0,"goal 1: end poverty in all its forms everywhere. more than 700 million people, or 10% of the world population, still live in extreme poverty and is struggling to fulfil the most basic needs like health, education, and access to water and sanitation, to name a few. the majority of people living on less than $1.90 a day live in sub saharan africa. worldwide, the poverty rate in rural areas is 17.2 per cent more than three times higher than in urban areas. having a job does not guarantee a decent living. in fact, 8 per cent of employed workers and their families worldwide lived in extreme poverty in 2018. poverty affects children disproportionately. one out of five children live in extreme poverty. ensuring social protection for all children and other vulnerable groups is critical to reduce poverty. poverty has many dimensions, but its causes include unemployment, social exclusion, and high vulnerability of certain populations to disasters, diseases and other phenomena which prevent them from being productive. growing inequality is detrimental to economic growth and undermines social cohesion, increasing political and social tensions and, in some circumstances, driving instability and conflicts. more than 700 million people, or 10% of the world population, still live in extreme poverty. surviving on less than us$1.90 a day. "
1,"having a job does not guarantee a decent living. in fact, 8 per cent of employed workers and their families worldwide lived in extreme poverty in 2018. globally, there are 122 women aged 25 to 34 living in extreme poverty for every 100 men of the same age group. the majority of people living on less than $1.90 a day live in sub saharan africa. high poverty rates are often found in small, fragile and conflict affected countries. poverty affects children disproportionately. one out of five children live in extreme poverty. as of 2018, 55% of the worlds population have no access to social protection. in 2018, only 41% of women giving birth received maternity cash benefits. by 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day. by 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions. implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable. by 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance. "
2,"by 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters. ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions. create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro poor and gender sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions. whats the goal here? to end poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030. why? more than 700 million people, or 10% of the world population, still live in extreme poverty and is struggling to fulfil the most basic needs like health, education, and access to water and sanitation, to name a few. the majority of people living on less than $1.90 a day live in sub saharan africa. worldwide, the poverty rate in rural areas is 17.2 per centmore than three times higher than in urban areas. having a job does not guarantee a decent living. "
3,"in fact, 8 per cent of employed workers and their families worldwide lived in extreme poverty in 2018. poverty affects children disproportionately. one out of five children live in extreme poverty. ensuring social protection for all children and other vulnerable groups is critical to reduce poverty. 55 per cent of the worlds population have no access to social protection. no poverty: why it matters. why is there so much poverty in the world? poverty has many dimensions, but its causes include unemployment, social exclusion, and high vulnerability of certain populations to disasters, diseases and other phenomena which prevent them from being productive. im not poor. why should i care about other peoples economic situation? there are many reasons, but in short, because as human beings, our wellbeing is linked to each other. growing inequality is detrimental to economic growth and undermines social cohesion, increasing political and social tensions and, in some circumstances, driving instability and conflicts. can we actually achieve this goal? yes. to end extreme poverty worldwide in 20 years, economist jeffrey sachs calculated that the total cost per year would be about $175 billion. this represents less than one percent of the combined income of the richest countries in the world. so what can i do about it? your active engagement in policymaking can make a difference in addressing poverty. "
4,"it ensures that your rights are promoted and that your voice is heard, that inter generational knowledge is shared, and that innovation and critical thinking are encouraged at all ages to support transformational change in peoples lives and communities. governments can help create an enabling environment to generate productive employment and job opportunities for the poor and the marginalized. they can formulate strategies and fiscal policies that stimulate pro poor growth, and reduce poverty. the private sector, as an engine of economic growth, has a major role to play in determining whether the growth it creates is inclusive and hence contributes to poverty reduction. it can promote economic opportunities for the poor, focusing on segments of the economy where most of the poor are active, namely on micro and small enterprises and those operating in the informal sector. the academic and education community have a major role in increasing the awareness about the impact of poverty. science provides the foundation for new and sustainable approaches, solutions and technologies to tackle the challenges of reducing poverty and achieving sustainable development. the contribution of science to end poverty has been significant. for example, it has enabled access to safe drinking water, reduced deaths caused by water borne diseases, and improved hygiene to reduce health risks related to unsafe drinking water and lack of sanitation. "
5,"the decline of global extreme poverty continues, but has slowed. the deceleration indicates that the world is not on track to achieve the target of less than 3 per cent of the world living in extreme poverty by 2030. people who continue to live in extreme poverty face deep, entrenched deprivation often exacerbated by violent conflicts and vulnerability to disasters. strong social protection systems and government spending on key services often help those left behind get back on their feet and escape poverty, but these services need to be brought to scale. the share of the world population living in extreme poverty declined to 10 per cent in 2015, down from 16 per cent in 2010 and 36 per cent in 1990. however, the pace of poverty reduction is decelerating, with a nowcast of 8.6 per cent in 2018. moreover, baseline projections suggest that 6 per cent of the world population will still be living in extreme poverty in 2030, missing the target of ending poverty. despite having a job, 8 per cent of the world workers and their families still lived in extreme poverty in 2018. the situation remains particularly alarming in sub saharan africa, where the share of working poor stood at 38 per cent in 2018. social protection systems help prevent and reduce poverty and provide a safety net for the vulnerable. however, social protection is not a reality for a large majority of the worlds population. "
6,"in 2016, 55 per cent  as many as 4 billion people  were not covered by any social protection cash benefits, with large variations across regions: from 87 per cent without coverage in sub saharan africa to 14 per cent in europe and northern america. only 22 per cent of unemployed persons receive unemployment cash benefits, only 28 per cent of persons with severe disabilities receive disability cash benefits, only 35 per cent of children worldwide enjoy effective access to social protection and only 41 per cent of women giving birth receive maternity cash benefits. disasters often lead to a downturn in the trajectory of socioeconomic development and exacerbate poverty. from 1998 to 2017, direct economic losses from disasters were estimated at almost $3 trillion, of which climate   related disasters accounted for 77 per cent of the total  a rise of 151 per cent compared with the period from 1978 to 1997  and climate related and geophysical disasters claimed an estimated 1.3 million lives. more than 90 per cent of deaths reported internationally were due to disaster events in low  and middle income countries, and economic losses from disasters as a percentage of gross domestic product (gdp) were also much higher in these countries. countries have reported progress in the development and implementation of national and local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 20152030. as at 31 march 2019, 67 countries had reported progress in such alignment and 24 countries reported that their respective local governments had developed local strategies consistent with national strategies and plans. "
7,"only one third of all countries spend between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of total government expenditure on education, as recommended in the education 2030 framework for action. while extreme poverty has eased considerably since 1990, pockets of the worst forms of poverty persist. ending poverty requires universal social protection systems aimed at safeguarding all individuals throughout the life cycle. it also requires targeted measures to reduce vulnerability to disasters and to address specific underserved geographic areas within each country. the rate of extreme poverty has fallen rapidly: in 2013 it was a third of the 1990 value. the latest global estimate suggests that 11 per cent of the world population, or 783 million people, lived below the extreme poverty threshold in 2013. the proportion of the worlds workers living with their families on less than $1.90 per person a day declined significantly over the past two decades, falling from 26.9 per cent in 2000 to 9.2 per cent in 2017. based on 2016 estimates, only 45 per cent of the worlds population were effectively covered by at least one social protection cash benefit. in 2017, economic losses attributed to disasters were estimated at over $300 billion. this is among the highest losses in recent years, owing to three major hurricanes affecting the united states of america and several countries across the caribbean. despite the fact that the global poverty rate has been halved since 2000, intensified efforts are required to boost the incomes, alleviate the suffering and build the resilience of those individuals still living in extreme poverty, in particular in sub saharan africa. "
8,"social protection systems need to be expanded and risks need to be mitigated for disaster prone countries, which also tend to be the most impoverished. in 2013, an estimated 767 million people lived below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day  down from 1.7 billion people in 1999. that figure reflects a decrease in the global poverty rate from 28 per cent in 1999 to 11 per cent in 2013. the most significant progress was seen in eastern and southeastern asia, where the rate declined from 35 per cent in 1999 to 3 per cent in 2013. in contrast, 42 per cent of people in sub saharan africa continued to subsist in conditions of extreme poverty in 2013. in 2016, just under 10 per cent of the worlds workers were living with their families on less than $1.90 per person per day, down from 28 per cent in 2000. in the least developed countries, nearly 38 per cent of workers in 2016 were living below the poverty line. social protection systems are fundamental to preventing and reducing poverty and inequality at every stage of peoples lives, through benefits for children, mothers with newborns, persons with disabilities, older persons and thoses persons who are poor and without jobs. preliminary data show that in 2016, only 45 per cent of the worlds population was effectively protected by a social protection system and that coverage varied widely across countries and regions. "
9,"in 2016, 68 per cent of people above retirement age received a pension. however, that global average masks large regional differences. in oceania, excluding australia and new zealand, and in sub saharan africa, only 10 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, of people above retirement age received a pension in 2016. other vulnerable groups lack social protections as well. in 2016, only 28 per cent of people with severe disabilities collected disability benefits, only 22 per cent of unemployed individuals worldwide received unemployment benefits and only 41 per cent of women giving birth received maternity benefits. building the resilience of the poor and strengthening disaster risk reduction is a core development strategy for ending extreme poverty in the most afflicted countries. economic losses from disasters are now reaching an average of $250 billion to $300 billion a year. disaster risk globally is highly concentrated in low  and lower middle income countries. in relation to the size of their economies, small island developing states have borne a disproportionate impact. goal 1 calls for an end to poverty in all its manifestations by 2030. it also aims to ensure social protection for the poor and vulnerable, increase access to basic services and support people harmed by climate related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters. the international poverty line is currently defined at $1.90 or below per person per day using 2011 united states dollars purchasing power parity (ppp). "
10,
11,"in the decade beginning in 2002, the proportion of the worlds population living below the poverty line dropped by half, from 26 per cent to 13 per cent. if growth rates during those 10 years prevail for the next 15 years, the global extreme poverty rate will likely fall to 4 per cent by 2030, assuming that growth benefits all income groups of the population equally. however, if the growth rates over the longer period of 20 years prevail, the global poverty rate will likely be around 6 per cent. in other words, eliminating extreme poverty will require a significant change from historical growth rates. in 2015, 10.2 per cent of the worlds workers were living with their families on less than $1.90 per person per day, down from 28 per cent in 2000. young people are especially likely to be among the working poor: 16 per cent of all employed youth aged 15 to 24 were considered working poor, compared to 9 per cent of adults. expanding social protection programmes and targeting appropriate schemes to the poor and most vulnerable can further reduce poverty. social protection programmes include social assistance, such as cash transfers, school feeding and targeted food assistance, as well as social insurance and labour market programmes, including old age pensions, disability pensions, unemployment insurance, skills training and wage subsidies, among others. "
12,"social protections have expanded globally since 2000, as many developing countries adopted policies that afford protection for multiple contingencies.  pension coverage in particular is expanding rapidly. over half (51 per cent) of people above retirement age received a pension according to data available for the period from 2010 to 2012. almost all countries have child or maternity benefit programmes, and cash transfer schemes are increasing. despite progress over the past decade, increasing social protection for those most in need remains a priority. globally, 18,000 children still die each day from poverty related causes, and only 28 per cent of employed women are effectively protected through contributory and non contributory maternity cash benefits. most poor people remain outside social protection systems, especially in low income countries. of the entire population, only 1 out of 5 receive any type of social protection in low income countries, compared with 2 out of 3 in upper middle income countries. the coverage gap is particularly acute in sub saharan africa and southern asia, where most of the worlds poorest people live. in sub saharan africa, only 15 per cent of those in the bottom income quintile have access to a social protection benefit. disaster risk reduction is essential to ending poverty and fostering sustainable development. "
13,"disaster risk is disproportionally higher in poorer countries with weaker institutions. in low  and lower middle income countries experiencing rapid economic growth, the exposure of people and assets to natural hazards is increasing at a faster pace than that at which risk reducing capacities are being strengthened, leading to increased disaster risk. economic losses from internationally reported disasters, principally large scale disasters, have grown steadily since 1990, reaching an estimated annual average of $200 billion in 2013. reported damage to housing, schools and health care facilities, along with agricultural production, shows statistically significant upward trends from 1990 onwards. by 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day. proportion of population below the international poverty line, by sex, age, employment status and geographical location (urban/rural). by 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions. proportion of population living below the national poverty line, by sex and age. proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions. implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable. "
14,"proportion of population covered by social protection floors/systems, by sex, distinguishing children, unemployed persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, newborns, work injury victims and the poor and the vulnerable. by 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance. proportion of population living in households with access to basic services. proportion of total adult population with secure tenure rights to land, with legally recognized documentation and who perceive their rights to land as secure, by sex and by type of tenure. by 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters. number of deaths, missing persons and persons affected by disaster per 100,000 people. direct disaster economic loss in relation to global gross domestic product (gdp)a. number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions. "
15,"proportion of resources allocated by the government directly to poverty reduction programmes. proportion of total government spending on essential services (education, health and social protection). create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro poor and gender sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions. proportion of government recurrent and capital spending to sectors that disproportionately benefit women, the poor and vulnerable groups. end poverty in all its forms everywhere. extreme poverty has been cut by more than half since 1990. still, around 1 in 10 people live on less than the target figure of international $1.25 per day. a very low poverty threshold is justified by highlighting the need of those people who are worst off. sdg 1 is to end extreme poverty globally by 2030. that target may not be adequate for human subsistence and basic needs, however. it is for this reason that changes relative to higher poverty lines are also commonly tracked. poverty is more than the lack of income or resources: people live in poverty if they lack basic services such as healthcare, security, and education. they also experience hunger, social discrimination, and exclusion from decision making processes. one possible alternative metric is the multidimensional poverty index. "
16,"children make up the majority, more than half, of those living in extreme poverty. in 2013, an estimated 385 million children lived on less than us$1.90 per day. still, these figures are unreliable due to huge gaps in data on the status of children worldwide. on average, 97 percent of countries have insufficient data to determine the state of impoverished children and make projections towards sdg goal 1, and 63 percent of countries have no data on child poverty at all. women face potentially life threatening risks from early pregnancy and frequent pregnancies. this can result in lost hope for an education and for a better income.[citation needed] poverty affects age groups differently, with the most devastating effects experienced by children. it affects their education, health, nutrition, and security, impacting emotional and spiritual development. achieving goal 1 is hampered by lack of economic growth in the poorest countries of the world, growing inequality, increasingly fragile statehood, and the impacts of climate change. eradicating poverty is not a task of charity, it is an act of justiceand the key to unlocking an enormous human potential. still, nearly half of the worlds population lives in poverty, and lack of food and clean water is killing thousands every single day of the year. together, we can feed the hungry, wipe out disease and give everyone in the world a chance to prosper and live a productive and rich life."
17,"goal 2: zero hunger. it is time to rethink how we grow, share and consume our food. if done right, agriculture, forestry and fisheries can provide nutritious food for all and generate decent incomes, while supporting people centered rural development and protecting the environment. right now, our soils, freshwater, oceans, forests and biodiversity are being rapidly degraded. climate change is putting even more pressure on the resources we depend on, increasing risks associated with disasters, such as droughts and floods. many rural women and men can no longer make ends meet on their land, forcing them to migrate to cities in search of opportunities. poor food security is also causing millions of children to be stunted, or too short for the ages, due to severe malnutrition. a profound change of the global food and agriculture system is needed if we are to nourish the 821 million people who are hungry today and the additional 2 billion people expected to be undernourished by 2050. investments in agriculture are crucial to increasing the capacity for agricultural productivity and sustainable food production systems are necessary to help alleviate the perils of hunger. hunger. an estimated 821 million people were undernourished in 2017. the majority of the worlds hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 per cent of the population is undernourished. "
18,"sub saharan africa remains the region with the highest prevalence of hunger, with the rate increasing from 20.7 per cent in 2014 to 23.2 per cent in 2017. in sub saharan africa, the number of undernourished people increased from 195 million in 2014 to 237 million in 2017. poor nutrition causes nearly half (45 per cent) of deaths in children under five  3.1 million children each year. 149 million children under 5 years of age22 per cent of the global under 5 populationwere still chronically undernourished in 2018. food security. agriculture is the single largest employer in the world, providing livelihoods for 40 per cent of todays global population. it is the largest source of income and jobs for poor rural households. 500 million small farms worldwide, most still rainfed, provide up to 80 per cent of food consumed in a large part of the developing world. investing in smallholder women and men is an important way to increase food security and nutrition for the poorest, as well as food production for local and global markets. since the 1900s, some 75 per cent of crop diversity has been lost from farmers fields. better use of agricultural biodiversity can contribute to more nutritious diets, enhanced livelihoods for farming communities and more resilient and sustainable farming systems. if women farmers had the same access to resources as men, the number of hungry in the world could be reduced by up to 150 million. 840 million people have no access to electricity worldwide  most of whom live in rural areas of the developing world. "
19,"energy poverty in many regions is a fundamental barrier to reducing hunger and ensuring that the world can produce enough food to meet future demand. by 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round. by 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons. by 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non farm employment. by 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality. by 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed. "
20,"increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed countries. correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of the doha development round. adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility. a profound change of the global food and agriculture system is needed to nourish todays 800 million hungry + the additional 2 billion increase in global population expected by 2050. zero hunger: why it matters. whats the goal here? to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. why? extreme hunger and malnutrition remains a barrier to sustainable development and creates a trap from which people cannot easily escape. hunger and malnutrition mean less productive individuals, who are more prone to disease and thus often unable to earn more and improve their livelihoods. there are more than 800 million people who suffer from hunger worldwide, the vast majority in developing countries. "
21,"how many people go hungry? the number of people going hungry has increased since 2014. an estimated 821 million people were undernourished in 2017. the prevalence of undernourishment has remained virtually unchanged in the past three years at a level slightly below 11 per cent. this reversal in progress sends a clear warning that more must be done and urgently if the sustainable development goal of zero hunger is to be achieved by 2030. why are there so many hungry people? climate induced shocks, civil insecurity and declining food production have all contributed to food scarcity and high food prices. investment in the agriculture sector is critical for reducing hunger and poverty, improving food security, creating employment and building resilience to disasters and shocks. why should i care? we all want our families to have enough food to eat what is safe and nutritious. a world with zero hunger can positively impact our economies, health, education, equality and social development. its a key piece of building a better future for everyone. additionally, with hunger limiting human development, we will not be able to achieve the other sustainable development goals such as education, health and gender equality. how much will it cost to achieve zero hunger? we will need an estimated additional $267 billion per year on average to end world hunger by 2030. "
22,"there will need to be investments in rural and urban areas and in social protection, so poor people have access to food and can improve their livelihoods. what can we do to help? you can make changes in your own lifeat home, at work and in the communityby supporting local farmers or markets and making sustainable food choices, supporting good nutrition for all, and fighting food waste. you can also use your power as a consumer and voter, demanding businesses and governments make the choices and changes that will make zero hunger a reality. join the conversation, whether on social media platforms or in your local communities. hunger is on the rise again globally and undernutrition continues to affect millions of children. public investment in agriculture globally is declining, smallscale food producers and family farmers require much greater support and increased investment in infrastructure and technology for sustainable agriculture is urgently needed. an estimated 821 million people, approximately 1 in 9 people in the world, were undernourished in 2017, up from 784 million in 2015. this represents a worrying rise in world hunger for a third consecutive year after a prolonged decline. africa remains the continent with the highest prevalence of undernourishment, affecting one fifth of its population (more than 256 million people). consistent with the continued growth in undernourishment, 770 million people faced severe food insecurity in 2017. stunting has been decreasing in nearly every region since 2000."
23," still, more than 1 in 5 children under 5 years of age (149 million) were stunted in 2018. globally, 49 million children under 5 were affected by wasting and another 40 million were overweight in 2018. strengthening the resilience and adaptive capacity of small scale and family farmers, whose productivity is systematically lower than all other food producers, is critical to reversing the trend of the rise in hunger. the share of small scale food producers in terms of all food producers in countries in africa, asia and latin america ranges from 40 to 85 per cent, compared with fewer than 10 per cent in europe. government spending on agriculture compared to agricultures contribution to the total economy has declined by 37 per cent; the ratio fell from 0.42 in 2001 to 0.26 worldwide in 2017. in addition, aid to agriculture in developing countries fell from nearly 25 per cent of all donors sector allocable aid in the mid 1980s to only 5 per cent in 2017, representing a decrease of $12.6 billion. a continuous downward trend has been observed in export subsidy outlays reported to the world trade organization (wto). the total outlays fell from close to $500 million in 2010 to around $120 million in 2016. this reduction in export subsidies by governments is leading to lower distortions in agricultural markets. after a prolonged decline, world hunger appears to be on the rise again. conflict, drought and disasters linked to climate change are among the key factors causing this reversal in progress. "
24,"the proportion of undernourished people worldwide increased from 10.6 per cent in 2015 to 11.0 per cent in 2016. this translates to 815 million people worldwide in 2016, up from 777 million in 2015. in 2017, 151 million children under age 5 suffered from stunting (low height for their age), 51 million suffered from wasting (low weight for height), and 38 million were overweight. aid to agriculture in developing countries totalled $12.5 billion in 2016, falling to 6 per cent of all donors sector allocable aid from nearly 20 per cent in the mid 1980s. progress has been made in reducing market distorting agricultural subsidies, which were more than halved in five yearsfrom $491 million in 2010 to less than $200 million in 2015. in 2016, 26 countries experienced high or moderately high levels of general food prices, which may have negatively affected food security. efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition have advanced significantly since 2000. ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition for all, however, will require continued and focused efforts, especially in asia and africa. more investments in agriculture, including government spending and aid, are needed to increase capacity for agricultural productivity. the proportion of undernourished people worldwide declined from 15 per cent in 2000 2002 to 11 per cent in 2014 2016. about 793 million people are undernourished globally, down from 930 million people during the same period. "
25,"in 2016, an estimated 155 million children under 5 years of age were stunted (too short for their age, a result of chronic malnutrition). globally, the stunting rate fell from 33 per cent in 2000 to 23 per cent in 2016. southern asia and sub saharan africa accounted for three quarters of all stunted children that year. in 2016, an estimated 52 million children under 5 years of age worldwide suffered from wasting (with a low weight for their height, usually the result of an acute and significant food shortage and/or disease). the global wasting rate in 2016 was 7.7 per cent, with the highest rate (15.4 per cent) in southern asia. at the other end of the spectrum, overweight and obesity affected 41 million children under 5 years of age worldwide (6 per cent) in 2016. ending hunger demands sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices. one aspect of that effort is maintaining the genetic diversity of plants and animals, which is crucial for agriculture and food production. in 2016, 4.7 million samples of seeds and other plant genetic material for food and agriculture were preserved in 602 gene banks throughout 82 countries and 14 regional and international centres, a 2 per cent increase since 2014. animal genetic material has been cryoconserved, but only for 15 per cent of national breed populations, according to information obtained from 128 countries. the stored genetic material is sufficient to reconstitute only 7 per cent of national breed populations should they become extinct. "
26,"as of february 2017, 20 per cent of local breeds were classified as at risk. increased investments are needed to enhance capacity for agricultural productivity. however, the global agriculture orientation index  defined as agricultures share of government expenditure divided by the sectors share of gross domestic product (gdp), fell from 0.38 in 2001 to 0.24 in 2013 and to 0.21 in 2015. the share of sector allocable aid allocated to agriculture from member countries of the development assistance committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) fell from nearly 20 per cent in the mid 1980s to 7 per cent in the late 1990s, where it remained through 2015. the decline reflects a shift away from aid for financing infrastructure and production towards a greater focus on social sectors. in 2016, 21 countries experienced high or moderately high domestic prices, relative to their historic levels, for one or more staple cereal food commodities. thirteen of those countries were in sub saharan africa. the main causes of high prices were declines in domestic output, currency depreciation and insecurity. localized increases in fuel prices also drove food prices higher. some progress has been made in preventing distortions in world agricultural markets. the global agricultural export subsidies were reduced by 94 per cent from 2000 to 2014. in december 2015, members of the world trade organization adopted a ministerial decision on eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products and restraining export measures that have a similar effect.

27,"goal 2 aims to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030. it also commits to universal access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food at all times of the year. this will require sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices, equal access to land, technology and markets and international cooperation on investments in infrastructure and technology to boost agricultural productivity. the fight against hunger has progressed over the past 15 years. globally, the prevalence of hunger has declined, from 15 per cent according to figures for 2000 to 2002, to 11 per cent according to figures for 2014 to 2016. however, more than 790 million people worldwide still lack regular access to adequate amounts of dietary energy. if current trends continue, the zero hunger target will be largely missed by 2030. many countries that failed to reach the target set as part of the millennium development goals, of halving the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, have faced natural and human induced disasters or political instability, resulting in protracted crises, with increased vulnerability and food insecurity affecting large parts of the population. the persistence of hunger is no longer simply a matter of food availability. more and better data on access to food can enable the tracking of progress and guide interventions to fight food insecurity and malnutrition. "
28,"globally, in 2014, nearly 1 in 4 children under the age of 5, an estimated total of 159 million children, had stunted growth. stunting is defined as inadequate height for age, an indicator of the cumulative effects of undernutrition and infection. southern asia and sub saharan africa accounted for three quarters of the children under 5 with stunted growth in 2014. another aspect of child malnutrition is the growing share of children who are overweight, a problem affecting nearly every region. globally, between 2000 and 2014, the percentage of children under the age of 5 who were overweight grew from 5.1 per cent to 6.1 per cent. ending hunger and malnutrition relies heavily on sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices. genetic diversity in livestock breeds is crucial for agriculture and food production since it allows for the raising of farm animals in a wide range of environments and provides the basis for diverse products and services. globally, 20 per cent of local livestock breeds, meaning breeds reported in only one country, are at risk of extinction. another 16 per cent of breeds are stable, and the status of the remaining local breeds is unknown owing to a lack of data. the figures exclude livestock breeds that have already become extinct. to increase the productive capacity of agriculture, more investment is needed, both public and private, from domestic and foreign sources. "
29,"however, recent trends in government spending are not favourable. the agriculture orientation index, defined as agricultures share of government expenditures divided by the sectors share of gross domestic product (gdp), fell globally from 0.37 to 0.25 between 2001 and 2013. the decline in the index was interrupted only temporarily during the food price crisis of 2006 to 2008, when governments increased agricultural spending. since the late 1990s, the percentage of aid for supporting agriculture in developing countries has been stable at around 8 per cent, when measured as a share of sector allocable aid from member countries of the development assistance committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd). this has decreased, from a peak of 20 per cent in the mid 1980s, as a result of donors beginning to focus more on improving governance, building social capital and bolstering fragile states. one of the targets for goal 2 calls for correcting and preventing distortions in world agricultural markets, including the elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies. those subsidies mask market signals, reduce competitiveness and can lead to environmental damage and the inequitable distribution of benefits. that said, some progress is being made, with members of the world trade organization adopting a ministerial decision, in december 2015, on eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products and restraining export measures that have an equivalent effect. by 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round. "
30,"prevalence of undernourishment. prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the population, based on the food insecurity experience scale (fies). by 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons. prevalence of stunting (height for age < 2 standard deviation from the median of the world health organization (who) child growth standards) among children under 5 years of age. prevalence of malnutrition (weight for height >+2 or < 2 standard deviation from the median of the who child growth standards) among children under 5 years of age, by type (wasting and overweight). by 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non farm employment. volume of production per labour unit by classes of farming/pastoral/forestry enterprise size. average income of small scale food producers, by sex and indigenous status. by 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality. "
31,"proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture. by 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed. number of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture secured in either medium or long term conservation facilities. proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk, not at risk or at unknown level of risk of extinction. increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed countries. the agriculture orientation index for government expenditures. total official flows (official development assistance plus other official flows) to the agriculture sector. correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of the doha development round. producer support estimate. agricultural export subsidies. "
32,"adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility. indicator of food price anomalies. end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. goal 2 states that by 2030 we should end hunger and all forms of malnutrition. this would be accomplished by doubling agricultural productivity and incomes of small scale food producers (especially women and indigenous peoples), by ensuring sustainable food production systems, and by progressively improving land and soil quality. agriculture is the single largest employer in the world, providing livelihoods for 40% of the global population. it is the largest source of income for poor rural households. women make up about 43% of the agricultural labor force in developing countries, and over 50% in parts of asia and africa. however, women own only 20% of the land. other targets deal with maintaining genetic diversity of seeds, increasing access to land, preventing trade restriction and distortions in world agricultural markets to limit extreme food price volatility, eliminating waste with help from the international food waste coalition, and ending malnutrition and undernutrition of children. globally, 1 in 9 people are undernourished, the vast majority of whom live in developing countries. undernutrition causes wasting or severe wasting of 52 million children worldwide, and contributes to nearly half (45%) of deaths in children under five  3.1 million children per year. "
33,"chronic malnutrition, which affects an estimated 155 million children worldwide, also stunts children s brain and physical development and puts them at further risk of death, disease, and lack of success as adults. as of 2017, only 26 of 202 un member countries are on track to meet the sdg target to eliminate undernourishment and malnourishment, while 20 percent have made no progress at all and nearly 70 percent have no or insufficient data to determine their progress. a report by the international food policy research institute (ifpri) of 2013 stated that the emphasis of the sdgs should not be on ending poverty by 2030, but on eliminating hunger and under nutrition by 2025. the assertion is based on an analysis of experiences in china, vietnam, brazil, and thailand. three pathways to achieve this were identified: 1) agriculture led; 2) social protection  and nutrition  intervention led; or 3) a combination of both of these approaches. a study published in nature concluded that it is unlikely there will be an end to malnutrition by 2030. hunger is the leading cause of death in the world. our planet has provided us with tremendous resources, but unequal access and inefficient handling leaves millions of people malnourished. if we promote sustainable agriculture with modern technologies and fair distribution systems, we can sustain the whole worlds population and make sure that nobody will ever suffer from hunger again."
34,"goal 3: ensure healthy lives and promote well being for all at all ages. ensuring healthy lives and promoting the well being at all ages is essential to sustainable development. significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with child and maternal mortality, but working towards achieving the target of less than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030 would require improvements in skilled delivery care. achieving the target of reducing premature deaths due to incommunicable diseases by 1/3 by the year 2030 would also require more efficient technologies for clean fuel use during cooking and education on the risks of tobacco. many more efforts are needed to fully eradicate a wide range of diseases and address many different persistent and emerging health issues. by focusing on providing more efficient funding of health systems, improved sanitation and hygiene, increased access to physicians and more tips on ways to reduce ambient pollution, significant progress can be made in helping to save the lives of millions. child health. 17,000 fewer children die each day than in 1990, but more than five million children still die before their fifth birthday each year.  since 2000, measles vaccines have averted nearly 15.6 million deaths. despite determined global progress, an increasing proportion of child deaths are in sub saharan africa and southern asia. four out of every five deaths of children under age five occur in these regions. children born into poverty are almost twice as likely to die before the age of five as those from wealthier families. "
35,"children of educated mothers, even mothers with only primary schooling, are more likely to survive than children of mothers with no education. maternal health. maternal mortality has fallen by 37% since 2000. in eastern asia, northern africa and southern asia, maternal mortality has declined by around two thirds. but maternal mortality ratio, the proportion of mothers that do not survive childbirth compared to those who do in developing regions is still 14 times higher than in the developed regions. more women are receiving antenatal care. in developing regions, antenatal care increased from 65 per cent in 1990 to 83 per cent in 2012. only half of women in developing regions receive the recommended amount of health care they need. fewer teens are having children in most developing regions, but progress has slowed. the large increase in contraceptive use in the 1990s was not matched in the 2000s. the need for family planning is slowly being met for more women, but demand is increasing at a rapid pace. hiv/aids, malaria and other diseases. 36.9 million people globally were living with hiv in 2017. 21.7 million million people were accessing antiretroviral therapy in 2017. 1.8 million people became newly infected with hiv in 2017. 940 000 people died from aids related illnesses in 2017. 77.3 million people have become infected with hiv since the start of the epidemic. 35.4 million people have died from aids related illnesses since the start of the epidemic. "
36,"tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death among people living with hiv, accounting for around one in three aids related deaths. globally, adolescent girls and young women face gender based inequalities, exclusion, discrimination and violence, which put them at increased risk of acquiring hiv. hiv is the leading cause of death for women of reproductive age worldwide. aids is now the leading cause of death among adolescents (aged 1019) in africa and the second most common cause of death among adolescents globally. over 6.2 million malaria deaths have been averted between 2000 and 2015, primarily of children under five years of age in sub saharan africa.  the global malaria incidence rate has fallen by an estimated 37 per cent and the mortality rates by 58 per cent. by 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births. by 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under 5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. by 2030, end the epidemics of aids, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water borne diseases and other communicable diseases. by 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well being. strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol. "
37,
38,"by 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents. by 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes.  achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. by 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination. strengthen the implementation of the world health organization framework convention on tobacco control in all countries, as appropriate. support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for the communicable and noncommunicable diseases that primarily affect developing countries, provide access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines, in accordance with the doha declaration on the trips agreement and public health, which affirms the right of developing countries to use to the full the provisions in the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights regarding flexibilities to protect public health, and, in particular, provide access to medicines for all. substantially increase health financing and the recruitment, development, training and retention of the health workforce in developing countries, especially in least developed countries and small island developing states. strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks. spending $1 billion in immunization coverage can save 1 million childrens lives each year. good health and well being: why it matters.  "
39,"whats the goal here? to ensure healthy lives and promote well being for all at all ages. why? ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all at all ages is important to building prosperous societies. major progress has been made in improving the health of millions of people. maternal and child mortality rates have been reduced, life expectancy continues to increase globally, and the fight against some infectious diseases has made steady progress. however, in the case of other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, progress has slowed or stalled. at least half the worlds population are still without access to essential health services. in rich and poor countries alike, a health emergency can push people into bankruptcy or poverty. concerted efforts are required to achieve universal health coverage and sustainable financing for health; address the growing burden of non communicable diseases, tackle antimicrobial resistance and environmental factors contributing to ill health. what progress have we made so far? major progress has been made in several areas, including in child and maternal health as well as in addressing hiv/aids. despite this progress, maternal mortality continues to affect women in low  and middle income countries disproportionately. the total number of deaths of children under 5 years of age dropped from 9.8 million in 2000 to 5.4 million in 2017. half of those deaths occurred in sub saharan africa, and another 30 per cent in southern asia. yet stark disparities persist across regions and countries. how much will it cost to achieve these targets? ensuring healthy lives for all requires a strong commitment, but the benefits outweigh the cost. "
40,"healthy people are the foundation for healthy economies. for example, if we spent $1 billion in expanding immunization coverage against influenza, pneumonia and other preventable diseases, we could save 1 million childrens lives each year. in the past decade, improvements in health and heath care led to a 24 per cent increase in income growth in some of the poorest countries. the cost of inaction is greatermillions of children will continue to die from preventable diseases, women will die in pregnancy and childbirth, and health care costs will continue to plunge millions of people into poverty. noncommunicable diseases alone will cost low  and middle income countries more than $7 trillion in the next 15 years. what can i do to help? you can start by promoting and protecting your own health and the health of those around you, by making well informed choices, practicing safe sex and vaccinating your children. you can raise awareness in your community about the importance of good health, healthy lifestyles as well as peoples right to quality health care services, especially for the most vulnerable such as women and children. you can also hold your government, local leaders and other decisionmakers accountable to their commitments to improve peoples access to health and health care. major progress has been made in improving the health of millions of people, increasing life expectancy, reducing maternal and child mortality and fighting against leading communicable diseases. however, progress has stalled or is not happening fast enough with regard to addressing major diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis, while at least half the global population does not have access to essential health services and many of those who do suffer undue financial hardship, potentially pushing them into extreme poverty. "
41,
42,"concerted efforts are required to achieve universal health coverage and sustainable financing for health, to address the growing burden of non communicable diseases, including mental health, and to tackle antimicrobial resistance and determinants of health such as air pollution and inadequate water and sanitation. reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health. an estimated 303,000 women around the world died due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth in 2015. almost all of these deaths occurred in low  and middle income countries, and almost two thirds of those were in sub saharan africa. these deaths are preventable with appropriate management and care. globally in 2018, 81 per cent of births took place with the assistance of a skilled birth attendant, a significant improvement from 69 per cent in 2012. coverage of skilled birth attendants in 2018 was only 59 per cent in sub saharan africa. the under 5 mortality rate fell to 39 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2017, a 6.7 per cent reduction from 42 deaths in 2015, and an overall reduction of 49 per cent from 77 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000. the total number of under 5 deaths dropped to 5.4 million in 2017 from 9.8 million in 2000. still, most of these deaths were from preventable causes and almost half, or 2.5 million, occurred in the first month of life  the most crucial period for child survival. the global neonatal mortality rate has continued to decline after a long downward trend from 31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 18 in 2017, a 41 per cent reduction.  immunization saves millions of lives and is widely recognized as one of the worlds most successful and cost effective health interventions. "
43,
44,"coverage of the required three doses of the vaccine that prevents diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis increased from 72 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2015 and has remained unchanged between 2015 and 2017. an estimated 19.9 million children did not receive the vaccines during the first year of life, putting them at serious risk of these potentially fatal diseases.  2000 to 76 per cent in 2019. adolescent fertility declined from 56 births per 1,000 adolescent women in 2000 to 45 births in 2015 and 44 births in 2019. the level of adolescent fertility has remained high in sub saharan africa, at 101 births per 1,000 adolescent women. infectious diseases. strong and steady domestic and international commitment and funding has fuelled an acceleration of evidence informed hiv prevention, testing and treatment programmes. as a result, the incidence of hiv in sub saharan africa (among adults aged 15 to 49) has declined by 37 per cent, from 3.39 infections per 1,000 uninfected people in 2010 to 2.49 in 2015 and 2.14 in 2017. however, the rate of global hiv incidence among adults aged 15 to 49 declined from 0.44 to 0.40 between 2015 and 2017 and overall by 22 per cent between 2010 and 2017, well short of the declines required to meet 2020 and 2030 targets. tuberculosis remains a leading cause of ill health and death. in 2017, an estimated 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis. the burden is falling globally: incidence of tuberculosis has continued to decline from 170 new and relapse cases per 100,000 people in 2000 to 140 in 2015, and 134 in 2017; and the tuberculosis mortality rate among hiv negative people fell by 42 per cent between 2000 and 2017. "
45,"however, large gaps in detection and treatment persist and the current pace of progress is not fast enough to meet the sustainable development goal target, with drug resistant tuberculosis remaining a continuing threat. after more than a decade of steady advances in fighting malaria, progress has stalled. no significant gains were made in reducing the number of malaria cases worldwide in the period 20152017. sub saharan africa continues to carry the heaviest burden of disease, accounting for more than 90 per cent of the global malaria burden. worryingly, there were an estimated 3.5 million more malaria cases in the 10 highest burden african countries in 2017 compared with the previous year. in 2015, an estimated 325 million people worldwide were living with hepatitis b virus or hepatitis c virus infection. the widespread use of hepatitis b vaccine in infants has considerably reduced the incidence of new chronic hbv infections, as reflected by the decline in hepatitis b prevalence among children under 5 years of age, from 4.7 per cent in the pre vaccine era to 0.8 per cent in 2017. in 2017, 1.58 billion people were reported as requiring the global coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which has the potential to significantly reduce deaths in children under age of 5, has yet to reach 50 per cent. two doses of the measles vaccine are required to prevent the disease and the illnesses, disabilities and deaths caused by complications associated with it.  coverage with the second dose of measles vaccine increased from 59 per cent in 2015 to 67 per cent in 2017, but that is still insufficient to prevent this highly contagious disease. "
46,"expanding access to modern contraceptive methods is essential to ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services. globally, the proportion of women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years old) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern contraceptive methods has continued to increase slowly, from 74 per cent in mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases, down from 1.63 billion in 2015 and 2.03 billion in 2010. improved surveillance meant that further populations requiring interventions against such diseases were identified in 2017. the 522 million people requiring treatment and care in least developed countries represented 52 per cent of those countries populations, down from 584 million in 2015. non communicable diseases, mental health and environmental risks. the probability of dying from any of the four main non communicable diseases  cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes  between the ages of 30 and 70 was 18 per cent in 2016. the risk remains markedly higher for men globally, at 21.6 per cent, compared with 15 per cent for women. progress has been made in reducing the global suicide rate (from 12.9 per 100,000 in 2000 to 10.6 per 100,000 in 2016). however, suicide remains the second highest cause of death among people aged 15 to 29 globally, with 79 per cent of suicides found in low  and middle income countries in 2016. the prevalence of tobacco use declined from 27 per cent in 2000 to 20 per cent in 2016.  prevalence fell faster for women, from 11 per cent in 2000 to 6 per cent in 2016, compared with men: prevalence in men only fell from 43 per cent to 34 per cent. despite the positive trends, the number of people dying from a tobacco related illness was estimated to be more than 8.1 million in 2017. "
47,"the number of road traffic deaths climbed from 1.31 million in 2013 to 1.35 million in 2016. road traffic injury is the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5 to 29.  air pollution, both ambient and household, increases the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disease and, in 2016, led to some 7 million deaths worldwide. sub saharan africa and most of asia and oceania (excluding australia/new zealand) have the highest mortality rates associated with air pollution, as a large proportion of the population still rely on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking. inadequate and unsafe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene is linked to 60 per cent of the disease burden from diarrhoea, 100 per cent of the burden from infections with soil transmitted helminths and 16 per cent of the burden from protein energy malnutrition, leading to a total of 870,000 deaths in 2016 from the three conditions. health systems and funding. official development assistance (oda) for basic health from all donors increased by 61 per cent in real terms since 2010 and reached $10.7 billion in 2017. in 2017, some $2.0 billion was spent on malaria control, $1.0 billion on tuberculosis control and $2.3 billion on other infectious diseases, excluding hiv/aids. available data from 2013 to 2018 indicate that close to 40 per cent of all countries had fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10,000 people, and more than 55 per cent had fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000 people.  all least developed countries had fewer than 10 medical doctors and fewer than 5 dentists and 5 pharmacists per 10,000 people, and 98 per cent had fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000 people. "
48,"many more people today are living healthier lives than in the past decade. nevertheless, people are still suffering needlessly from preventable diseases, and too many are dying prematurely. overcoming disease and ill health will require concerted and sustained efforts, focusing on population groups and regions that have been neglected. reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health. the maternal mortality ratio has declined by 37 per cent since 2000. nevertheless, in 2015, 303,000 women around the world died due to complications during pregnancy or childbirth.  over the period 20122017, almost 80 per cent of live births worldwide occurred with the assistance of skilled health personnel, up from 62 per cent in 20002005. globally, from 2000 to 2016, the under 5 mortality rate dropped by 47 per cent, and the neonatal mortality rate fell by 39 per cent. over the same period, the total number of under 5 deaths dropped from 9.9 million to 5.6 million. even in the region facing the greatest health challenges, progress has been impressive. since 2000, the maternal mortality ratio in sub saharan africa has been reduced by 35 per cent, and the under 5 mortality rate has dropped by 50 per cent. in 2018, the global adolescent birth rate is 44 births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19, compared to 56 in 2000. the highest rate (101) is found in sub saharan africa. infectious diseases and non communicable diseases. globally, the incidence of hiv declined from 0.40 to 0.26 per 1,000 uninfected people between 2005 and 2016. for women of reproductive age in sub saharan africa, however, the rate is much higher, at 2.58 per 1,000 uninfected people. in 2016, 216 million cases of malaria were reported versus 210 million cases in 2013. "
49,
50,"there were 140 new cases of tuberculosis per 100,000 people in 2016 compared to 173 cases per 100,000 in 2000. hepatitis b prevalence declined among children under 5 from 4.7 per cent in the pre vaccine era to 1.3 per cent in 2015. in 2016, 1.5 billion people were reported to require mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases, down from 1.6 billion in 2015 and 2 billion in 2010. unsafe drinking water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene continue to be major contributors to global mortality, resulting in about 870,000 deaths in 2016. these deaths were mainly caused by diarrhoeal diseases, but also from malnutrition and intestinal nematode infections. globally, 32 million people died in 2016 due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease. the probability of dying from these causes was about 18 per cent in 2016 for people between 30 and 70 years of age. in 2016, household and outdoor air pollution led to some 7 million deaths worldwide. health systems and funding. globally, almost 12 per cent of the worlds population (over 800 million people) spent at least one tenth of their household budgets to pay for health services in 2010, up from 9.7 per cent in 2000.  official development assistance (oda) for basic health from all donors increased by 41 per cent in real terms since 2010, reaching $9.4 billion in 2016. available data from 2005 to 2016 indicate that close to 45 per cent of all countries and 90 per cent of least developed countries (ldcs) have less than one physician per 1,000 people, and over 60 per cent have fewer than three nurses or midwives per 1,000 people. since 2000, impressive advancements have been made on many health fronts.

51,"however, to meet the sustainable development goals health targets by 2030, progress must be accelerated, in particular in regions with the highest burden of disease. reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health. in 2015, the global maternal mortality ratio stood at 216 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. achieving the target of less than 70 maternal deaths by 2030 requires an annual rate of reduction of at least 7.5 per cent, more than double the annual rate of progress achieved from 2000 to 2015. most maternal deaths can be prevented. in 2016, 78 per cent of live births worldwide benefited from skilled care during delivery, compared to 61 per cent in 2000. in sub saharan africa, however, the rate in 2016 was only 53 per cent of live births. the mortality rate for children under 5 years of age globally was 43 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. that rate represents a 44 per cent reduction since 2000. mortality among children under 5 years of age remains high in sub saharan africa, with a rate of 84 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015.  children are most vulnerable in the first 28 days of life (the neonatal period). in 2015, the global neonatal mortality rate was 19 deaths per 1,000 live births, a decrease from 31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000. neonatal mortality is highest in central and southern asia and in sub saharan africa, at 29 deaths per 1,000 live births in each of those regions in 2015. preventing unintended pregnancies and reducing adolescent childbearing through universal access to sexual and reproductive health care is crucial to the health and well being of women, children and adolescents. "
52,"in 2017, 78 per cent of women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years of age) worldwide who were married or in union had their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods, up from 75 per cent in 2000. progress has been substantial in the least developed countries, with a rise of 18 percentage points from 2000 to 2017. globally, the adolescent birth rate among females aged 15 to 19 declined by 21 per cent from 2000 to 2015; in northern america and southern asia, it dropped by more than 50 per cent. however, the adolescent birth rate remains high in two thirds of all countries, with more than 20 births per 1,000 adolescent girls in 2015. infectious diseases. major advances have been made in combating infectious diseases. globally in 2015, there were 0.3 new hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) infections per 1,000 uninfected people; among children under 15 years of age, there were 0.08 new hiv infections. that data represents a decline of 45 per cent and 71 per cent, respectively, since 2000. the incidence of hiv infection remained highest in sub saharan africa, with 1.5 new infections per 1,000 uninfected people in 2015. in 2015, 10.4 million new cases of tuberculosis were reported worldwide, which represents 142 new cases per 100,000 people, or a decline of 17 per cent since 2000. the global malaria incidence rate in 2015 was 94 per 1,000 people at risk, a 41 per cent decrease since 2000. in 2015, 1.6 billion people required mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases, a 21 per cent decline from 2010. "
53,
54,"around 1.34 million deaths were attributed to hepatitis in 2015, including 0.9 million deaths owing to hepatitis b. hepatitis b can be prevented through vaccinations; global coverage of vaccinations for that disease among children 1 year of age increased from 29 per cent in 2000 to 84 per cent in 2015. a major risk factor for infectious diseases and mortality is the lack of safe water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) services, which disproportionately affects sub saharan africa and central/southern asia. death rates owing to the lack of wash services in those two regions were 46 and 23 per 100,000 people, respectively, compared to 12 per 100,000 people globally in 2012. non communicable diseases and mental health. premature deaths (before 70 years of age) owing to cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes totalled about 13 million in 2015, accounting for 43 per cent of all premature deaths globally. from 2000 to 2015, the risk of dying between 30 and 70 years of age from one of those four causes decreased from 23 per cent to 19 per cent, falling short of the rate required to meet the 2030 target of a one third reduction. such mental disorders as depression can lead to suicide. nearly 800,000 suicides occurred worldwide in 2015, with men about twice as likely to commit suicide as women. tobacco and alcohol use contributes to the burden of non communicable diseases. the world health organization (who) framework convention on tobacco control has been ratified by 180 parties, which represent 90 per cent of the global population. still, more than 1.1 billion people, mostly men, consumed tobacco in 2015. "
55,"the prevalence of smoking among those individuals 15 years of age and older dropped from 23 per cent in 2007 to 21 per cent in 2013. in 2016, the average consumption of pure alcohol was 6.4 litres per year per person among those individuals 15 years of age or older. indoor and ambient air pollution is the greatest environmental health risk. globally in 2012, household air pollution from cooking with unclean fuels or inefficient technologies led to an estimated 4.3 million deaths, while ambient air pollution from traffic, industrial sources, waste burning or residential fuel combustion resulted in an estimated 3 million deaths. other health risks. in 2013, about 1.25 million people died from road traffic injuries, the leading cause of death among males between 15 and 29 years of age. road traffic deaths have increased by about 13 per cent globally since 2000. worldwide in 2015, an estimated 108,000 people died as a result of unintentional poisoning. that figure represents 1.5 deaths per 100,000 people, a 33 per cent decrease since 2000. health systems and funding. in 2015, total official flows for medical research and basic health from all donor countries and multilateral organizations amounted to $9.7 billion, an increase in real terms of 30 per cent since 2010. of that amount, the member countries of the development assistance committee of oecd contributed $4.3 billion. available data from 2005 to 2015 indicate that over 40 per cent of all countries have less than one physician per 1,000 people, and around half have fewer than three nurses or midwives per 1,000 people. "
56,"almost all least developed countries have less than one physician and fewer than three nurses or midwives per 1,000 people. goal 3 seeks to ensure health and well being for all, at every stage of life. the goal addresses all major health priorities, including reproductive, maternal and child health; communicable, non communicable and environmental diseases; universal health coverage; and access for all to safe, effective, quality and affordable medicines and vaccines. it also calls for more research and development, increased health financing, and strengthened capacity of all countries in health risk reduction and management. between 2000 and 2015, the global maternal mortality ratio, or number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, declined by 37 per cent, to an estimated ratio of 216 per 100,000 live births in 2015. almost all maternal deaths occur in low resource settings and can be prevented. globally, 3 out of 4 births were assisted by skilled health care personnel in 2015. under five mortality rates fell rapidly from 2000 to 2015, declining by 44 per cent globally. nevertheless, an estimated 5.9 million children under the age of 5 died in 2015, with a global under five mortality rate of 43 per 1,000 live births. the neonatal mortality rate, that is, the likelihood of dying in the first 28 days of life, declined from 31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 19 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. over that period, progress in the rate of child survival among children aged 1 to 59 months outpaced advances in reducing neonatal mortality; as a result, neonatal deaths now represent a larger share (45 per cent) of all under five deaths. "
57,
58,"preventing unintended pregnancy and reducing adolescent childbearing through universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services are critical to further advances in the health of women, children and adolescents. worldwide, in 2015, approximately 3 in 4 women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years of age) who were married or in union satisfied their need for family planning by using modern contraceptive methods; in sub saharan africa and oceania, however, the share was less than half. childbearing in adolescence has steadily declined in almost all regions, but wide disparities persist: in 2015, the birth rate among adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 ranged from 7 births per 1,000 girls in eastern asia to 102 births per 1,000 girls in sub saharan africa. the incidence of major infectious diseases, including hiv, tuberculosis and malaria, has declined globally since 2000. globally in 2015, the number of new hiv infections among all people was 0.3 new infections per 1,000 uninfected people; 2.1 million people became newly infected that year. the incidence of hiv was highest in sub saharan africa, with 1.5 new cases per 1,000 uninfected people. in 2014, 9.6 million new cases of tuberculosis (133 cases per 100,000 people) were reported worldwide, with 58 per cent of them in south eastern asia and the western pacific. almost half the worlds population is at risk of malaria and, in 2015, the incidence rate was 91 new cases per 1,000 people at risk, an estimated total of 214 million cases. sub saharan africa accounted for 89 per cent of all malaria cases worldwide, with an incidence rate of 235 cases per 1,000 people at risk. in 2014, at least 1.7 billion people, in 185 countries, required treatment for at least one neglected tropical disease. "
59,"according to estimates from 2012, around 38 million deaths per year, accounting for 68 per cent of all deaths worldwide, were attributable to non communicable diseases. of all deaths among persons under the age of 70, commonly referred to as premature deaths, an estimated 52 per cent were as a result of non communicable diseases. over three quarters of premature deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. globally, premature mortality from those four main categories of non communicable disease declined by 15 per cent between 2000 and 2012. reducing tobacco use will be critical for meeting the proposed target of reducing premature mortality from non communicable diseases by one third. in 2015, over 1.1 billion people consumed tobacco, with far more male (945 million) than female (180 million) smokers. unhealthy environmental conditions increase the risk of both non communicable and infectious diseases, which is reflected in the strong integrated nature of the goals. in 2012, an estimated 889,000 people died from infectious diseases caused largely by faecal contamination of water and soil and by inadequate hand washing facilities and practices resulting from poor or non existent sanitation services. in 2012, household and ambient air pollution resulted in some 6.5 million deaths. substance use and substance use disorders have also created a significant public health burden. worldwide, average alcohol consumption in 2015 was estimated at 6.3l of pure alcohol per person among those aged 15 or older, with wide variations across countries. "
60,"alcohol consumption was highest in the developed regions (10.4l per person) and lowest in northern africa (0.5l per person). in 2013, only about 1 in 6 people worldwide suffering from drug use disorders received treatment. approximately 1 in 18 people with drug use disorders received treatment in africa that year, compared with 1 in 5 in western and central europe. mental disorders occur in all regions and cultures. the most common are anxiety and depression, which, not infrequently, can lead to suicide. in 2012, an estimated 800,000 people worldwide committed suicide, and 86 per cent of them were under the age of 70. globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death among those between the ages of 15 and 29. around 1.25 million people died from road traffic injuries in 2013. halving the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020 is an ambitious goal given the dramatic increase in the number of vehicles, which nearly doubled between 2000 and 2013. total official flows from all providers for medical research and basic health sectors were $8.9 billion in 2014. within this total, official development assistance (oda) from dac donors was $4.5 billion in 2014, an increase of 20 per cent in real terms since 2010, with the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and the united states of america accounting for $2.6 billion of that total. in 2014, $1 billion was spent on malaria control and $1.2 billion was spent on other infectious diseases, excluding aids. "
61,
62,"by 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births. maternal mortality ratio. proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel.  by 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under 5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. under five mortality rate. neonatal mortality rate. by 2030, end the epidemics of aids, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water borne diseases and other communicable diseases. number of new hiv infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and key populations. tuberculosis incidence per 1,000 population. malaria incidence per 1,000 population. hepatitis b incidence per 100,000 population. number of people requiring interventions against neglected tropical diseases. by 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well being. mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease. suicide mortality rate. strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol. coverage of treatment interventions (pharmacological, psychosocial and rehabilitation and aftercare services) for substance use disorders. harmful use of alcohol, defined according to the national context as alcohol per capita consumption (aged 15 years and older) within a calendar year in litres of pure alcohol. "
63,"by 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents. death rate due to road traffic injuries. by 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes. proportion of women of reproductive age (aged 15 49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods. adolescent birth rate (aged 10 14 years; aged 15 19 years) per 1,000 women in that age group. achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. coverage of essential health services (defined as the average coverage of essential services based on tracer interventions that include reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, infectious diseases, non communicable diseases and service capacity and access, among the general and the most disadvantaged population). proportion of population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income. by 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination. mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution. mortality rate attributed health worker density and distribution. strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks. "
64,"international health regulations (ihr) capacity and health emergency preparedness. ensure healthy lives and promote well being for all at all ages. significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with child and maternal mortality. between 2000 and 2016, the worldwide under five mortality rate decreased by 47 percent (from 78 deaths per 1,000 live births to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births). still, the number of children dying under age five is extremely high: 5.6 million in 2016 alone. newborns account for a growing number of these deaths, and poorer children are at the greatest risk of under 5 mortality due to a number of factors. sdg goal 3 aims to reduce under five mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. but if current trends continue, more than 60 countries will miss the sdg neonatal mortality target for 2030. about half of these countries would not reach the target even by 2050. goal 3 also aims to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births. though the maternal mortality ratio declined by 37 to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene for all (wash) services). mortality rate attributed to unintentional poisoning. strengthen the implementation of the world health organization framework convention on tobacco control in all countries, as appropriate. age standardized prevalence of current tobacco use among persons aged 15 years and older. "
65,"support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for the communicable and non communicable diseases that primarily affect developing countries, provide access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines, in accordance with the doha declaration on the trips agreement and public health, which affirms the right of developing countries to use to the full the provisions in the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights regarding flexibilities to protect public health, and, in particular, provide access to medicines for all. proportion of the population with access to affordable medicines and vaccines on a sustainable basis. total net official development assistance to medical research and basic health sectors. substantially increase health financing and the recruitment, development, training and retention of the health workforce in developing countries, especially in least developed countries and small island developing states. while needs are being addressed gradually, more than 225 million women have an unmet need for contraception. goal 3 aims to achieve universal health coverage, including access to essential medicines and vaccines. it proposes to end the preventable death of newborns and children under 5 and to end epidemics such as aids, tuberculosis, malaria, and water borne diseases, for example. 2016 rates for the third dose of the pertussis vaccine (dtp3) and the first dose of the measles vaccine (mcv1) reached 86 percent and 85 percent, respectively. yet about 20 million children did not receive dtp3 and about 21 million did not receive mcv1. around 2 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress in order to reach sdg targets for immunization. "
66,"attention to health and well being also includes targets related to the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, deaths and injuries from traffic accidents and from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination. over the last 15 years, the number of childhood deaths has been cut in half. this proves that it is possible to win the fight against almost every disease. still, we are spending an astonishing amount of money and resources on treating illnesses that are surprisingly easy to prevent. the new goal for worldwide good health promotes healthy lifestyles, preventive measures and modern, efficient healthcare for everyone. percent between 2000 and 2015, there were approximately 303,000 maternal deaths worldwide in 2015, most from preventable causes. in 2015, maternal health conditions were also the leading cause of death among girls aged 1519. data for girls of greatest concern  those aged between 10 14   is currently unavailable. key strategies for meeting sdg goal 3 will be to reduce adolescent pregnancy (which is strongly linked to gender equality), provide better data for all women and girls, and achieve universal coverage of skilled birth attendants. similarly, progress has been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation and on reducing malaria, tuberculosis, polio, and the spread of hiv/aids. from 2000 2016, new hiv infections declined by 66 percent for children under 15 and by 45 percent among adolescents aged 1519. however, current trends mean that 1 out of 4 countries still won t meet the sdg target to end aids among children under 5, and 3 out of 4 will not meet the target to end aids among adolescents. additionally, only half of women in developing countries have received the health care they need, and the need for family planning is increasing exponentially as the population grows. "
67,
68,"obtaining a quality education is the foundation to creating sustainable development. in addition to improving quality of life, access to inclusive education can help equip locals with the tools required to develop innovative solutions to the worlds greatest problems. over 265 million children are currently out of school and 22% of them are of primary school age. additionally, even the children who are attending schools are lacking basic skills in reading and math. in the past decade, major progress has been made towards increasing access to education at all levels and increasing enrollment rates in schools particularly for women and girls. basic literacy skills have improved tremendously, yet bolder efforts are needed to make even greater strides for achieving universal education goals. for example, the world has achieved equality in primary education between girls and boys, but few countries have achieved that target at all levels of education. the reasons for lack of quality education are due to lack of adequately trained teachers, poor conditions of schools and equity issues related to opportunities provided to rural children. for quality education to be provided to the children of impoverished families, investment is needed in educational scholarships, teacher training workshops, school building and improvement of water and electricity access to schools. enrolment in primary education in developing countries has reached 91 per cent but 57 million primary age children remain out of school. "
69,"more than half of children that have not enrolled in school live in sub saharan africa. an estimated 50 per cent of out of school children of primary school age live in conflict affected areas. 617 million youth worldwide lack basic mathematics and literacy skills. by 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and goal 4 effective learning outcomes. by 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and preprimary education so that they are ready for primary education. by 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university. by 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship. by 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations. by 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy. by 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of cultures contribution to sustainable development. "
70,"build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, nonviolent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all. by 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing states and african countries, for enrolment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering and scientific programmes, in developed countries and other developing countries. by 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing states. 262 million children and adolescents remain out of school. 617 million lack minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics. quality education: why it matters. what is the goal here? ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning. why does education matter? education enables upward socioeconomic mobility and is a key to escaping poverty. education is also essential to achieving many other sustainable development goals (sdgs). when people are able to get quality education they can break from the cycle of poverty. education helps to reduce inequalities and to reach gender equality. in fact, one extra year of education is associated with a reduction of the gini coefficient by 1.4 percentage points. education empowers people everywhere to live more healthy and sustainable lives. "
71,"education is also crucial to fostering tolerance between people and contributes to more peaceful societies. how much progress have we made so far? despite years of steady growth in enrolment rates, non proficiency rates remain disturbingly high. globally, an estimated 617 million children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school age, more than 55 per cent of the global total, lacked minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics in 2015. non proficiency rates are highest in sub saharan africa and central and southern asia, where more than 80 per cent of children of primary and lower secondary school age were not proficient in reading. where are people struggling the most to have access to education? adequate infrastructure and teacher training play a critical role in the quality of education. sub saharan africa faces the biggest challenges in providing schools with basic resources. the situation is extreme at the primary and lower secondary levels, where less than one half of schools in sub saharan africa have access to drinking water, electricity, computers and the internet. another important step towards the goal of good quality education for all is getting enough trained teachers into classrooms. here again, sub saharan africa lags behind."
72,"are there groups that have a more difficult access to education? yes, women and girls are one of these groups. about one third of countries in the developing regions have not achieved gender parity in primary education. in sub saharan africa, oceania and western asia, girls still face barriers to entering both primary and secondary school. these disadvantages in education also translate into lack of access to skills and limited opportunities in the labour market for young women. what can we do? ask our governments to place education as a priority in both policy and practice. lobby our governments to make firm commitments to provide free primary school education to all, including vulnerable or marginalized groups. encourage the private sector to invest resources in the development of educational tools and facilities. urge ngos to partner with youth and other groups to foster the importance of education within local communities. despite the considerable progress on education access and participation over the past years, 262 million children and youth aged 6 to 17 were still out of school in 2017, and more than half of children and adolescents are not meeting minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. rapid technological changes present opportunities and challenges, but the learning environment, the capacities of teachers and the quality of education have not kept pace."
73,"refocused efforts are needed to improve learning outcomes for the full life cycle, especially for women, girls and marginalized people in vulnerable settings. in 72 countries with recent data, approximately 7 in 10 children aged 3 and 4 were developmentally on track in at least three of the following domains: literacy numeracy, physical development, social emotional development and learning. in 2015, an estimated 617 million children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school age worldwide  more than 50 per cent  were not achieving minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics. of these, about two thirds were attending school but were not learning in the classroom, or dropped out school. some 750 million adults  two thirds of them women  remained illiterate in 2016. half of the global illiterate population lives in south asia, and a quarter live in sub saharan africa. many developing countries still lack basic infrastructure and facilities to provide effective learning environments. sub saharan africa faces the biggest challenges: at the primary and lower secondary levels, less than half of schools have access to electricity, the internet, computers and basic drinking water. oda for scholarships amounted to $1.3 billion in 2017. australia, france, japan, the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and institutions of the european union accounted for nearly two thirds of this total. "
74,"globally, there has been little progress in the percentage of primary school teachers who are trained: it has been stagnating at about 85 per cent since 2015. the proportion is lowest in sub saharan africa (64 per cent). more than half of children and adolescents worldwide are not meeting minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. refocused efforts are needed to improve the quality of education. disparities in education along the lines of gender, urban rural location and other dimensions still run deep, and more investments in education infrastructure are required, particularly in ldcs. at the global level, the participation rate in early childhood and primary education was 70 per cent in 2016, up from 63 per cent in 2010. the lowest rates are found in sub saharan africa (41 per cent) and northern africa and western asia (52 per cent). an estimated 617 million children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school age worldwide 58 per cent of that age group are not achieving minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics. in 2016, an estimated 85 per cent of primary school teachers worldwide were trained; the proportion was only 71 per cent for southern asia and 61 per cent for sub saharan africa. in 2016, only 34 per cent of primary schools in ldcs had electricity and less than 40 per cent were equipped with basic handwashing facilities. "
75,"achieving inclusive and equitable quality education for all will require increasing efforts, especially in sub saharan africa and southern asia and for vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities, indigenous people, refugee children and poor children in rural areas. in 2014, about 2 in 3 children worldwide participated in pre primary or primary education in the year prior to official entry age for primary school. however, in the least developed countries, the ratio was only 4 in 10. despite considerable gains in education enrolment over the past 15 years, worldwide, the adjusted net enrolment rates were 91 per cent for primary education, 84 per cent for lower secondary education and 63 per cent for upper secondary education in 2014. about 263 million children and youth were out of school, including 61 million children of primary school age. sub saharan africa and southern asia account for over 70 per cent of the global out ofschool population in primary and secondary education. even though more children than ever are going to school, many do not acquire basic skills in reading and mathematics. recent learning assessment studies show that in 9 of 24 sub saharan african countries and 6 of 15 latin american countries with data, fewer than half of the students at the end of primary education had attained minimum proficiency levels in mathematics. in 6 of 24 sub saharan african countries with data, fewer than half of the students who finished their primary schooling had attained minimum proficiency levels in reading."
76,"equity issues constitute a major challenge in education according to a recent assessment. in all countries with data, children from the richest 20 per cent of households achieved greater proficiency in reading at the end of their primary and lower secondary education than children from the poorest 20 per cent of households. in most countries with data, urban children scored higher in reading than rural children. the lack of trained teachers and the poor condition of schools in many parts of the world are jeopardizing prospects for quality education for all. sub  saharan africa has a relatively low percentage of trained teachers in pre  primary, primary and secondary education (44 per cent, 74 per cent and 55 per cent, respectively). moreover, the majority of schools in the region do not have access to electricity or potable water. on the basis of data from 65 developing countries, the average percentage of schools with access to computers and the internet for teaching purposes is above 60 per cent in both primary and secondary education. however, the share is less than 40 per cent in more than half of sub saharan countries with data. official development assistance (oda) for scholarships amounted to $1 billion in 2015, a decrease from $1.2 billion in 2014. australia, france and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland were the largest contributors. despite progress, the world failed to meet the millennium development goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015. "
77,"data from 38 countries in the developed regions show that, in the majority of those countries, at least 75 per cent of young people achieved at least a minimum proficiency in reading and/or mathematics; the same was true for only 5 out of 22 countries, in developing regions, for which data were available.  in 2013, the latest year for which data are available, 59 million children of primary school age were out of school. estimates show that, among those 59 million children, 1 in 5 of those children had dropped out and recent trends suggest that 2 in 5 of out of school children will never set foot in a classroom. the sustainable development goals clearly recognize that this gap must be closed, even as the international community more explicitly addresses the challenges of quality and equity. measuring learning achievement, starting in the early grades, will help to identify where schools are failing to meet their commitments to children and to formulate appropriate remedial action. for example, data for 2013 from 15 latin american countries show that in six countries, fewer than 50 per cent of third graders had a minimum level of proficiency in mathematics; in three countries, fewer than half were proficient in reading. at the end of primary school, children should be able to read and write and to understand and use basic concepts in mathematics. the end of lower secondary education often coincides with the end of compulsory education. by this stage, young people should be able to master subject related knowledge and skills and possess personal and social skills. "
78,"completion rates for both primary and lower secondary education has been rising steadily since 2000. completion rates for primary education in both developed and developing regions exceeded 90 per cent in 2013. at the lower secondary level, the gap between developed and developing regions has narrowed substantially, but still stood at nearly 20 percentage points in 2013 (91 per cent for developed regions and 72 per cent for developing regions). quality early education provides children with basic cognitive and language skills and fosters emotional development. in the majority of the 58 countries with available data for the period 2009 2015, more than half of children between the ages of 3 and 4 were developmentally on track in at least three of the following domains: literacy, numeracy, physical development, social emotional development and learning. goal 4 strongly supports the reduction of persistent disparities. worldwide, in 2013, two thirds of the 757 million adults (aged 15 and over) who were unable to read and write were women. globally, in 2013, 1 in 10 girls were out of school, compared to 1 in 12 boys. children from the poorest 20 per cent of households are nearly four times more likely to be out of school than their richest peers. out of school rates are also higher in rural areas and among children from households headed by someone with less than a primary education. to fulfil the promise of universal primary and secondary education, new primary school teachers are needed, with current estimates showing a need for nearly 26 million of them by 2030. "
79,"africa faces the greatest challenges in this regard, with nearly 7 in 10 countries experiencing acute shortages of trained primary school teachers. in 2013, only 71 per cent of teachers in sub saharan africa and 84 per cent in northern africa were trained in accordance with national standards. official development assistance for educational scholarships amounted to around $1.1 billion annually from 2011 to 2013. it totalled $1.2 billion in 2014, with australia, france and japan being the largest contributors. by 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes. proportion of children and young people: (a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex. by 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre primary education so that they are ready for primary education. proportion of children under 5 years of age who are developmentally on track in health, learning and psychosocial well being, by sex. participation rate in organized learning (one year before the official primary entry age), by sex. by 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university. participation rate of youth and adults in formal and non formal education and training in the previous 12 months, by sex. "
80,"by 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship. proportion of youth and adults with information and communications technology (ict) skills, by type of skill. by 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations. parity indices (female/male, rural/urban, bottom/top wealth quintile and others such as disability status, indigenous peoples and conflict affected, as data become available) for all education indicators on this list that can be disaggregated. by 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy. percentage of population in a given age group achieving at least a fixed level of proficiency in functional (a) literacy and (b) numeracy skills, by sex. by 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of cultures contribution to sustainable development. extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development, including gender equality and human rights, are mainstreamed at all levels in: (a) national education policies, (b) curricula, (c) teacher education and (d) student assessment. "
81,"build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, non violent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all. proportion of schools with access to: (a) electricity; (b) the internet for pedagogical purposes; (c) computers for pedagogical purposes; (d) adapted infrastructure and materials for students with disabilities; (e) basic drinking water; (f) single sex basic sanitation facilities; and (g) basic handwashing facilities (as per the wash indicator definitions). by 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing states and african countries, for enrolment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering and scientific programmes, in developed countries and other developing countries. volume of official development assistance flows for scholarships by sector and type of study. by 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing states. proportion of teachers in: (a) pre primary; (b) primary; (c) lower secondary; and (d) upper secondary education who have received at least the minimum organized teacher training (e.g. pedagogical training) pre service or in service required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country. ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. major progress has been made in access to education, specifically at the primary school level, for both boys and girls. the number of out of school children has almost halved from 112 million in 1997 to 60 million in 2014. "
82,
83,"still, at least 22 million children in 43 countries will miss out on pre primary education unless the rate of progress doubles. access does not always mean quality of education or completion of primary school. 103 million youth worldwide still lack basic literacy skills, and more than 60 percent of those are women.  in one out of four countries, more than half of children failed to meet minimum math proficiency standards at the end of primary school, and at the lower secondary level, the rate was 1 in 3 countries. target 1 of goal 4 is to ensure that, by 2030, all girls and boys complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education. additionally, progress is difficult to track: 75 percent of countries have no or insufficient data to track progress towards sdg goal 4 targets for learning outcomes (target 1), early childhood education (target 2), and effective learning environments. data on learning outcomes and pre primary school are particularly scarce; 70 percent and 40 percent of countries lack adequate data for these targets, respectively. this makes it hard to analyze and identify the children at greatest risk of being left behind. a 2019 study used computer modeling to estimate educational attainment for men and women from 2000 2017, mapping the results for each country to help identify areas lagging behind. education liberates the intellect, unlocks the imagination and is fundamental for self respect. it is the key to prosperity and opens a world of opportunities, making it possible for each of us to contribute to a progressive, healthy society. learning benefits every human being and should be available to all."
84,
85,"goal 5: achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. while the world has achieved progress towards gender equality and womens empowerment under the millennium development goals (including equal access to primary education between girls and boys), women and girls continue to suffer discrimination and violence in every part of the world. gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. unfortunately, at the current time, 1 in 5 women and girls between the ages of 15 49 have reported experiencing physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner within a 12 month period and 49 countries currently have no laws protecting women from domestic violence. progress is occurring regarding harmful practices such as child marriage and fgm (female genital mutilation), which has declined by 30% in the past decade, but there is still much work to be done to completely eliminate such practices. providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision making processes will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large. implementing new legal frameworks regarding female equality in the workplace and the eradication of harmful practices targeted at women is crucial to ending the gender based discrimination prevalent in many countries around the world. globally, 750 million women and girls were married before the age of 18 and at least 200 million women and girls in 30 countries have undergone fgm. "
86,"the rates of girls between 15 19 who are subjected to fgm (female genital mutilation) in the 30 countries where the practice is concentrated have dropped from 1 in 2 girls in 2000 to 1 in 3 girls by 2017. in 18 countries, husbands can legally prevent their wives from working; in 39 countries, daughters and sons do not have equal inheritance rights; and 49 countries lack laws protecting women from domestic violence. one in five women and girls, including 19 per cent of women and girls aged 15 to 49, have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner within the last 12 months. yet, 49 countries have no laws that specifically protect women from such violence. while women have made important inroads into political office across the world, their representation in national parliaments at 23.7 per cent is still far from parity. in 46 countries, women now hold more than 30 per cent of seats in national parliament in at least one chamber. only 52 per cent of women married or in a union freely make their own decisions about sexual relations, contraceptive use and health care. globally, women are just 13 per cent of agricultural land holders. women in northern africa hold less than one in five paid jobs in the nonagricultural sector. the proportion of women in paid employment outside the agriculture sector has increased from 35 per cent in 1990 to 41 per cent in 2015. more than 100 countries have taken action to track budget allocations for gender equality. "
87,"in southern asia, a girls risk of marrying in childhood has dropped by over 40% since 2000. end all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere. eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation. eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation. recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies and the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family as nationally appropriate. ensure womens full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decisionmaking in political, economic and public life. ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the programme of action of the international conference on population and development and the beijing platform for action and the outcome documents of their review conferences. undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources, in accordance with national laws. enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women. adopt and strengthen sound policies and enforceable legislation for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls at all levels. gender equality: why it matters. "
88,"in 2018, women only held 27 per cent of managerial positions worldwide. whats the goal here? to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. why? women and girls represent half of the worlds population and therefore also half of its potential. but, today gender inequality persists everywhere and stagnates social progress. women continue to be underrepresented at all levels of political leadership. across the globe, women and girls perform a disproportionate share of unpaid domestic work. inequalities faced by girls can begin right at birth and follow them all their lives. in some countries, girls are deprived of access to health care or proper nutrition, leading to a higher mortality rate. how much progress have we made? women and girls around the world continue to experience violence and cruel practices. physical and/or sexual violence affects women of all ages, ethnicities, socioeconomic status and educational level. child marriage also affects girls education. about one third of developing countries have not achieved gender parity in primary education. in sub saharan africa, oceania and western asia, girls still face barriers to entering both primary and secondary school. how does gender inequality affect women? disadvantages in education translate into lack of access to skills and limited opportunities in the labour market. womens and girls empowerment is essential to expand economic growth and promote social development. the full participation of women in labour forces would add percentage points to most national growth rates double digits in many cases. are there any other gender related challenges? "
89,"yes. worldwide, 35 per cent of women between 15 49 years of age have experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non partner sexual violence. 1 in 3 girls aged 15 19 have experienced some form of female genital mutilation/cutting in the 30 countries in africa and the middle east, where the harmful practice is most common with a high risk of prolonged bleeding, infection (including hiv), childbirth complications, infertility and death. the spotlight initative, an eu/un partnership, is a global, multi year initiative focused on eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls (vawg). but, why should gender equality matter to me? regardless of where you live in, gender equality is a fundamental human right. advancing gender equality is critical to all areas of a healthy society, from reducing poverty to promoting the health, education, protection and the well being of girls and boys. investing in education programmes for girls and increasing the age at which they marry can return $5 for every dollar spent. investing in programs improving income generating activities for women can return $7 dollars for every dollar spent. what can we do to fix these issues? if you are a girl, you can stay in school, help empower your female classmates to do the same and fight for your right to access sexual and reproductive health services. if you are a woman, you can address unconscious biases and implicit associations that form an unintended and often an invisible barrier to equal opportunity. "
90,"if you are a man or a boy, you can work alongside women and girls to achieve gender equality and embrace healthy, respectful relationships. you can fund education campaigns to curb cultural practices like female genital mutilation and change harmful laws that limit the rights of women and girls and prevent them from achieving their full potential. while some indicators of gender equality are progressing, such as a significant decline in the prevalence of female genital mutilation and early marriage, the overall numbers continue to be high. moreover, insufficient progress on structural issues at the root of gender inequality, such as legal discrimination, unfair social norms and attitudes, decision making on sexual and reproductive issues and low levels of political participation, are undermining the ability to achieve sustainable development goal 5. recent data from 106 countries show that 18 per cent of ever partnered women and girls aged 15 to 49 have experienced physical and/or sexual partner violence in the previous 12 months. the prevalence is highest in least developed countries, at 24 per cent. the practice of child marriage has continued to decline around the world, largely driven by progress in south asia, where a girls risk of marrying in childhood decreased by about one quarter between 2013 and 2018. in sub saharan africa, levels of child marriage have declined at a more modest rate. at least 200 million girls and women have been subjected to female genital mutilation, based on data from 30 countries where the practice is concentrated and where nationally representative prevalence data is available. in these countries, the prevalence of this harmful practice declined by one quarter between approximately 2000 and 2018."
91,"according to recent data from some 90 countries, women devote on average roughly three times more hours a day to unpaid care and domestic work than men, limiting the time available for paid work, education and leisure and further reinforcing gender based socioeconomic disadvantages. women continue to be underrepresented at all levels of political leadership. as at 1 january 2019, womens representation in national parliaments ranged from 0 to 61.3 per cent, with the average standing at 24.2 per cent, an increase from 19 per cent in 2010. at the local level, data from 99 countries and areas show that womens representation in elected deliberative bodies varies from less than 1 per cent to 48 per cent, with the median of the distribution at 26 per cent. when legislated gender quotas are adopted, significantly higher proportions of women are elected at both national and local levels. while women represented 39 per cent of world employment, only 27 per cent of managerial positions in the world were occupied by women in 2018, up only marginally from 26 per cent in 2015. the proportion of women in management has increased since 2000 in all regions except in least developed countries. in 51 countries with data on the subject, only 57 per cent of women aged 15 to 49, married or in union, make their own decisions about sexual relations and the use of contraceptives and health services. "
92,"over the past 25 years, there has been progress in reforming laws towards improving gender equality, yet discriminatory laws and gaps in legal protection remain in many countries. on the basis of data collected across four areas of law in 2018 from 53 countries, almost a third have legal gaps in the area of overarching legal frameworks and public life (e.g., constitutions, antidiscrimination laws, quotas, legal aid); more than a quarter have legal gaps in the area of violence against women; and 29 per cent and 24 per cent have legal gaps in the employment and economic benefits area and in the marriage and family area, respectively. despite progress in implementing gender responsive budgeting globally, gaps remain in country efforts to establish comprehensive and transparent tracking systems. based on 2018 data from 69 countries, 13 countries fully met the criteria of having in place a tracking system that measures and makes publicly available gender budget data, and 41 countries approached the requirements. while some forms of discrimination against women and girls are diminishing, gender inequality continues to hold women back and deprives them of basic rights and opportunities. empowering women requires addressing structural issues such as unfair social norms and attitudes as well as developing progressive legal frameworks that promote equality between women and men. based on 20052016 data from 56 countries, 20 per cent of adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 who have ever been in a sexual relationship experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner in the 12 months prior to the survey. "
93,"globally, around 2017, an estimated 21 per cent of women between 20 and 24 years of age reported that they were married or in an informal union before age 18. this means that an estimated 650 million girls and women today were married in childhood. rates of child marriage have continued to decline around the world. in southern asia, a girls risk of marrying in childhood has dropped by over 40 per cent since around 2000. around 2017, one in three girls aged 15 to 19 had been subjected to female genital mutilation in the 30 countries where the practice is concentrated, compared to nearly one in two around 2000. based on data between 2000 and 2016 from about 90 countries, women spend roughly three times as many hours in unpaid domestic and care work as men. globally, the percentage of women in single or lower houses of national parliament has increased from 19 per cent in 2010 to around 23 per cent in 2018. gender inequality persists worldwide, depriving women and girls of their basic rights and opportunities. achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls will require more vigorous efforts, including legal frameworks, to counter deeply rooted gender based discrimination that often results from patriarchal attitudes and related social norms. on the basis of data from 2005 to 2016 for 87 countries, 19 per cent of women between 15 and 49 years of age said they had experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner in the 12 months prior to the survey. in the most extreme cases, such violence can lead to death. "
94,"in 2012, almost half of all women who were victims of intentional homicide worldwide were killed by an intimate partner or family member, compared to 6 per cent of male victims. child marriage is declining, but not fast enough. around 2000, nearly 1 in 3 women between 20 and 24 years of age reported that they were married before 18 years of age. around 2015, the ratio was just over 1 in 4. the decline is driven by an even steeper reduction in the marriage rate among girls under 15 years of age during that period. the harmful practice of female genital mutilation/cutting has declined by 24 per cent since around 2000. nevertheless, prevalence remains high in some of the 30 countries with representative data. in those countries, survey data from around 2015 indicate that more than 1 in 3 girls between 15 and 19 years of age have undergone the procedure compared to nearly 1 in 2 girls around 2000. the average amount of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is more than threefold higher for women than men, according to survey data from 83 countries and areas. available data indicate that time spent on domestic chores accounts for a large proportion of the gender gap in unpaid work. globally, womens participation in single or lower houses of national parliaments reached 23.4 per cent in 2017, just 10 percentage points higher than in 2000. "
95,"such slow progress suggests that stronger political commitment and more ambitious measures and quotas are needed to boost womens political participation and empowerment. women are still underrepresented in managerial positions. in the majority of the 67 countries with data from 2009 to 2015, fewer than a third of senior  and middle management positions were held by women. just over half (52 per cent) of women between 15 and 49 years of age who are married or in union make their own decisions about consensual sexual relations and use of contraceptives and health services. that statistic is based on available data from around 2012 for 45 countries, 43 of which are in developing regions. gender equality and womens empowerment have advanced in recent decades. girls access to education has improved, the rate of child marriage declined and progress was made in the area of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including fewer maternal deaths. nevertheless, gender equality remains a persistent challenge for countries worldwide and the lack of such equality is a major obstacle to sustainable development. assuring womens rights through legal frameworks is a first step in addressing discrimination against them. as of 2014, 143 countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their constitutions; another 52 countries have yet to make this important commitment. in 132 countries, the statutory legal age of marriage is equal for women and men, while in another 63 countries, the legal age of marriage is lower for women than for men. violence against women and girls violates their human rights and hinders development. "
96,"most such violence is perpetrated by intimate partners, with available data from surveys conducted between 2005 and 2015, in 52 countries, (including only one country from the developed regions) indicating that 21 per cent of girls and women aged between 15 and 49 experienced physical and/or sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner in the previous 12 months. estimates on the risks of violence experienced by women with disabilities, women from ethnic minorities and among women above the age of 50 are not yet included, owing to data limitations. additionally, human trafficking disproportionately affects women and girls, since 70 per cent of all victims detected worldwide are female. globally, the proportion of women aged between 20 and 24 who reported that they were married before their eighteenth birthday dropped from 32 per cent around 1990 to 26 per cent around 2015. child marriage is most common in southern asia and sub saharan africa, with 44 per cent of women married before their eighteenth birthday in southern asia and 37 per cent of women married before their eighteenth birthday in sub saharan africa. the marriage of girls under the age 15 is also highest in those two regions, at 16 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. social norms can and do change, however, with the rate of marriage of girls under the age of 15 declining globally from 12 per cent around 1990 to 7 per cent around 2015, although disparities are found across regions and countries. "
97,"the most rapid reduction in child marriage overall was recorded in northern africa, where the percentage of women married before the age of 18 dropped by more than half, from 29 per cent to 13 per cent, over the past 25 years. the harmful practice of female genital mutilation/cutting is another human rights violation that affects girls and women worldwide. while the exact number of girls and women globally who have undergone the procedure is unknown, at least 200 million have been subjected to the procedure in 30 countries with representative prevalence data. overall, rates of female genital mutilation/cutting have been declining over the past three decades. however, not all countries have made progress and the pace of decline has been uneven. today, in the 30 countries, for which data were available, around 1 in 3 girls aged 15 to 19 have undergone the practice, versus 1 in 2 in the mid 1980s. in every region, women and girls do the bulk of unpaid work, including caregiving and such household tasks as cooking and cleaning. on average, women report that they spend 19 per cent of their time each day in unpaid activities, versus 8 per cent for men. the responsibilities of unpaid care and domestic work, combined with paid work, means greater total work burdens for women and girls and less time for rest, self care, learning and other activities. globally, womens participation in parliament rose to 23 per cent in 2016, representing an increase by 6 percentage points over a decade. slow progress in this area is in contrast with more women in parliamentary leadership positions. "
98,"in 2016, the number of women speakers of national parliaments jumped from 43 to 49 (out of the 273 posts globally); women accounted for 18 per cent of all speakers of parliament in january 2016. end all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere. whether or not legal frameworks are in place to promote, enforce and monitor equality and nondiscrimination on the basis of sex. eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation. proportion of ever partnered women and girls aged 15 years and older subjected to physical, sexual or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months, by form of violence and by age. proportion of women and girls aged 15 years and older subjected to sexual violence by persons other than an intimate partner in the previous 12 months, by age and place of occurrence. eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation. proportion of women aged 20 24 years who were married or in a union before age 15 and before age 18. proportion of girls and women aged 15 49 years who have undergone female genital mutilation/cutting, by age. recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies and the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family as nationally appropriate. "
99,"proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location. ensure womens full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and public life. proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments and local governments. proportion of women in managerial positions. ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the programme of action of the international conference on population and development and the beijing platform for action and the outcome documents of their review conferences. proportion of women aged 15 49 years who make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and reproductive health care. number of countries with laws and regulations that guarantee women aged 15 49 years access to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education. undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources, in accordance with national laws. (a) proportion of total agricultural population with ownership or secure rights over agricultural land, by sex; and (b) share of women among owners or rights bearers of agricultural land, by type of tenure. proportion of countries where the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees womens equal rights to land ownership and/or control. enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women. "
100,"proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone, by sex. adopt and strengthen sound policies and enforceable legislation for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls at all levels. proportion of countries with systems to track and make public allocations for gender equality and womens empowerment. achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. according to the un, ""gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world."" providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision making processes will nurture sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large. a record 143 countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their constitutions as of 2014. however, another 52 had not taken this step. in many nations, gender discrimination is still woven into the fabric of legal systems and social norms. even though sdg5 is a stand alone goal, other sdgs can only be achieved if the needs of women receive the same attention as the needs of men. issues unique to women and girls include traditional practices against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, such as female genital mutilation. child marriage has declined over the past decades, yet there is no region that is currently on track to eliminate the practice and reach sdg targets by 2030. if current trends continue, between 2017 and 2030, 150 million girls will be married before they turn 18. "
101,"though child marriages are four times higher among the poorest than the wealthiest in the world, most countries need to accelerate progress among both groups in order to reach the sdg goal 5 target to eliminate child marriage by 2030. achieving gender equality will require enforceable legislation that promotes empowerment of all women and girls and requires secondary education for all girls. the targets call for an end to gender discrimination and for empowering women and girls through technology. some have advocated for ""listening to girls"". the assertion is that the sdgs can deliver transformative change for girls only if girls are consulted. their priorities and needs must be taken into account. girls should be viewed not as beneficiaries of change, but as agents of change. engaging women and girls in the implementation of the sdgs is crucial. the world pensions council (wpc) has insisted on the transformational role gender diverse that boards can play in that regard, predicting that 2018 could be a pivotal year, as ""more than ever before, many uk and european union pension trustees speak enthusiastically about flexing their fiduciary muscles for the uns sustainable development goals, including sdg5, and to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. gender bias is undermining our social fabric and devalues all of us. it is not just a human rights issue; it is a tremendous waste of the worlds human potential. by denying women equal rights, we deny half the population a chance to live life at its fullest. political, economic and social equality for women will benefit all the worlds citizens. together we can eradicate prejudice and work for equal rights and respect for all."
102,"goal 6: ensure access to water and sanitation for all. clean, accessible water for all is an essential part of the world we want to live in and there is sufficient fresh water on the planet to achieve this. however, due to bad economics or poor infrastructure, millions of people including children die every year from diseases associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene. water scarcity, poor water quality and inadequate sanitation negatively impact food security, livelihood choices and educational opportunities for poor families across the world. at the current time, more than 2 billion people are living with the risk of reduced access to freshwater resources and by 2050, at least one in four people is likely to live in a country affected by chronic or recurring shortages of fresh water. drought in specific afflicts some of the worlds poorest countries, worsening hunger and malnutrition. fortunately, there has been great progress made in the past decade regarding drinking sources and sanitation, whereby over 90% of the worlds population now has access to improved sources of drinking water. to improve sanitation and access to drinking water, there needs to be increased investment in management of freshwater ecosystems and sanitation facilities on a local level in several developing countries within sub saharan africa, central asia, southern asia, eastern asia and south eastern asia."
103,"1 in 4 health care facilities lacks basic water services. 3 in 10 people lack access to safely managed drinking water services and 6 in 10 people lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities. at least 892 million people continue to practice open defecation. women and girls are responsible for water collection in 80 per cent of households without access to water on premises. between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of the global population using an improved drinking water source has increased from 76 per cent to 90 per cent. water scarcity affects more than 40 per cent of the global population and is projected to rise. over 1.7 billion people are currently living in river basins where water use exceeds recharge. 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation services, such as toilets or latrines. more than 80 per cent of wastewater resulting from human activities is discharged into rivers or sea without any pollution removal. each day, nearly 1,000 children die due to preventable water and sanitation related diarrheal diseases. approximately 70 per cent of all water abstracted from rivers, lakes and aquifers is used for irrigation. floods and other water related disasters account for 70 per cent of all deaths related to natural disasters. by 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all. by 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations. "
104,"by 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally. by 2030, substantially increase water use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity. by 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate. by 2020, protect and restore water related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes. by 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity building support to developing countries in water  and sanitation related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies. support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management. half of the worlds population is already experiencing severe water scarcity at least one month a year. clean water and sanitation: why it matters. whats the goal here? to ensure access to safe water sources and sanitation for all. why? the demand for water has outpaced population growth, and half the worlds population is already experiencing severe water scarcity at least one month a year. access to water, sanitation and hygiene is a human right, yet billions are still faced with daily challenges accessing even the most basic of services. "
105,"3 in 10 people lack access to safely managed drinking water services. about 3 billion people lack access to basic sanitation services, such as toilets or latrines. more than 80 per cent of wastewater resulting from human activities is discharged into rivers or sea without any treatment, leading to pollution. what are the effects of this? water and sanitation related diseases remain among the major causes of death in children under five; more than 800 children die every day from diarrhoeal diseases linked to poor hygiene. proper water and sanitation is a key foundation for achieving the sustainable development goals, including good health and gender equality. by managing our water sustainably, we are also able to better manage our production of food and energy and contribute to decent work and economic growth. moreover, we can preserve our water ecosystems, their biodiversity, and take action on climate change. what would it cost to correct the problem? a study by the world bank group, unicef and the world health organization estimates that extending basic water and sanitation services to the unserved would cost us$28.4 billion per year from 2015 to 2030, or 0.10 per cent of the global product of the 140 countries included in its study. what would it cost if we dont correct the problem? the costs are huge, both for people and for the economy. worldwide, more than 2 million people die every year from diarrhoeal diseases. "
106,"poor hygiene and unsafe water are responsible for nearly 90 per cent of these deaths and mostly affect children. the economic impact of not investing in water and sanitation costs 4.3 per cent of sub saharan african gdp. the world bank estimates that 6.4 per cent of indias gdp is lost due to adverse economic impacts and costs of inadequate sanitation. without better infrastructure and management, millions of people will continue to die every year and there will be further losses in biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, undermining prosperity and efforts towards a more sustainable future. what can we do? civil society organizations should work to keep governments accountable, invest in water research and development, and promote the inclusion of women, youth and indigenous communities in water resources governance. generating awareness of these roles and turning them into action will lead to win win results and increased sustainability and integrity for both human and ecological systems. you can also get involved in the world water day and world toilet day campaigns that aim to provide information and inspiration to take action on hygiene issues. despite progress, billions of people still lack safe water, sanitation and handwashing facilities. data suggests that achieving universal access to even basic sanitation service by 2030 would require doubling the current annual rate of progress. more efficient use and management of water are critical to addressing the growing demand for water, threats to water security and the increasing frequency and severity of droughts and floods resulting from climate change. "
107,"as of the time of writing, most countries are unlikely to reach full implementation of integrated water resources management by 2030. globally, the proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services increased from 61 to 71 per cent between 2000 and 2015 and remained unchanged in 2017. an additional 19 per cent of the global population used basic drinking water services. this means that 785 million people still lacked even a basic drinking water service. the global population using safely managed sanitation services increased from 28 per cent in 2000 to 43 per cent in 2015 and to 45 per cent in 2017, with the greatest increases occurring in latin america and the caribbean, sub saharan africa and east and south east asia. between 2000 and 2017, the proportion lacking even a basic sanitation service decreased from 44 to 27 per cent, yet 701 million people still practiced open defecation in 2017.in 2017, some 60 per cent of people worldwide and only 38 per cent in least developed countries had a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home, leaving an estimated 3 billion people without basic handwashing facilities at home. in 2016, one third of all primary schools lacked basic drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services, affecting the education of millions of schoolchildren, but particularly girls managing menstruation, and one in four health care facilities worldwide lacked basic water services, affecting more than 2 billion people. approximately one third of countries have medium or high levels of water stress. "
108,"almost all countries that have registered high water stress are located in north africa and west asia or in central and south asia, and these levels indicate serious water difficulties in the supply of freshwater, at least during parts of the year. of 172 countries, 80 per cent have medium low implementation or better of integrated water resources management. however, 60 per cent of countries are unlikely to reach the target of full implementation by 2030. a significant effort is needed to ensure that cooperation is operational in all transboundary basins. according to data from 67 of 153 countries that share transboundary waters, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was 59 per cent in the period 20172018, with only 17 countries reporting that all their transboundary basins were covered by such arrangements. following several years of steady increases and after reaching $9 billion in 2016, oda disbursements to the water sector declined by 2 per cent from 2016 to 2017. however, oda commitments to the water sector jumped by 36 per cent between 2016 and 2017, indicating a renewed focus by donors on the sector. too many people still lack access to safely managed water supplies and sanitation facilities. water scarcity, flooding and lack of proper wastewater management also hinder social and economic development. increasing water efficiency and improving water management are critical to balancing the competing and growing water demands from various sectors and users. "
109, 
110,"in 2015, 29 per cent of the global population lacked safely managed drinking water supplies, and 61 per cent were without safely managed sanitation services. in 2015, 892 million people continued to practise open defecation. in 2015, only 27 per cent of the population in ldcs had basic handwashing facilities. preliminary estimates from household data of 79 mostly high  and high middle income countries (excluding much of africa and asia) suggest that 59 per cent of all domestic wastewater is safely treated. in 22 countries, mostly in the northern africa and western asia region and in the central and southern asia region, the water stress level is above 70 per cent, indicating the strong probability of future water scarcity. in 20172018, 157 countries reported average implementation of integrated water resources management of 48 per cent. based on data from 62 out of 153 countries sharing transboundary waters, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was only 59 per cent in 2017. access to safe water and sanitation and sound management of freshwater ecosystems are essential to human health and to environmental sustainability and economic prosperity. in 2015, 6.6 billion people (over 90 per cent of the worlds population) used improved drinking water sources and 4.9 billion people (over two thirds of the worlds population) used improved sanitation facilities. in both cases, people without access live predominantly in rural areas. achieving universal access to basic sanitation and ending the unsafe practice of open defecation will require substantial acceleration of progress in rural areas of central and southern asia, eastern and south eastern asia and sub saharan africa. "
111,"effective water and sanitation management relies on the participation of a range of stakeholders, including local communities. a 2016 2017 survey found that over 80 per cent of 74 responding countries had clearly defined procedures for engaging service users/communities in water and sanitation management. more than 2 billion people globally are living in countries with excess water stress, defined as the ratio of total freshwater withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resources above a threshold of 25 per cent. northern africa and western asia experience water stress levels above 60 per cent, which indicates the strong probability of future water scarcity. in 2012, 65 per cent of the 130 countries that responded to a survey on integrated water resources management reported that management plans were in place at the national level. oda for the water sector has been rising steadily, but has remained relatively constant as a proportion of total oda disbursements, at approximately 5 per cent since 2005. in 2015, oda disbursements in the water sector totalled about $8.6 billion, which represents an increase of 67 per cent in real terms since 2005. water and sanitation are at the very core of sustainable development, critical to the survival of people and the planet. goal 6 not only addresses the issues relating to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, but also the quality and sustainability of water resources worldwide. in 2015, 4.9 billion people globally used an improved sanitation facility; 2.4 billion did not. among those lacking adequate sanitation were 946 million people without any facilities at all, who continued to practise open defecation. "
112,"in 2015, 68 per cent of the global population was using improved sanitation facilities compared to 59 per cent in 2000. nevertheless, the unsafe management of faecal waste and wastewater continues to present a major risk to public health and the environment. more progress has been made in access to drinking water. in 2015, 6.6 billion people, or 91 per cent of the global population, used an improved drinking water source, versus 82 per cent in 2000. despite that improvement, an estimated 663 million people were using unimproved water sources or surface water that year. while coverage was around 90 per cent or more in all regions except sub saharan africa and oceania, widespread inequalities persist within and among countries. moreover, not all improved sources are safe. for instance, in 2012 it was estimated that at least 1.8 billion people were exposed to drinking water sources contaminated with faecal matter. holistic management of the water cycle means taking into account the level of water stress, calculated as the ratio of total fresh water withdrawn by all major sectors to the total renewable fresh water resources in a particular country or region. currently, water stress affects more than 2 billion people around the world, a figure that is projected to rise. already, water stress affects countries on every continent and hinders the sustainability of natural resources, as well as economic and social development. in 2011, 41 countries experienced water stress, an increase from 36 countries in 1998. of those, 10 countries, on the arabian peninsula, in central asia and in northern africa, withdrew more than 100 per cent of their renewable fresh water resources. "
113,
114,"integrated water resources management, one of the follow up actions to the plan of implementation of the world summit on sustainable development (johannesburg plan of implementation), aims to address this urgent situation. in 2012, 65 per cent of the 130 countries that responded to a survey question on integrated water resources management reported that management plans were in place at the national level. total official flows for water and sanitation were $10 billion in 2014, of which total aid flows from dac donors amounted to $8 billion. aid for water and sanitation nearly doubled as a share of oda during the international drinking water supply and sanitation decade (1981 1990). since that time, on average, it has remained at around 7 per cent of total aid flows. better targeting and tracking of water aid within the context of national situations is needed. for instance, numerous countries with limited access to water supply and/or sanitation have been receiving minimal external assistance (typically less than $2 per capita annually), while other countries with higher levels of access have received much more (at least $30 per capita a year). effective water and sanitation management also depends on the participation of stakeholders. according to a 2013 2014 global analysis and assessment of sanitation and drinking water survey, 83 per cent of the 94 countries surveyed reported that procedures for stakeholder participation were clearly defined in law or policy. in the sustainable development goals, the focus is being refined to also include the participation of local communities, which will be captured in the next cycle of global analysis and assessment of sanitation and drinking water monitoring."

""equitable sanitation"" calls for addressing the specific needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities. "
117,"water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented. ending open defecation will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as behavior change of the users. this will require cooperation between governments, civil society, and the private sector. the main indicator for the sanitation target is the ""proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand washing facility with soap and water"". however, as of 2017, two thirds of countries lacked baseline estimates for sdg indicators on hand washing, safely managed drinking water, and sanitation services. from those that were available, the joint monitoring programme (jmp) found that 4.5 billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation.[46] to meet sdg targets for sanitation by 2030, nearly one third of countries will need to accelerate progress to end open defecation, including brazil, china, ethiopia, india, indonesia, nigeria, and pakistan. the sustainable sanitation alliance (susana) has made it its mission to achieve sdg6. susana s position is that the sdgs are highly interdependent. therefore, the provision of clean water and sanitation for all is a precursor to achieving many of the other sdgs. one in three people live without sanitation. this is causing unnecessary disease and death. although huge strides have been made with access to clean drinking water, lack of sanitation is undermining these advances. if we provide affordable equipment and education in hygiene practices, we can stop this senseless suffering and loss of life."
118,
119,"ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy. energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today. be it for jobs, security, climate change, food production or increasing incomes, access to energy for all is essential. working towards this goal is especially important as it interlinks with other sustainable development goals. focusing on universal access to energy, increased energy efficiency and the increased use of renewable energy through new economic and job opportunities is crucial to creating more sustainable and inclusive communities and resilience to environmental issues like climate change. at the current time, there are approximately 3 billion people who lack access to clean cooking solutions and are exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution. additionally, slightly less than 1 billion people are functioning without electricity and 50% of them are found in sub saharan africa alone. fortunately, progress has been made in the past decade regarding the use of renewable electricity from water, solar and wind power and the ratio of energy used per unit of gdp is also declining. however, the challenge is far from being solved and there needs to be more access to clean fuel and technology and more progress needs to be made regarding integrating renewable energy into end use applications in buildings, transport and industry. "
120,"public and private investments in energy also need to be increased and there needs to be more focus on regulatory frameworks and innovative business models to transform the worlds energy systems. 13% of the global population still lacks access to modern electricity. 3 billion people rely on wood, coal, charcoal or animal waste for cooking and heating. energy is the dominant contributor to climate change, accounting for around 60 per cent of total global greenhouse gas emissions. indoor air pollution from using combustible fuels for household energy caused 4.3 million deaths in 2012, with women and girls accounting for 6 out of every 10 of these. the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption has reached 17.5% in 2015. by 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services. by 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. by 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. by 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology. by 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing states, and land locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support."
121,"3 billion people lack access to clean cooking fuels, resulting in nearly 4 million premature deaths each year. affordable and clean energy: why it matters. whats the goal here? to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. why? a well established energy system supports all sectors: from businesses, medicine and education to agriculture, infrastructure, communications and high technology. access to electricity in poorer countries has begun to accelerate, energy efficiency continues to improve, and renewable energy is making impressive gains. nevertheless, more focused attention is needed to improve access to clean and safe cooking fuels and technologies for 3 billion people. i have access to electricity. why should i care about this goal? for many decades, fossil fuels such as coal, oil or gas have been major sources of electricity production, but burning carbon fuels produces large amounts of greenhouse gases which cause climate change and have harmful impacts on peoples well being and the environment. this affects everyone, not just a few. moreover, global electricity use is rising rapidly. in a nutshell, without a stable electricity supply, countries will not be able to power their economies. how many people are living without electricity? nearly 9 out of 10 people now have access to electricity, but reaching the unserved will require increased efforts. in sub saharan africa, an estimated 573 million people still lacked access to electricity. "
122,
123,"without electricity, women and girls have to spend hours fetching water, clinics cannot store vaccines for children, many schoolchildren can not do homework at night, and people cannot run competitive businesses. the health and well being of some 3 billion people are adversely impacted by the lack of clean cooking fuels, such as wood, charcoal, dung and coal, which causes indoor air pollution. what would it cost to switch to more sustainable energy? the world needs to triple its investment in sustainable energy infrastructure per year, from around $400 billion now to $1.25 trillion by 2030. regions with the greatest energy deficits, sub saharan africa and south asia, need our help to improve energy access. that includes pushing harder to find clean, efficient, and affordable alternatives to health damaging cook stoves. what can we do to fix these issues? countries can accelerate the transition to an affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy system by investing in renewable energy resources, prioritizing energy efficient practices, and adopting clean energy technologies and infrastructure. businesses can maintain and protect ecosystems to be able to use and further develop hydropower sources of electricity and bioenergy, and commit to sourcing 100% of operational electricity needs from renewable sources. employers can reduce the internal demand for transport by prioritizing telecommunications and incentivize less energy intensive modes such as train travel over auto and air travel."
124, 
125,"investors can invest more in sustainable energy services, bringing new technologies to the market quickly from a diverse supplier base. you can save electricity by plugging appliances into a power strip and turning them off completely when not in use, including your computer. you can also bike, walk or take public transport to reduce carbon emissions. access to electricity in the poorest countries has begun to accelerate, energy efficiency continues to improve and renewable energy is making gains in electricity sector. despite this progress, some 800 million people remain without electricity while access to clean cooking fuels and technologies needs dedicated attention. in addition, if sustainable development goals 7, 13 and related goals are to be met, much higher levels of ambition are required with regard to renewable energy, including transportation and heating. the global electrification rate rose from 83 per cent in 2010 to 87 per cent in 2015, with the increase accelerating to reach 89 per cent in 2017. however, some 840 million people around the world are still without access to electricity. the global share of the population with access to clean cooking fuels and technologies reached 61 per cent in 2017, up from 57 per cent in 2010. despite this progress, close to 3 billion people still rely primarily on inefficient and polluting cooking systems. the renewable energy share of total final energy consumption gradually increased from 16.6 per cent in 2010 to 17.5 per cent in 2016, though much faster change is required to meet climate goals. "
126,"even though the absolute level of renewable energy consumption has grown by more than 18 per cent since 2010, only since 2012 has the growth of renewables outpaced the growth of total energy consumption. e/2019/68 14/39 19 07404. global primary energy intensity (ratio of energy used per unit of gdp) improved from 5.9 in 2010 to 5.1 in 2016, a rate of improvement of 2.3 per cent, which is still short of the 2.7 per cent annual rate needed to reach target 3 of sustainable development goal 7. international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy reached $18.6 billion in 2016, almost doubling from $9.9 billion in 2010. ensuring access to affordable, reliable and modern energy for all has come one step closer due to recent progress in electrification, particularly in ldcs, and improvements in industrial energy efficiency. however, national priorities and policy ambitions still need to be strengthened to put the world on track to meet the energy targets for 2030. from 2000 to 2016, the proportion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 78 per cent to 87 per cent, with the absolute number of people living without electricity dipping to just below 1 billion. in the least developed countries, the proportion of the people with access to electricity more than doubled between 2000 and 2016. "
127,
128,"in 2016, 3 billion people (41 per cent of the worlds population) were still cooking with polluting fuel and stove combinations. the share of renewables in final energy consumption increased modestly, from 17.3 per cent in 2014 to 17.5 per cent in 2015. yet only 55 per cent of the renewable share was derived from modern forms of renewable energy. global energy intensity decreased by 2.8 per cent from 2014 to 2015, double the rate of improvement seen between 1990 and 2010. progress in every area of sustainable energy falls short of what is needed to achieve energy access for all and to meet targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency. meaningful improvements will require higher levels of financing and bolder policy commitments, together with the willingness of countries to embrace new technologies on a much wider scale. globally, 85.3 per cent of the population had access to electricity in 2014, an increase of only 0.3 percentage points since 2012. that means that 1.06 billion people, predominantly rural dwellers, still function without electricity. half of those people live in sub saharan africa. access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking climbed to 57.4 per cent in 2014, up slightly from 56.5 per cent in 2012. more than 3 billion people, the majority of them in asia and sub saharan africa, are still cooking without clean fuels and more efficient technologies. the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption grew modestly from 2012 to 2014, from 17.9 per cent to 18.3 per cent. "
129,
130,"most of the increase was from renewable electricity from water, solar and wind power. solar and wind power still make up a relatively minor share of energy consumption, despite their rapid growth in recent years. the challenge is to increase the share of renewable energy in the heat and transport sectors, which together account for 80 per cent of global energy consumption. from 2012 to 2014, three quarters of the worlds 20 largest energy consuming countries had reduced their energy intensity  the ratio of energy used per unit of gdp. the reduction was driven mainly by greater efficiencies in the industry and transport sectors. however, that progress is still not sufficient to meet the target of doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. energy is crucial for achieving almost all of the sustainable development goals, from its role in the eradication of poverty through advancements in health, education, water supply and industrialization, to combating climate change. the proportion of the global population with access to electricity has increased steadily, from 79 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2012. still, 1.1 billion people are without this valuable service. recent global progress in this area has been driven largely by asia, where access is expanding at more than twice the pace of demographic growth. of those gaining access to electricity worldwide since 2010, 80 per cent are urban dwellers.

131,"the proportion of the worlds population with access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking increased from 51 per cent in 2000 to 58 per cent in 2014, although there has been limited progress since 2010. the absolute number of people relying on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking, such as solid fuels and kerosene, however, has actually increased, reaching an estimated three billion people. limited progress since 2010 falls substantially short of global population growth and is almost exclusively confined to urban areas. the share of renewable energy (derived from hydropower, solid and liquid biofuels, wind, the sun, biogas, geothermal and marine sources, and waste) in the worlds total final energy consumption has increased slowly, from 17.4 per cent in 2000 to 18.1 per cent in 2012. more telling is the fact that modern renewable energy consumption, which excludes solid biofuels used for traditional purposes, grew rapidly, at a rate of 4 per cent a year between 2010 and 2012, and accounted for 60 per cent of all new power generating capacity in 2014. in absolute terms, about 72 per cent of the increase in energy consumption from modern renewable sources between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions, mostly from eastern asia. the technologies making the largest contribution have been hydropower, wind and solar energy; together they account for 73 per cent of the total increase in modern renewable energy between 2010 and 2012. energy intensity, calculated by dividing total primary energy supply by gdp, reveals how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. "
132,"globally, energy intensity decreased by 1.7 per cent per year from 2010 to 2012. this represents a considerable improvement over the period from 1990 to 2010, when it decreased by 1.2 per cent a year. as a result, global energy intensity, which stood at 6.7 (millijoules (mj) per 2011 united states dollar ppp) in 2000 fell to 5.7 by 2012. the proportion of the worlds energy use covered by mandatory energy efficiency regulation, which has almost doubled over the past decade, from 14 per cent in 2005 to 27 per cent in 2014, was a factor. still, current progress is only about two thirds of the pace needed to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. among end use sectors, industry was the largest contributor to reduced energy intensity, followed closely by transportation. about 68 per cent of the savings in energy intensity between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions, with eastern asia as the largest contributor. by 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services. proportion of population with access to electricity. proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology. by 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption. by 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and gdp. by 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology."
133, 
134,"international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems. by 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing states, and land locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support. investments in energy efficiency as a percentage of gdp and the amount of foreign direct investment in financial transfer for infrastructure and technology to sustainable development services. ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. targets for 2030 include access to affordable and reliable energy while increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. this would involve improving energy efficiency and enhancing international cooperation to facilitate more open access to clean energy technology and more investment in clean energy infrastructure. plans call for particular attention to infrastructure support for the least developed countries, small islands and land locked developing countries. as of 2017, only 57 percent of the global population relies primarily on clean fuels and technology for cooking, falling short of the 95 percent target. renewable energy solutions are becoming cheaper, more reliable and more efficient every day.our current reliance on fossil fuels is unsustainable and harmful to the planet, which is why we have to change the way we produce and consume energy. implementing these new energy solutions as fast as possible is essential to counter climate change, one of the biggest threats to our own survival."
135,
136,"promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. roughly half the worlds population still lives on the equivalent of about us$2 a day with global unemployment rates of 5.7% and having a job doesnt guarantee the ability to escape from poverty in many places. this slow and uneven progress requires us to rethink and retool our economic and social policies aimed at eradicating poverty. a continued lack of decent work opportunities, insufficient investments and under consumption lead to an erosion of the basic social contract underlying democratic societies: that all must share in progress. even though the average annual growth rate of real gdp per capita worldwide is increasing year on year, there are still many countries in the developing world that are decelerating in their growth rates and moving farther from the 7% growth rate target set for 2030. as labor productivity decreases and unemployment rates rise, standards of living begin to decline due to lower wages. sustainable economic growth will require societies to create the conditions that allow people to have quality jobs that stimulate the economy while not harming the environment. job opportunities and decent working conditions are also required for the whole working age population. there needs to be increased access to financial services to manage incomes, accumulate assets and make productive investments. increased commitments to trade, banking and agriculture infrastructure will also help increase productivity and reduce unemployment levels in the worlds most impoverished regions."
137,"the global unemployment rate in 2017 was 5.6%, down from 6.4% in 2000. globally, 61% of all workers were engaged in informal employment in 2016. excluding the agricultural sector, 51% of all workers fell into this employment category. men earn 12.5% more than women in 40 out of 45 countries with data. the global gender pay gap stands at 23 per cent globally and without decisive action, it will take another 68 years to achieve equal pay. womens labour force participation rate is 63 per cent while that of men is 94 per cent. despite their increasing presence in public life, women continue to do 2.6 times the unpaid care and domestic work that men do. 470 million jobs are needed globally for new entrants to the labor market between 2016 and 2030. sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries. achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high value added and labour intensive sectors. promote development oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro, small and medium sized enterprises, including through access to financial services. "
138,"improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10 year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, with developed countries taking the lead. by 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value. by 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training. take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms. protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment. by 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products. strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance and financial services for all. increase aid for trade support for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, including through the enhanced integrated framework for trade related technical assistance to least developed countries. "
139,"by 2020, develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment and implement the global jobs pact of the international labour organization. decent work and economic growth: why it matters. in 2018, 20 per cent of the worlds youth were not engaged in either education, employment or training. whats the goal here? to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. why? sustained and inclusive economic growth can drive progress, create decent jobs for all and improve living standards. while real gdp per capita and labour productivity have increased globally, 731 million people remain below the us$1.90 poverty line. how many people are unemployed? the global unemployment rate has finally recovered from the global financial crisis of 2009. in 2018, it stood at 5 per cent, matching the pre crisis level. however, large disparities exist across regions and age groups. in 2018, the unemployment rates in northern africa and western asia and latin america and the caribbean were over 2.5 times higher than those in central and southern asia. are jobs enough? having a job does not guarantee a decent living. in fact, 8 per cent of employed workers and their families worldwide lived in extreme poverty in 2018. in addition to creating jobs, we also need to improve conditions for more than 700 million women and men who are working, but not earning enough to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. in addition, women and girls must enjoy equal access to equal opportunities with men and boys for employment. i have a job. why does this matter to me? society as a whole benefits when more people are being productive and contributing to their countrys growth. "
140,"productive employment and decent work are key elements to achieving fair globalization and poverty reduction. in addition, unemployment can lead to unrest and disrupt peace if it is left unaddressed. what does decent work mean? decent work means opportunities for everyone to get work that is productive and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration. it is also important that all women and men are given equal opportunities in the workplace. a continued lack of decent work opportunities, insufficient investments and under consumption lead to an erosion of the basic social contract underlying democratic societies: that all must share in progress. what can we do to fix these issues? providing youth the best opportunity to transition to a decent job calls for investing in education and training of the highest possible quality, providing youth with skills that match labour market demands, giving them access to social protection and basic services regardless of their contract type, as well as levelling the playing field so that all aspiring youth can attain productive employment regardless of their gender, income level or socio economic background. governments can work to build dynamic, sustainable, innovative and people centred economies, promoting youth employment and womens economic empowerment, in particular, and decent work for all. "
141,"local authorities and communities can renew and plan their cities and human settlements so as to foster community cohesion and personal security and to stimulate innovation and employment. inclusive and sustainable economic growth can drive progress and generate the means to implement the sustainable development goals. globally, labour productivity has increased and unemployment is back to pre financial crisis levels. however, the global economy is growing at a slower rate. more progress is needed to increase employment opportunities, particularly for young people, reduce informal employment and the gender pay gap and promote safe and secure working environments to create decent work for all. in 2017, the global growth rate of real gdp per capita was 1.9 per cent and is expected to remain at about 2 per cent from 2018 to 2020. this is significantly less than the 3 per cent rate attained in 2010 and slightly higher than the 2015 rate of 1.63 per cent. real gdp growth rate for least developed countries is expected to increase from 4.5 per cent in 2017 to 5.7 per cent in 2020, which is less than the 7 per cent envisioned by the 2030 agenda. since the global economic downturn of 2009, labour productivity (measured as gdp per employed person) has been increasing in the world, recording positive annual growth rates consistently since 2010. in 2018, the worlds labour productivity increased by 2.1 per cent, its highest annual growth since 2010. "
142,"informal employment, which has an impact on the adequacy of earnings, occupational safety and health and working conditions, remains pervasive: in three quarters of countries with data on the subject, more than half of all persons employed in non agriculture sectors are in informal employment. based on data for 62 countries, the median hourly gender pay gap stood at 12 per cent. the median gender pay gap exceeded 20 per cent in managerial and professional occupations, among workers in crafts and related trades and among plant machine operators and assemblers. the global unemployment rate has finally recovered from the global economic crisis. in 2018, the global unemployment rate stood at 5.0 per cent, matching pre crisis levels. youth were three times more likely to be unemployed than adults. in 2018, one fifth of the worlds youth were not in education, employment or training, meaning that they were neither gaining professional experience nor acquiring or developing skills through educational or vocational programmes in their prime years. there is a stark gender difference. young women were more than twice as likely as young men to be unemployed or outside the labour force and not in education or training. many workers around the world are exposed to undue risks in their workplaces. based on recent data from some 55 countries, a median of 3 deaths occurred per 100,000 employees and a median of 889 non fatal injuries occurred per 100,000 employees. access to finance is on the rise globally, but the mode of access seems to be changing with growing reliance on technology. "
143,"from 2010 to 2017, the number of automated teller machines (atms) per 100,000 adults grew by close to 50 per cent from 45 to 66 globally, and from 2.3 to 5.8 in the least developed countries. the number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults grew by only 2 per cent between 2010 and 2017, with more customers using digital banking solutions. in 2017, aid for trade commitments increased to $58 billion and more than doubled when compared to the 20022005 baseline, when they represented $23.1 billion. in absolute terms, the increase was highest in the agriculture sector ($1.7 billion), the industry sector ($1.0 billion) and in banking and financial services ($1.0 billion). globally, labour productivity has increased and the unemployment rate has decreased. however, more progress is needed to increase employment opportunities, especially for young people, reduce informal employment and labour market inequality (particularly in terms of the gender pay gap), promote safe and secure working environments, and improve access to financial services to ensure sustained and inclusive economic growth. in 2016, real gross domestic product (gdp) per capita grew at 1.3 per cent globally, less than the 1.7 per cent average growth rate recorded in 20102016. for ldcs, the rate fell sharply from 5.7 per cent in 20052009 to 2.3 per cent in 20102016. labour productivity at the global level, measured as output produced per employed person in constant 2005 us dollars, grew by 2.1 per cent in 2017. this is the fastest growth registered since 2010. "
144,"globally, 61 per cent of all workers were engaged in informal employment in 2016. excluding the agricultural sector, 51 per cent of all workers fell into this employment category. data from 45 countries suggest that gender inequality in earnings is still pervasive: in 89 per cent of these countries, the hourly wages of men are, on average, higher than those of women, with a median pay gap of 12.5 per cent. the global unemployment rate in 2017 was 5.6 per cent, down from 6.4 per cent in 2000. the decline has slowed since 2009, when it hit 5.9 per cent. youth are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults, with the global youth unemployment rate at 13 per cent in 2017. in high income countries, almost every adult has an account at a bank or other financial institution, compared to only 35 per cent of adults in low income countries. across all regions, women lag behind men in this regard. increasing labour productivity, reducing the unemployment rate, especially for young people, and improving access to financial services and benefits are essential components of sustained and inclusive economic growth. the average annual growth rate of real gdp per capita worldwide was 1.6 per cent from 2010 to 2015, compared to 0.9 per cent in 2005 2009. in the least developed countries, the per capita growth rate accelerated from 3.5 per cent in 2000 2004 to 4.6 per cent in 2005 2009, before slowing to 2.5 per cent in 2010 2015. "
145,"overall average annual gdp growth in the least developed countries followed a similar trend, decelerating from 7.1 per cent in 2005  2009 to 4.9 per cent in 2010 2015, below the sustainable development goals target of 7 per cent. labour productivity (annual growth rate of real gdp per worker) globally has slowed from an average annual rate of 2.9 per cent from 2000 to 2008 to 1.9 per cent from 2009 to 2016. the slowdown represents a negative development for the global economy, with adverse effects on living standards and real wages. the global unemployment rate stood at 5.7 per cent in 2016, with women more likely to be unemployed than men across all age groups. youth were almost three times as likely as adults to be unemployed, with unemployment rates of 12.8 per cent and 4.4 per cent, respectively, in 2016. moreover, in more than 76 per cent of countries with data, more than 1 in 10 youth are neither in the educational system nor working. young women are more likely than young men to fall into that category in almost 70 per cent of countries with data. while the number of children from 5 to 17 years of age who are working has declined from 246 million in 2000 to 168 million in 2012, child labour remains a serious concern. more than half of child labourers (85 million children) participate in hazardous work and 59 per cent of them work in the agricultural sector. "
146,"girls have made greater progress than boys, with the number of girls engaged in child labour declining by 40 per cent during the period 2000 2012, compared to a decline of 25 per cent for boys. access to financial services enables individuals and firms to manage changes in income, deal with fluctuating cash flows, accumulate assets and make productive investments. access to financial services through automated teller machines increased by 55 per cent worldwide from 2010 to 2015. commercial bank branches grew by 5 per cent during the same period, with the lower growth explained by increased digital access to financial services. globally, there were 60 automated teller machines and 17 commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults in 2015. from 2011 to 2014, 700 million adults became new account holders and the share of adults with an account at a financial institution increased from 51 per cent to 61 per cent. after contracting slightly in 2014, aid for trade rose 5.4 per cent in real terms to reach $53.9 billion in 2015 owing to a recovery in commitments for trade related infrastructure and further growth in support of banking and agriculture. aid for trade commitments to the least developed countries increased in 2015 by $4.3 billion, reaching $17.2 billion. the enhanced integrated framework, an aid for trade programme dedicated to those countries, started its second phase in 2016 and will run to 2022. donor commitments to the framework stood at $55.3 million in 2016, with $17.3 million already disbursed to the trust fund. "
147,"sustained and inclusive economic growth is necessary for achieving sustainable development. the global annual growth rate of real gdp per capita increased by 1.3 per cent in 2014, a significant slowdown compared to 2010 (2.8 per cent growth) and 2000 (3.0 per cent growth). developing regions grew far faster than developed regions, with average annual growth rates in 2014 of 3.1 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively. labour productivity (measured by gdp per worker) spurs economic growth. growth in labour productivity in developing regions far outpaced that of developed regions, especially in asia. between 2010 and 2015, labour productivity grew by 0.9 per cent per year, on average, in developed regions, while rising by 6.7 per cent per year, on average, in eastern asia, the region with the fastest growth. despite rapid growth in some developing regions, labour productivity remains far higher in the developed regions. in 2015, the average worker in developed regions produced 23 times the annual output of an average worker in sub saharan africa (which has the lowest labour productivity in developing regions), and 2.5 times that of an average worker in western asia (which has the highest labour productivity in developing regions). the global unemployment rate stood at 6.1 per cent in 2015, down from a peak of 6.6 per cent in 2009, mostly owing to a decline in unemployment in the developed regions. "
148,"unemployment affects population groups differently. globally, women and youth (aged 15 to 24) are more likely to face unemployment than men and adults aged 25 and over. in all regions, except eastern asia and the developed regions, the unemployment rate among women is higher than that of men. in almost all regions, the rate of youth unemployment is more than twice that of adults. although the number of children engaged in child labour declined globally by one third from 2000 to 2012 (from 246 million to 168 million), more than half of child labourers in 2012 (85 million) were engaged in hazardous forms of work. the incidence of child labour was highest in sub saharan africa, where 21 per cent of children were employed as child labourers. of all child labourers worldwide, 59 per cent were engaged in agricultural activities in 2012. while economic growth and employment are important for economic security, access to financial services is an essential component of inclusive growth. between 2011 and 2014, the proportion of the worlds adult population with an account at a financial institution or a mobile money service provider increased from 51 per cent to 62 per cent, meaning that 700 million adults became account holders during this period. financial exclusion disproportionately affected women and the poor. the proportion of women who are account holders is 9 percentage points lower than the proportion of men who are account holders. "
149,"moreover, the proportion of account holders among the poorest 40 per cent of households is 14 percentage points lower than among those living in the richest 60 per cent of households. in 2014, aid for trade assistance was $54.8 billion, an increase of almost 120 per cent over the period from 2002 to 2005. however, total commitments fell slightly (by $1 billion) in 2014 compared to 2013, driven mainly by a $4.7 billion drop in support for transport and storage. a total of 146 developing countries received aid for trade assistance in 2014, with lower middle income countries receiving 39.4 per cent of the total, the least developed countries receiving 26.3 per cent and upper middle income countries receiving 19 per cent. on a per capita basis, however, the least developed countries received $10 per capita, more than any other income group and more than twice the global average. sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries. annual growth rate of real gdp per capita. achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high value added and labour intensive sectors. annual growth rate of real gdp per employed person. promote development oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro , small  and medium sized enterprises, including through access to financial services. "
150,"proportion of informal employment in non agriculture employment, by sex. improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10 year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, with developed countries taking the lead. material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per gdp. domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per gdp. by 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value. average hourly earnings of female and male employees, by occupation, age and persons with disabilities. unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities. by 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training. proportion of youth (aged 15 24 years) not in education, employment or training. take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms. proportion and number of children aged 517 years engaged in child labour, by sex and age. protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment.

"
152,"world pensions council (wpc) development economists have argued that the twin considerations of long term economic growth and infrastructure investment were not prioritized enough. the fact they were designated as the number 8 and number 9 objective respectively was considered a rather ""mediocre ranking [which] defies common sense"". for the least developed countries, the economic target is to attain at least a 7 percent annual growth in gross domestic product (gdp). achieving higher productivity will require diversification and upgraded technology along with innovation, entrepreneurship, and the growth of small  and medium sized enterprises (smes). some targets are for 2030; others are for 2020. the target for 2020 is to reduce youth unemployment and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment. implementing the global jobs pact of the international labour organization is also mentioned. by 2030, the target is to establish policies for sustainable tourism that will create jobs. strengthening domestic financial institutions and increasing aid for trade support for developing countries is considered essential to economic development. the enhanced integrated framework for trade related technical assistance to least developed countries is mentioned as a method for achieving sustainable economic development. economic growth should be a positive force for the whole planet.this is why we must make sure that financial progress creates decent and fulfilling jobs while not harming the environment. we must protect labour rights and once and for all put a stop to modern slavery and child labour. if we promote job creation with expanded access to banking and financial services, we can make sure that everybody gets the benefits of entrepreneurship and innovation."
153,"goal 9: build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. investments in infrastructure, transport, irrigation, energy and information and communication technology, are crucial to achieving sustainable development and empowering communities in many countries. it has long been recognized that growth in productivity and incomes, and improvements in health and education outcomes require investment in infrastructure. manufacturing is an important driver of economic development and employment. at the current time, however, manufacturing value added per capita is only us$100 in the least developed countries compared to over us$4,500 in europe and northern america. another important factor to consider is the emission of carbon dioxide during manufacturing processes. emissions have decreased over the past decade in many countries but the pace of decline has not been even around the world. technological progress is the foundation of efforts to achieve environmental objectives, such as increased resource and energy efficiency. without technology and innovation, industrialization will not happen, and without industrialization, development will not happen. there needs to be more investments in high tech products that dominate the manufacturing productions to increase efficiency and a focus on mobile cellular services that increase connections between people. basic infrastructure like roads, information and communication technologies, sanitation, electrical power and water remains scarce in many developing countries. 16% of the global population does not have access to mobile broadband networks. for many african countries, particularly the lower income countries, the existent constraints regarding infrastructure affect firm productivity by around 40 per cent. the global share of manufacturing value added in gdp increased from 15.2% in 2005 to 16.3% in 2017, driven by the fast growth of manufacturing in asia. "
154,"industrializations job multiplication effect has a positive impact on society.  every job in manufacturing creates 2.2 jobs in other sectors. small and medium sized enterprises that engage in industrial processing and manufacturing are the most critical for the early stages of industrialization and are typically the largest job creators. they make up over 90 per cent of business worldwide and account for between 50 60 per cent of employment. least developed countries have immense potential for industrialization in food and beverages (agro industry), and textiles and garments, with good prospects for sustained employment generation and higher productivity. middle income countries can benefit from entering the basic and fabricated metals industries, which offer a range of products facing rapidly growing international demand. in developing countries, barely 30 per cent of agricultural production undergoes industrial processing. in high income countries, 98 per cent is processed. this suggests that there are great opportunities for developing countries in agribusiness. develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all. promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industrys share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries. increase the access of small scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing countries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and markets. by 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities. "
155,
156,"enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending. facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries through enhanced financial, technological and technical support to african countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states 18.  support domestic technology development, research and innovation in developing countries, including by ensuring a conducive policy environment for, inter alia, industrial diversification and value addition to commodities. significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the internet in least developed countries by 2020. 3.8 billion people do not have access to the internet representing 80 per cent of the population in the least developed countries. industry, innovation and infrastructure: why it matters. whats the goal here? to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. why? economic growth, social development and climate action are heavily dependent on investments in infrastructure, sustainable industrial development and technological progress. in the face of a rapidly changing global economic landscape and increasing inequalities, sustained growth must include industrialization that first of all, makes opportunities accessible to all people, and two, is supported by innovation and resilient infrastructure. so whats the problem? basic infrastructure like roads, information and communication technologies, sanitation, electrical power and water remains scarce in many developing countries.

157,"an estimated 3.8 billion people still do not have access to the internet, representing 80% of the population in the least developed countries. 3 billion people worldwide lack access to basic sanitation and 3 in 10 people lack access to safely managed drinking water. how much progress have we made? the growth of manufacturing in both developing and developed regions slowed in 2018, attributed largely to emerging trade and tariff barriers that constrain investment and future expansion.  the disparities in industrial productivity between rich and poor nations also remain stark. why should i care? inclusive and sustainable industrialization, together with innovation and infrastructure, can unleash dynamic and competitive economic forces that generate employment and income. they play a key role in introducing and promoting new technologies, facilitating international trade and enabling the efficient use of resources. the growth of new industries means improvement in the standard of living for many of us. also, if industries pursue sustainability, this approach will have a positive effect on the environment. climate change affects all us. what is the price of inaction? the price is steep. ending poverty would be more difficult, given the industrys role as a core driver of the global development agenda to eradicate poverty and advance sustainable development. additionally, failing to improve infrastructure and promote technological innovation could translate into poor health care, inadequate sanitation and limited access to education. how can we help? establish standards and promote regulations that ensure company projects and initiatives are sustainably managed. collaborate with ngos and the public sector to help promote sustainable growth within developing countries. "
158,"think about how industry impacts on your life and well being and use social media to push for policymakers to prioritize the sdgs. aspects of the prevailing global economic environment have not been conducive to rapid progress on sustainable development goal 9.  while financing for economic infrastructure has increased in developing countries and impressive progress has been made in mobile connectivity, countries that are lagging behind, such as least developed countries, face serious challenges in doubling the manufacturing industrys share of gdp by 2030, and investment in scientific research and innovation remains below the global average. efficient transportation services are key drivers of economic development, and more than 80 per cent of world merchandise trade by volume is transported by sea, making maritime transport a critical enabler of trade and globalization. international maritime freight increased by an estimated 3.7 per cent globally in 2017 and projected growth will test the capacity of existing maritime transport infrastructure to support increased freight volumes. in 2018, global manufacturing slowed in both developing and developed regions. the slowdown was attributed mainly to emerging trade and tariff barriers that constrained investment and future growth. despite this slowdown, the global share of gdp in terms of manufacturing value added increased marginally from 15.9 per cent in 2008 to 16.5 per cent in 2015, but stalled at the same level in 2018. the share of manufacturing in least developed countries remained low, posing a serious challenge to the target of doubling the industrys share of gdp by 2030. meanwhile, the share of manufacturing employment in total employment declined from 15.3 per cent in 2000 to 14.7 per cent in 2015 and to 14.2 per cent in 2018, as countries gradually reallocated production factors from agriculture and low value added manufacturing towards high value added manufacturing and services. "
159,"the intensity of global carbon dioxide (co2) emissions from manufacturing industries declined by more than 20 per cent between 2000 and 2016, to 0.30 kg co2 per united states dollar, showing a general decoupling of co2 emissions and gdp growth. the proportion of global gdp invested in research and development increased from 1.52 per cent to 1.68 per cent from 2000 to 2016, with europe and northern america standing at 2.21 per cent of gdp spent on research and development and most developing regions falling short of the world average in 2016. while there has been an increase in the number of researchers per million inhabitants from 804 in 2000 to 1,163 in 2016, that number reached only 91 in sub saharan africa. total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing countries reached $59 billion in 2017, an increase of 32.5 per cent in real terms since 2010. within this total, the main sectors assisted were transport ($21.6 billion) and banking and financial services ($13.4 billion). in 2016, medium high and high tech sectors accounted for 44.7 per cent of the global manufacturing value added. medium high and high tech products continued to dominate manufacturing production in northern america and europe, reaching 47.4 per cent in 2016 compared with 10.4 per cent in least developed countries. almost all people around the world now live within range of a mobile cellular network signal, with 90 per cent living within range of a 3g quality or higher network. this evolution of the mobile network, however, is growing more rapidly than the percentage of the population using the internet. steady progress has been made in the manufacturing industry. "
160, 
161,"to achieve inclusive and sustainable industrialization, competitive economic forces need to be unleashed to generate employment and income, facilitate international trade and enable the efficient use of resources. the global share of manufacturing value added in gdp increased from 15.2 per cent in 2005 to 16.3 per cent in 2017, driven by the fast growth of manufacturing in asia. globally, the carbon intensity decreased by 19 per cent from 2000 to 2015 from 0.38 to 0.31 kilograms of carbon dioxide per dollar of value added. in 2015, medium high  and high technology sectors accounted for 44.7 per cent of total manufacturing value added globally. the value added reached 34.6 per cent in developing economies, up from 21.5 per cent in 2005. by 2016, the proportion of the population covered by a third generation (3g) mobile broadband network stood at 61 per cent in the ldcs and 84 per cent globally. despite steady improvements in manufacturing output and employment, renewed investment will be needed in the least developed countries to build needed infrastructure and ensure the doubling of industrys share of gdp in those countries by 2030. efficient transportation services generate employment and wealth. in 2015, the estimated global economic impact (both direct and indirect) of air transport was $2.7 trillion, equivalent to 3.5 per cent of global gdp. the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states represent far less air travel and freight volumes, with each country group accounting for only 1 per cent to 2.7 per cent of the global total. manufacturing is a principal driver of economic development, employment and social stability. "
162,"globally, manufacturing value added as a share of gdp increased from 15.3 per cent in 2005 to 16.2 per cent in 2016. in 2016, manufacturing value added per capita amounted to $4,621 in europe and northern america, compared to about $100 in the least developed countries. as many countries move to more efficient and less energy intensive industries, their emissions of carbon dioxide per unit of manufacturing value added are generally declining. from 2000 to 2014, europe and northern america reduced their emissions intensity by 36 per cent. all of the 10 largest manufacturing countries saw decreases in their emissions intensity. such promising trends are not reflected in the global emissions intensity level, however, since a significant share of global manufacturing value added has moved to countries with generally higher intensity levels. in 2014, investments in research and development stood at 1.7 per cent of global gdp, up from 1.5 per cent in 2000. worldwide, there were 1,098 researchers per million inhabitants in 2014, ranging from 63 in the least developed countries to 3,500 in europe and northern america. oda for economic infrastructure in developing countries reached $57 billion in 2015, an increase of 32 per cent in real terms since 2010. the main recipient sectors were transport and energy ($19 billion each). manufacturing is increasingly shifting towards more technologically complex products. while medium  and high tech products continue to dominate manufacturing production in industrialized economies (where they contribute about 80 per cent of total manufacturing output), the share has barely reached 10 per cent in least developed countries. "
163,"mobile cellular services have spread rapidly and have allowed people living in previously unconnected areas to join the global information society. in 2016, 95 per cent of the worlds population and 85 per cent of people in the least developed countries were covered by a mobile cellular signal. goal 9 encompasses three important aspects of sustainable development: infrastructure, industrialization and innovation. infrastructure provides the basic physical systems and structures essential to the operation of a society or enterprise. industrialization drives economic growth, creates job opportunities and thereby reduces income poverty. innovation advances the technological capabilities of industrial sectors and prompts the development of new skills. an important component of physical infrastructure is air shipping and air travel. in 2014, 45 per cent of all air passengers originated from developing regions; 55 per cent originated from developed regions. however, in the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states, air passenger volume was extremely low, making up only 0.8 per cent, 0.8 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, of the global total. similar patterns are found for freight volumes in air transit: the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states made up only 1.1 per cent, 0.9 per cent and 2.6 per cent of the global total, respectively, in 2014. manufacturing is a foundation of economic development, employment and social stability. in 2015, the share of manufacturing value added in terms of gdp of developed regions was estimated at 13 per cent, a decrease over the past decade owing largely to the increasing role of services in developed regions. "
164,"in contrast, the share of manufacturing value added in gdp remained relatively stagnant for developing regions, increasing marginally from 19 per cent in 2005 to 21 per cent in 2015. those values hide substantial differences, with manufacturing value added contributing over 31 per cent to gdp in eastern asia and 10 per cent or less in both sub saharan africa and oceania. the least developed countries face particular challenges in industrializing. although those countries represent 13 per cent of the global population, they contribute less than 1 per cent of global manufacturing value added. worldwide, about 500 million people are employed in manufacturing. while manufacturing job numbers have fallen in industrialized countries, they have steadily increased in developing countries. in the least developed countries, agricultural and traditional sectors remain the main sources of employment. in developing countries, small scale industries accounted for an estimated 15 per cent to 20 per cent of value added and 25 per cent to 30 per cent of total industrial employment in 2015. however, access to financial services in those countries remains a problem. globally, the credit gap for small and medium enterprises (defined as having between 5 and 99 employees) was estimated at $3.2 trillion to $3.9 trillion in 2012. in emerging markets, between 45 per cent and 55 per cent of all small and medium enterprises are unserved or underserved by financial services. as the structure of world economies shifts to less energy intensive industries and countries implement policies for enhanced energy efficiency, almost all regions have shown a reduction in carbon intensity of gdp. "
165,"global carbon dioxide emissions per unit of value added showed a steady decline between 1990 and 2013, a decrease of about 30 per cent. innovation and the creation of new and more sustainable industries are spurred by investments in research and development. global expenditure on research and development as a proportion of gdp stood at 1.7 per cent in 2013. however, this figure masks wide disparities. expenditure on research and development was 2.4 per cent of gdp for developed regions, 1.2 per cent for developing regions, and below 0.3 per cent for the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries. the number of researchers per 1 million inhabitants showed a similar pattern. while the global average was 1,083 researchers per 1 million inhabitants, the ratio ranged from 65 per 1 million in the least developed countries to 3,641 per 1 million in developed regions. total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing regions reached $59.5 billion in 2014. the main sectors receiving assistance were transport and energy. infrastructure and economic development also rely on information and communications technology. mobile cellular services have spread rapidly around the world, allowing people in previously unconnected areas to join the global information society. by 2015, the percentage of the population living in areas covered by mobile broadband networks stood at 69 per cent globally. in rural areas, the share was only 29 per cent. develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all.

169,
170,"goal 10: reduce inequality within and among countries. the international community has made significant strides towards lifting people out of poverty. the most vulnerable nations the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island developing states continue to make inroads into poverty reduction. however, inequality persists and large disparities remain regarding access to health and education services and other assets. there is growing consensus that economic growth is not sufficient to reduce poverty if it is not inclusive and if it does not involve the three dimensions of sustainable development economic, social and environmental. fortunately, income inequality has been reduced both between and within countries. at the current time, the per capita income of 60 out of 94 countries with data has risen more rapidly than the national average. there has been some progress regarding creating favorable access conditions for exports from least developing countries as well. to reduce inequality, policies should be universal in principle, paying attention to the needs of disadvantaged and marginalized populations. there needs to be an increase in duty free treatment and continuation of favoring exports from developing countries, in addition to increasing the share of developing countries vote within the imf. finally, innovations in technology can help reduce the cost of transferring money for migrant workers. in 2016, over 64.4% of products exported by the least developed countries to world markets faced zero tariffs, an increase of 20% since 2010. "
171,"evidence from developing countries shows that children in the poorest 20 per cent of the populations are still up to three times more likely to die before their fifth birthday than children in the richest quintiles. social protection has been significantly extended globally, yet persons with disabilities are up to five times more likely than average to incur catastrophic health expenditures. despite overall declines in maternal mortality in most developing countries, women in rural areas are still up to three times more likely to die while giving birth than women living in urban centers. up to 30 per cent of income inequality is due to inequality within households, including between women and men. women are also more likely than men to live below 50 per cent of the median income. by 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average. by 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status. ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard. adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and progressively achieve greater equality. "
172,"improve the regulation and monitoring of global financial markets and institutions and strengthen the implementation of such regulations. ensure enhanced representation and voice for developing countries in decision making in global international economic and financial institutions in order to deliver more effective, credible, accountable and legitimate institutions. facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well managed migration policies. implement the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, in accordance with world trade organization agreements. encourage official development assistance and financial flows, including foreign direct investment, to states where the need is greatest, in particular least developed countries, african countries, small island developing states and landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their national plans and programmes. by 2030, reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent. reduced inequalities: why it matters. 16,000 children die each day from preventable diseases such as measles and tuberculosis. whats the goal here? to reduce inequalities within and among countries. why? inequalities based on income, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, race, class, ethnicity, religion and opportunity continue to persist across the world, within and among countries. inequality threatens long term social and economic development, harms poverty reduction and destroys peoples sense of fulfilment and self worth. this, in turn, can breed crime, disease and environmental degradation. "
173,"most importantly, we cannot achieve sustainable development and make the planet better for all if people are excluded from opportunities, services, and the chance for a better life. despite progress in some areas, income inequality continues to rise in many parts of the world. what are some examples of inequality? 16,000 children die each day from preventable diseases such as measles and tuberculosis. rural women are three times more likely to die while giving birth than women in urban centres. persons with disabilities are the worlds largest minority. 80 per cent of them live in developing countries. women and girls with disabilities face double discrimination. these are just a few examples, but it is an issue that affects every country in the world. why should i need to care about inequality if i dont face any discrimination? in todays world, we are all interconnected. problems and challenges, be they poverty, climate change, migration or economic crises are never just confined to one country or region. even the richest countries still have communities living in abject poverty. the oldest democracies still wrestle with racism, homophobia and transphobia, and religious intolerance. global inequality affects us all, no matter who we are or where we are from. can we actually achieve equality for everyone in this world? it can be and should be achieved to ensure a life of dignity for all. political, economic and social policies need to be universal and pay particular attention to the needs of disadvantaged and marginalized communities. "
174,"recent statistics have shown that this is possible. between 2010 and 2016, in 60 out of 94 countries with data, the incomes of the poorest 40 per cent of the population grew faster than those of the entire population. what can we do? reducing inequality requires transformative change. greater efforts are needed to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, and invest more in health, education, social protection and decent jobs especially for young people, migrants and other vulnerable communities. within countries, it is important to empower and promote inclusive social and economic growth. we can ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of income if we eliminate discriminatory laws, policies and practices. among countries, we need to ensure that developing countries are better represented in decision making on global issues so that solutions can be more effective, credible and accountable. governments and other stakeholders can also promote safe, regular and responsible migration, including through planned and well managed policies, for the millions of people who have left their homes seeking better lives due to war, discrimination, poverty, lack of opportunity and other drivers of migration. inequality within and among nations continues to be a significant concern despite progress in and efforts at narrowing disparities of opportunity, income and power. income inequality continues to rise in many parts of the world, even as the bottom 40 per cent of the population in many countries has experienced positive growth rates. greater emphasis will need to be placed on reducing inequalities in income as well as those based on other factors. "
175,
176,"additional efforts are needed to increase zero tariff access for exports from least developed countries and developing countries, and assistance to least developed countries and small island developing states. in more than half of the 92 countries with comparable data during the period 20112016, the bottom 40 per cent of the population experienced a growth rate that was higher than the overall national average. however, the bottom 40 per cent received less than 25 per cent of the overall income or consumption. in many places, the increasing share of income going to the top 1 per cent of earners is of significant concern. robust and sound financial systems are essential for supporting equal access to financial services. high loan asset impairment, measured by the ratio of non performing loans to total loans for deposit takers, is a potential risk to the soundness of the banking system. for almost half of the 138 reporting countries, the percentage of non performing loans to total loans was less than 5, while the average median for the period 20102017 was 4.3 per cent. while countries in developing regions represent over 70 per cent of the membership of the general assembly and world trade organization, which utilize a one member, one vote system, their voting share in other international organizations remains far below these levels. governance reforms are being negotiated at the international monetary fund, and changes were adopted at the world bank in october 2018. however, full implementation will leave developing countries with just over 40 per cent of the voting rights, still short of the 75 per cent they represent in world bank membership in terms of the number of countries. "
177,"duty free access continued to increase for least developed countries, small island developing states and developing regions at large. more than 50 per cent of exports from developing countries are now eligible for duty free treatment. the increase of duty free access in world markets was the largest for least developed countries, namely in the industrial and agricultural sector. in 2017, total receipts by developing countries from donors of the development assistance committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development, multilateral agencies and other key providers were $414 billion, of which $163 billion were oda. total oda to small island developing states from all donors was $4.3 billion in 2017, a decrease of 33 per cent in real terms over 2016, due to exceptional debt relief operations for cuba in 2016. efforts have been made in some countries to reduce income inequality, increase zero tariff access for exports from ldcs and developing countries, and provide additional assistance to ldcs and small island developing states (sids). however, progress will need to accelerate to reduce growing disparities within and among countries. between 2010 and 2016, in 60 out of 94 countries with data, the incomes of the poorest 40 per cent of the population grew faster than those of the entire population. in 2016, over 64.4 per cent of products exported by ldcs to world markets and 64.1 per cent of those from sids faced zero tariffs, an increase of 20 per cent since 2010. "
178,"developing countries overall had duty free market access for about 50 per cent of all products exported in 2016. in 2016, receipts by developing countries from member countries of the development assistance committee of the oecd, multilateral agencies and other key providers totalled $315 billion; of this amount, $158 billion was oda. in 2016, total oda to ldcs and sids from all donors totalled $43.1 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. based on provisional data, among the $613 billion in total remittances recorded in 2017, $466 billion went to low  and middle income countries. while the global average cost of sending money has gradually declined in recent years, it was estimated at 7.2 per cent in 2017, more than double the target transaction cost of 3 per cent. progress in reducing inequality within and among countries has been mixed. the voices of developing countries still need to be strengthened in decisio n making forums of international economic and financial institutions. moreover, while remittances can be a lifeline for families and communities of international migrant workers in their countries of origin, the high cost of transferring money continues to reduce such benefits. from 2008 to 2013, the per capita income or consumption of the poorest 40 per cent of the population improved more rapidly than the national average in 49 of 83 countries (accounting for three quarters of the worlds population) with data. the international monetary fund, through its recent quota reform, has increased the share of developing countries vote (defined as countries in developing regions, according to the m49 classification) to 37 per cent in 2016, up from 33 per cent in 2010. that increase is still short of the 74 per cent they represent in the membership. "
179,"while the world bank reforms of 2010 are still being implemented, that effort has not changed the 38 per cent share of voting rights at the international bank for reconstruction and development that developing countries have held since 2000. duty free treatment and favourable access conditions for exports from least developed and developing countries have expanded. from 2005 to 2015, the proportion of tariff lines globally with duty free treatment for products that originate in developing countries increased from 41 per cent to 50 per cent; for products that originate in the least developed countries, the proportion rose from 49 per cent to 65 per cent. the least developed countries and small island developing states continue to require additional assistance to ensure that they share in the benefits of sustainable development. in 2015, total resource flows to the least developed countries and small island developing states amounted to $48 billion and $6 billion, respectively. eight donor countries met the target of 0.15 per cent of gross national income (gni) for oda to the least developed countries. the benefits of remittance from international migrant workers are reduced somewhat by the generally high cost of transfer. on average, post offices and money transfer operators charge over 6 per cent of the amount remitted; commercial banks charge 11 per cent. both are significantly above the 3 per cent target. new and improved technologies, such as prepaid cards and mobile operators, result in lower fees for sending money home (between 2 per cent and 4 per cent), but are not yet widely available or used for many remittance corridors. "
180, 
181,"goal 10 calls for reducing inequalities in income as well as those based on age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status within a country. the goal also addresses inequalities among countries, including those related to representation, migration and development assistance. target 10.1 seeks to ensure that income growth among the poorest 40 per cent of the population in every country is more rapid than its national average. this was true in 56 of 94 countries with data available from 2007 to 2012. however, this does not necessarily imply greater prosperity, since nine of those countries experienced negative growth rates over that period. the labour share of gdp, which represents the proportion of wages and social protection transfers in an economy, provides an aggregate measure of primary income inequality. a shift of income away from labour towards capital has contributed to rising inequality. globally, the labour share of gdp decreased from 57 per cent in 2000 to 55 per cent in 2015, mainly owing to stagnating wages and a decline in employers social contributions in developed regions, while the trend was stable or slightly upward in developing regions. preferential treatment for developing countries and the least developed countries in trade can help reduce inequalities by creating more export opportunities. major developed country markets already offer duty free market access to the least developed countries on most of their tariff lines. but even when they do not, as in the case of some agricultural products, the average applied tariff rate is often close to zero per cent. "
182,"the share of exports from the least developed countries and developing regions that benefitted from duty free treatment increased from 2000 to 2014, reaching 79 per cent for developing countries and 84 per cent for the least developed countries. the comparative advantage of the least developed countries in duty free access varies depending on the product groups analysed. almost all agricultural products from the least developed countries (98 per cent) were exempt from duties by developed countries, versus 74 per cent of products from developing countries. shares of exports exempt from duties diverged even more for textiles and clothing: the rate for both product groups for the least developed countries was around 70 per cent, while for developing countries it was 41 per cent for textiles and 34 per cent for clothing. official development assistance and financial flows contribute to reducing inequalities within and among countries. in 2014, total resource flows for development to the least developed countries totalled $55.2 billion, and eight donor countries met the target of 0.15 per cent of gross national income (gni) for oda to the least developed countries. preliminary oda figures for 2015 show that bilateral net oda to the least developed countries increased by 4 per cent in real terms, compared to 2014. people migrate for many reasons, including better employment opportunities and higher wages. when successful, many migrants send money back to their country of origin to care of family members. remittances to developing countries have increased slightly, rising to $431.6 billion in 2015, up 0.4 per cent from 2014. "

187,"goal 11: make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. cities are hubs for ideas, commerce, culture, science, productivity, social development and much more. at their best, cities have enabled people to advance socially and economically. with the number of people living within cities projected to rise to 5 billion people by 2030, its important that efficient urban planning and management practices are in place to deal with the challenges brought by urbanization. many challenges exist to maintaining cities in a way that continues to create jobs and prosperity without straining land and resources. common urban challenges include congestion, lack of funds to provide basic services, a shortage of adequate housing, declining infrastructure and rising air pollution within cities. rapid urbanization challenges, such as the safe removal and management of solid waste within cities, can be overcome in ways that allow them to continue to thrive and grow, while improving resource use and reducing pollution and poverty. one such example is an increase in municipal waste collection. there needs to be a future in which cities provide opportunities for all, with access to basic services, energy, housing, transportation and more. half of humanity  3.5 billion people  lives in cities today and 5 billion people are projected to live in cities by 2030. 95 per cent of urban expansion in the next decades will take place in developing world. "
188,"883 million people live in slums today and most them are found in eastern and south eastern asia. the worlds cities occupy just 3 per cent of the earths land, but account for 60 80 per cent of energy consumption and 75 per cent of carbon emissions. rapid urbanization is exerting pressure on fresh water supplies, sewage, the living environment, and public health. as of 2016, 90% of urban dwellers have been breathing unsafe air, resulting in 4.2 million deaths due to ambient air pollution. more than half of the global urban population were exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times higher than the safety standard. by 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums. by 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons. by 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries. strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the worlds cultural and natural heritage. by 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations. "
189,"by 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management. by 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities. support positive economic, social and environmental links between urban, peri urban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning. by 2020, substantially increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilience to disasters, and develop and implement, in line with the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 2015 2030, holistic disaster risk management at all levels. support least developed countries, including through financial and technical assistance, in building sustainable and resilient buildings utilizing local materials. sustainable cities: why they matter. 60 per cent of the worlds population will live in cities by 2030. whats the goal here? to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable why? the world is becoming increasingly urbanized. since 2007, more than half the worlds population has been living in cities, and that share is projected to rise to 60 per cent by 2030. cities and metropolitan areas are powerhouses of economic growth, contributing about 60 per cent of global gdp. however, they also account for about 70 per cent of global carbon emissions and over 60 per cent of resource use. "
190,"what are some of the most pressing challenges that cities face today? inequality is a big concern. over 1 billion people live in slums and this number keeps rising. the levels of urban energy consumption and pollution are also worrying. cities occupy just 3 per cent of the earths land, but account for 60 80 per cent of energy consumption and 70 per cent of carbon emissions. many cities are also more vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters due to their high concentration of people and location so building urban resilience is crucial to avoid human, social and economic losses. i live in a city but im not affected by any of these issues. why should i care? all these issues will eventually affect every citizen. inequality can lead to unrest and insecurity, pollution deteriorates everyones health and affects workers productivity and therefore the economy, and natural disasters have the potential to disrupt everyones lifestyles. what happens if cities are just left to grow organically? the cost of poorly planned urbanization can be seen in some of the huge slums, tangled traffic, greenhouse gas emissions and sprawling suburbs all over the world. slums are a drag on gdp, and lower life expectancy. by choosing to act sustainably we choose to build cities where all citizens live a decent quality of life, and form a part of the citys productive dynamic, creating shared prosperity and social stability without harming the environment. "
191,
192,"is it expensive to put sustainable practices in place? the cost is minimal in comparison with the benefits. for example, there is a cost to creating a functional public transport network, but the benefits are huge in terms of economic activity, quality of life, the environment, and the overall success of a networked city. what can i do to help achieve this goal? take an active interest in the governance and management of your city. advocate for the kind of city you believe you need. develop a vision for your building, street, and neighbourhood, and act on that vision. are there enough jobs? can your children walk to school safely? can you walk with your family at night? how far is the nearest public transport? whats the air quality like? what are your shared public spaces like? the better the conditions you create in your community, the greater the effect on quality of life. substantial progress has been made in reducing the proportion of the global urban population living in slums, though more than 1 billion people continue to live in such situations. urgent action is needed to reverse the current situation, which sees the vast majority of urban residents breathing poor quality air and having limited access to transport and open public spaces. with the areas occupied by cities growing faster than their populations, there are profound repercussions for sustainability. "
193,"between 1990 and 2016, the proportion of the global urban population living in slums fell from 46 to 23 per cent. this progress was largely offset by internal population growth and rural urban migration. in 2016, just over 1 billion people lived in slums or informal settlements, with over half (589 million) living in east, south east, central and south asia. the proportion of urban residents who have convenient access to public transport (defined as living within 500 m walking distance of a bus stop and within 1,000 m of a railway and/or ferry terminal) remains low, particularly in developing countries. based on data from 227 cities from 78 countries in 2018, on average, 53 per cent of urban residents in all regions had convenient access to public transport, from a low of 18 per cent in sub saharan africa to a high of 75 per cent in australia and new zealand. in some regions that have low access to public transport, informal transport modes are highly prevalent and in many cases provide reliable transport for the majority of urban populations. globally, urban areas are expanding at a faster rate than their populations. between 2000 and 2014, areas occupied by cities grew 1.28 times faster than their populations. closely related to this trend is that the urban densities of cities have been declining, creating profound repercussions for environmental sustainability at the local, regional and global scale. better management of urban growth will be crucial in order to guarantee sustainable urbanization. "
194,"globally, 2 billion people do not have access to waste collection services and 3 billion people lack access to controlled waste disposal facilities. with increasing urban populations and the existence of consumer oriented economies amid rising income levels and rapid urbanization, it is estimated that the total waste generated in the world will double from nearly 2 billion tons in 2016 to about 4 billion tons by 2050. while from 2010 to 2018 the proportion of solid waste collected was about 81 per cent globally, in sub saharan africa it was only 52 per cent. in 2016, 9 in 10 people living in urban areas still breathed air that did not meet the world health organizations air quality guidelines value for particulate matter  that particulate matter 2.5 microns or less in size (pm2.5) not exceed an annual mean of 10 micrograms per m3 or a daily mean of 25 micrograms per m3  and more than half of the world population experienced an increase in pm2.5 from 2010 to 2016. most cities have struggled to ensure that their populations have convenient access to open public spaces (defined as spaces within 400 m walking distance of their residence). based on data from 220 cities in 77 countries in 2018, only 21 per cent of the population had convenient access to open public spaces. however, these results do not necessarily mean that there is an inadequate share of land dedicated to open public spaces in these cities, but rather that their distribution across urban areas is uneven. "
195,"national urban policies are policy strategies that specifically respond to the urbanization challenges of today. as of the beginning of 2019, 150 countries had developed such policies, and almost half are already implementing them. many cities around the world are facing acute challenges in managing rapid urbanization from ensuring adequate housing and infrastructure to support growing populations, to confronting the environmental impact of urban sprawl, to reducing vulnerability to disasters. between 2000 and 2014, the proportion of the global urban population living in slums dropped from 28.4 per cent to 22.8 per cent. however, the actual number of people living in slums increased from 807 million to 883 million. based on data collected for 214 cities/municipalities, about three quarters of municipal solid waste generated is collected. in 2016, 91 per cent of the urban population worldwide were breathing air that did not meet the world health organization air quality guidelines value for particulate matter (pm 2.5); more than half were exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times higher than that safety standard. in 2016, an estimated 4.2 million people died as a result of high levels of ambient air pollution. from 1990 to 2013, almost 90 per cent of deaths attributed to internationally reported disasters occurred in low  and middle income countries. reported damage to housing attributed to disasters shows a statistically significant rise from 1990 onwards. in recent decades, the world has experienced unprecedented urban growth. "
196,"in 2015, close to 4 billion people  54 per cent of the worlds population  lived in cities and that number is projected to increase to about 5 billion people by 2030. rapid urbanization has brought enormous challenges, including growing numbers of slum dwellers, increased air pollution, inadequate basic services and infrastructure, and unplanned urban sprawl, which also make cities more vulnerable to disasters. better urban planning and management are needed to make the worlds urban spaces more inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. as of may 2017, 149 countries were developing national level urban policies. the proportion of the urban population that lives in developing country slums fell from 39 per cent in 2000 to 30 per cent in 2014. despite some gains, the absolute number of urban residents who live in slums continued to grow, owing in part to accelerating urbanization, population growth and lack of appropriate land and housing policies. in 2014, an estimated 880 million urban residents lived in slum conditions, compared to 792 million urban residents in 2000. as more and more people move to urban areas, cities typically expand their geographic boundaries to accommodate new inhabitants. from 2000 to 2015, in all regions of the world, the expansion of urban land outpaced the growth of urban populations. as a result, cities are becoming less dense as they grow, with unplanned urban sprawl challenging more sustainable patterns of urban development. the safe removal and management of solid waste represents one of the most vital urban environmental services."
197,
198," uncollected solid waste blocks drains, causes flooding and may lead to the spread of water borne diseases. on the basis of data from cities in 101 countries from 2009 to 2013, 65 per cent of the urban population was served by municipal waste collection. air pollution is a major environmental health risk. in 2014, 9 of 10 people who live in cities were breathing air that did not comply with the safety standard set by who. more than half the worlds population lives in cities. by 2030, it is projected that 6 out of 10 people will be urban dwellers. despite numerous planning challenges, well managed cities and other human settlements can be incubators for innovation and ingenuity and key drivers of sustainable development. however, as more people migrate to cities in search of a better life and urban populations grow, housing issues intensify. already in 2014, 30 per cent of the urban population lived in slum like conditions; in sub saharan africa, the proportion was 55 per cent, the highest of any region. globally, more than 880 million people were living in slums in 2014. this estimate does not include people in inadequate or unaffordable housing (defined as costing more than 30 per cent of total monthly household income). as population growth outpaces available land, cities expand far beyond their formal administrative boundaries. this urban sprawl can be seen in many cities around the world, and not only"
199,"in developing regions. from 2000 to 2015, the ratio of the land consumption rate to the population growth rate in eastern asia and the oceania was the highest in the world, with developed regions second. other regions, such as south eastern asia and latin america and the caribbean, showed a decrease in that indicator over the same time period. unfortunately, a low value for this ratio is not necessarily an indication that urban dwellers are faring well, as this can indicate a prevalence of overcrowded slums. unplanned urban sprawl undermines other determinants of sustainable development. for example, for every 10 per cent increase in sprawl, there is a 5.7 per cent increase in per capita carbon dioxide emissions and a 9.6 per cent increase in per capita hazardous pollution. this illustrates the important interlinkages across the goals and targets. likewise, managing solid waste is often problematic in densely populated areas. in fact, in many developing regions, less than half of solid waste is safely disposed of. as per capita waste generation continues to rise, the collection and safe disposal of solid waste will continue to require serious attention. urban air pollution also challenged cities around the world, causing illness and millions of premature deaths annually. in 2014, around half the global urban population was exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times higher than maximum standards set by the world health organization. "
200,"the quest for sustainable and coordinated urban development starts with national policies and regional development plans. as of 2015, 142 countries had a national urban policy in place or under development. those countries are home to 75 per cent of the worlds urban population. by 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums. proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing. by 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons. proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport, by sex, age and persons with disabilities. by 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries. ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate. proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operate regularly and democratically. strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the worlds cultural and natural heritage. total expenditure (public and private) per capita spent on the preservation, protection and conservation of all cultural and natural heritage, by type of heritage (cultural, natural, mixed and world heritage centre designation), level of government (national, regional and local/municipal), type of expenditure (operating expenditure/investment) and type of private funding (donations in kind, private non profit sector and sponsorship). "
201,"by 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations. number of deaths, missing persons and persons affected by disaster per 100,000 peoplea. direct disaster economic loss in relation to global gdp, including disaster damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services. by 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management. proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and with adequate final discharge out of total urban solid waste generated, by cities. annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. pm2.5 and pm10) in cities (population weighted). by 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities. average share of the built up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities. proportion of persons victim of physical or sexual harassment, by sex, age, disability status and place of occurrence, in the previous 12 months. support positive economic, social and environmental links between urban, peri urban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning. proportion of population living in cities that implement urban and regional development plans integrating population projections and resource needs, by size of city. "
202,"by 2020, substantially increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilience to disasters, and develop and implement, in line with the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 2015 2030, holistic disaster risk management at all levels. proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 2015 2030a. number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. support least developed countries, including through financial and technical assistance, in building sustainable and resilient buildings utilizing local materials. proportion of financial support to the least developed countries that is allocated to the construction and retrofitting of sustainable, resilient and resource efficient buildings utilizing local materials. make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. the target for 2030 is to ensure access to safe and affordable housing. the indicator named to measure progress toward this target is the proportion of urban population living in slums or informal settlements. between 2000 and 2014, the proportion fell from 39 percent to 30 percent. however, the absolute number of people living in slums went from 792 million in 2000 to an estimated 880 million in 2014. movement from rural to urban areas has accelerated as the population has grown and better housing alternatives are available. the worlds population is constantly increasing.to accommodate everyone, we need to build modern, sustainable cities. for all of us to survive and prosper, we need new, intelligent urban planning that creates safe, affordable and resilient cities with green and culturally inspiring living conditions."
203,
204,"goal 12: ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. sustainable consumption and production is about promoting resource and energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and providing access to basic services, green and decent jobs and a better quality of life for all. its implementation helps to achieve overall development plans, reduce future economic, environmental and social costs, strengthen economic competitiveness and reduce poverty. at the current time, material consumption of natural resources is increasing, particularly within eastern asia. countries are also continuing to address challenges regarding air, water and soil pollution. since sustainable consumption and production aims at doing more and better with less, net welfare gains from economic activities can increase by reducing resource use, degradation and pollution along the whole life cycle, while increasing quality of life. there also needs to be significant focus on operating on supply chain, involving everyone from producer to final consumer. this includes educating consumers on sustainable consumption and lifestyles, providing them with adequate information through standards and labels and engaging in sustainable public procurement, among others. should the global population reach 9.6 billion by 2050, the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. with rises in the use of non metallic minerals within infrastructure and construction, there has been significant improvement in the material standard of living. "
205,"the per capita material footprint of developing countries increased from 5 metric tons in 2000 to 9 metric tons in 2017. 93% of the worlds 250 largest companies are now reporting on sustainability. water. less than 3 per cent of the worlds water is fresh (drinkable), of which 2.5 per cent is frozen in the antarctica, arctic and glaciers. humanity must therefore rely on 0.5 per cent for all of mans ecosystems and fresh water needs. humankind is polluting water in rivers and lakes faster than nature can recycle and purify. more than 1 billion people still do not have access to fresh water. excessive use of water contributes to the global water stress. water is free from nature but the infrastructure needed to deliver it is expensive. energy. if people worldwide switched to energy efficient lightbulbs, the world would save us$120 billion annually. despite technological advances that have promoted energy efficiency gains, energy use in oecd countries will continue to grow another 35 per cent by 2020. commercial and residential energy use is the second most rapidly growing area of global energy use after transport. in 2002 the motor vehicle stock in oecd countries was 550 million vehicles (75 per cent of which were personal cars). a 32 per cent increase in vehicle ownership is expected by 2020. at the same time, motor vehicle kilometers are projected to increase by 40 per cent and global air travel is projected to triple in the same period. "
206,"households consume 29 per cent of global energy and consequently contribute to 21 per cent of resultant co2 emissions. the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption has reached 17.5% in 2015. food. while substantial environmental impacts from food occur in the production phase (agriculture, food processing), households influence these impacts through their dietary choices and habits. this consequently affects the environment through food related energy consumption and waste generation. each year, an estimated 1/3 of all food produced  equivalent to 1.3 billion tons worth around $1 trillion  ends up rotting in the bins of consumers and retailers, or spoiling due to poor transportation and harvesting practices. 2 billion people globally are overweight or obese. land degradation, declining soil fertility, unsustainable water use, overfishing and marine environment degradation are all lessening the ability of the natural resource base to supply food. the food sector accounts for around 30 per cent of the worlds total energy consumption and accounts for around 22 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions. implement the 10 year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries. by 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. by 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post harvest losses. "
207,
208,"by 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment. by 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse. encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle. promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities. by 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature. support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production. develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products. rationalize inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities. responsible consumption & production: why it matters. "
209,"if the global population reaches 9.6 billion by 2050, the equivalent of almost three planets will be required to sustain current lifestyles. what is the goal here? to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. why? economic and social progress over the last century has been accompanied by environmental degradation that is endangering the very systems on which our future development and very survival depend.  if we dont act to change our consumption and production patterns, we will cause irreversible damage to our environment. what are some of the current consumption and production patterns that need to change? there are many aspects of consumption that with simple changes can have a big impact on society as a whole. for example, about one third of the food produced for human consumption each year is lost or wasted. when it comes to consumers, households consume 29 per cent of global energy and contribute to 21 per cent of resultant co2 emissions. water pollution is also a pressing issue that needs a sustainable solution. we are polluting water faster than nature can recycle and purify water in rivers and lakes. urgent action is needed to ensure that current material needs do not lead to over extraction of resources and further degradation of the environment. how can i help as a business? its in businesses interest to find new solutions that enable sustainable consumption and production patterns. a better understanding of environmental and social impacts of products and services is needed, both of product life cycles and how these are affected by use within lifestyles."
210,"identifying hot spots within the value chain where interventions have the greatest potential to improve the environmental and social impact of the system as a whole is a crucial first step. businesses can also use their innovative power to design solutions that can both enable and inspire individuals to lead more sustainable lifestyles, reducing impacts and improving wellbeing. how can i help as a consumer? there are two main ways to help: reducing your waste and being thoughtful about what you buy and choosing a sustainable option whenever possible. reducing our waste can be done in many ways, from ensuring you dont throw away food to reducing your consumption of plasticone of the main pollutants of the ocean. carrying a reusable bag, refusing to use plastic straws, and recycling plastic bottles are good ways to do your part every day. making informed purchases about what were buying also helps. for example, the textile industry today is the second largest polluter of clean water after agriculture, and many fashion companies exploit textile workers in the developing world. if you can buy from sustainable and local sources you can make a difference as well as exercising pressure on businesses to adopt sustainable practices. worldwide material consumption has expanded rapidly, as has material footprint per capita, seriously jeopardizing the achievement of sustainable development goal 12 and the goals more broadly."
211,"urgent action is needed to ensure that current material needs do not lead to the overextraction of resources or to the degradation of environmental resources, and should include policies that improve resource efficiency, reduce waste and mainstream sustainability practices across all sectors of the economy. in 2017, worldwide material consumption reached 92.1 billion tons, up from 87 billion in 2015 and a 254 per cent increase from 27 billion in 1970, with the rate of extraction accelerating every year since 2000. this reflects the increased demand for natural resources that has defined the past decades, resulting in undue burden on environmental resources. without urgent and concerted political action, it is projected that global resource extraction could grow to 190 billion tons by 2060. material footprint per capita has increased considerably as well: in 1990 some 8.1 tons of natural resources were used to satisfy a persons need, while in 2015, almost 12 tons of resources were extracted per person. well designed national policy frameworks and instruments are necessary to enable the fundamental shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. in 2018, 71 countries and the european union reported on a total of 303 policy instruments. parties to the montreal protocol and the basel, rotterdam and stockholm conventions are required to transmit information on the implementation of their obligations under those agreements. however, the rate of transmission varies, with the average compliance rate across these four agreements at approximately 70 per cent. "
212,
213,"decoupling economic growth from resource use is one of the most critical and complex challenges facing humanity today. doing so effectively will require policies that create a conducive environment for such change, social and physical infrastructure and markets, and a profound transformation of business practices along global value chains. the per capita material footprint of developing countries grew from 5 metric tons in 2000 to 9 metric tons in 2017, representing a significant improvement in the material standard of living. most of the increase is attributed to a rise in the use of non metallic minerals, pointing to growth in the areas of infrastructure and construction. for all types of materials, developed countries have at least double the per capita footprint of developing countries. in particular, the material footprint for fossil fuels is more than four times higher for developed than developing countries. by 2018, a total of 108 countries had national policies and initiatives relevant to sustainable consumption and production. according to a recent report from kpmg, 93 per cent of the worlds 250 largest companies (in terms of revenue) are now reporting on sustainability, as are three quarters of the top 100 companies in 49 countries. achieving goal 12 requires a strong national framework for sustainable consumption and production that is integrated into national and sectoral plans, sustainable business practices and consumer behaviour, together with adherence to international norms on the management of hazardous chemicals and wastes.

214,"decoupling economic growth from natural resource use is fundamental to sustainable development. global figures, however, point to worsening trends: domestic material consumption (the total amount of natural resour ces used in economic processes) increased from 1.2 kg to 1.3 kg per unit of gdp from 2000 to 2010. total domestic material consumption also rose during the same period  from 48.7 billion tons to 71.0 billion tons. the increase is due in part to rising natural resource use worldwide, in particular in eastern asia. countries continue to address challenges linked to air, soil and water pollution and exposure to toxic chemicals under the auspices of multilateral environmental agreements. almost all states members of the united nations are party to at least one of those conventions. under the conventions obligations, countries are requested to regularly report data and information related to hazardous wastes, persistent organic pollutants and ozone depleting substances. however, from 2010 to 2014, only 57 per cent of the parties to the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal, 71 per cent of the parties to the rotterdam convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade and 51 per cent of the parties to the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants provided the requested data and information. all parties reported to the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer. economic growth and development require the production of goods and services that improve the quality of life. "
215,"sustainable growth and development require minimizing the natural resources and toxic materials used, and the waste and pollutants generated, throughout the entire production and consumption process. two measures, material footprint and domestic material consumption, provide an accounting of global material extraction and use, as well as flows or consumption of materials in countries. the material footprint reflects the amount of primary materials required to meet a countrys needs. it is an indicator of the material standard of living or level of capitalization of an economy. domestic material consumption measures the amount of natural resources used in economic processes. in 2010, the total material footprint in developed regions was significantly higher than that of developing regions, 23.6 kg per unit of gdp versus 14.5 kg per unit of gdp, respectively. the material footprint of developing regions increased from 2000 to 2010, with non metallic minerals showing the largest increase. domestic material consumption in developed regions has diminished slightly, from 17.5 tonnes per capita in 2000 to 15.3 tonnes per capita in 2010. it remains significantly higher than the value for developing regions, which stood at 8.9 tonnes per capita in 2010. domestic material consumption per capita increased in almost all developing regions from 2000 to 2010, except in africa, where it remained relatively stable (around 4 tonnes per capita), and oceania, where it decreased from around 10.7 to 7.7 tonnes per capita. the rise in domestic material consumption per capita in asia during that period is primarily a result of rapid industrialization. "
216,"the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal, the rotterdam convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade and the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants established international frameworks to achieve the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes, chemicals and persistent organic pollutants. with six exceptions, all member states are party to at least one of those conventions. the number of parties to those conventions rose significantly from 2005 to 2015, particularly in africa and oceania. there are now 183 parties to the basel convention, 180 to the stockholm convention and 155 to the rotterdam convention. implement the 10 year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries. number of countries with sustainable consumption and production (scp) national action plans or scp mainstreamed as a priority or a target into national policies. by 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per gdp. domestic material consumption, domestic material consumption per capita, and domestic material consumption per gdp. by 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post harvest losses. global food loss index. "
217,
218,"by 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment. number of parties to international multilateral environmental agreements on hazardous waste, and other chemicals that meet their commitments and obligations in transmitting information as required by each relevant agreement. hazardous waste generated per capita and proportion of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment. by 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse. national recycling rate, tons of material recycled. encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle. number of companies publishing sustainability reports. promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities. number of countries implementing sustainable public procurement policies and action plans. by 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature. extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development (including climate change education) are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education; and (d) student assessment. support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production. amount of support to developing countries on research and development for sustainable consumption and production and environmentally sound technologies. develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products. "
219,"number of sustainable tourism strategies or policies and implemented action plans with agreed monitoring and evaluation tools. rationalize inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities. amount of fossil fuel subsidies per unit of gdp (production and consumption) and as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels. ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. the targets of goal 12 include using eco friendly production methods and reducing the amount of waste. by 2030, national recycling rates should increase, as measured in tons of material recycled. further, companies should adopt sustainable practices and publish sustainability reports. target 12.1 calls for the implementation of the 10 year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production. this framework, adopted by member states at the united nations conference on sustainable development, is a global commitment to accelerate the shift to sustainable consumption and production in developed and developing countries. in order to generate the collective impact necessary for such a shift, programs such as the one planet network have formed different implementation methods to help achieve goal 12. our planet has provided us with an abundance of natural resources.but we have not utilized them responsibly and currently consume far beyond what our planet can provide. we must learn how to use and produce in sustainable ways that will reverse the harm that we have inflicted on the planet."
220,
221,"goal 13: take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. climate change is now affecting every country on every continent. it is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. without action, the worlds average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century. the poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most. affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. the pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts. climate change, however, is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. it is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level to help developing countries move toward a low carbon economy. to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, countries adopted the paris agreement at the cop21 in paris, which went into force in november of 2016. in the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade. "
222,"as of april 2018, 175 parties had ratified the paris agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change. limiting global warming to 1.5c would require rapid, far reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society, the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) said in a new assessment. with clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems, limiting global warming to 1.5c compared to 2c could go hand in hand with ensuring a more sustainable and equitable society. as of april 2018, 175 parties had ratified the paris agreement and 168 parties had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the un framework convention on climate change secretariat. as of april 2018, 10 developing countries had successfully completed and submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change. developed country parties continue to make progress towards the goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020 for mitigation actions. thanks to the intergovernmental panel on climate change we know: from 1880 to 2012, average global temperature increased by 0.85c. to put this into perspective, for each 1 degree of temperature increase, grain yields decline by about 5 per cent. maize, wheat and other major crops have experienced significant yield reductions at the global level of 40 megatons per year between 1981 and 2002 due to a warmer climate. oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished and sea level has risen.from 1901 to 2010, the global average sea level rose by 19 cm as oceans expanded due to warming and ice melted. "
223,"the arctics sea ice extent has shrunk in every successive decade since 1979, with 1.07 million km of ice loss every decade. given current concentrations and on going emissions of greenhouse gases, it is likely that by the end of this century, the increase in global temperature will exceed 1.5c compared to 1850 to 1900 for all but one scenario. the worlds oceans will warm and ice melt will continue. average sea level rise is predicted as 24  30cm by 2065 and 40 63cm by 2100. most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries even if emissions are stopped. global emissions of carbon dioxide (co2) have increased by almost 50 per cent since 1990. emissions grew more quickly between 2000 and 2010 than in each of the three previous decades. it is still possible, using a wide array of technological measures and changes in behavior, to limit the increase in global mean temperature to two degrees celsius above pre industrial levels. major institutional and technological change will give a better than even chance that global warming will not exceed this threshold. strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate related hazards and natural disasters in all countries. integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning. improve education, awareness raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning. "
224,"implement the commitment undertaken by developed country parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the green climate fund through its capitalization as soon as possible. promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing states, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities. climate action: why it matters. to limit global warming to 1.5c, global carbon emissions need to fall by a staggering 45 per cent by 2030 from 2010 levels. whats the goal here? taking urgent action to tackle climate change and its impacts. why? as greenhouse gas levels continue to climb, climate change is occurring at much higher rates than anticipated, and its effects are evident worldwide. by addressing climate change, we can build a sustainable world for everyone. but we need to act now. are peoples lives really being affected by climate change? yes. severe weather and rising sea levels are affecting people and their property in developed and developing countries. from a small farmer in the philippines to a businessman in london, climate change is affecting everyone, especially the poor and vulnerable, as well as marginalized groups like women, children, and the elderly. "
225,"what happens if we dont take action? if left unchecked, climate change will cause average global temperatures to increase beyond 3c, and will adversely affect every ecosystem. already, we are seeing how climate change can exacerbate storms and disasters, and threats such as food and water scarcity, which can lead to conflict. doing nothing will end up costing us a lot more than if we take action now. we have an opportunity to take actions that will lead to more jobs, great prosperity, and better lives for all while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building climate resilience. can we solve this problem or is it too late to act? to address climate change, we have to vastly increase our efforts. much is happening around the world, investments in renewable energy have soared. but so much more needs to be done. the world must transform its energy, industry, transport, food, agriculture and forestry systems to ensure that we can limit global temperature rise to well below 2c, maybe even 1.5c. in december 2015, the world took a significant first step by adopting the paris agreement, in which all countries committed to take action to address climate change. many businesses and investors are also committing themselves to lower their emissions, not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it makes economic and business sense as well. "
226,"how much would it cost to solve this problem? in total, public and private sector investment in clean energy needs to reach at least us$1 trillion per year by 2030, and more to build climate resilience. this sounds like a lot, but consider that of the us$1.7 trillion invested in the global energy supply in 2016, nearly 70% was related to fossil fuels. but more and more, governments and businesses are finding that investments in renewable energy and sustainability are paying off. whats more is that the estimated costs of mitigation do not account for the benefits of reduced climate change. these include cleaner air, greater food security, more liveable cities, and better health. investments of only $6 billion for disaster risk reduction over the next 15 years would result in total benefits of $360 billion in terms of avoided losses over the lifetime of the investment. with rising greenhouse gas emissions, climate change is occurring at rates much faster than anticipated and its effects are clearly felt worldwide. while there are positive steps in terms of the climate finance flows and the development of nationally determined contributions, far more ambitious plans and accelerated action are needed on mitigation and adaptation. access to finance and strengthened capacities need to be scaled up at a much faster rate, particularly for least developed countries and small island developing states. increasing greenhouse gas emissions are driving climate change. "
227,"in 2017, greenhouse gas concentrations reached new highs, with globally averaged mole fractions of co2 at 405.5 parts per million (ppm), up from 400.1 ppm in 2015, and at 146 per cent of pre industrial levels. moving towards 2030 emission objectives compatible with the 2c and 1.5c pathways requires a peak to be achieved as soon as possible, followed by rapid reductions. as indicated under sustainable development goal 1 (see para. 22 above), during the period 19982017, direct economic losses from disasters were estimated at almost $3 trillion. climate related and geophysical disasters claimed an estimated 1.3 million lives. as of april 2019, 185 parties had ratified the paris agreement. parties to the paris agreement are expected to prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions, and 183 parties had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the secretariat of the united nations framework convention on climate change, while 1 party had communicated its second. under the agreement, all parties are required to submit new nationally determined contributions, containing revised and much more ambitious targets, by 2020. global climate finance flows increased by 17 per cent in the period 20152016 compared with the period 20132014. as at 20 may 2019, 28 countries had accessed green climate fund grant financing for the formulation of national adaptation plans and other adaptation planning processes, with a value of $75 million. of these, 67 per cent were for least developed countries, small island developing states and african states. "
228,"proposals from an additional seven countries, with a value of $17 million, are in the final stage of approval. in total, 75 countries are seeking support from the green climate fund for national adaptation plans and other adaptation planning processes, with a combined value of $191 million. the year 2017 was one of the three warmest on record and was 1.1 degrees celsius above the pre industrial period. an analysis by the world meteorological organization shows that the five year average global temperature from 2013 to 2017 was also the highest on record. the world continues to experience rising sea levels, extreme weather conditions (the north atlantic hurricane season was the costliest ever recorded) and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. this calls for urgent and accelerated action by countries as they implement their commitments to the paris agreement on climate change. as of 9 april 2018, 175 parties had ratified the paris agreement and 168 parties (167 countries plus the european commission) had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the united nations framework convention on climate change secretariat. in addition, as of 9 april 2018, 10 developing countries had successfully completed and submitted the first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change. developed country parties continue to make progress towards the goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions. "
229,
230,"planetary warming continued in 2016, setting a new record of about 1.1 degrees centigrade above the preindustrial period, according to the world meteorological organization (wmo) statement on the state of the global climate in 2016. drought conditions predominated across much of the globe, aggravated by the el nio phenomenon in the statement, wmo also noted that the extent of global sea ice fell to a minimum of 4.14 million km2 in 2016, the second lowest extent on record. atmospheric carbon dioxide levels also reached a record high of 400 parts per million that year. mitigating climate change and its impacts will require building on the momentum achieved by the paris agreement on climate change, which entered into force on 4 november 2016. stronger efforts are needed to build resilience and limit climate related hazards and natural disasters. parties to the paris agreement are expected to prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions. the nationally determined contributions reflect official country responses to climate change and contributions to global climate action. as of 20 april 2017, 143 parties ratified the paris agreement, of which 137 parties (136 countries and the european commission) communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the secretariat of the united nations framework convention on climate change. as of 20 april 2017, seven developing countries successfully completed and submitted the first iteration of their national adaptation plans, in response to climate change. "
231,"developed countries have committed to jointly mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020 to address the climate related needs of developing countries and to continue that level of support through 2025. initial efforts to mobilize resources for the green climate fund raised $10.3 billion and developed   country parties are strongly urged to scale up their financial support. the number of deaths attributed to natural disasters continues to rise, despite progress in implementing disaster risk reduction strategies. from 1990 to 2015, more than 1.6 million people died in internationally reported natural disasters. many countries have begun implementing national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. in 2014 2015, most reporting countries indicated that environmental impact assessments, legislation on protected areas, climate change adaptation projects and programmes, and integrated planning played a major role in reducing underlying risk factors. climate change presents the single biggest threat to development, and its widespread, unprecedented impacts disproportionately burden the poorest and most vulnerable. urgent action to combat climate change and minimize its disruptions is integral to the successful implementation of the sustainable development goals. the global nature of climate change calls for broad international cooperation in building resilience and adaptive capacity to its adverse effects, developing sustainable low carbon pathways to the future, and accelerating the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. on 22 april 2016, 175 member states signed the paris agreement under the united nations framework convention on climate change. "
232,"the new agreement aims to reduce the pace of climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future. climate change often exacerbates disasters. between 1990 and 2013, more than 1.6 million people died in internationally reported disasters, with annual deaths trending upwards. as a result, more countries are acting on the imperative to implement national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. in 2015, 83 countries had legislative and/or regulatory provisions in place for managing disaster risk. parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change are responsible for providing a range of national reports on their efforts to implement the agreement. as of 4 april 2016, 161 intended nationally determined contributions, from 189 of the 197 parties to the framework convention (the european commission submitted one joint intended determined contribution) had been recorded by the secretariat of the framework convention, providing insights into the efforts many countries are taking to integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning. among those countries, 137 parties included an adaptation component in their intended nationally determined contributions. some countries stressed that adaptation was their main climate change priority, with strong linkages to other aspects of national development, sustainability and security. in order to help countries move forward on climate action, a global stocktaking was established, in the context of the paris agreement, to assess collective progress every five years. the process will begin in 2018, with a facilitative dialogue to review the efforts of parties towards emissions reductions and to inform the preparation of final nationally determined contributions. "
233,"as parties scale up climate change action, enhanced cooperation, capacity building and access to financial and technical support will be needed to help many countries realize their priorities, including those identified in intended nationally determined contributions and national adaptation plans. developed countries have committed to mobilizing, by 2020, $100 billion a year in climate financing from a wide variety of sources to help address the needs of developing countries. by 2025, parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change will set a new collective goal of at least $100 billion per year. the green climate fund, a mechanism within the framework convention created to assist developing countries in adaptation and mitigation practices, is an important delivery vehicle for this financing. as of may 2016, the green climate fund had mobilized $10.3 billion. climate change is already affecting the most vulnerable countries and populations, in particular the least developed countries and the small island developing states. the preparation of national adaptation programmes of action under the united nations framework convention on climate change is helping the least developed countries address urgent and immediate needs, with support from the least developed countries fund and the least developed countries expert group.  in addition, the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action will help the least developed countries prepare and seek funding for comprehensive national adaptation plans, thereby reducing their risk of being left behind. strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate related hazards and natural disasters in all countries. proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies. "
234,"number of deaths, missing persons and persons affected by disaster per 100,000 people. number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning. number of countries that have communicated the establishment or operationalization of an integrated policy/strategy/plan which increases their ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change, and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development in a manner that does not threaten food production (including a national adaptation plan, nationally determined contribution, national communication, biennial update report or other). improve education, awareness raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning. number of countries that have integrated mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning into primary, secondary and tertiary curricula. number of countries that have communicated the strengthening of institutional, systemic and individual capacity building to implement adaptation, mitigation and technology transfer, and development actions. implement the commitment undertaken by developed country parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the green climate fund through its capitalization as soon as possible. mobilized amount of united states dollars per year starting in 2020 accountable towards the $100 billion commitment. "
235,"promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing states, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities. number of least developed countries and small island developing states that are receiving specialized support, and amount of support, including finance, technology and capacity building, for mechanisms for raising capacities for effective climate change related planning and management, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities. take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts by regulating emissions and promoting developments in renewable energy. the un discussions and negotiations identified the links between the post 2015 sdg process and the financing for development process that concluded in addis ababa in july 2015 and the cop 21 climate change conference in paris in december 2015. in may 2015, a report concluded that only a very ambitious climate deal in paris in 2015 could enable countries to reach the sustainable development goals and targets. the report also states that tackling climate change will only be possible if the sdgs are met. further, economic development and climate change are inextricably linked, particularly around poverty, gender equality, and energy. the un encourages the public sector to take initiative in this effort to minimize negative impacts on the environment. this renewed emphasis on climate change mitigation was made possible by the partial sino american convergence that developed in 2015 2016, notably at the un cop21 summit (paris) and ensuing g20 conference (hangzhou). "
236,"at a 2017 un press briefing, global ceo alliance (gceoa) chairman james donovan described the asia pacific region, which is a region particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, as needing more public private partnerships (ppps) to successfully implement its sustainable development initiatives. in 2018, the international panel of climate change (ipcc), the united nations body for assessing the science related to climate change, published a special report global warming of 1.5c. it outlined the impacts of a 1.5 c global temperature rise above pre industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, and highlighted the possibility of avoiding a number of such impacts by limiting global warming to 1.5 c compared to 2 c, or more. the report mentioned that this would require global net human caused emissions of carbon dioxide (co2) to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net  zero around 2050, through rapid and far reaching transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities. this special report was subsequently discussed at cop 24. despite being requested by countries at the cop 21, the report was not accepted by four countries  the us, saudi arabia, russia and kuwait, which only wanted to note it, thereby postponing the resolution to the next sbsta session in 2019. climate change is a real and undeniable threat to our entire civilization.the effects are already visible and will be catastrophic unless we act now. through education, innovation and adherence to our climate commitments, we can make the necessary changes to protect the planet. these changes also provide huge opportunities to modernize our infrastructure which will create new jobs and promote greater prosperity across the globe."
237,
238,"goal 14: conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources. the worlds oceans  their temperature, chemistry, currents and life  drive global systems that make the earth habitable for humankind. our rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate, coastlines, much of our food, and even the oxygen in the air we breathe, are all ultimately provided and regulated by the sea. throughout history, oceans and seas have been vital conduits for trade and transportation. careful management of this essential global resource is a key feature of a sustainable future. however, at the current time, there is a continuous deterioration of coastal waters owing to pollution and ocean acidification is having an adversarial effect on the functioning of ecosystems and biodiversity. this is also negatively impacting small scale fisheries. marine protected areas need to be effectively managed and well resourced and regulations need to be put in place to reduce overfishing, marine pollution and ocean acidification. oceans cover three quarters of the earths surface, contain 97 per cent of the earths water, and represent 99 per cent of the living space on the planet by volume. over three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. globally, the market value of marine and coastal resources and industries is estimated at $3 trillion per year or about 5 per cent of global gdp. oceans contain nearly 200,000 identified species, but actual numbers may lie in the millions. oceans absorb about 30 per cent of carbon dioxide produced by humans, buffering the impacts of global warming. "
239,"oceans serve as the worlds largest source of protein, with more than 3 billion people depending on the oceans as their primary source of protein. marine fisheries directly or indirectly employ over 200 million people. subsidies for fishing are contributing to the rapid depletion of many fish species and are preventing efforts to save and restore global fisheries and related jobs, causing ocean fisheries to generate us$50 billion less per year than they could. open ocean sites show current levels of acidity have increased by 26 per cent since the start of the industrial revolution. coastal waters are deteriorating due to pollution and eutrophication. without concerted efforts, coastal eutrophication is expected to increase in 20 percent of large marine ecosystems by 2050. by 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution. by 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans. minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels. by 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics. "
240,"by 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information. by 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the world trade organization fisheries subsidies negotiation. by 2030, increase the economic benefits to small island developing states and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism. increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account the intergovernmental oceanographic commission criteria and guidelines on the transfer of marine technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing states and least developed countries. provide access for small scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets. enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in unclos, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of the future we want. life below water: why it matters. over 3 billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihood. "
241,"whats the goal here? to conserve and sustainably use the worlds oceans, seas and marine resources. why? oceans provide key natural resources including food, medicines, biofuels and other products. they help with the breakdown and removal of waste and pollution, and their coastal ecosystems act as buffers to reduce damage from storms. maintaining healthy oceans supports climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. and have you been to the seaside? its also a great place for tourism and recreation. even more, marine protected areas contribute to poverty reduction by increasing fish catches and income, and improving health. they also help improve gender equality, as women do much of the work at small scale fisheries. the marine environment is also home to a stunning variety of beautiful creatures, ranging from single celled organisms to the biggest animal ever to have lived on the earththe blue whale. they are also home to coral reefs, one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet. sounds like a worthwhile thing to protect. so whats the problem? increasing levels of debris in the worlds oceans are having a major environmental and economic impact. marine debris impacts biodiversity through entanglement or ingestion of debris items by organisms, which can kill them or make it impossible for them to reproduce. as far as the worlds coral reefs are concerned, about 20 per cent of them have been effectively destroyed and show no prospects for recovery.

242,"about 24 per cent of the remaining reefs are under imminent risk of collapse through human pressures, and a further 26 per cent are under a longer term threat of collapse. furthermore, improper marine management results in overfishing. the lost economic benefits from the fisheries sector are estimated to be around us$50 billion annually. the un environment programme estimates the cumulative economic impact of poor ocean management practices is at least us$200 billion per year. in the absence of mitigation measures, climate change will increase the cost of damage to the ocean by an additional us$322 billion per year by 2050. what would it cost to correct this? the costs of taking action largely are offset by the long term gains. in economic terms, the convention on biological diversity suggests that scaled up actions to sustain the global ocean require a us$32 billion one time public cost and us$21 billion dollars a year for recurring costs. so what can we do? for open ocean and deep sea areas, sustainability can be achieved only through increased international cooperation to protect vulnerable habitats. establishing comprehensive, effective and equitably managed systems of government protected areas should be pursued to conserve biodiversity and ensure a sustainable future for the fishing industry. on a local level, we should make ocean friendly choices when buying products or eating food derived from oceans and consume only what we need. selecting certified products is a good place to start. making small changes in our daily lives, like taking public transport and unplugging electronics saves energy. "
243,"these actions reduce our carbon footprint, a factor that contributes to rising sea levels. we should eliminate plastic usage as much as possible and organize beach clean ups. most importantly, we can spread the message about how important marine life is and why we need to protect it. the expansion of protected areas for marine biodiversity and existing policies and treaties that encourage responsible use of ocean resources are still insufficient to combat the adverse effects of overfishing, growing ocean acidification due to climate change and worsening coastal eutrophication. as billions of people depend on oceans for their livelihood and food source and on the transboundary nature of oceans, increased efforts and interventions are needed to conserve and sustainably use ocean resources at all levels. ocean acidification is caused by the uptake of atmospheric co2 by the ocean, which changes the chemical composition of the seawater. long term observations of ocean acidification over the past 30 years have shown an average increase of acidity of 26 per cent since pre industrial times, and at this rate, an increase of 100 to 150 per cent is predicted by the end of the century, with serious consequences for marine life. to achieve sustainable development of fisheries, fish stocks must be maintained at a biologically sustainable level. analyses reveal that the fraction of world marine fish stocks that are within biologically sustainable levels declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 66.9 per cent in 2015. "
244,"as of december 2018, over 24 million km2 (17.2 per cent) of waters under national jurisdiction (0200 nautical miles from a national border) were covered by protected areas, a significant increase from 12 per cent in 2015 and more than double the extent covered in 2010. the global mean percentage of each marine key biodiversity area covered by protected areas increased from 31.2 per cent in 2000 to 44.7 per cent in 2015 and to 45.7 per cent in 2018. illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing remains one of the greatest threats to sustainable fisheries, the livelihoods of those who depend upon them and marine ecosystems. a framework of international instruments has been developed that addresses different aspects of fisheries management. most countries have taken measures to combat such fishing and have adopted an increasing number of fisheries management instruments in the past decade. for example, the agreement on port state measures to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, the first international binding agreement to combat such fishing, entered into force in june 2016. the number of parties to the agreement has rapidly increased and stood at 58 as of february 2019. small scale fisheries are present in almost all countries, accounting for more than half of total production on average, in terms of both quantity and value. to promote small scale fishers access to productive resources, services and markets, most countries have developed targeted regulatory and institutional frameworks. however, more than 20 per cent of countries have a low to medium level of implementation of such frameworks, particularly in oceania and central and south asia. "
245,"advancing the sustainable use and conservation of the oceans continues to require effective strategies and management to combat the adverse effects of overfishing, growing ocean acidification and worsening coastal eutrophication. the expansion of protected areas for marine biodiversity, intensification of research capacity and increases in ocean science funding remain critically important to preserve marine resources. the global share of marine fish stocks that are within biologically sustainable levels declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 69 per cent in 2013. studies at open ocean and coastal sites around the world show that current levels of marine acidity have increased by about 26 per cent on average since the start of the industrial revolution. moreover, marine life is being exposed to conditions outside previously experienced natural variability. global trends point to continued deterioration of coastal waters due to pollution and eutrophication. without concerted efforts, coastal eutrophication is expected to increase in 20 per cent of large marine ecosystems by 2050. as of january 2018, 16 per cent (or over 22 million square kilometres) of marine waters under national jurisdictionthat is, 0 to 200 nautical miles from shorewere covered by protected areas. this is more than double the 2010 coverage level. the mean coverage of marine key biodiversity areas (kbas) that are protected has also increasedfrom 30 per cent in 2000 to 44 per cent in 2018. goal 14. conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development 18. "
246,"the increasingly adverse impacts of climate change (including ocean acidification), overfishing and marine pollution are jeopardizing recent gains in protecting portions of the worlds oceans. global trends point to continued deterioration of coastal waters owing to pollution and eutrophication (excessive nutrients in water, frequently a result of run off from land, which causes dense plant growth and the death of animal life from lack of oxygen). of the 63 large marine ecosystems evaluated under the transboundary waters assessment programme, 16 per cent of the ecosystems are in the high or highest risk categories for coastal eutrophication. they are located mainly in western europe, southern and eastern asia, and the gulf of mexico. ocean acidification is closely linked to shifts in the carbonate chemistry of the waters, which can lead to a significant weakening of the shells and skeletons of many marine species (such as reef building corals and shelled molluscs). studies of marine acidity at open ocean and coastal sites around the world have indicated that current levels are often outside preindustrial bounds. overfishing reduces food production, impairs the functioning of ecosystems and reduces biodiversity. the proportion of world marine fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels has declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 68.6 per cent in 2013. however, the trend has slowed and appears to have stabilized from 2008 to 2013. small scale fisheries face numerous challenges. "
247,"in response, about 70 per cent of the respondents to a survey representing 92 countries and the european union have introduced or developed regulations, policies, laws, plans or strategies specifically targeting small scale fisheries. when effectively managed and well resourced, marine protected areas are important mechanisms for safeguarding ocean life. in 2017, protected areas cover 13.2 per cent of the marine environment under national jurisdiction (up to 200 nautical miles from shore), 0.25 per cent of the marine environment beyond national jurisdiction and 5.3 per cent of the total global ocean area. oceans, along with coastal and marine resources, play an essential role in human well being and social and economic development worldwide. they are particularly crucial for people living in coastal communities, who represented 37 per cent of the global population in 2010. oceans provide livelihoods and tourism benefits, as well as subsistence and income. they also help regulate the global ecosystem by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and protecting coastal areas from flooding and erosion. in fact, coastal and marine resources contribute an estimated $28 trillion to the global economy each year through ecosystem services. however, those resources are extremely vulnerable to environmental degradation, overfishing, climate change and pollution. the sustainable use and preservation of marine and coastal ecosystems and their biological diversity is essential to achieving the 2030 agenda, in particular for small island developing states. "
248,"pollution of both land and seas is a threat in many coastal regions. in addition, since river basins, marine ecosystems and the atmosphere are all part of hydrological systems, the effects of such pollution are often felt far from their source. in many coastal communities, pollution and eutrophication, which is the presence of excessive nutrients in water, frequently owing to runoff from the land, causing dense plant growth and the death of animal life, are driving detrimental changes. the five large marine ecosystems most at risk from coastal eutrophication, according to a global comparative assessment undertaken in 2016 as part of the transboundary water assessment programme, are the bay of bengal, the east china sea, the gulf of mexico, the north brazil shelf and the south china sea. since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the ocean has absorbed about one third of the carbon dioxide released by human activities, thereby mitigating the full impact of climate change. however, this comes at a steep ecological price, as dissolved carbon dioxide in seawater lowers the ph level of oceans, thereby increasing acidity and changing the biogeochemical carbonate balance. concerns about ocean acidification, first expressed in the early 1980s, have now been confirmed, and the extent of its impact on marine ecosystems is being investigated. fisheries contribute significantly to global food security, livelihoods and the economy. however, if not sustainably managed, fishing can damage fish habitats. ultimately, overfishing impairs the functioning of ecosystems and reduces biodiversity, with negative repercussions for sustainable social and economic development. in order to achieve a healthy balance, fish stocks must be maintained within biologically sustainable limits, at or above the abundance level that can produce maximum sustainable yields. "
249,"based on an analysis of assessed stocks, the percentage of world marine fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 69 per cent in 2013. fortunately, the downward trend has slowed and appears to have stabilized since 2008. biodiverse marine sites require safeguarding to ensure sustainable long term use of their precious natural resources. globally, in 2014, 8.4 per cent of the marine environment under national jurisdiction (up to 200 nautical miles from shore) and 0.25 per cent of the marine environment beyond national jurisdiction were under protection. from 2000 to 2016, the share of marine sites around the world that are designated as key biodiversity areas and are completely covered by protected areas increased from 15 per cent to 19 per cent. by 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution. index of coastal eutrophication and floating plastic debris density. by 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans. proportion of national exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem based approaches. minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels. average marine acidity (ph) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling stations. by 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics. "
250,"proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels. by 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information. coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas. by 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the world trade organization fisheries subsidies negotiation. progress by countries in the degree of implementation of international instruments aiming to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. by 2030, increase the economic benefits to small island developing states and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism. sustainable fisheries as a percentage of gdp in small island developing states, least developed countries and all countries. increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account the intergovernmental oceanographic commission criteria and guidelines on the transfer of marine technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing states and least developed countries. proportion of total research budget allocated to research in the field of marine technology. "
251,"provide access for small scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets. progress by countries in the degree of application of a legal/regulatory/policy/institutional framework which recognizes and protects access rights for small scale fisheries. enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in unclos, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of the future we want. number of countries making progress in ratifying, accepting and implementing through legal, policy and institutional frameworks, ocean related instruments that implement international law, as reflected in the united nation convention on the law of the sea, for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and their resources. conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. sustainable development goal 14 aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. effective strategies to mitigate adverse effects of increased ocean acidification are needed to advance the sustainable use of oceans. as areas of protected marine biodiversity expand, there has been an increase in ocean science funding, essential for preserving marine resources. the deterioration of coastal waters has become a global occurrence, due to pollution and coastal eutrophication (overflow of nutrients in water), where similar contributing factors to climate change can affect oceans and negatively impact marine biodiversity.without concerted efforts, coastal eutrophication is expected to increase in 20 per cent of large marine ecosystems by 2050. the preparatory meeting to the un ocean conference convened in new york, us, in february 2017, to discuss the implementation of sustainable development goal 14. "
252,"international law, as reflected in the un convention on the law of the sea (unclos), stressed the need to include governance instruments to consider anthropogenic activities taking place outside of the ocean. concerns regarding ocean health in destructive fishing practices and marine pollution were discussed, in looking at the role of local communities of small island developing states (sids) and least developed countries (ldcs) to not forget that oceans are a large part of their economies. the targets include preventing and reducing marine pollution and acidification, protecting marine and coastal ecosystems, and regulating fishing. the targets also call for an increase in scientific knowledge of the oceans. although many participating united nations legislative bodies comes together to discuss the issues around marine environments and sdg 14, such as at the united nations ocean conference, it is important to consider how sdg 14 is implemented across different multilateral environmental agreements, respectively. as climate, biodiversity and land degradation are major parts of the issues surrounding the deterioration of marine environments and oceans, it is important to know how each rio convention implements this sdg. oceans cover 71 percent of the earth s surface. they are essential for making the planet livable. rainwater, drinking water and climate are all regulated by ocean temperatures and currents. over 3 billion people depend on marine life for their livelihood. oceans absorb 30 percent of all carbon dioxide produced by humans. the oceans contain more than 200,000 identified species, and there might be thousands of species that are yet to be discovered. oceans are the world s largest sources of protein. however, there has been a 26 percent increase in acidification since the industrial revolution. a full 30 percent of marine habitats have been destroyed, and 30 percent of the world s fish stocks are over exploited. "
253,"marine pollution has reached shocking levels; each minute, 15 tons of plastic are released into the oceans. 20 percent of all coral reefs have been destroyed irreversibly, and another 24 percent are in immediate risk of collapse. approximately 1 million sea birds, 100 000 marine mammals, and an unknown number of fish are harmed or die annually due to marine pollution caused by humans. it has been found that 95 percent of fulmars in norway have plastic parts in their guts. microplastics are another form of marine pollution. individuals can help the oceans by reducing their energy consumption and their use of plastics. nations can also take action. in norway, for instance, citizens, working through a web page called finn.no, can earn money for picking up plastic on the beach. several countries, including kenya and tanzania, have banned the use of plastic bags for retail purchases. improving the oceans contributes to poverty reduction, as it gives low income families a source of income and healthy food. keeping beaches and ocean water clean in less developed countries can attract tourism, as stated in goal 8, and reduce poverty by providing more employment. characterized by extinctions, invasions, hybridizations and reductions in the abundance of species, marine biodiversity is currently in global decline. over the past decades, there has been an exponential increase in human activates in and near oceans, resulting in negative consequences to our marine environment. made evident by the degradation of habitats and changes in ecosystem processes, the declining health of the oceans has a negative effect on people, their livelihoods and entire economies, with local communities which rely on ocean resources being the most affected. poor decisions in resource management can compromise conservation, local livelihood, and resource sustainability goals. "
254,"the sustainable management of our oceans relies on the ability to influence and guide human use of the marine environment. as conservation of marine resources is critical to the well being of local fishing communities and their livelihoods, related management actions may lead to changes in human behavior to support conservation programs to achieve their goals. ultimately, governments and international agencies act as gatekeepers, interfering with needed stakeholder participation in decision making. the way to best safeguard life in oceans is to implement effective management strategies around marine environments. climate action is used as a way of protecting the world s oceans. oceans cover three quarters of the earth s surface and impact global climate systems through functions of carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere and oxygen generation. the increase in levels of greenhouse gases leading to changes in climate negatively affects the world s oceans and marine coastal communities. the resulting impacts of rising sea levels by 20 centimeters since the start of the 20th century and the increase of ocean acidity by 30% since the industrial revolution has contributed to the melting of ice sheets through the thermal expansion of sea water. sustainable development goal 14 has been incorporated into the convention on biological diversity (cbd), the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc), and the united nations convention to combat desertification (unccd). healthy oceans and seas are essential to our existence.they cover 70 percent of our planet and we rely on them for food, energy and water. yet, we have managed to do tremendous damage to these precious resources. we must protect them by eliminating pollution and overfishing and immediately start to responsibly manage and protect all marine life around the world."
255,"sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, halt biodiversity loss. forests cover 30.7 per cent of the earths surface and, in addition to providing food security and shelter, they are key to combating climate change, protecting biodiversity and the homes of the indigenous population. by protecting forests, we will also be able to strengthen natural resource management and increase land productivity. at the current time, thirteen million hectares of forests are being lost every year while the persistent degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6 billion hectares. even though up to 15% of land is currently under protection, biodiversity is still at risk. deforestation and desertification  caused by human activities and climate change  pose major challenges to sustainable development and have affected the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in the fight against poverty. efforts are being made to manage forests and combat desertification. there are two international agreements being implemented currently that promote the use of resources in an equitable way. financial investments in support of biodiversity are also being provided. on 21 june, 2018, the united nations development programme (undp), finch and founding partner mars, incorporated, announced the lions share, an initiative aimed at transforming the lives of animals across the world by asking advertisers to contribute a percentage of their media spend to conservation and animal welfare projects. "
256,"the lions share will see partners contribute 0.5 percent of their media spend to the fund for each advertisement they use featuring an animal. those funds will be used to support animals and their habitats around the world. the fund is seeking to raise us$100m a year within three years, with the money being invested in a range of wildlife conservation and animal welfare programs to be implemented by united nations and civil society organizations. forests. around 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihood, including 70 million indigenous people. forests are home to more than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects. between 2010 and 2015, the world lost 3.3 million hectares of forest areas. poor rural women depend on common pool resources and are especially affected by their depletion. desertification. 2.6 billion people depend directly on agriculture, but 52 per cent of the land used for agriculture is moderately or severely affected by soil degradation. arable land loss is estimated at 30 to 35 times the historical rate. due to drought and desertification, 12 million hectares are lost each year (23 hectares per minute). within one year, 20 million tons of grain could have been grown. 74 per cent of the poor are directly affected by land degradation globally. biodiversity. illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife continues to thwart conservation efforts, with nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants reported in illegal trade involving 120 countries. "
257,"of the 8,300 animal breeds known, 8 per cent are extinct and 22 per cent are at risk of extinction. of the over 80,000 tree species, less than 1 per cent have been studied for potential use. fish provide 20 per cent of animal protein to about 3 billion people. only ten species provide about 30 per cent of marine capture fisheries and ten species provide about 50 per cent of aquaculture production. over 80 per cent of the human diet is provided by plants. only three cereal crops, rice, maize and wheat, provide 60 per cent of energy intake. as many as 80 per cent of people living in rural areas in developing countries rely on traditional plant based medicines for basic healthcare. micro organisms and invertebrates are key to ecosystem services, but their contributions are still poorly known and rarely acknowledged. by 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements. by 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally. by 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation neutral world. by 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development. "
258,"take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species. promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and promote appropriate access to such resources, as internationally agreed. take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products. by 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species. by 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts. mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems. mobilize significant resources from all sources and at all levels to finance sustainable forest management and provide adequate incentives to developing countries to advance such management, including for conservation and reforestation. enhance global support for efforts to combat poaching and trafficking of protected species, including by increasing the capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities. life on land: why it matters. 1 million plant and animal species are at risk of extinction. whats the goal here? to sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss. "
259,"why? forests cover nearly 31 per cent of our planets land area. from the air we breathe, to the water we drink, to the food we eat, forests sustain us. around 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihood. almost 75 per cent of the worlds poor are affected directly by land degradation. forests are home to more than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects. however, biodiversity is declining faster than at any other time in human history. an estimated 20 per cent of the earths land area was degraded between 2000 and 2015. biodiversity and the ecosystem services it underpins can also be the basis for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies as they can deliver benefits that will increase the resilience of people to the impacts of climate change. forests and nature are also important for recreation and mental well being. in many cultures, natural landscapes are closely linked to spiritual values, religious beliefs and traditional teachings. what would it cost to correct the problem? the un forum on forests secretariat estimates that achieving sustainable forest management on a global scale would cost us$70 $160 billion per year. the convention on biological diversity estimates that us$150 $440 billion per year is required to halt the loss of biodiversity at a global level by the middle of this century. what would it cost if we dont correct the problem? biodiversity delivers multiple services from local to global levels, while responses to biodiversity loss range from emotional to utilitarian. "
260,"for instance, insects and other pollen carriers are estimated to be worth more than us$200 billion per year to the global food economy. three quarters of the top ranking global prescription drugs contain components derived from plant extracts, which would be threatened. natural disasters caused by ecosystems disrupted by human impact and climate change already cost the world more than us$300 billion per year. deforestation and forest degradation results in loss of habitat for all species, a decrease in freshwater quality, an increase in soil erosion, land degradation and higher emissions of carbon into the atmosphere. in short, not taking action on forests impacts both the health of the planet and our communities. what can we do? inevitably, we change the ecosystems we are a part of through our presence, but we can make choices that either affirm diversity or devalue it. some things we can do to help include recycling, eating a locally based diet that is sustainably sourced, consuming only what we need, and limiting energy usage through efficient heating and cooling systems. we must also be respectful toward wildlife and only take part in ecotourism opportunities that are responsibly and ethically run in order to prevent wildlife disturbance. well managed protected areas support healthy ecosystems, which in turn keep people healthy. it is therefore critical to secure the involvement of the local communities in the development and management of these protected areas. there are some encouraging global trends in protecting terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity. "
261,"forest loss is slowing down, more key biodiversity areas are protected and more financial assistance is flowing towards biodiversity protection. yet, the 2020 targets of sustainable development goal 15 are unlikely to be met, land degradation continues, biodiversity loss is occurring at an alarming rate, and invasive species and the illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife continue to thwart efforts to protect and restore vital ecosystems and species. protecting important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity is vital for ensuring long term and sustainable use of terrestrial and freshwater natural resources. the global mean percentage of each key biodiversity area covered by protected areas increased from 33.1 per cent in 2000 to 46.1 per cent in 2018 for terrestrial areas, from 30.5 per cent in 2000 to 43.2 per cent in 2018 for freshwater areas, and from 32.9 per cent in 2000 to 44.7 per cent in 2018 for mountain areas. healthy mountain ecosystems are fundamental to ensuring the provision of ecosystem services to upland communities as well as lowland peoples. as of 2017, 76 per cent of the worlds mountain areas were covered by a form of green coverage: 41 per cent by forests, 29 per cent by grassland/shrubland and only 6 per cent by cropland. from 2000 to 2015, more than one fifth of the earths total land area was degraded, largely due to human induced processes, such as desertification, cropland expansion and urbanization. during the same period, there were significant productivity declines in land cover, with grasslands incurring some of the greatest losses. "
262,"the most fundamental and irreversible human impact on nature is species extinction. the red list index  which measures the risk of extinction, in which a value of 1 indicates no threat to any species, and a value of 0 indicates that all species are extinct  has deteriorated from 0.82 in 1993 to 0.73 globally in 2019. the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization to the convention on biological diversity creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources and biodiversity. as at 1 february 2019, 116 countries had ratified the nagoya protocol (an increase of 46 since 2016) and 61 countries had shared information on their access and benefit sharing frameworks through the access and benefit sharing clearing house (representing an increase of 55 countries). in 2017, bilateral oda in support of biodiversity was $8.7 billion, an increase of 15 per cent in real terms over 2016. protection of forest and terrestrial ecosystems is on the rise, and forest loss has slowed. that said, other facets of terrestrial conservation continue to demand accelerated action to protect biodiversity, land productivity and genetic resources and to curtail the loss of species. the earths forest areas continue to shrink, down from 4.1 billion hectares in 2000 (or 31.2 per cent of total land area) to about 4 billion hectares (30.7 per cent of total land area) in 2015. however, the rate of forest loss has been cut by 25 per cent since 20002005. about one fifth of the earths land surface covered by vegetation showed persistent and declining trends in productivity from 1999 to 2013, threatening the livelihoods of over one billion people. "
263,"protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. this goal articulates targets for preserving biodiversity of forest, desert, and mountain eco systems, as a percentage of total land mass. achieving a ""land degradation neutral world"" can be reached by restoring degraded forests and land lost to drought and flood. goal 15 calls for more attention to preventing invasion of introduced species and more protection of endangered species. forests have a prominent role to play in the success of agenda 2030, notably in terms of ecosystem services, livelihoods, and the green economy; but this will require clear priorities to address key tradeoffs and mobilize synergies with other sdgs. the mountain green cover index monitors progress toward target 15.4, which focuses on preserving mountain ecosystems. the index is named as the indicator for target 15.4. similarly, the red index (red list index or rli) will fill the monitoring function for biodiversity goals by documenting the trajectory of endangered species. animal extinction is a growing problem. a flourishing life on land is the foundation for our life on this planet.we are all part of the planets ecosystem and we have caused severe damage to it through deforestation, loss of natural habitats and land degradation. promoting a sustainable use of our ecosystems and preserving biodiversity is not a cause. it is the key to our own survival."
264,"up to 24 million square kilometres of land were affected, including 19 per cent of cropland, 16 per cent of forest land, 19 per cent of grassland and 28 per cent of rangeland. since 1993, the global red list index of threatened species has fallen from 0.82 to 0.74, indicating an alarming trend in the decline of mammals, birds, amphibians, corals and cycads. the primary drivers of this assault on biodiversity are habitat loss from unsustainable agriculture, deforestation, unsustainable harvest and trade, and invasive alien species.  illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife continues to thwart conservation efforts, with nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants reported in illegal trade involving 120 countries. in 2016, bilateral oda in support of biodiversity totalled $7 billion, a decrease of 21 per cent in real terms from 2015. progress in preserving and sustainably using the earths terrestrial species and ecosystems is uneven. the pace of forest loss has slowed and improvements continue to be made in managing forests sustainably and protecting areas important for biodiversity. however, declining trends in land productivity, biodiversity loss and poaching and trafficking of wildlife remain serious concerns. the net loss of forest continues to slow and forest biomass stock per hecta re is stable. more forests are being protected and areas under long term management plans and voluntary certification have increased. from 2010 to 2015, the annual net loss of forest area globally was less than half that of the 1990s. the proportion of land area covered by forest decreased from 31.6 per cent in 1990 to 30.8 per cent in 2010 and 30.6 per cent in 2015. "
265,"fifteen per cent of land is currently under protection, but that does not cover all areas important for biodiversity. protecting key biodiversity areas is necessary to strengthen natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. from 2000 to 2017, average worldwide coverage of terrestrial, freshwater and mountain key biodiversity areas by protected areas increased from 35 per cent to 47 per cent, from 32 per cent to 43 per cent and from 39 per cent to 49 per cent, respectively.  as of 2017, 76 per cent of the worlds mountain areas are covered by some form of green vegetation, including forests, shrubs, grasses and crops. green cover on mountains is lowest in central asia (31 per cent) and highest in oceania (excluding australia and new zealand) (98 per cent). from 1998 to 2013, about one fifth of the earths land surface covered by vegetation showed persistent and declining trends in productivity. south america and africa are most affected; in some cases, advanced stages of land degradation there are leading to desertification in dryland areas, particularly in the grasslands and rangelands. land and soil degradation undermine the security and development of all countries. reversing the effects of land degradation and desertification through sustainable land management is key to improving the lives and livelihoods of more than 1 billion people currently under threat. biodiversity loss continues at an alarming rate according to the red list index. the extinction risk for corals is increasing most rapidly among all assessed species groups owing to the growing threat from climate change and local impacts. "
266,"chytrid fungal disease, another grave concern, is decimating many amphibian species and increasing their risk of extinction. wildlife poaching and trafficking continues to thwart conservation efforts. illicit wildlife markets are complex and subject to rapid fluctuations. demand for a given wildlife product can grow quickly, before the international community can react. in 2013, elephant ivory, rosewood and rhinoceros horn comprised over 60 per cent of total wildlife and timber product seizures. the global community is committed to conserving biodiversity. two international agreements aim at sharing the benefits from using genetic resources in a fair and equitable way. as of april 2017, 144 countries ratified the international treaty on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and 96 countries ratified the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization. in 2015, bilateral oda in support of biodiversity amounted to $8.8 billion, an increase of 39 per cent in real terms over 2014. preserving diverse forms of life on land requires targeted efforts to protect, restore and promote the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial and other ecosystems. goal 15 focuses specifically on managing forests sustainably, restoring degraded lands and successfully combating desertification, reducing degraded natural habitats and ending biodiversity loss. between 1990 and 2015, the worlds forest area diminished from 31.7 per cent of the worlds total land mass to 30.7 per cent. the loss was mainly attributable to the conversion of forest to other land uses, such as agriculture and infrastructure development. "
267,"meanwhile, other areas were transformed into forests through planting, landscape restoration or the natural expansion of forest. owing to the balance of the two processes and efforts to slow deforestation, the global net loss of forest area declined from 7.3 million hectares per year in the 1990s to 3.3 million hectares per year during the period from 2010 to 2015. to safeguard places that contribute significantly to global biodiversity, protected areas have been established and identified as key biodiversity areas. in 2014, 15.2 per cent of the worlds terrestrial and freshwater environments were covered by protected areas. the percentage of terrestrial key biodiversity areas covered by protected areas has increased, from 16.5 per cent in 2000 to 19.3 per cent in 2016.  over the same period, the share of freshwater key biodiversity areas that are protected has increased from 13.8 per cent to 16.6 per cent, and the share of mountain key biodiversity areas under protection has grown from 18.1 per cent to 20.1 per cent. the focus in goal 15 on halting biodiversity loss comes at a critical time, since many species of amphibians, birds and mammals are sliding towards extinction. according to the international union for conservation of natures red list index, amphibians are declining most rapidly in latin america and the caribbean, primarily as a result of the chytrid fungal disease, one of numerous wildlife diseases on the rise worldwide. the greatest extinction risks for birds and mammals are found in south eastern asia, mainly owing to the conversion of lowland forests. "
268,"by 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally.  progress towards sustainable forest management. by 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation neutral world. proportion of land that is degraded over total land area. by 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development. coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity. mountain green cover index.  however, their decline is not inevitable, with extinction risks for vertebrate species having been reversed in five small island developing states (the cook islands, fiji, mauritius, seychelles and tonga) as a result of conservation actions over the past several decades. conservation efforts can also be thwarted by poaching and the trafficking of wildlife. since 1999, at least 7,000 species of animals and plants have been detected in illegal trade, and the list of species under international protection continues to grow. comparing the size of legal trade in wildlife products (about 900,000 transactions per year) to the quantity of wildlife seized (about 16,000 seizures per year) provides an indication of the scope of illicit wildlife trafficking. the value of legal and illicit wildlife products can also be compared. "
269,"for example, the value of recorded seizures of crocodylus genus represents between 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent of the value of legal protected exports of this species between 2009 and 2013, with no clear trend discernible. in 2014, bilateral oda to support biodiversity amounted to $7 billion, an increase of 16 per cent in real terms over 2013. the two largest recipients of biodiversity assistance were the philippines and india, which together received about $1 billion of the total aid. by 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements. forest area as a proportion of total land area. proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type.  take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species. red list index. promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and promote appropriate access to such resources, as internationally agreed. number of countries that have adopted legislative, administrative and policy frameworks ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits. take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products."
270,
271," proportion of traded wildlife that was poached or illicitly trafficked. by 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species. proportion of countries adopting relevant national legislation and adequately resourcing the prevention or control of invasive alien species.  by 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts. progress towards national targets established in accordance with aichi biodiversity target 2 of the strategic plan for biodiversity 2011 2020. mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems. official development assistance and public expenditure on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystems. mobilize significant resources from all sources and at all levels to finance sustainable forest management and provide adequate incentives to developing countries to advance such management, including for conservation and reforestation. official development assistance and public expenditure on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystems. enhance global support for efforts to combat poaching and trafficking of protected species, including by increasing the capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities. proportion of traded wildlife that was poached or illicitly trafficked. "
272,"goal 16: promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies. the threats of international homicide, violence against children, human trafficking and sexual violence are important to address to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development. they pave the way for the provision of access to justice for all and for building effective, accountable institutions at all levels. while homicide and trafficking cases have seen significant progress over the past decade, there are still thousands of people at greater risk of intentional murder within latin america, sub saharan africa and around asia. childrens rights violations through aggression and sexual violence continue to plague many countries around the world, especially as under reporting and lack of data aggravate the problem. to tackle these challenges and build a more peaceful, inclusive societies, there needs to be more efficient and transparent regulations put in place and comprehensive, realistic government budgets. one of the first steps towards protecting individual rights is the implementation of worldwide birth registration and the creation of more independent national human rights institutions around the world. among the institutions most affected by corruption are the judiciary and police. corruption, bribery, theft and tax evasion cost some us $1.26 trillion for developing countries per year; this amount of money could be used to lift those who are living on less than $1.25 a day above $1.25 for at least six years. birth registration has occurred for 73 per cent of children under 5, but only 46% of sub saharan africa have had their births registered. approximately 28.5 million primary school age who are out of school live in conflict affected areas. "
273,"the rule of law and development have a significant interrelation and are mutually reinforcing, making it essential for sustainable development at the national and international level. the proportion of prisoners held in detention without sentencing has remained almost constant in the last decade, at 31% of all prisoners. violence against children. violence against children affects more than 1 billion children around the world and costs societies up to us$ 7 trillion a year. 50% of the worlds children experience violence every year. every 5 minutes, somewhere in the world, a child is killed by violence. 1 in 10 children is sexually abused before the age of 18. 9 in 10 children live in countries where corporal punishment is not fully prohibited, leaving 732 million children without legal protection. 1 in 3 internet users worldwide is a child and 800 million of them use social media. any child can become a victim of online violence. child online sexual abuse reports to ncmec has grown from 1 million in 2014 to 45 million in 2018. 246 million children worldwide affected by school related violence each year. 1 in 3 students has been bullied by their peers at school in the last month, and at least 1 in 10 children have experienced cyberbullying. significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere. end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children. promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all. by 2030, significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows, strengthen the recovery and return of stolen assets and combat all forms of organized crime. substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms. develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels. "
274,"ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision making at all levels. broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance. by 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration. ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements. strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime. promote and enforce non discriminatory laws and policies for sustainable development. peace, justice, and strong institutions: why they matter. today, 20 million people are refugees, over 41 million people have been internally displaced, and at least 4 million people are stateless. whats the goal here? promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. why? peaceful, just and inclusive societies are necessary to achieve the sustainable development goals (sdgs). people everywhere need to be free of fear from all forms of violence and feel safe as they go about their lives whatever their ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation. in order to advance the sdgs we need effective and inclusive public institutions that can deliver quality education and healthcare, fair economic policies and inclusive environmental protection. what needs to be done to address this? to achieve peace, justice and inclusion, it is important that governments, civil society and communities work together to implement lasting solutions to reduce violence, deliver justice, combat corruption and ensure inclusive participation at all times. "
275,"freedom to express views, in private and in public, must be guaranteed. people must be able to contribute to decisions that affect their lives. laws and policies must be applied without any form of discrimination. disputes need to be resolved through functioning political and justice systems. national and local institutions must be accountable and need to be in place to deliver basic services to families and communities equitably and without the need for bribes. how does this goal apply to me, wherever i live? crimes that threaten the foundation of peaceful societies, including homicides, trafficking and other organized crimes, as well as discriminatory laws or practices, affect all countries. even the worlds greatest democracies face major challenges in addressing corruption, crime and human rights violations for everyone at home. what would be the cost of not taking action now? armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a countrys development, affecting economic growth and often resulting in long standing grievances among communities. violence, in all its forms, has a pervasive impact on societies. violence affects childrens health, development and well being, and their ability to thrive. it causes trauma and weakens social inclusion. lack of access to justice means that conflicts remain unresolved and people cannot obtain protection and redress. institutions that do not function according to legitimate laws are prone to arbitrariness and abuse of power, and less capable of delivering public services to everyone. to exclude and to discriminate not only violates human rights, but also causes resentment and animosity, and could give rise to violence. what can we do? take a genuine interest in what your government is doing. "
276,"raise awareness in your community about the realities of violence and the importance of peaceful and just societies, and identify how you can pursue the sdgs in your daily life. exercise your right to hold your elected officials to account. exercise your right to freedom of information and share your opinion with your elected representatives. be the change, promote inclusion and respect towards people of different backgrounds, ethnic origins, religions, gender, sexual orientations or different opinions. together, we can help to improve conditions for a life of dignity for all. advances in ending violence, promoting the rule of law, strengthening institutions and increasing access to justice are uneven and continue to deprive millions of their security, rights and opportunities and undermine the delivery of public services and broader economic development. attacks on civil society are also holding back development progress. renewed efforts are essential to move towards the achievement of sustainable development goal 16. the number of intentional homicides per 100,000 people increased from 6.0 in 2015 to 6.1 in 2017. this slight uptick was largely the result of an increase in the homicide rates in latin america and the caribbean and in some countries in sub saharan africa. various forms of violence against children persist. in 83 countries (mostly from developing regions) with recent data on the subject, nearly 8 in 10 children from 1 to 14 years of age were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home. in all but seven of these countries, at least half of children experienced violent disciplinary methods. sexual violence is perhaps the most disturbing of childrens rights violations. "
277,"based on the limited data available, in 14 of 46 countries with comparable data, at least 5 per cent of women between the ages of 18 and 29 experienced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts that were forced, physically or in other ways, for the first time before they were 18 years of age. there has been an overall increase in the detection of victims of trafficking in persons, which could reflect either a positive (enhanced efforts by authorities to identify victims) or negative (larger trafficking problem) development. in a departure from prior findings, recent data show that most trafficking victims were detected domestically: 58 per cent in 2016, up from 43 per cent in 2014. the vast majority (70 per cent) of detected victims of human trafficking were women and girls, most of whom were trafficked for sexual exploitation. the share of unsentenced detainees in the overall prison population has remained largely constant at 30 per cent in recent years. this occurred in a context where the total prison population grew in absolute values while remaining constant as a share of the total population. killings of human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists are on the rise. from 2017 to 2018, the united nations recorded and verified 431 killings across 41 countries. every passing week saw at least eight people murdered at the front lines of efforts to build more inclusive and equal societies  a worrying increase from the previous average of one victim per day observed from 2015 to 2017. ninety nine journalists and bloggers were among the victims. "
278,"birth registration plays a primary role in ensuring individual rights and access to justice and social services. even if many regions have reached universal or near universal birth registration, globally the average is just 73 per cent. fewer than half (46 per cent) of all children under the age of 5 in sub saharan africa have had their births registered. binding laws and policies giving individuals a right to access information held by public authorities have been adopted by 125 countries, with at least 31 countries adopting such laws since 2013. among the 123 countries for which data on the legal framework is available, 40 do not include the right to appeal to an independent administrative body, which has been assessed as key for the proper implementation of this right. the pace of progress to put in place national human rights institutions compliant with the paris principles must be accelerated. in 2018, a total of 39 per cent of all countries had in place an institution that was fully compliant with the internationally agreed standard, seven countries more than was the case in 2015. if growth continues at the same rate, by 2030 only a little over one half (54 per cent) of all countries worldwide will have compliant national human rights institutions. the difference between the approved and the implemented budget reflects a governments ability to achieve development objectives, including delivering services to the public. deviation between the approved and actual spending during the period 20062017 in 108 countries shows that actual spending was within plus or minus 5 per cent of the approved budget in about half of the countries. "
279,"one out of 10 countries had a deviation of more than plus or minus 15 per cent. almost half of low income economies showed more than plus or minus 10 per cent deviation in budget execution. many regions of the world continue to suffer untold horrors as a result of armed conflict or other forms of violence that occur within societies and at the domestic level. advances in promoting the rule of law and access to justice are uneven. however, progress is being made in regulations to promote public access to information, albeit slowly, and in strengthening institutions upholding human rights at the national level. nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 years were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment on a regular basis at home in 81 countries (primarily developing), according to available data from 2005 to 2017. in all but seven of these countries, more than half of children experienced violent forms of discipline. more than 570 different flows involving trafficking in persons were detected between 2012 and 2014, affecting all regions; many involved movement from lower income to higher income countries. in 2014, the majority of detected trafficking victims were women and girls (71 per cent), and about 28 per cent were children (20 per cent girls and 8 per cent boys). over 90 per cent of victims detected were trafficked for sexual exploitation or forced labour. the proportion of prisoners held in detention without being sentenced for a crime remained almost constant in the last decade: from 32 per cent in 20032005 to 31 per cent in 20142016. "
280,"almost one in five firms worldwide report receiving at least one bribery payment request when engaged in regulatory or utility transactions. globally, 73 per cent of children under 5 have had their births registered; the proportion is less than half (46 per cent) in sub saharan africa. at least 1,019 human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists have been killed in 61 countries since 2015. this is equivalent to one person killed every day while working to inform the public and build a world free from fear and want. freedom of information laws and policies have been adopted by 116 countries, with at least 25 countries doing so over the last five years. however, implementation remains a challenge. since 1998, more than half of countries (116 of 197) have established a national human rights institution that has been peer reviewed for compliance with internationally agreed standards (the paris principles). however, only 75 of these countries have institutions that are fully compliant. violent conflicts have increased in recent years, while homicides have declined slowly and more citizens around the world have better access to justice. a few high intensity armed conflicts are causing large numbers of civilian casualties. progress promoting peace and justice, together with effective, accountable and inclusive institutions, remains uneven across and within regions. in 2015, between 5.2 persons and 6.7 persons per 100,000 persons worldwide were victims of intentional homicide. while the homicide rate has declined over the past decade, people in some countries located in latin america, sub saharan africa and asia face increased risk of intentional murder. "
281,"various forms of violence against children persist, including discipline that relies on physical punishment and psychological aggression. in 76 countries (most are developing countries) with available data from 2005 to 2016, about 8 in 10 children from 1 to 14 years of age were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment on a regular basis. countries have made solid progress in terms of detecting victims of trafficking in persons, as reflected by the increasing number of detected victims over the last decade. globally, more women and girls than men and boys were identified as victims of trafficking in 2014. however, the share of women and girls has slowly retreated, from 84 per cent in 2004 to 71 per cent in 2014. while the share of victims trafficked for sexual exploitation has declined, the proportion of those trafficked for forced labour has increased. about 28 per cent of all trafficking victims detected in 2014 were children, with girls outnumbering boys (20 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively, of total victims). sexual violence is perhaps the most disturbing of childrens rights violations. underreporting and a lack of comparable data limit understanding of the full extent of the problem. in 35 low  and middle income countries with data, the proportions of women between 18 and 29 years of age who experienced sexual violence for the first time before 18 years of age ranged from 0 per cent to 16 per cent. rates of pretrial detention suggest that progress with respect to the rule of law and access to justice has been slow. "
282,"globally, the proportion of people held in detention without being sentenced for a crime has remained almost unchanged  from 32 per cent of total prisoners in 2003 2005 to 31 per cent in 2013 2015  which indicates that substantive progress has not been achieved in the ability of judicial systems to process and try the accused in a fair and transparent manner. opaque, burdensome and inefficient regulations and procedures nurture opportunities for corrupt officials to extract bribes or unofficial payments. in 2015, over 18 per cent of firms worldwide reported receiving at least one bribery payment request. the share of firms in low  and lower middle income countries totalled 25 per cent, compared to 4 per cent in high income countries. to provide a sound basis for development, government budgets should be comprehensive, transparent and realistic. while expenditure in nearly 2 in 3 countries was within 10 per cent of their original national budgets, more than 1 in 7 countries deviated by at least 15 per cent. nevertheless, budget reliability has improved over time, with about 8 in 10 countries in southern asia and eastern asia and the pacific showing improvement. birth registration is a first step towards safeguarding individual rights and providing every person with access to justice and social services. while many regions have reached universal or near universal birth registration, globally the average is just 71 per cent, on the basis of available country data reported from 2010 to 2016. fewer than half (46 per cent) of all children under 5 years of age in sub saharan africa have had their births registered. legislation that calls for freedom of information has increased steadily, but slow or inefficient implementation of such laws remains a concern. "
283,"more than 110 countries have adopted freedom of information legislation and policies. however, expert assessments suggest that 47 of those countries fall short of having clear legal provisions for exceptions to that right, while another 47 countries lack sufficient provisions for public education. independent national human rights institutions play an important role in ensuring that states deliver on their human rights obligations and that no one is left behind. by the end of 2016, 37 per cent of countries had a national human rights institution that was compliant with internationally agreed standards (the paris principles), while 57 per cent of countries had been reviewed for compliance by their peers. peace, justice and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions are at the core of sustainable development. several regions have enjoyed increased and sustained levels of peace and security in recent decades. but many countries still face protracted armed conflict and violence, and far too many people struggle as a result of weak institutions and the lack of access to justice, information and other fundamental freedoms. the number of victims of intentional homicide worldwide remained relatively stable from 2008 to 2014. the worldwide number of victims of intentional homicide was estimated to be between 4.6 and 6.8 per 100,000 people in 2014, a slight decrease with respect to previous years. yet during that period, the homicide rate in developing countries was twice that in developed countries, and increased in the least developed countries. moreover, despite the lack of harmonized data, fatalities and injuries related to armed conflict appear to be increasing in some countries, causing unprecedented population displacements and enormous humanitarian needs. "
284,"various forms of violence against children are pervasive, including discipline that relies on physical punishment and psychological aggression. in all but 7 of 73 countries and areas with available survey data from 2005 to 2015, more than half of children between the ages of 1 and 14 were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home. in northern africa, the share was more than 90 per cent. globally, the share of girls and boys among victims of human trafficking (21 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively) peaked in 2011. by 2014, the figures had dropped to 18 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, but were still almost twice the levels recorded for 2004. sexual violence is one of the most unsettling of childrens rights violations. yet underreporting and the lack of comparable data limit understanding of the full extent of the problem. survey data from 31 low  and middle income countries suggest that the proportion of women aged between 18 and 29 who experienced sexual violence for the first time before the age of 18 varies widely, ranging from zero to 16 per cent. comparable data on the experiences of men are only available for five countries, but values are lower than those reported among women in the same countries. progress with respect to the rule of law and access to justice is mixed. globally, the proportion of people held in detention without sentencing decreased slightly, from 32 per cent of total detainees in 2003 2005 to 30 per cent in 2012 2014. however, the percentage for developing regions has consistently been more than two times that of developed regions. "
285,"in southern asia, for instance, more than 2 out of 3 prisoners remained unsentenced in 2012 2014, despite some improvement over the data available for the period 2003 to 2005. among victims of robbery, between one quarter and one half reported the crime to the police, in 27 countries with available data. the data suggest a significant gap in citizens access to and trust in authorities. although official data on the prevalence of bribery are limited, figures from 19 countries indicate that the rate of prevalence of bribery may reach as high as 50 per cent among citizens who had contact with public officials, undermining trust in state institutions. registering children at birth is a first step in securing recognition before the law and safeguarding individual rights and access to justice. despite recent progress, the births of more than 1 in 4 children under the age of 5 worldwide have not been recorded. in sub saharan africa, over half (54 per cent) of children have not been registered by their fifth birthday. globally, children living in urban areas are around 1.5 times more likely to be registered than their rural counterparts. in most regions, birth registration rates tend to be highest among the richest 20 per cent of the population. efforts are under way to make national and international institutions more effective, inclusive and transparent. over the past 10 years, nearly two thirds of 144 countries with available data were able to plan their national budgets effectively (where final expenses remained within 10 per cent of original budgets). voting rights assigned to various groups of countries in international institutions is one indication of inclusivity at the international level. "
286,"for example, while developing countries account for 63 per cent of voting rights in the african development bank, this figure is only 35 per cent in the international monetary fund and 38 per cent in the international bank for reconstruction and development of the world bank group. a free press is closely linked to access to information and the protection of human rights, but the trend in this regard is discouraging. the number of journalists killed increased from 65 in 2010 to 114 in 2015, despite the fact that, by 2013, 90 states had adopted laws on freedom of and/or access to information. the proportion of countries with national human rights institutions has doubled over the past 15 years, reaching 35.5 per cent by the end of 2015. the share of such institutions that are compliant with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (paris principles) (adopted by the general assembly in its resolution 48/134) was highest in developed regions (46 per cent) and in latin america and the caribbean (41 per cent). significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere. number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population, by sex and age. conflict related deaths per 100,000 population, by sex, age and cause. proportion of population subjected to physical, psychological or sexual violence in the previous 12 months. proportion of population that feel safe walking alone around the area they live. end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children. proportion of children aged 1 17 years who experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month. "

"
289,"reducing violent crime, sex trafficking, forced labor, and child abuse are clear global goals. the international community values peace and justice and calls for stronger judicial systems that will enforce laws and work toward a more peaceful and just society. by 2017, the un could report progress on detecting victims of trafficking. more women and girls than men and boys were victimized, yet the share of women and girls has slowly declined (see also violence against women). in 2004, 84 percent of victims were females and by 2014 that number had dropped to 71 percent. sexual exploitation numbers have declined, but forced labor has increased. one target is to see the end to sex trafficking, forced labor, and all forms of violence against and torture of children. however, reliance on the indicator of ""crimes reported"" makes monitoring and achieving this goal challenging. for instance, 84 percent of countries have no or insufficient data on violent punishment of children. of the data available, it is clear that violence against children by their caregivers remains pervasive: nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 are subjected to violent discipline on a regular basis (regardless of income), and no country is on track to eliminate violent discipline by 2030. sdg 16 also targets universal legal identity and birth registration, ensuring the right to a name and nationality, civil rights, recognition before the law, and access to justice and social services. with more than a quarter of children under 5 unregistered worldwide as of 2015, about 1 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress to achieve universal birth registration by 2030. compassion and a strong moral compass is essential to every democratic society.yet, persecution, injustice and abuse still runs rampant and is tearing at the very fabric of civilization. we must ensure that we have strong institutions, global standards of justice, and a commitment to peace everywhere."
290,"goal 1 calls for an end to poverty in all its manifestations by 2030. it also aims to ensure social protection for the poor and vulnerable, increase access to basic services and support people harmed by climate related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters. the international poverty line is currently defined at $1.90 or below per person per day using 2011 united states dollars purchasing power parity (ppp). in the decade beginning in 2002, the proportion of the worldâ€™s population living below the poverty line dropped by half, from 26 per cent to 13 per cent. if growth rates during those 10 years prevail for the next 15 years, the global extreme poverty rate will likely fall to 4 per cent by 2030, assuming that growth benefits all income groups of the population equally. however, if the growth rates over the longer period of 20 years prevail, the global poverty rate will likely be around 6 per cent. in other words, eliminating extreme poverty will require a significant change from historical growth rates. in 2015, 10.2 per cent of the worldâ€™s workers were living with their families on less than $1.90 per person per day, down from 28 per cent in 2000. young people are especially likely to be among the working poor: 16 per cent of all employed youth aged 15 to 24 were considered working poor, compared to 9 per cent of adults. expanding social protection programmes and targeting appropriate schemes to the poor and most vulnerable can further reduce poverty. social protection programmes include social assistance, such as cash transfers, school feeding and targeted food assistance, as well as social insurance and labour market programmes, including old age pensions, disability pensions, unemployment insurance, skills training and wage subsidies, among others. "
291,"social protections have expanded globally since 2000, as many developing countries adopted policies that afford protection for multiple contingencies. pension coverage in particular is expanding rapidly. over half (51 per cent) of people above retirement age received a pension according to data available for the period from 2010 to 2012. almost all countries have child or maternity benefit programmes, and cash transfer schemes are increasing. despite progress over the past decade, increasing social protection for those most in need remains a priority. globally, 18,000 children still die each day from poverty related causes, and only 28 per cent of employed women are effectively protected through contributory and non contributory maternity cash benefits. most poor people remain outside social protection systems, especially in low income countries. of the entire population, only 1 out of 5 receive any type of social protection in low income countries, compared with 2 out of 3 in upper middle income countries. the coverage gap is particularly acute in sub saharan africa and southern asia, where most of the worldâ€™s poorest people live. in sub saharan africa, only 15 per cent of those in the bottom income quintile have access to a social protection benefit. disaster risk reduction is essential to ending poverty and fostering sustainable development. disaster risk is disproportionally higher in poorer countries with weaker institutions. in low  and lower middle income countries experiencing rapid economic growth, the exposure of people and assets to natural hazards is increasing at a faster pace than that at which risk reducing capacities are being strengthened, leading to increased disaster risk. "
292,"economic losses from internationally reported disasters, principally large scale disasters, have grown steadily since 1990, reaching an estimated annual average of $200 billion in 2013. reported damage to housing, schools and health care facilities, along with agricultural production, shows statistically significant upward trends from 1990 onwards. despite the fact that the global poverty rate has been halved since 2000, intensified efforts are required to boost the incomes, alleviate the suffering and build the resilience of those individuals still living in extreme poverty, in particular in sub saharan africa. social protection systems need to be expanded and risks need to be mitigated for disaster prone countries, which also tend to be the most impoverished. in 2013, an estimated 767 million people lived below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day â€” down from 1.7 billion people in 1999. that figure reflects a decrease in the global poverty rate from 28 per cent in 1999 to 11 per cent in 2013. the most significant progress was seen in eastern and southeastern asia, where the rate declined from 35 per cent in 1999 to 3 per cent in 2013. in contrast, 42 per cent of people in sub saharan africa continued to subsist in conditions of extreme poverty in 2013. in 2016, just under 10 per cent of the worldâ€™s workers were living with their families on less than $1.90 per person per day, down from 28 per cent in 2000. in the least developed countries, nearly 38 per cent of workers in 2016 were living below the poverty line. "
293,"social protection systems are fundamental to preventing and reducing poverty and inequality at every stage of peopleâ€™s lives, through benefits for children, mothers with newborns, persons with disabilities, older persons and thoses persons who are poor and without jobs. preliminary data show that in 2016, only 45 per cent of the worldâ€™s population was effectively protected by a social protection system and that coverage varied widely across countries and regions. in 2016, 68 per cent of people above retirement age received a pension. however, that global average masks large regional differences. in oceania, excluding australia and new zealand, and in sub saharan africa, only 10 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, of people above retirement age received a pension in 2016. other vulnerable groups lack social protections as well. in 2016, only 28 per cent of people with severe disabilities collected disability benefits, only 22 per cent of unemployed individuals worldwide received unemployment benefits and only 41 per cent of women giving birth received maternity benefits. building the resilience of the poor and strengthening disaster risk reduction is a core development strategy for ending extreme poverty in the most afflicted countries. economic losses from disasters are now reaching an average of $250 billion to $300 billion a year. disaster risk globally is highly concentrated in low  and lower middle income countries. in relation to the size of their economies, small island developing states have borne a disproportionate impact."
294,"while extreme poverty has eased considerably since 1990, pockets of the worst forms of poverty persist. ending poverty requires universal social protection systems aimed at safeguarding all individuals throughout the life cycle. it also requires targeted measures to reduce vulnerability to disasters and to address specific underserved geographic areas within each country. the rate of extreme poverty has fallen rapidly: in 2013 it was a third of the 1990 value. the latest global estimate suggests that 11 per cent of the world population, or 783 million people, lived below the extreme poverty threshold in 2013. the proportion of the worldâ€™s workers living with their families on less than $1.90 per person a day declined significantly over the past two decades, falling from 26.9 per cent in 2000 to 9.2 per cent in 2017. based on 2016 estimates, only 45 per cent of the worldâ€™s population were effectively covered by at least one social protection cash benefit. in 2017, economic losses attributed to disasters were estimated at over $300 billion. this is among the highest losses in recent years, owing to three major hurricanes affecting the united states of america and several countries across the caribbean.the decline of global extreme poverty continues, but has slowed. the deceleration indicates that the world is not on track to achieve the target of less than 3 per cent of the world living in extreme poverty by 2030. "
295,"people who continue to live in extreme poverty face deep, entrenched deprivation often exacerbated by violent conflicts and vulnerability to disasters. strong social protection systems and government spending on key services often help those left behind get back on their feet and escape poverty, but these services need to be brought to scale. the share of the world population living in extreme poverty declined to 10 per cent in 2015, down from 16 per cent in 2010 and 36 per cent in 1990. however, the pace of poverty reduction is decelerating, with a nowcast of 8.6 per cent in 2018. moreover, baseline projections suggest that 6 per cent of the world population will still be living in extreme poverty in 2030, missing the target of ending poverty. despite having a job, 8 per cent of the worldâ€™s workers and their families still lived in extreme poverty in 2018. the situation remains particularly alarming in sub saharan africa, where the share of working poor stood at 38 per cent in 2018. social protection systems help prevent and reduce poverty and provide a safety net for the vulnerable. however, social protection is not a reality for a large majority of the worldâ€™s population. in 2016, 55 per cent â€“ as many as 4 billion people â€“ were not covered by any social protection cash benefits, with large variations across regions: from 87 per cent without coverage in sub saharan africa to 14 per cent in europe and northern america."
296,"only 22 per cent of unemployed persons receive unemployment cash benefits, only 28 per cent of persons with severe disabilities receive disability cash benefits, only 35 per cent of children worldwide enjoy effective access to social protection and only 41 per cent of women giving birth receive maternity cash benefits. disasters often lead to a downturn in the trajectory of socioeconomic development and exacerbate poverty. from 1998 to 2017, direct economic losses from disasters were estimated at almost $3 trillion, of which climate   related disasters accounted for 77 per cent of the total â€“ a rise of 151 per cent compared with the period from 1978 to 1997 â€“ and climate related and geophysical disasters claimed an estimated 1.3 million lives. more than 90 per cent of deaths reported internationally were due to disaster events in low  and middle income countries, and economic losses from disasters as a percentage of gross domestic product (gdp) were also much higher in these countries. countries have reported progress in the development and implementation of national and local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 2015â€“2030. as at 31 march 2019, 67 countries had reported progress in such alignment and 24 countries reported that their respective local governments had developed local strategies consistent with national strategies and plans. only one third of all countries spend between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of total government expenditure on education, as recommended in the education 2030 framework for action"
297,"even before the pandemic, the pace of global poverty reduction was decelerating, and it was projected that the global target of ending poverty by 2030 would be missed. the pandemic is pushing tens of millions of persons back into extreme poverty, undoing years of progress. while the pandemic has highlighted the need to strengthen social protection and emergency preparedness and response, those measures are insufficient to safeguard the poor and the vulnerable, who most need them. after a decline, from 15.7 per cent in 2010 to 10.0 per cent in 2015, the pace of reduction of extreme poverty slowed further, with a nowcast rate of 8.2 per cent in 2019. the pandemic is reversing the trend of poverty reduction. according to the most recent estimates, the global extreme poverty rate is projected to be 8.4 to 8.8 per cent in 2020, which is close to its level in 2017. consequently, an estimated 40 to 60 million persons will be pushed back into extreme poverty, the first increase in global poverty in more than 20 years. the share of the worldâ€™s workers living in extreme poverty fell, from 14.3 to 8.3 to 7.1 per cent in 2010, 2015 and 2019, respectively. progress in that regard was less encouraging for young workers: in 2019, 12.8 per cent of the worldâ€™s young workers lived in extreme poverty, compared with only 6 per cent of all adult workers. "
298,"the pandemic is pushing millions of workers into unemployment, underemployment and working poverty. based on 2016 data, 55 per cent of the worldâ€™s population, about 4 billion persons, did not benefit from any form of social protection, which is critical to help the poorest and the most vulnerable in the current crisis. at least half of the worldâ€™s population still lacked full coverage of essential health services, and only 22 per cent of unemployed workers were covered by unemployment benefits. hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, wildfires and other extreme natural disasters exacerbate poverty. a total of 80 countries reported disaster related losses for 2018, including 23,458 deaths and 2,164 persons missing. more than 39 million persons were reported as affected, 29 million of whom saw their livelihood disrupted or destroyed. in terms of direct economic losses, $23.6 billion was reported by countries, 73 per cent of which was attributed to the agricultural sector. the slowdown in progress on poverty reduction since 2015 has been further set back by the covid 19 pandemic, with the global rate of extreme poverty rising in 2020 for the first time in over 20 years. the triple threat of covid 19, conflict and climate change makes the global goal of ending poverty by 2030 unachievable unless immediate and substantial policy actions are taken. the covid 19 crisis has demonstrated the importance of social protection systems for protecting health, employment and income, with many new social protection measures introduced in 2020 as a result. "
299,"however, 4 billion people worldwide are still without any social protection, most of whom are poor and vulnerable. compounding the threats to poverty eradication posed by climate change and conflict, the pandemic is set to increase the number of poor people in 2020 by between 119 and 124 million, causing the extreme poverty rate to rise for the first time in a generation, from 8.4 per cent in 2019 to 9.5 per cent in 2020 according to nowcasts. of the new poor, 8 out of 10 are in middle income countries and territories. it is predicted that around 600 million people will still be living in extreme poverty by 2030. before the pandemic, global extreme poverty had fallen from 10.1 per cent in 2015 to 9.3 per cent in 2017, equivalent to 689 million people living on less than $1.90 a day. however, the rate of decrease had slowed to less than half a percentage point annually in that period, compared to around 1 percentage point annually between 1990 and 2015. the share of workers around the world living in extreme poverty fell from 14 per cent in 2010 to 7.8 per cent in 2015 and 6.6 per cent in 2019, although progress for young workers was less encouraging. however, the pandemic has severely affected the informal economy, in which the vast majority of the working poor are employed. the crisis also has had a disproportionate impact on the livelihoods of young and female workers, who are already much more likely to be living in poverty. "
300,"in 2019, young people were twice as likely as adults to be among the working poor. by 2020, only 47 per cent of the global population was covered effectively by at least one social protection cash benefit, leaving 4 billion people unprotected. however, between 1 february and 31 december 2020, governments of 209 countries and territories announced more than 1,600 mostly short term social protection measures in response to the covid 19 crisis. in 2019, 12,000 disaster fatalities were reported across 72 reporting countries and territories. this is a significant reduction on the figure for 2018, when disaster mortality reported by 105 countries and territories reached a total of 125,000, and is in line with the overall trend in mortality that has been declining since 2005. on the basis of the latest reports submitted as part of the monitoring process under the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 2015â€“2030, direct economic losses of $9.3 billion were reported for 2019 by 67 countries and territories, of which 68 per cent or $6.4 billion was recorded for the agricultural sector. 18. only 30 per cent of all countries and territories with data for the period 2015 â€“ 2018 spent between 15 and 20 per cent of total government expenditure on education, as recommended in the framework for action for the implementation of sustainable development goal 4.total oda grants for basic social services and development food aid, which are intended for poverty reduction, represented 0.02 per cent of the gross national income of donors to the development assistance committee in 2019"
301,"goal 2 aims to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030. it also commits to universal access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food at all times of the year. this will require sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices, equal access to land, technology and markets and international cooperation on investments in infrastructure and technology to boost agricultural productivity. the fight against hunger has progressed over the past 15 years. globally, the prevalence of hunger has declined, from 15 per cent according to figures for 2000 to 2002, to 11 per cent according to figures for 2014 to 2016. however, more than 790 million people worldwide still lack regular access to adequate amounts of dietary energy. if current trends continue, the zero hunger target will be largely missed by 2030. many countries that failed to reach the target set as part of the millennium development goals, of halving the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, have faced natural and human induced disasters or political instability, resulting in protracted crises, with increased vulnerability and food insecurity affecting large parts of the population. the persistence of hunger is no longer simply a matter of food availability. more and better data on access to food can enable the tracking of progress and guide interventions to fight food insecurity and malnutrition. globally, in 2014, nearly 1 in 4 children under the age of 5, an estimated total of 159 million children, had stunted growth. stunting is defined as inadequate height for age, an indicator of the cumulative effects of undernutrition and infection. southern asia and sub saharan africa accounted for three quarters of the children under 5 with stunted growth in 2014. another aspect of child malnutrition is the growing share of children who are overweight, a problem affecting nearly every region. globally, between 2000 and 2014, the percentage of children under the age of 5 who were overweight grew from 5.1 per cent to 6.1 per cent. "
302,"ending hunger and malnutrition relies heavily on sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices. genetic diversity in livestock breeds is crucial for agriculture and food production since it allows for the raising of farm animals in a wide range of environments and provides the basis for diverse products and services. globally, 20 per cent of local livestock breeds, meaning breeds reported in only one country, are at risk of extinction. another 16 per cent of breeds are stable, and the status of the remaining local breeds is unknown owing to a lack of data. the figures exclude livestock breeds that have already become extinct. to increase the productive capacity of agriculture, more investment is needed, both public and private, from domestic and foreign sources. however, recent trends in government spending are not favourable. the agriculture orientation index, defined as agricultureâ€™s share of government expenditures divided by the sectorâ€™s share of gross domestic product (gdp), fell globally from 0.37 to 0.25 between 2001 and 2013. the decline in the index was interrupted only temporarily during the food price crisis of 2006 to 2008, when governments increased agricultural spending. since the late 1990s, the percentage of aid for supporting agriculture in developing countries has been stable at around 8 per cent, when measured as a share of sector allocable aid from member countries of the development assistance committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd). this has decreased, from a peak of 20 per cent in the mid 1980s, as a result of donors beginning to focus more on improving governance, building social capital and bolstering fragile states. one of the targets for goal 2 calls for correcting and preventing distortions in world agricultural markets, including the elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies. "
303,"those subsidies mask market signals, reduce competitiveness and can lead to environmental damage and the inequitable distribution of benefits. that said, some progress is being made, with members of the world trade organization adopting a ministerial decision, in december 2015, on eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products and restraining export measures that have an equivalent effect. efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition have advanced significantly since 2000. ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition for all, however, will require continued and focused efforts, especially in asia and africa. more investments in agriculture, including government spending and aid, are needed to increase capacity for agricultural productivity. the proportion of undernourished people worldwide declined from 15 per cent in 2000 2002 to 11 per cent in 2014 2016. about 793 million people are undernourished globally, down from 930 million people during the same period. in 2016, an estimated 155 million children under 5 years of age were stunted (too short for their age, a result of chronic malnutrition). globally, the stunting rate fell from 33 per cent in 2000 to 23 per cent in 2016. southern asia and sub saharan africa accounted for three quarters of all stunted children that year. in 2016, an estimated 52 million children under 5 years of age worldwide suffered from wasting (with a low weight for their height, usually the result of an acute and significant food shortage and/or disease). the global wasting rate in 2016 was 7.7 per cent, with the highest rate (15.4 per cent) in southern asia. at the other end of the spectrum, overweight and obesity affected 41 million children under 5 years of age worldwide (6 per cent) in 2016. ending hunger demands sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices. one aspect of that effort is maintaining the genetic diversity of plants and animals, which is crucial for agriculture and food production. "
304,"in 2016, 4.7 million samples of seeds and other plant genetic material for food and agriculture were preserved in 602 gene banks throughout 82 countries and 14 regional and international centres â€” a 2 per cent increase since 2014. animal genetic material has been cryoconserved, but only for 15 per cent of national breed populations, according to information obtained from 128 countries. the stored genetic material is sufficient to reconstitute only 7 per cent of national breed populations should they become extinct. as of february 2017, 20 per cent of local breeds were classified as at risk. increased investments are needed to enhance capacity for agricultural productivity. however, the global agriculture orientation index â€” defined as agricultureâ€™s share of government expenditure divided by the sectorâ€™s share of gross domestic product (gdp) â€” fell from 0.38 in 2001 to 0.24 in 2013 and to 0.21 in 2015. the share of sector allocable aid allocated to agriculture from member countries of the development assistance committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) fell from nearly 20 per cent in the mid 1980s to 7 per cent in the late 1990s, where it remained through 2015. the decline reflects a shift away from aid for financing infrastructure and production towards a greater focus on social sectors. in 2016, 21 countries experienced high or moderately high domestic prices, relative to their historic levels, for one or more staple cereal food commodities. thirteen of those countries were in sub saharan africa. the main causes of high prices were declines in domestic output, currency depreciation and insecurity. localized increases in fuel prices also drove food prices higher."
305,"some progress has been made in preventing distortions in world agricultural markets. the global agricultural export subsidies were reduced by 94 per cent from 2000 to 2014. in december 2015, members of the world trade organization adopted a ministerial decision on eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products and restraining export measures that have a similar effect. after a prolonged decline, world hunger appears to be on the rise again. conflict, drought and disasters linked to climate change are among the key factors causing this reversal in progress. the proportion of undernourished people worldwide increased from 10.6 per cent in 2015 to 11.0 per cent in 2016. this translates to 815 million people worldwide in 2016, up from 777 million in 2015. in 2017, 151 million children under age 5 suffered from stunting (low height for their age), 51 million suffered from wasting (low weight for height), and 38 million were overweight. aid to agriculture in developing countries totalled $12.5 billion in 2016, falling to 6 per cent of all donorsâ€™ sector allocable aid from nearly 20 per cent in the mid 1980s. progress has been made in reducing market distorting agricultural subsidies, which were more than halved in five yearsâ€”from $491 million in 2010 to less than $200 million in 2015 in 2016, 26 countries experienced high or moderately high levels of general food prices, which may have negatively affected food security. hunger is on the rise again globally and undernutrition continues to affect millions of children. public investment in agriculture globally is declining, smallscale food producers and family farmers require much greater support and increased investment in infrastructure and technology for sustainable agriculture is urgently needed."
306,"an estimated 821 million people â€“ approximately 1 in 9 people in the world â€“ were undernourished in 2017, up from 784 million in 2015. this represents a worrying rise in world hunger for a third consecutive year after a prolonged decline. africa remains the continent with the highest prevalence of undernourishment, affecting one fifth of its population (more than 256 million people). consistent with the continued growth in undernourishment, 770 million people faced severe food insecurity in 2017. stunting has been decreasing in nearly every region since 2000. still, more than 1 in 5 children under 5 years of age (149 million) were stunted in 2018. globally, 49 million children under 5 were affected by wasting and another 40 million were overweight in 2018. strengthening the resilience and adaptive capacity of small scale and family farmers, whose productivity is systematically lower than all other food producers, is critical to reversing the trend of the rise in hunger. the share of small scale food producers in terms of all food producers in countries in africa, asia and latin america ranges from 40 to 85 per cent, compared with fewer than 10 per cent in europe. government spending on agriculture compared to agricultureâ€™s contribution to the total economy has declined by 37 per cent; the ratio fell from 0.42 in 2001 to 0.26 worldwide in 2017. in addition, aid to agriculture in developing countries fell from nearly 25 per cent of all donorsâ€™ sector allocable aid in the mid 1980s to only 5 per cent in 2017, representing a decrease of $12.6 billion. a continuous downward trend has been observed in export subsidy outlays reported to the world trade organization (wto). the total outlays fell from close to $500 million in 2010 to around $120 million in 2016. this reduction in export subsidies by governments is leading to lower distortions in agricultural markets."
307,"the total number of persons suffering from severe food insecurity has been on the rise since 2015, and there are still millions of malnourished children. the economic slowdown and the disruption of food value chains caused by the pandemic are exacerbating hunger and food insecurity. in addition, the upsurge in desert locusts remains alarming in east africa and yemen, where 35 million persons already experience acute food insecurity. owing to the pandemic, some 370 million schoolchildren are missing the free school meals that they rely on. measures to strengthen food production and distribution systems must be taken immediately to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the pandemic. an estimated 26.4 per cent of the world population, about 2 billion persons, were affected by moderate or severe food insecurity in 2018, an increase from 23.2 per cent in 2014, owing mainly to increases in food insecurity in sub saharan africa and latin america. slightly more than 700 million persons, or 9.2 per cent of the world population, experienced severe food insecurity in 2018, implying reductions in the quantity of food consumed to the extent that they possibly experienced hunger. the proportion of children under 5 years of age suffering from chronic undernutrition, as well as stunting (being too short for oneâ€™s age), decreased, from 23.1 per cent in 2015 to 21.3 per cent in 2019. globally, 144 million children under 5 years of age were still affected by stunting in 2019. three quarters of them lived in central and southern asia or sub saharan africa."
308,"globally, 47 million children under 5 years of age, or 6.9 per cent, were affected by acute undernutrition or wasting (low weight for oneâ€™s height) in 2019 conditions generally caused by limited nutrient intake and infection. more than half of the wasted children lived in central and southern asia. childhood overweight affected 38 million children under 5 years of age worldwide, or 5.6 per cent, in 2019. wasting and overweight may coexist at levels considered to be medium to high, the so called double burden of malnutrition. in northern africa and south eastern asia, the rate of wasting was 7.2 per cent and 8.2 per cent, respectively, while the rate of overweight was 11.3 per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively, in 2019. the share of government expenditure in the agricultural sector, measured by government expenditure in agriculture divided by the sectorâ€™s share of gdp, fell worldwide, from 0.42 to 0.31 to 0.28 per cent in 2001, 2015 and 2018, respectively. moreover, aid to agriculture in developing countries fell, from nearly 25 per cent of all donorsâ€™ sector allocable aid in the mid 1980s to only 5 per cent, in 2018. in 2019, sharp increases in food prices were concentrated largely in sub saharan africa, driven by production shocks and macroeconomic difficulties. the lingering impact of prolonged conflict and extreme weather conditions in some areas were additional factors."
309,"even before the covid 19 pandemic, the number of people experiencing hunger globally and suffering from food insecurity had been rising gradually since 2014. the pandemic has increased the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems, potentially leaving hundreds of millions more people chronically undernourished and making the goal of ending hunger more difficult to achieve. between 83 and 132 million more people may already have been pushed into chronic hunger in 2020. in addition, countries and territories around the world continue to struggle with multiple forms of malnutrition. it is estimated that almost 690 million people around the world experienced hunger in 2019, equivalent to 8.9 per cent of the world population â€“ an increase of nearly 60 million in five years. updated estimates due for publication in july 2021 will provide a more recent picture of the effects of the pandemic on hunger. an estimated 2 billion people, 25.9 per cent of the world population, were affected by moderate or severe food insecurity in 2019, up from 22.4 per cent in 2015. the fastest rise was recorded in latin america and the caribbean, although the highest levels were registered in sub saharan africa. globally, 149.2 million children under the age of 5, some 22 per cent of all children, suffer from stunting (low height for age) according to the latest estimates available for 2020,2 a decrease from 24.4 per cent in 2015. however, these figures may rise as a result of continued constraints on access to nutritious food and essential nutrition services during the pandemic, the full impact of which may take years to manifest. "
310,"in 2020, wasting (low weight for height) and overweight affected 6.7 per cent (45.4 million) and 5.7 per cent (38.9 million) of children under the age of 5, respectively. wasting will be one of the conditions most affected by the pandemic in the short term: around 15 per cent more children than estimated may have suffered from wasting as a result of a decline in household wealth and disruptions in the availability and affordability of nutritious food and essential nutrition services. childhood overweight (high weight for height) may also rise in some countries and territories where unhealthy foods replaced fresh, nutritious foodstuffs and restrictions on movement constrained opportunities for physical activity for long periods. in women, anaemia increases the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. in 2019, the global prevalence of anaemia was 29.9 per cent in women of reproductive age, 29.6 per cent in non pregnant women and 36.5 per cent in pregnant women. the prevalence was higher in central and southern asia, at 47.5 per cent in women of reproductive age. the average agricultural output per labour day of small scale food producers in the limited number of countries and territories surveyed is lower than that of large   scale producers, who also earn up to two or three times the annual income of smallscale producers. in almost all countries and territories surveyed, households headed by males achieve higher labour productivity and earn larger annual incomes compared to their female counterparts. "
311,"global holdings of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture in 2020 reached 5.7 million accessions conserved in 831 gene banks by 114 countries and territories and 17 regional and international research centres. although the total number of global holdings has risen, the growth rate decreased over the past 10 years, reaching its lowest level in 2020. the world is still far off target for maintaining the genetic diversity of farmed and domesticated animals, either in the field or in gene banks. the risk status of 61 per cent of local livestock breeds remains unknown. of the limited number surveyed, 74 per cent are deemed to be at risk of extinction, yet there is only sufficient material in gene banks for 203 out of a global total of 7,700 local livestock breeds to reconstitute the breed in the event of its extinction. while the share of agricultural aid has remained constant at about 5 percent, it has more than doubled in volume since 2002, with total disbursements amounting to $13 billion in 2019. a steady downward trend has been observed in export subsidy outlays notified to the world trade organization (wto). total notified annual outlays fell from a peak of $6.7 billion in 1999 to $138 million in 2018. in december 2015, wto members adopted the ministerial decision on export competition, formally agreeing to eliminate all forms of agricultural export subsidy entitlements. at the global level, the number of countries and territories afflicted by high food prices decreased from 2014 to 2019, with the notable exception of some countries in central, southern and western asia as well as northern africa, owing to the reduced domestic availability of staple foods and to currency depreciations."
312,"goal 3 seeks to ensure health and well being for all, at every stage of life. the goal addresses all major health priorities, including reproductive, maternal and child health; communicable, non communicable and environmental diseases; universal health coverage; and access for all to safe, effective, quality and affordable medicines and vaccines. it also calls for more research and development, increased health financing, and strengthened capacity of all countries in health risk reduction and management. between 2000 and 2015, the global maternal mortality ratio, or number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, declined by 37 per cent, to an estimated ratio of 216 per 100,000 live births in 2015. almost all maternal deaths occur in low resource settings and can be prevented. globally, 3 out of 4 births were assisted by skilled health care personnel in 2015. under five mortality rates fell rapidly from 2000 to 2015, declining by 44 per cent globally. nevertheless, an estimated 5.9 million children under the age of 5 died in 2015, with a global under five mortality rate of 43 per 1,000 live births. the neonatal mortality rate, that is, the likelihood of dying in the first 28 days of life, declined from 31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 19 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. over that period, progress in the rate of child survival among children aged 1 to 59 months outpaced advances in reducing neonatal mortality; as a result, neonatal deaths now represent a larger share (45 per cent) of all under five deaths. "
313,"preventing unintended pregnancy and reducing adolescent childbearing through universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services are critical to further advances in the health of women, children and adolescents. worldwide, in 2015, approximately 3 in 4 women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years of age) who were married or in union satisfied their need for family planning by using modern contraceptive methods; in sub saharan africa and oceania, however, the share was less than half. childbearing in adolescence has steadily declined in almost all regions, but wide disparities persist: in 2015, the birth rate among adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 ranged from 7 births per 1,000 girls in eastern asia to 102 births per 1,000 girls in sub saharan africa. the incidence of major infectious diseases, including hiv, tuberculosis and malaria, has declined globally since 2000. globally in 2015, the number of new hiv infections among all people was 0.3 new infections per 1,000 uninfected people; 2.1 million people became newly infected that year. the incidence of hiv was highest in sub saharan africa, with 1.5 new cases per 1,000 uninfected people. in 2014, 9.6 million new cases of tuberculosis (133 cases per 100,000 people) were reported worldwide, with 58 per cent of them in south eastern asia and the western pacific. unhealthy environmental conditions increase the risk of both non communicable and infectious diseases, which is reflected in the strong integrated nature of the goals. "
314,"in 2012, an estimated 889,000 people died from infectious diseases caused largely by faecal contamination of water and soil and by inadequate hand washing facilities and practices resulting from poor or non existent sanitation services. in 2012, household and ambient air pollution resulted in some 6.5 million deaths. substance use and substance use disorders have also created a significant public health burden. worldwide, average alcohol consumption in 2015 was estimated at 6.3l of pure alcohol per person among those aged 15 or older, with wide variations across countries. alcohol consumption was highest in the developed regions (10.4l per person) and lowest in northern africa (0.5l per person). in 2013, only about 1 in 6 people worldwide suffering from drug use disorders received treatment. approximately 1 in 18 people with drug use disorders received treatment in africa that year, compared with 1 in 5 in western and central europe. mental disorders occur in all regions and cultures. the most common are anxiety and depression, which, not infrequently, can lead to suicide. in 2012, an estimated 800,000 people worldwide committed suicide, and 86 per cent of them were under the age of 70. globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death among those between the ages of 15 and 29. around 1.25 million people died from road traffic injuries in 2013. halving the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020 is an ambitious goal given the dramatic increase in the number of vehicles, which nearly doubled between 2000 and 2013. almost half the worldâ€™s population is at risk of malaria and, in 2015, the incidence rate was 91 new cases per 1,000 people at risk, an estimated total of 214 million cases. "
315,"sub saharan africa accounted for 89 per cent of all malaria cases worldwide, with an incidence rate of 235 cases per 1,000 people at risk. in 2014, at least 1.7 billion people, in 185 countries, required treatment for at least one neglected tropical disease. according to estimates from 2012, around 38 million deaths per year, accounting for 68 per cent of all deaths worldwide, were attributable to non communicable diseases. of all deaths among persons under the age of 70, commonly referred to as premature deaths, an estimated 52 per cent were as a result of non communicable diseases. over three quarters of premature deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. globally, premature mortality from those four main categories of non communicable disease declined by 15 per cent between 2000 and 2012. reducing tobacco use will be critical for meeting the proposed target of reducing premature mortality from non communicable diseases by one third. in 2015, over 1.1 billion people consumed tobacco, with far more male (945 million) than female (180 million) smokers. total official flows from all providers for medical research and basic health sectors were $8.9 billion in 2014. within this total, official development assistance (oda) from dac donors was $4.5 billion in 2014, an increase of 20 per cent in real terms since 2010, with the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and the united states of america accounting for $2.6 billion of that total. in 2014, $1 billion was spent on malaria control and $1.2 billion was spent on other infectious diseases, excluding aids."
316,"since 2000, impressive advancements have been made on many health fronts. however, to meet the sustainable development goals health targets by 2030, progress must be accelerated, in particular in regions with the highest burden of disease. reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health in 2015, the global maternal mortality ratio stood at 216 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. achieving the target of less than 70 maternal deaths by 2030 requires an annual rate of reduction of at least 7.5 per cent, more than double the annual rate of progress achieved from 2000 to 2015. most maternal deaths can be prevented. in 2016, 78 per cent of live births worldwide benefited from skilled care during delivery, compared to 61 per cent in 2000. in sub saharan africa, however, the rate in 2016 was only 53 per cent of live births. the mortality rate for children under 5 years of age globally was 43 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. that rate represents a 44 per cent reduction since 2000. mortality among children under 5 years of age remains high in sub saharan africa, with a rate of 84 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. children are most vulnerable in the first 28 days of life (the neonatal period). in 2015, the global neonatal mortality rate was 19 deaths per 1,000 live births, a decrease from 31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000. neonatal mortality is highest in central and southern asia and in sub saharan africa, at 29 deaths per 1,000 live births in each of those regions in 2015. preventing unintended pregnancies and reducing adolescent childbearing through universal access to sexual and reproductive health care is crucial to the health and well being of women, children and adolescents. "
317,"in 2017, 78 per cent of women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years of age) worldwide who were married or in union had their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods, up from 75 per cent in 2000. progress has been substantial in the least developed countries, with a rise of 18 percentage points from 2000 to 2017. major advances have been made in combating infectious diseases. globally in 2015, there were 0.3 new hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) infections per 1,000 uninfected people; among children under 15 years of age, there were 0.08 new hiv infections. that data represents a decline of 45 per cent and 71 per cent, respectively, since 2000. the incidence of hiv infection remained highest in sub saharan africa, with 1.5 new infections per 1,000 uninfected people in 2015. in 2015, 10.4 million new cases of tuberculosis were reported worldwide, which represents 142 new cases per 100,000 people, or a decline of 17 per cent since 2000. the global malaria incidence rate in 2015 was 94 per 1,000 people at risk, a 41 per cent decrease since 2000. in 2015, 1.6 billion people required mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases, a 21 per cent decline from 2010. around 1.34 million deaths were attributed to hepatitis in 2015, including 0.9 million deaths owing to hepatitis b. hepatitis b can be prevented through vaccinations; global coverage of vaccinations for that disease among children 1 year of age increased from 29 per cent in 2000 to 84 per cent in 2015. a major risk factor for infectious diseases and mortality is the lack of safe water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) services, which disproportionately affects sub saharan africa and central/southern asia. "
318,"death rates owing to the lack of wash services in those two regions were 46 and 23 per 100,000 people, respectively, compared to 12 per 100,000 people globally in 2012. non communicable diseases and mental health. premature deaths (before 70 years of age) owing to cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes totalled about 13 million in 2015, accounting for 43 per cent of all premature deaths globally. from 2000 to 2015, the risk of dying between 30 and 70 years of age from one of those four causes decreased from 23 per cent to 19 per cent, falling short of the rate required to meet the 2030 target of a one third reduction. such mental disorders as depression can lead to suicide. nearly 800,000 suicides occurred worldwide in 2015, with men about twice as likely to commit suicide as women. tobacco and alcohol use contributes to the burden of non communicable diseases. the world health organization (who) framework convention on tobacco control has been ratified by 180 parties, which represent 90 per cent of the global population. still, more than 1.1 billion people, mostly men, consumed tobacco in 2015. the prevalence of smoking among those individuals 15 years of age and older dropped from 23 per cent in 2007 to 21 per cent in 2013. in 2016, the average consumption of pure alcohol was 6.4 litres per year per person among those individuals 15 years of age or older. indoor and ambient air pollution is the greatest environmental health risk. "
319,"globally in 2012, household air pollution from cooking with unclean fuels or inefficient technologies led to an estimated 4.3 million deaths, while ambient air pollution from traffic, industrial sources, waste burning or residential fuel combustion resulted in an estimated 3 million deaths. other health risks. in 2013, about 1.25 million people died from road traffic injuries, the leading cause of death among males between 15 and 29 years of age. road traffic deaths have increased by about 13 per cent globally since 2000. worldwide in 2015, an estimated 108,000 people died as a result of unintentional poisoning. that figure represents 1.5 deaths per 100,000 people, a 33 per cent decrease since 2000. health systems and funding. in 2015, total official flows for medical research and basic health from all donor countries and multilateral organizations amounted to $9.7 billion, an increase in real terms of 30 per cent since 2010. of that amount, the member countries of the development assistance committee of oecd contributed $4.3 billion. available data from 2005 to 2015 indicate that over 40 per cent of all countries have less than one physician per 1,000 people, and around half have fewer than three nurses or midwives per 1,000 people. almost all least developed countries have less than one physician and fewer than three nurses or midwives per 1,000 people. globally, the adolescent birth rate among females aged 15 to 19 declined by 21 per cent from 2000 to 2015; in northern america and southern asia, it dropped by more than 50 per cent. however, the adolescent birth rate remains high in two thirds of all countries, with more than 20 births per 1,000 adolescent girls in 2015. infectious diseases "
320,"many more people today are living healthier lives than in the past decade. nevertheless, people are still suffering needlessly from preventable diseases, and too many are dying prematurely. overcoming disease and ill health will require concerted and sustained efforts, focusing on population groups and regions that have been neglected. reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health. the maternal mortality ratio has declined by 37 per cent since 2000. nevertheless, in 2015, 303,000 women around the world died due to complications during pregnancy or childbirth. over the period 2012â€“2017, almost 80 per cent of live births worldwide occurred with the assistance of skilled health personnel, up from 62 per cent in 2000â€“2005. globally, from 2000 to 2016, the under 5 mortality rate dropped by 47 per cent, and the neonatal mortality rate fell by 39 per cent. over the same period, the total number of under 5 deaths dropped from 9.9 million to 5.6 million. even in the region facing the greatest health challenges, progress has been impressive. since 2000, the maternal mortality ratio in sub saharan africa has been reduced by 35 per cent, and the under 5 mortality rate has dropped by 50 per cent. in 2018, the global adolescent birth rate is 44 births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19, compared to 56 in 2000. the highest rate (101) is found in sub saharan africa. infectious diseases and non communicable diseases. globally, the incidence of hiv declined from 0.40 to 0.26 per 1,000 uninfected people between 2005 and 2016. for women of reproductive age in sub saharan africa, however, the rate is much higher, at 2.58 per 1,000 uninfected people."
321,"in 2016, 216 million cases of malaria were reported versus 210 million cases in 2013. there were 140 new cases of tuberculosis per 100,000 people in 2016 compared to 173 cases per 100,000 in 2000. hepatitis b prevalence declined among children under 5â€” from 4.7 per cent in the pre vaccine era to 1.3 per cent in 2015. in 2016, 1.5 billion people were reported to require mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases, down from 1.6 billion in 2015 and 2 billion in 2010. unsafe drinking water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene continue to be major contributors to global mortality, resulting in about 870,000 deaths in 2016. these deaths were mainly caused by diarrhoeal diseases, but also from malnutrition and intestinal nematode infections. globally, 32 million people died in 2016 due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease. the probability of dying from these causes was about 18 per cent in 2016 for people between 30 and 70 years of age. in 2016, household and outdoor air pollution led to some 7 million deaths worldwide. health systems and funding globally, almost 12 per cent of the worldâ€™s population (over 800 million people) spent at least one tenth of their household budgets to pay for health services in 2010, up from 9.7 per cent in 2000. official development assistance (oda) for basic health from all donors increased by 41 per cent in real terms since 2010, reaching $9.4 billion in 2016. available data from 2005 to 2016 indicate that close to 45 per cent of all countries and 90 per cent of least developed countries (ldcs) have less than one physician per 1,000 people, and over 60 per cent have fewer than three nurses or midwives per 1,000 people."
322,"major progress has been made in improving the health of millions of people, increasing life expectancy, reducing maternal and child mortality and fighting against leading communicable diseases. however, progress has stalled or is not happening fast enough with regard to addressing major diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis, while at least half the global population does not have access to essential health services and many of those who do suffer undue financial hardship, potentially pushing them into extreme poverty. concerted efforts are required to achieve universal health coverage and sustainable financing for health, to address the growing burden of non communicable diseases, including mental health, and to tackle antimicrobial resistance and determinants of health such as air pollution and inadequate water and sanitation. reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health an estimated 303,000 women around the world died due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth in 2015. almost all of these deaths occurred in low  and middle income countries, and almost two thirds of those were in sub saharan africa. these deaths are preventable with appropriate management and care. globally in 2018, 81 per cent of births took place with the assistance of a skilled birth attendant, a significant improvement from 69 per cent in 2012. coverage of skilled birth attendants in 2018 was only 59 per cent in sub saharan africa. the under 5 mortality rate fell to 39 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2017, a 6.7 per cent reduction from 42 deaths in 2015, and an overall reduction of 49 per cent from 77 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000. the total number of under 5 deaths dropped to 5.4 million in 2017 from 9.8 million in 2000. still, most of these deaths were from preventable causes and almost half, or 2.5 million, occurred in the first month of life â€“ the most crucial period for child survival.  "
323," the global neonatal mortality rate has continued to decline after a long downward trend from 31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 18 in 2017, a 41 per cent reduction. immunization saves millions of lives and is widely recognized as one of the worldâ€™s most successful and cost effective health interventions. coverage of the required three doses of the vaccine that prevents diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis increased from 72 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2015 and has remained unchanged between 2015 and 2017. an estimated 19.9 million children did not receive the vaccines during the first year of life, putting them at serious risk of these potentially fatal diseases. the global coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which has the potential to significantly reduce deaths in children under age of 5, has yet to reach 50 per cent. two doses of the measles vaccine are required to prevent the disease and the illnesses, disabilities and deaths caused by complications associated with it. coverage with the second dose of measles vaccine increased from 59 per cent in 2015 to 67 per cent in 2017, but that is still insufficient to prevent this highly contagious disease. expanding access to modern contraceptive methods is essential to ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services. globally, the proportion of women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years old) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern contraceptive methods has continued to increase slowly, from 74 per cent in 2000 to 76 per cent in 2019. adolescent fertility declined from 56 births per 1,000 adolescent women in 2000 to 45 births in 2015 and 44 births in 2019. the level of adolescent fertility has remained high in sub saharan africa, at 101 births per 1,000 adolescent women. infectious diseases "
324,"strong and steady domestic and international commitment and funding has fuelled an acceleration of evidence informed hiv prevention, testing and treatment programmes. as a result, the incidence of hiv in sub saharan africa (among adults aged 15 to 49) has declined by 37 per cent, from 3.39 infections per 1,000 uninfected people in 2010 to 2.49 in 2015 and 2.14 in 2017. however, the rate of global hiv incidence among adults aged 15 to 49 declined from 0.44 to 0.40 between 2015 and 2017 and overall by 22 per cent between 2010 and 2017, well short of the declines required to meet 2020 and 2030 targets. tuberculosis remains a leading cause of ill health and death. in 2017, an estimated 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis. the burden is falling globally: incidence of tuberculosis has continued to decline from 170 new and relapse cases per 100,000 people in 2000 to 140 in 2015, and 134 in 2017; and the tuberculosis mortality rate among hiv negative people fell by 42 per cent between 2000 and 2017. however, large gaps in detection and treatment persist and the current pace of progress is not fast enough to meet the sustainable development goal target, with drug resistant tuberculosis remaining a continuing threat. after more than a decade of steady advances in fighting malaria, progress has stalled. no significant gains were made in reducing the number of malaria cases worldwide in the period 2015â€“2017. sub saharan africa continues to carry the heaviest burden of disease, accounting for more than 90 per cent of the global malaria burden. worryingly, there were an estimated 3.5 million more malaria cases in the 10 highest burden african countries in 2017 compared with the previous year.  "
325,"the probability of dying from any of the four main non communicable diseases â€“ cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes â€“ between the ages of 30 and 70 was 18 per cent in 2016. the risk remains markedly higher for men globally, at 21.6 per cent, compared with 15 per cent for women. progress has been made in reducing the global suicide rate (from 12.9 per 100,000 in 2000 to 10.6 per 100,000 in 2016). however, suicide remains the second highest cause of death among people aged 15 to 29 globally, with 79 per cent of suicides found in low  and middle income countries in 2016. the prevalence of tobacco use declined from 27 per cent in 2000 to 20 per cent in 2016. prevalence fell faster for women, from 11 per cent in 2000 to 6 per cent in 2016, compared with men: prevalence in men only fell from 43 per cent to 34 per cent. despite the positive trends, the number of people dying from a tobacco related illness was estimated to be more than 8.1 million in 2017. the number of road traffic deaths climbed from 1.31 million in 2013 to 1.35 million in 2016. road traffic injury is the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5 to 29. air pollution, both ambient and household, increases the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disease and, in 2016, led to some 7 million deaths worldwide. sub saharan africa and most of asia and oceania (excluding australia/new zealand) have the highest mortality rates associated with air pollution, as a large proportion of the population still rely on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking. "
326,"inadequate and unsafe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene is linked to 60 per cent of the disease burden from diarrhoea, 100 per cent of the burden from infections with soil transmitted helminths and 16 per cent of the burden from protein energy malnutrition, leading to a total of 870,000 deaths in 2016 from the three conditions. in 2015, an estimated 325 million people worldwide were living with hepatitis b virus or hepatitis c virus infection. the widespread use of hepatitis b vaccine in infants has considerably reduced the incidence of new chronic hbv infections, as reflected by the decline in hepatitis b prevalence among children under 5 years of age, from 4.7 per cent in the pre vaccine era to 0.8 per cent in 2017. in 2017, 1.58 billion people were reported as requiring mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases, down from 1.63 billion in 2015 and 2.03 billion in 2010. improved surveillance meant that further populations requiring interventions against such diseases were identified in 2017. the 522 million people requiring treatment and care in least developed countries represented 52 per cent of those countriesâ€™ populations, down from 584 million in 2015. non communicable diseases, mental health and environmental risks. health systems and funding. official development assistance (oda) for basic health from all donors increased by 61 per cent in real terms since 2010 and reached $10.7 billion in 2017. in 2017, some $2.0 billion was spent on malaria control, $1.0 billion on tuberculosis control and $2.3 billion on other infectious diseases, excluding hiv/aids."
327,"available data from 2013 to 2018 indicate that close to 40 per cent of all countries had fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10,000 people, and more than 55 per cent had fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000 people. all least developed countries had fewer than 10 medical doctors and fewer than 5 dentists and 5 pharmacists per 10,000 people, and 98 per cent had fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000 people. progress in many health areas continues, but the rate of improvement has slowed and will not be sufficient to meet most of the goal 3 targets. the pandemic is devastating health systems globally and threatens health outcomes already achieved. most countries, in particular poor ones, have insufficient health facilities, medical supplies and health care workers to meet the surge in demand. countries need comprehensive health strategies and increased spending on health systems to meet urgent needs and protect health workers, while a global coordinated effort is needed to support countries in need. reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health. globally, an estimated 295,000 maternal deaths occurred in 2017, resulting in an overall maternal mortality ratio of 211 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, a 4 per cent reduction compared with 2015 and a 38 per cent reduction compared with 2000. the majority of the deaths occurred in low  and lower middle income countries, and roughly 66 per cent of them occurred in sub saharan africa. at the current pace of progress, the world will fall short of the target of the goal."
328,"worldwide, 81 per cent of births were assisted by skilled health professionals in the period 2014â€“2019, up from 64 per cent in the period 2000â€“2005, with central asia, eastern asia, western asia, northern america and europe nearly achieving universal coverage. the concerted effort of the global community continues to reduce preventable child deaths, from a mortality rate of 76 deaths per 1,000 live births in children under 5 years of age in 2000 to 42 in 2015 to 39 in 2018. notwithstanding the progress, some 5.3 million children died before reaching 5 years of age in 2018 alone, and nearly half of those deaths, or 2.5 million, occurred in the first month of life. globally, the proportion of women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) whose family planning needs were met by modern contraceptive methods increased only slightly, from 75.7 per cent in 2010 to around 77 per cent from 2015 to 2020, reaching only 56 per cent in sub saharan africa and 52 per cent in oceania (excluding australia and new zealand). worldwide, the adolescent birth rate fell steadily, from 45 births per 1,000 women 15 to 19 years of age in 2015 to 41 per 1,000 in 2020, with the highest rate, 101 per 1,000, in sub saharan africa. infectious diseases. in 2018, there were an estimated 1.7 million new hiv infections, an incidence rate of 0.24 per 1,000 uninfected persons among the total population, almost unchanged from the level of 0.26 per 1,000 in 2015, putting the world off track in achieving the sustainable development goal target. one in three of new hiv infections globally occurred among women 15 to 49 years of age in sub saharan africa. "
329,"in 2018, an estimated 10 million persons fell ill with tuberculosis (89 per cent were adults, 63 per cent were men and 8.6 per cent were people living with hiv). the incidence of tuberculosis declined, from 141 new and relapse cases per 100,000 persons in 2015 to 132 in 2018. the tuberculosis mortality rate among hiv negative people fell by 8.3 per cent in the same period. however, large gaps in detection and treatment persist, and the current pace of progress is not fast enough to meet the target of ending the epidemic by 2030. drug resistant tuberculosis is also a continuing threat. after many years of impressive reductions in the global malaria burden, progress has stalled. globally, malaria incidence (the number of cases per 1,000 persons) fell, from 81 in 2000 to 57 in 2014, and remained at a similar level throughout 2018. the world is not on a trajectory to achieve the sustainable development goal target of ending malaria. the use of the hepatitis b vaccine in infants has reduced the incidence of new chronic hepatitis b virus infections considerably. the proportion of children under 5 years of age who became chronically infected fell, from 4.7 per cent in the pre vaccine era to 0.9 per cent in 2018. in 2018, 1.76 billion persons were reported to have required mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases, down from 1.80 billion in 2015 and 2.19 billion in 2010. the 530 million persons requiring treatment and care in least developed countries represented 52 per cent of the population of those countries, down from 78 per cent in 2010.  "
330,"progress has been driven largely by the fact that at least one neglected tropical disease has been eliminated in 40 countries. non communicable diseases, mental health and environmental risks. the probability of dying from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease at between 30 and 70 years of age decreased, from 19 per cent in 2010 to 18 per cent in 2016, a rate of decline that was insufficient to meet the sustainable development goal target. based on 2016 data, nearly 800,000 persons died every year by suicide, and 79 per cent of global suicides occurred in low  and middle income countries. the number of persons dying of tobacco related illnesses was estimated to be 8.1 million in 2017. the global prevalence of tobacco use among men was 38.6 per cent in 2018, compared with 8.5 per cent among women. in 2016, indoor (household) and outdoor (ambient) air pollution caused some 7 million deaths worldwide. inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene led to a total of 870,000 deaths in the same year. health systems and funding. immunization is one of the worldâ€™s most successful and cost effective health interventions. while vaccination coverage among infants increased, from 72 to 85 to 86 per cent in 2000, 2015 and 2018, respectively, an estimated 19.4 million children did not receive essential vaccines in their first year of life. in addition, global coverage levels of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which has the potential to reduce pneumonia significantly, have yet to reach 50 per cent coverage. measles is a highly contagious disease, and the 69 per cent coverage of the two dose vaccine in 2018 was insufficient to prevent a measles outbreak. "
331,"in 2017, only around one third to half of the global population was covered by essential health services. if current trends continue, only 39 to 63 per cent of the global population will be covered by essential health services by 2030. the proportion of the population spending more than 10 per cent of its household budget on out of pocket payment for health services increased continuously, from 9.4 to 12.7 per cent (927 million persons), between 2000 and 2015. at current rates, the proportion will reach 12.9 per cent, equal to 1 billion persons, in 2020. nearly 90 million persons were pushed into extreme poverty owing to out of pocket medical expenses. official development assistance (oda) for basic health from all donors increased by 41 per cent in real terms since 2010, reaching $10 billion in 2018. in 2018, about $1.7 billion was spent on malaria control, $0.8 billion on tuberculosis control and $1.9 billion on other infectious diseases, excluding hiv/aids. based on data from the period 2013â€“2018, globally, women make up more than 76 per cent of medical doctors and nursing personnel combined, but compose only slightly more than 40 per cent of medical doctors and nearly 90 per cent of nursing personnel. in 2019, 166 countries reported the status of their capacity to implement the international health regulations with regard to preparedness for detecting, reporting and responding to health emergencies such as covid 19. analysis shows that steady progress has been made in nearly every core capacity of the regulations, except in human resources, compared with 2018."
332,"before the covid 19 pandemic, progress had been made in many health areas, including improving the health of mothers and children, increasing immunization coverage and reducing the incidence of communicable diseases, albeit not fast enough to meet the goal 3 targets by 2030. the disruption caused by the pandemic has now halted progress and even reversed some gains made. according to a recent survey, substantial disruptions persist more than a year into the pandemic, with about 90 per cent of countries and territories still reporting one or more disruptions to essential health services. among the health services most extensively affected are those for mental, neurological and substance use disorders; neglected tropical diseases; tuberculosis; hiv and hepatitis b and c; cancer screening; services for other non communicable diseases, including hypertension and diabetes; family planning and contraception; urgent dental care; malnutrition; immunization; and malaria. fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria, the gavi alliance and the united states of america accounted for more than half of that total, providing $2.4 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. in 2019, $3.4 billion was spent on basic health care, $2.2 billion on infectious disease control, excluding hiv/aids, and $2.2 billion on malaria control. health workers are on the front line of the covid 19 pandemic response. countries and territories, especially those with a limited health workforce, are further constrained with regard to the delivery of essential health services. on the basis of data from the period 2013â€“2018, the density of nursing and midwifery personnel in northern america is more than 150 per 10,000 population, which is more than 15 times that in sub saharan african and 8 times that in northern africa and southern asia. the density of medical doctors in northern america, oceania and central asia remains around 25 per 10,000 population, compared to 2 per 10,000 population in sub saharan african."
333,"reproductive, maternal and child health according to data from the period 2014â€“2020, 83 per cent of births worldwide were assisted by skilled health professionals, including medical doctors, nurses and midwives, an increase from 71 per cent in the period from 2007 to 2013. the covid 19 pandemic may reverse gains in skilled childbirth care coverage and disrupt maternity health services. the world has made substantial progress towards the goal of ending preventable child deaths, with the global under 5 mortality rate decreasing from 76 to 38 deaths per 1,000 live births between 2000 and 2019. the global neonatal mortality rate fell from 30 deaths to 17 per 1,000 live births in the same period. even with such progress, 5.2 million children died in 2019 before reaching their fifth birthday, with almost half of those deaths, 2.4 million, occurring in the first month of life. while the full impact of the pandemic on child survival is not yet known, significant disruption to the continued provision of life saving interventions could stall or even reverse the progress made. the proportion of women of reproductive age (15 to 49â€¯years) who have their family planning needs met by modern contraceptive methods has remained steady at around 77 per cent between 2015 and 2021, reaching only 56 per cent in sub  saharan africa and 52 per cent in oceania, excluding australia and new zealand. the ongoing pandemic may lead to reductions in these figures as a result of supply chain disruptions and decreased access to family planning services, while the fertility intentions and family planning needs among women of reproductive age may also change. the global adolescent birth rate has fallen from 56 births per 1,000 adolescent women 15 to 19 years of age in 2000 to 45 births per 1,000 adolescents in 2015 and 41 per 1,000 in 2020. the declines varied considerably across regions, with the largest decrease in central and southern asia from 70 births per 1,000 adolescents in 2000 to 24 births per 1,000 in 2020."
334,"infectious diseases while the rate of new hiv infections declined from 0.48 infections pe r 1,000 uninfected population among adults (15 to 49 years of age) to 0.37 per 1,000 between 2010 and 2019, it remained far higher than the global target for 2020. the largest decrease was in sub saharan africa, the region with the highest numbers of people living with hiv. major inequalities remain in access to hiv prevention, testing and treatment services across regions, countries, and sub populations within countries. there is evidence to suggest that the covid 19 pandemic has caused considerable disruption to hiv services, including testing, initiation of treatment, voluntary medical male circumcision and pre exposure prophylaxis. in 2019, an estimated 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis, of whom 56 per cent were adult men, 32 per cent adult women, 12 per cent children and 8.2 per cent people living with hiv, making it the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. globally, the incidence of tuberculosis fell from 174 new and relapse cases per 100,000 population in 2000 to 130 cases per 100,000 in 2019, a 25 per cent decline over the period, with the tuberculosis mortality rate among hiv negative people falling by 45 per cent in the same period. although the disease burden is decreasing, large gaps in detection and treatment persist, and the current pace of progress is not fast enough to meet the target of ending tuberculosis by 2030. drug   resistant tuberculosis is a continuing threat: in 2019, there were 465,000 new cases with resistance to rifampicin, the most effective first line drug, and 78 per cent of those infected with tuberculosis had a multidrug resistant strain. as a result of the covid 19 pandemic, an estimated 1.4 million fewer people received necessary care for tuberculosis during 2020 compared with the previous year, a reduction in treatment levels of 21 per cent."
335,"non communicable diseases, mental health and environmental risks globally, 74 per cent of all deaths in 2019 were caused by non communicable diseases. the probability of dying from any of the four main non communicable diseases (cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease) between 30 and 70 years of age decreased from 19.9 per cent in 2010 to 17.8 per cent in 2019. the rate of decline is insufficient to meet the goal target. the covid 19 pandemic has underscored the need for further attention to interventions in non communicable diseases, as people with underlying non communicable diseases are at higher risk of severe illness and death from the covid 19 virus. about 700,000 suicide deaths occurred in 2019. the global suicide death rate declined by 29 per cent, from 13 deaths per 100,000 population in 2000 to 9.2 deaths per 100,000 in 2019. in 2019, global alcohol consumption was 5.8 litres of pure alcohol per person 15 years of age or older, a 5 per cent decrease from 6.1 litres in 2010. the global rate of mortality from road traffic injuries fell by 8.3 per cent, from 18.1 deaths per 100,000 population in 2010 to 16.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2019. nevertheless, 1.3 million people worldwide died in road traffic accidents in 2019, 75 per cent of whom were boys and men. low income countries and territories had lower rates of vehicle ownership than in high income countries and territories, yet a death rate more than 3.5 times higher. road traffic injuries were the leading cause of death among young people 15 to 29 years of age worldwide. the global prevalence of tobacco uses among men declined from 50 per cent in 2000 to 38.6 per cent in 2018, and among women from 16.7 per cent in 2000 to 8.5 per cent in 2018. even so, the number of people dying from a tobacco related illness was estimated to be more than 8.1 million in 2017. unintentional poisonings were responsible for more than 84,000 deaths in 2019. although the number of such deaths has steadily declined since 2000, mortality rates continue to be relatively high in low income countries and territories, where they are more than twice the global average. one third of all deaths from unintentional poisonings occurred in sub saharan africa. "
336,"health systems and funding immunization is one of the worldâ€™s most successful and cost effective health interventions. while vaccination coverage among infants increased from 72 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2015 before stalling until 2019, an estimated 19.7 million children did not receive essential vaccines during the first year of their life in 2019. in addition, global coverage levels for the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of pneumonia, have yet to reach 50 per cent. measles is a highly contagious disease, and the 71 per cent coverage of the two dose vaccine in 2019 was insufficient to prevent outbreaks of measles. improvements in essential health services, as measured by the universal health coverage service coverage index, increased from a global average of 45 out of 100 in the year 2000 to 66 in 2017. low income countries and territories experienced the greatest progress, driven mainly by interventions for infectious diseases. however, the pace of progress has slowed since 2010, and the poorest countries and territories and those affected by conflict are generally lagging furthest behind. the covid 19 pandemic is derailing progress even further. before the pandemic, an estimated 927 million people, or 12.7 per cent of the global population, made out of pocket health care payments amounting to more than 10 per cent of their household budgets, and for 209 million people, or 3 per cent, their share of health care spending exceeded 25 per cent of their household budgets, posing an even greater threat to spending on other essential goods and services such as food and education. oda for basic health from all official donors has increased by 59 per cent in real terms since 2010, reaching $11 billion in 2019. the global "
337,"despite progress, the world failed to meet the millennium development goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015. in 2013, the latest year for which data are available, 59 million children of primary school age were out of school. estimates show that, among those 59 million children, 1 in 5 of those children had dropped out and recent trends suggest that 2 in 5 of out of school children will never set foot in a classroom. the sustainable development goals clearly recognize that this gap must be closed, even as the international community more explicitly addresses the challenges of quality and equity. measuring learning achievement, starting in the early grades, will help to identify where schools are failing to meet their commitments to children and to formulate appropriate remedial action. for example, data for 2013 from 15 latin american countries show that in six countries, fewer than 50 per cent of third graders had a minimum level of proficiency in mathematics; in three countries, fewer than half were proficient in reading. at the end of primary school, children should be able to read and write and to understand and use basic concepts in mathematics. however, in 2014, between 40 per cent and 90 per cent of children failed to achieve even minimum levels of proficiency in reading, in 10 african countries, and in nine of those countries, between 40 per cent and 90 per cent of children failed to achieve minimum levels of proficiency in mathematics."
338,"the end of lower secondary education often coincides with the end of compulsory education. by this stage, young people should be able to master subject related knowledge and skills and possess personal and social skills. data from 38 countries in the developed regions show that, in the majority of those countries, at least 75 per cent of young people achieved at least a minimum proficiency in reading and/or mathematics; the same was true for only 5 out of 22 countries, in developing regions, for which data were available. completion rates for both primary and lower secondary education has been rising steadily since 2000. completion rates for primary education in both developed and developing regions exceeded 90 per cent in 2013. at the lower secondary level, the gap between developed and developing regions has narrowed substantially, but still stood at nearly 20 percentage points in 2013 (91 per cent for developed regions and 72 per cent for developing regions). quality early education provides children with basic cognitive and language skills and fosters emotional development. in the majority of the 58 countries with available data for the period 2009 2015, more than half of children between the ages of 3 and 4 were developmentally on track in at least three of the following domains: literacy, numeracy, physical development, social emotional development and learning."
339,"goal 4 strongly supports the reduction of persistent disparities. worldwide, in 2013, two thirds of the 757 million adults (aged 15 and over) who were unable to read and write were women. globally, in 2013, 1 in 10 girls were out of school, compared to 1 in 12 boys. children from the poorest 20 per cent of households are nearly four times more likely to be out of school than their richest peers. out of school rates are also higher in rural areas and among children from households headed by someone with less than a primary education. to fulfil the promise of universal primary and secondary education, new primary school teachers are needed, with current estimates showing a need for nearly 26 million of them by 2030. africa faces the greatest challenges in this regard, with nearly 7 in 10 countries experiencing acute shortages of trained primary school teachers. in 2013, only 71 per cent of teachers in sub saharan africa and 84 per cent in northern africa were trained in accordance with national standards. official development assistance for educational scholarships amounted to around $1.1 billion annually from 2011 to 2013. it totalled $1.2 billion in 2014, with australia, france and japan being the largest contributors.  almost half of countries and territories with recent data did not achieve gender parity in primary completion, and only a handful of countries and territories demonstrate parity in tertiary enrolment ratios. "
340,"achieving inclusive and equitable quality education for all will require increasing efforts, especially in sub saharan africa and southern asia and for vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities, indigenous people, refugee children and poor children in rural areas. in 2014, about 2 in 3 children worldwide participated in pre primary or primary education in the year prior to official entry age for primary school. however, in the least developed countries, the ratio was only 4 in 10. despite considerable gains in education enrolment over the past 15 years, worldwide, the adjusted net enrolment rates were 91 per cent for primary education, 84 per cent for lower secondary education and 63 per cent for upper secondary education in 2014. about 263 million children and youth were out of school, including 61 million children of primary school age. sub saharan africa and southern asia account for over 70 per cent of the global out ofschool population in primary and secondary education. even though more children than ever are going to school, many do not acquire basic skills in reading and mathematics. recent learning assessment studies show that in 9 of 24 sub saharan african countries and 6 of 15 latin american countries with data, fewer than half of the students at the end of primary education had attained minimum proficiency levels in mathematics. in 6 of 24 sub saharan african countries with data, fewer than half of the students who finished their primary schooling had attained minimum proficiency levels in reading."
341,"equity issues constitute a major challenge in education according to a recent assessment. in all countries with data, children from the richest 20 per cent of households achieved greater proficiency in reading at the end of their primary and lower secondary education than children from the poorest 20 per cent of households. in most countries with data, urban children scored higher in reading than rural children. the lack of trained teachers and the poor condition of schools in many parts of the world are jeopardizing prospects for quality education for all. sub  saharan africa has a relatively low percentage of trained teachers in pre  primary, primary and secondary education (44 per cent, 74 per cent and 55 per cent, respectively). moreover, the majority of schools in the region do not have access to electricity or potable water. on the basis of data from 65 developing countries, the average percentage of schools with access to computers and the internet for teaching purposes is above 60 per cent in both primary and secondary education. however, the share is less than 40 per cent in more than half of sub saharan countries with data. official development assistance (oda) for scholarships amounted to $1 billion in 2015, a decrease from $1.2 billion in 2014. australia, france and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland were the largest contributors."
342,"more than half of children and adolescents worldwide are not meeting minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. refocused efforts are needed to improve the quality of education. disparities in education along the lines of gender, urban rural location and other dimensions still run deep, and more investments in education infrastructure are required, particularly in ldcs. at the global level, the participation rate in early childhood and primary education was 70 per cent in 2016, up from 63 per cent in 2010. the lowest rates are found in sub saharan africa (41 per cent) and northern africa and western asia (52 per cent). an estimated 617 million children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school age worldwideâ€”58 per cent of that age groupâ€”are not achieving minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics. in 2016, an estimated 85 per cent of primary school teachers worldwide were trained; the proportion was only 71 per cent for southern asia and 61 per cent for sub saharan africa in 2016, only 34 per cent of primary schools in ldcs had electricity and less than 40 per cent were equipped with basic handwashing facilities. despite the considerable progress on education access and participation over the past years, 262 million children and youth aged 6 to 17 were still out of school in 2017, and more than half of children and adolescents are not meeting minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. rapid technological changes present opportunities and challenges, but the learning environment, the capacities of teachers and the quality of education have not kept pace. "
343,"refocused efforts are needed to improve learning outcomes for the full life cycle, especially for women, girls and marginalized people in vulnerable settings. in 72 countries with recent data, approximately 7 in 10 children aged 3 and 4 were developmentally on track in at least three of the following domains: literacy numeracy, physical development, social emotional development and learning. in 2015, an estimated 617 million children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school age worldwide â€“ more than 50 per cent â€“ were not achieving minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics. of these, about two thirds were attending school but were not learning in the classroom, or dropped out school. some 750 million adults â€“ two thirds of them women â€“ remained illiterate in 2016. half of the global illiterate population lives in south asia, and a quarter live in sub saharan africa. many developing countries still lack basic infrastructure and facilities to provide effective learning environments. sub saharan africa faces the biggest challenges: at the primary and lower secondary levels, less than half of schools have access to electricity, the internet, computers and basic drinking water. oda for scholarships amounted to $1.3 billion in 2017. australia, france, japan, the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and institutions of the european union accounted for nearly two thirds of this total. globally, there has been little progress in the percentage of primary school teachers who are trained: it has been stagnating at about 85 per cent since 2015. the proportion is lowest in sub saharan africa (64 per cent)."
344,"at the end of 2019, millions of children and young people were still out of school, and more than half of those in school were not meeting minimum proficiency standards in reading and numeracy. the closure of schools to slow the spread of covid 19 is having an adverse impact on learning outcomes and the social and behavioural development of children and young people. it has affected more than 90 per cent of the worldâ€™s student population, 1.5 billion children and young people. although remote learning is provided to many students, children and young people in vulnerable and disadvantaged communities, such as those living in remote areas, extreme poverty, fragile states and refugee camps, do not have the same access thereto. the digital divide will widen existing gaps in equality with regard to education. in 74 countries with comparable data for the 2011â€“2019 period, around 7 in 10 children 3 and 4 years of age were on track developmentally in at least three of the following domains: literacy numeracy, physical development, social emotional development and learning. participation in organized learning one year before the official primary age of entry grew steadily, from 62 per cent in 2010 to 67 per cent in 2018. however, variation among countries is still wide, with values ranging from 9 to nearly 100 per cent. the primary school completion rate reached 84 per cent in 2018, up from 70 per cent in 2000.  "
345,"under current trends, the rate is expected to reach 89 per cent globally by 2030. in 2018, 258 million children, adolescents and young people 6 to 17 years of age were still out of school, representing 17 per cent of the global population of that age group. parity between children or adolescents from the richest and poorest quintiles of the population was achieved in 25 per cent of countries for primary education, 21 per cent of countries for lower secondary education and only 1 per cent of countries for upper secondary education. in 2018, some 773 million adults, two thirds of them women, remained illiterate in terms of reading and writing skills. the global adult literacy rate, for the population 15 years of age and older, was 86 per cent in 2018, while the youth literacy rate, for the population 15 to 24 years of age, was 92 per cent. southern asia is home to nearly half of the global illiterate population, and sub saharan africa is home to one quarter thereof. in 2019, less than one half of primary and lower secondary schools in subsaharan africa had access to electricity, the internet, computers and basic handwashing facilities, key basic services and facilities necessary to ensure a safe and effective learning environment for all students. oda for scholarships amounted to $1.6 billion in 2018, up from $1.3 billion in 2017. based on data from 129 countries, the percentage of primary school teachers receiving the minimum pedagogical training according to national standards throughout the world has stagnated at 85 per cent since 2015. the percentage is lowest in sub saharan africa (64 per cent) and southern asia (72 per cent)."
346,"the impact of the covid 19 pandemic on schooling is a generational catastrophe. before the pandemic, progress was already slow and insufficient to achieve the education targets in the goals. school closures caused by the pandemic have had devastating consequences for childrenâ€™s learning and well being. hundreds of millions of children and young people are falling behind in their learning, which will have long term impacts. one year into the covid 19 crisis, two thirds of students worldwide are still affected by full or partial school closures. the most vulnerable children and those unable to access remote learning are at increased risk of never returning to school and of being forced into child marriage or child labour. it is estimated that 101 million additional children and young people (from grades 1 to 8) fell below the minimum reading proficiency level in 2020 owing to the consequences of the pandemic, which wiped out the education gains achieved over the past 20 years. reading proficiency levels could recover by 2024, but only if exceptional efforts are devoted to the task through remedial and catch up strategies. just before the pandemic, 53 per cent of young people were completing secondary school globally, although the figure for sub saharan africa was only 29 per cent. the rise in school completion rates may slow or even reverse depending on the duration of school closures, which are resulting in learning losses and affecting the motivation to attend school, and on the extent to which poverty might increase, adding to the obstacles faced by disadvantaged children."
347,"data from before the pandemic for 76 mostly low  and middle income countries and territories covering the period 2012â€“2020 indicate that 7 in 10 children who are 3 and 4 years of age are on track developmentally, with no significant differences between the sexes. however, many young children are unable to attend early education because of the pandemic and so are now entirely reliant on their caregivers for nurturing care. unsafe conditions, negative interactions with caregivers and a lack of educational opportunities during the early years can lead to irreversible outcomes, affecting childrenâ€™s potential for the remainder of their lives. the rate of participation in organized learning one year before the official age of entry into primary education rose steadily in the years before the pandemic, from 65 per cent in 2010 to 73 per cent in 2019, but with variation among countries and territories ranging from 12 per cent to nearly 100 per cent. gender parity has been achieved in every region. the progress made over past years has been at risk since 2020 because early education facilities and primary schools closed in most countries and territories, preventing or limiting access to education, especially for children from low  and middle income countries and territories. disparities in access to education and learning outcomes persist across a range of education indicators. for example, there were still only 92 literate women and girls 15 years of age or older for every 100 literate boys and men of the same ag e range in 2019."
348,"disparities by urban/rural geographical location and household wealth are typically more extreme, with one third and one sixth of countries and territories achieving parity in primary completion, respectively, and no countries or territories with recent data achieving parity in tertiary attendance. the pandemic is expected to lead to a reversal in recent progress towards equity. with the shift towards remote learning, those from the poorest households and other vulnerable groups are less equipped to participate and more likely to drop out permanently or for extended periods. according to data for the period from 2017 to 2019, more than one fifth of primary schools worldwide do not have access to basic drinking water, and more than one third lack basic handwashing facilities. in the least developed countries, more than two thirds of primary schools do not have access to electricity, with even lower rates of internet access and computer availability for pedagogical purposes in schools. oda for scholarships amounted to $1.7 billion in 2019, up from $1.3 billion in 2017. the european union, france, japan, saudi arabia and turkey accounted for 55 per cent of this total. in 2019, 81 per cent of primary school teachers were trained, although that proportion was lower in sub saharan africa (65 per cent) and southern asia (74 per cent). with the unprecedented lockdown as a result of the pandemic leading to total or partial school closures in most countries and territories, the teaching workforce was severely affected."
349,"gender equality and womenâ€™s empowerment have advanced in recent decades. girlsâ€™ access to education has improved, the rate of child marriage declined and progress was made in the area of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including fewer maternal deaths. nevertheless, gender equality remains a persistent challenge for countries worldwide and the lack of such equality is a major obstacle to sustainable development. assuring womenâ€™s rights through legal frameworks is a first step in addressing discrimination against them. as of 2014, 143 countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their constitutions; another 52 countries have yet to make this important commitment. in 132 countries, the statutory legal age of marriage is equal for women and men, while in another 63 countries, the legal age of marriage is lower for women than for men. violence against women and girls violates their human rights and hinders development. most such violence is perpetrated by intimate partners, with available data from surveys conducted between 2005 and 2015, in 52 countries, (including only one country from the developed regions) indicating that 21 per cent of girls and women aged between 15 and 49 experienced physical and/or sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner in the previous 12 months. estimates on the risks of violence experienced by women with disabilities, women from ethnic minorities and among women above the age of 50 are not yet included, owing to data limitations. additionally, human trafficking disproportionately affects women and girls, since 70 per cent of all victims detected worldwide are female."
350,"globally, the proportion of women aged between 20 and 24 who reported that they were married before their eighteenth birthday dropped from 32 per cent around 1990 to 26 per cent around 2015. child marriage is most common in southern asia and sub saharan africa, with 44 per cent of women married before their eighteenth birthday in southern asia and 37 per cent of women married before their eighteenth birthday in sub saharan africa. the marriage of girls under the age 15 is also highest in those two regions, at 16 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. social norms can and do change, however, with the rate of marriage of girls under the age of 15 declining globally from 12 per cent around 1990 to 7 per cent around 2015, although disparities are found across regions and countries. the most rapid reduction in child marriage overall was recorded in northern africa, where the percentage of women married before the age of 18 dropped by more than half, from 29 per cent to 13 per cent, over the past 25 years. the harmful practice of female genital mutilation/cutting is another human rights violation that affects girls and women worldwide. while the exact number of girls and women globally who have undergone the procedure is unknown, at least 200 million have been subjected to the procedure in 30 countries with representative prevalence data.  overall, rates of female genital mutilation/cutting have been declining over the past three decades. however, not all countries have made progress and the pace of decline has been uneven. women are still underrepresented in managerial positions. in the majority of the 67 countries with data from 2009 to 2015, fewer than a third of senior  and middle management positions were held by women."
351,"today, in the 30 countries, for which data were available, around 1 in 3 girls aged 15 to 19 have undergone the practice, versus 1 in 2 in the mid 1980s. in every region, women and girls do the bulk of unpaid work, including caregiving and such household tasks as cooking and cleaning. on average, women report that they spend 19 per cent of their time each day in unpaid activities, versus 8 per cent for men. the responsibilities of unpaid care and domestic work, combined with paid work, means greater total work burdens for women and girls and less time for rest, self care, learning and other activities. globally, womenâ€™s participation in parliament rose to 23 per cent in 2016, representing an increase by 6 percentage points over a decade. slow progress in this area is in contrast with more women in parliamentary leadership positions. in 2016, the number of women speakers of national parliaments jumped from 43 to 49 (out of the 273 posts globally); women accounted for 18 per cent of all speakers of parliament in january 2016. gender inequality persists worldwide, depriving women and girls of their basic rights and opportunities. achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls will require more vigorous efforts, including legal frameworks, to counter deeply rooted gender based discrimination that often results from patriarchal attitudes and related social norms. on the basis of data from 2005 to 2016 for 87 countries, 19 per cent of women between 15 and 49 years of age said they had experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner in the 12 months prior to the survey. "
352,"in the most extreme cases, such violence can lead to death. in 2012, almost half of all women who were victims of intentional homicide worldwide were killed by an intimate partner or family member, compared to 6 per cent of male victims. child marriage is declining, but not fast enough. around 2000, nearly 1 in 3 women between 20 and 24 years of age reported that they were married before 18 years of age. around 2015, the ratio was just over 1 in 4. the decline is driven by an even steeper reduction in the marriage rate among girls under 15 years of age during that period. the harmful practice of female genital mutilation/cutting has declined by 24 per cent since around 2000. nevertheless, prevalence remains high in some of the 30 countries with representative data. in those countries, survey data from around 2015 indicate that more than 1 in 3 girls between 15 and 19 years of age have undergone the procedure compared to nearly 1 in 2 girls around 2000. the average amount of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is more than threefold higher for women than men, according to survey data from 83 countries and areas. available data indicate that time spent on domestic chores accounts for a large proportion of the gender gap in unpaid work. globally, womenâ€™s participation in single or lower houses of national parliaments reached 23.4 per cent in 2017, just 10 percentage points higher than in 2000. such slow progress suggests that stronger political commitment and more ambitious measures and quotas are needed to boost womenâ€™s political participation and empowerment."
353,
354,"just over half (52 per cent) of women between 15 and 49 years of age who are married or in union make their own decisions about consensual sexual relations and use of contraceptives and health services. that statistic is based on available data from around 2012 for 45 countries, 43 of which are in developing regions. while some forms of discrimination against women and girls are diminishing, gender inequality continues to hold women back and deprives them of basic rights and opportunities. empowering women requires addressing structural issues such as unfair social norms and attitudes as well as developing progressive legal frameworks that promote equality between women and men. based on 2005â€“2016 data from 56 countries, 20 per cent of adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 who have ever been in a sexual relationship experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner in the 12 months prior to the survey. globally, around 2017, an estimated 21 per cent of women between 20 and 24 years of age reported that they were married or in an informal union before age 18. this means that an estimated 650 million girls and women today were married in childhood. rates of child marriage have continued to decline around the world. in southern asia, a girl s risk of marrying in childhood has dropped by over 40 per cent since around 2000. around 2017, one in three girls aged 15 to 19 had been subjected to female genital mutilation in the 30 countries where the practice is concentrated, compared to nearly one in two around 2000. based on data between 2000 and 2016 from about 90 countries, women spend roughly three times as many hours in unpaid domestic and care work as men. globally, the percentage of women in single or lower houses of national parliament has increased from 19 per cent in 2010 to around 23 per cent in 2018."
355,"while some indicators of gender equality are progressing, such as a significant decline in the prevalence of female genital mutilation and early marriage, the overall numbers continue to be high. moreover, insufficient progress on structural issues at the root of gender inequality, such as legal discrimination, unfair social norms and attitudes, decision making on sexual and reproductive issues and low levels of political participation, are undermining the ability to achieve sustainable development goal 5. recent data from 106 countries show that 18 per cent of ever partnered women and girls aged 15 to 49 have experienced physical and/or sexual partner violence in the previous 12 months. the prevalence is highest in least developed countries, at 24 per cent. the practice of child marriage has continued to decline around the world, largely driven by progress in south asia, where a girlâ€™s risk of marrying in childhood decreased by about one quarter between 2013 and 2018. in sub saharan africa, levels of child marriage have declined at a more modest rate. at least 200 million girls and women have been subjected to female genital mutilation, based on data from 30 countries where the practice is concentrated and where nationally representative prevalence data is available. in these countries, the prevalence of this harmful practice declined by one quarter between approximately 2000 and 2018. according to recent data from some 90 countries, women devote on average roughly three times more hours a day to unpaid care and domestic work than men, limiting the time available for paid work, education and leisure and further reinforcing gender based socioeconomic disadvantages."
356,"women continue to be underrepresented at all levels of political leadership. as at 1 january 2019, womenâ€™s representation in national parliaments ranged from 0 to 61.3 per cent, with the average standing at 24.2 per cent, an increase from 19 per cent in 2010. at the local level, data from 99 countries and areas show that womenâ€™s representation in elected deliberative bodies varies from less than 1 per cent to 48 per cent, with the median of the distribution at 26 per cent. when legislated gender quotas are adopted, significantly higher proportions of women are elected at both national and local levels. while women represented 39 per cent of world employment, only 27 per cent of managerial positions in the world were occupied by women in 2018, up only marginally from 26 per cent in 2015. the proportion of women in management has increased since 2000 in all regions except in least developed countries. in 51 countries with data on the subject, only 57 per cent of women aged 15 to 49, married or in union, make their own decisions about sexual relations and the use of contraceptives and health services. over the past 25 years, there has been progress in reforming laws towards improving gender equality, yet discriminatory laws and gaps in legal protection remain in many countries. on the basis of data collected across four areas of law in 2018 from 53 countries, almost a third have legal gaps in the area of overarching legal frameworks and public life (e.g., constitutions, antidiscrimination laws, quotas, legal aid); more than a quarter have legal gaps in the area of violence against women; and 29 per cent and 24 per cent have legal gaps in the employment and economic benefits area and in the marriage and family area, respectively. "
357,"despite progress in implementing gender responsive budgeting globally, gaps remain in country efforts to establish comprehensive and transparent tracking systems. based on 2018 data from 69 countries, 13 countries fully met the criteria of having in place a tracking system that measures and makes publicly available gender budget data, and 41 countries approached the requirements. the commitment to advancing gender equality has brought about improvements in some areas, but the promise of a world in which every woman and girl enjoy full gender equality and all legal, social and economic barriers to their empowerment have been removed remains unfulfilled. the current pandemic is also hitting women and girls hard. globally, women make up three quarters of medical doctors and nursing personnel. women already spend three times as many hours as men on unpaid care work at home. the closure of school and day care centres requires parents, women in particular, to care more for children and facilitate their learning at home. reports from several countries suggest that domestic violence against women and children is also rising during the global lockdown. in 2019, one in five young women 20 to 24 years of age throughout the world was married in childhood, down from one in four in 2004 and with the highest figure in sub saharan africa, with more than one in three young women. at least 200 million girls and women have been subjected to female genital mutilation, according to recent data from the 31 countries where the practice is concentrated. the harmful practice is becoming less common, but progress is not fast enough to meet the global target of its elimination by 2030. "
358,"as at 1 january 2020, representation by women in single or lower houses of national parliament reached 24.9 per cent, up slightly from 22.3 per cent in 2015. women have better access to decision making positions at the local level, holding 36 per cent of elected seats in local deliberative bodies, based on data from 133 countries and areas. in 2019, 28 per cent of managerial positions in the world were occupied by women, a small increase from 25 per cent in 2000, while women represented 39 per cent of the worldâ€™s workers and half of the worldâ€™s working age population. based on data from 57 countries for the period 2007â€“2018, only 55 per cent of married or in union women 15 to 49 years of age made their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health and rights, ranging from less than 40 per cent in central and western africa to nearly 80 per cent in some countries in europe, south eastern asia and latin america and the caribbean. in 2019, in the 75 countries with data, on average, 73 per cent of the laws and regulations needed to guarantee full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights were in place. the findings are particularly encouraging with regard to hiv: on average, countries achieved 87 per cent of enabling laws and regulations for hiv counselling and test services, 91 per cent for hiv treatment and care services and 96 per cent for hiv confidentiality. empowering women with mobile telephones has been shown to accelerate social and economic development. however, in the 66 countries with data for the 2016â€“2018 period, the rate of mobile telephone ownership among men was on average 6.8 percentage points higher than the rate among women."
359,"the socioeconomic impacts of the covid 19 pandemic have adversely affected recent progress on gender equality: violence against women and girls has intensified, child marriage is expected to increase after declining in previous years, and increased care work at home is affecting women disproportionately. the pandemic has highlighted the need for swift action to address the gender inequality that remains pervasive globally and to get back on track for achieving gender equality. women have played a critical role in the response to the pandemic as front line health workers, caregivers, and managers and leaders of the response and recovery efforts. however, they remain underrepresented in critical leadership positions, and their rights and priorities are often not explicitly addressed in those efforts. the crisis presents an opportunity to reshape and rebuild systems, laws, policies and institutions in order to advance gender equality. discriminatory laws and legal gaps continue to prevent women from fully enjoying their human rights. according to data for 2020 from 95 countries and territories, more than half lacked quotas for women in the national parliament; 83 per cent included budgetary commitments to implement legislation addressing violence against women, although 63 per cent continued to lack rape laws based on the principle of consent; more than 90 per cent prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of gender, yet almost half continued to restrict women from working in certain jobs or industries; and almost one quarter did not grant women equal rights to men for entering into marriage and initiating divorce proceedings. new estimates based on surveys from the period 2000â€“2018 confirm that nearly 736 million women, or one in three, have been subjected to physical violence, sexual violence or both by a husband or intimate partner, or sexual violence by a non partner, at least once in their lifetime from 15 years of age â€“ a figure that has remained largely unchanged over the past decade. "
360,"intimate partner violence starts early, with nearly 24 per cent of adolescent girls 15 to 19 years of age and 26 per cent of young women 20 to 24 years of age who have ever had a partner or been married having experienced such violence already. over the past decade, the practice of child marriage has declined significantly, with the global proportion of young women who were married as children decreasing by 15 per cent, from nearly one in four in 2010 to one in five in 2020. as a result of this progress, the child marriages of some 25 million girls have been averted. however, the profound effects of the pandemic are threatening this progress, with up to 10 million additional girls at risk of child marriage in the next decade as a result of the pandemic. according to data from 31 countries and territories in which the practice is concentrated, at least 200 million women and girls have been subjected to female genital mutilation. despite some progress, there are still countries and territories in which at least 9 in 10 girls and women ranging from 15 to 49 years of age have been subjected to such mutilation, making the harmful practice almost universal. the latest data collected on 90 countries and territories between 2001 and 2019 indicate that, on an average day, women spend about 2.5 times as many hours as men on unpaid domestic work and care work. as at 1 january 2021, data from 135 countries and territories indicated that the global average proportion of women in the single or lower houses of parliaments had reached 25.6 per cent, continuing a slow upward trend that would require 40 years for gender parity to be achieved, while the proportion of women in local deliberative bodies was 36.3 per cent. "
361,"there are 40 per cent or more women in the lower or single parliamentary houses of only 23 countries and territories and in the local governments of only 22 countries and territories, proportions achieved through the use of gender quotas in most of the countries and territories. by 2019, women accounted for nearly 39 per cent of the global labour force, but held only 28.3 per cent of managerial positions, a rise of 3 percentage points since 2000. the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women in the workforce, and female entrepreneurs in particular, threatens to roll back the little progress made in reducing the global gender gap in managerial positions. data for 2020 from 36 countries and territories on national legal framework guarantees for womenâ€™s equal rights to land ownership show that substantial improvement has been achieved in establishing equal inheritance rights (69 per cent) and establishing spousal consent requirements for land transactions (61 per cent), while progress is lagging in areas including land registration, customary law, and womenâ€™s representation in land governance. empowering more women with mobile telephones has been shown to accelerate social and economic development. however, in the 66 countries and territories with data for the period 2017â€“2019, average mobile telephone ownership was 8.5 percentage points lower for women than for men. in 2018, 81 per cent of the 69 countries and territories for which there are data needed to improve their systems for tracking budget allocations for gender equality. in the context of the covid 19 pandemic, strengthening these systems through the comprehensive use of gender budgeting tools will contribute to the better targeting of resources for a gender responsive recovery."
362,"water and sanitation are at the very core of sustainable development, critical to the survival of people and the planet. goal 6 not only addresses the issues relating to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, but also the quality and sustainability of water resources worldwide. in 2015, 4.9 billion people globally used an improved sanitation facility; 2.4 billion did not. among those lacking adequate sanitation were 946 million people without any facilities at all, who continued to practise open defecation. in 2015, 68 per cent of the global population was using improved sanitation facilities compared to 59 per cent in 2000. nevertheless, the unsafe management of faecal waste and wastewater continues to present a major risk to public health and the environment. more progress has been made in access to drinking water. in 2015, 6.6 billion people, or 91 per cent of the global population, used an improved drinking water source, versus 82 per cent in 2000. despite that improvement, an estimated 663 million people were using unimproved water sources or surface water that year. while coverage was around 90 per cent or more in all regions except sub saharan africa and oceania, widespread inequalities persist within and among countries. moreover, not all improved sources are safe. for instance, in 2012 it was estimated that at least 1.8 billion people were exposed to drinking water sources contaminated with faecal matter. holistic management of the water cycle means taking into account the level of water stress, calculated as the ratio of total fresh water withdrawn by all major sectors to the total renewable fresh water resources in a particular country or region."
363,"integrated water resources management, one of the follow up actions to the plan of implementation of the world summit on sustainable development (johannesburg plan of implementation), aims to address this urgent situation. in 2012, 65 per cent of the 130 countries that responded to a survey question on integrated water resources management reported that management plans were in place at the national level. total official flows for water and sanitation were $10 billion in 2014, of which total aid flows from dac donors amounted to $8 billion. aid for water and sanitation nearly doubled as a share of oda during the international drinking water supply and sanitation decade (1981 1990). since that time, on average, it has remained at around 7 per cent of total aid flows. better targeting and tracking of water aid within the context of national situations is needed. for instance, numerous countries with limited access to water supply and/or sanitation have been receiving minimal external assistance (typically less than $2 per capita annually), while other countries with higher levels of access have received much more (at least $30 per capita a year). effective water and sanitation management also depends on the participation of stakeholders. according to a 2013 2014 global analysis and assessment of sanitation and drinking water survey, 83 per cent of the 94 countries surveyed reported that procedures for stakeholder participation were clearly defined in law or policy. in the sustainable development goals, the focus is being refined to also include the participation of local communities, which will be captured in the next cycle of global analysis and assessment of sanitation and drinking water monitoring"
364,"access to safe water and sanitation and sound management of freshwater ecosystems are essential to human health and to environmental sustainability and economic prosperity. in 2015, 6.6 billion people (over 90 per cent of the worldâ€™s population) used improved drinking water sources and 4.9 billion people (over two thirds of the worldâ€™s population) used improved sanitation facilities. in both cases, people without access live predominantly in rural areas. achieving universal access to basic sanitation and ending the unsafe practice of open defecation will require substantial acceleration of progress in rural areas of central and southern asia, eastern and south eastern asia and sub saharan africa. effective water and sanitation management relies on the participation of a range of stakeholders, including local communities. a 2016 2017 survey found that over 80 per cent of 74 responding countries had clearly defined procedures for engaging service users/communities in water and sanitation management. more than 2 billion people globally are living in countries with excess water stress, defined as the ratio of total freshwater withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resources above a threshold of 25 per cent. northern africa and western asia experience water stress levels above 60 per cent, which indicates the strong probability of future water scarcity. in 2012, 65 per cent of the 130 countries that responded to a survey on integrated water resources management reported that management plans were in place at the national level. oda for the water sector has been rising steadily, but has remained relatively constant as a proportion of total oda disbursements, at approximately 5 per cent since 2005. in 2015, oda disbursements in the water sector totalled about $8.6 billion, which represents an increase of 67 per cent in real terms since 2005."
365,"too many people still lack access to safely managed water supplies and sanitation facilities. water scarcity, flooding and lack of proper wastewater management also hinder social and economic development. increasing water efficiency and improving water management are critical to balancing the competing and growing water demands from various sectors and users. in 2015, 29 per cent of the global population lacked safely managed drinking water supplies, and 61 per cent were without safely managed sanitation services. in 2015, 892 million people continued to practise open defecation. in 2015, only 27 per cent of the population in ldcs had basic handwashing facilities. preliminary estimates from household data of 79 mostly high  and high middle income countries (excluding much of africa and asia) suggest that 59 per cent of all domestic wastewater is safely treated. in 22 countries, mostly in the northern africa and western asia region and in the central and southern asia region, the water stress level is above 70 per cent, indicating the strong probability of future water scarcity. in 2017â€“2018, 157 countries reported average implementation of integrated water resources management of 48 per cent. based on data from 62 out of 153 countries sharing transboundary waters, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was only 59 per cent in 2017.  currently, water stress affects more than 2 billion people around the world, a figure that is projected to rise. already, water stress affects countries on every continent and hinders the sustainability of natural resources, as well as economic and social development."
366,"despite progress, billions of people still lack safe water, sanitation and handwashing facilities. data suggests that achieving universal access to even basic sanitation service by 2030 would require doubling the current annual rate of progress. more efficient use and management of water are critical to addressing the growing demand for water, threats to water security and the increasing frequency and severity of droughts and floods resulting from climate change. as of the time of writing, most countries are unlikely to reach full implementation of integrated water resources management by 2030. globally, the proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services increased from 61 to 71 per cent between 2000 and 2015 and remained unchanged in 2017. an additional 19 per cent of the global population used basic drinking water services. this means that 785 million people still lacked even a basic drinking water service. the global population using safely managed sanitation services increased from 28 per cent in 2000 to 43 per cent in 2015 and to 45 per cent in 2017, with the greatest increases occurring in latin america and the caribbean, sub saharan africa and east and south east asia. between 2000 and 2017, the proportion lacking even a basic sanitation service decreased from 44 to 27 per cent, yet 701 million people still practiced open defecation in 2017. e/2019/68 19 07404 13/39 in 2017, some 60 per cent of people worldwide and only 38 per cent in least developed countries had a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home, leaving an estimated 3 billion people without basic handwashing facilities at home."
367,"in 2016, one third of all primary schools lacked basic drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services, affecting the education of millions of schoolchildren, but particularly girls managing menstruation, and one in four health care facilities worldwide lacked basic water services, affecting more than 2 billion people. approximately one third of countries have medium or high levels of water stress. almost all countries that have registered high water stress are located in north africa and west asia or in central and south asia, and these levels indicate serious water difficulties in the supply of freshwater, at least during parts of the year. of 172 countries, 80 per cent have medium low implementation or better of integrated water resources management. however, 60 per cent of countries are unlikely to reach the target of full implementation by 2030. a significant effort is needed to ensure that cooperation is operational in all transboundary basins. according to data from 67 of 153 countries that share transboundary waters, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was 59 per cent in the period 2017â€“2018, with only 17 countries reporting that all their transboundary basins were covered by such arrangements. following several years of steady increases and after reaching $9 billion in 2016, oda disbursements to the water sector declined by 2 per cent from 2016 to 2017. however, oda commitments to the water sector jumped by 36 per cent between 2016 and 2017, indicating a renewed focus by donors on the sector."
368,"billions of people throughout the world still lack access to safely managed water and sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities at home, which are critical to preventing spreading the spread of covid 19. immediate action to improve water, sanitation and hygiene for all (wash) is critical to preventing infection and containing its spread. in 2017, only 71 per cent of the global population used safely managed drinking water and just 45 per cent used safely managed sanitation services, leaving 2.2 billion persons without safely managed drinking water, including 785 million without even basic drinking water, and 4.2 billion without safely managed sanitation. of those, 673 million persons still practised open defecation. in 2016, one in four health care facilities throughout the world lacked basic water services, and one in five had no sanitation services. in 2017, 3 billion persons lacked soap and water at home. in 2016, 47 per cent of schools worldwide lacked handwashing facilities with available soap and water, and 40 per cent of health care facilities were not equipped to practise hand hygiene at points of care. preliminary estimates from 79 mostly high  and higher middle income countries in 2019 suggest that, in about one quarter of the countries, less than half of all household wastewater flows were treated safely. in 2011, 41 countries experienced water stress, an increase from 36 countries in 1998. of those, 10 countries, on the arabian peninsula, in central asia and in northern africa, withdrew more than 100 per cent of their renewable fresh water resources."
369,"in 2017, central and southern asia and northern africa registered very high water stress â€“ defined as the ratio of fresh water withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resources â€“ of more than 70 per cent, followed by western asia and eastern asia, with high water stress of 54 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively. in 2018, 60 per cent of 172 countries reported very low, low and medium low levels of implementation of integrated water resources management and were unlikely to meet the implementation target by 2030. according to data from 67 countries, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was 59 per cent in the period 2017â€“2018. only 17 countries reported that all of their transboundary basins were covered by such arrangements. â· globally, in 2018, slightly more than 2.1 per cent of land was covered by freshwater bodies, although unevenly distributed, ranging from 3.5 per cent in developed countries to only 1.4 per cent in developing countries and 1.2 per cent and 1 per cent in least developed countries and small island developing states, respectively. the adverse effects of climate change can decrease the extent of freshwater bodies, thereby worsening ecosystems and livelihoods. oda disbursements to the water sector increased to $9 billion, or 6 per cent, in 2018, following a decrease in such disbursements in 2017. however, oda commitments fell by 9 per cent in 2018. because countries have signalled a funding gap of 61 per cent between what is needed to achieve national drinking water and sanitation targets and available funding, increasing donor commitments to the water sector will remain crucial to make progress towards goal 6."
370,"billions of people worldwide still live without safely managed drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services, which are critical for protecting human health and containing the spread of the covid 19 virus. over the past century, global water use has increased at more than twice the rate of population growth. in addition to water stress, countries and territories are facing growing challenges linked to water pollution, degraded water related ecosystems, water scarcity caused by climate change, and a lack of cooperation on transboundary waters. the world is not on track to achieve goal 6. a dramatic acceleration is needed in the current rates of progress and in integrated and holistic approaches to water management. between 2000 and 2020, the global population using safely managed drinkingwater and sanitation services increased by 2 billion and 2.4 billion, respectively. despite the progress, 2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water services, 3.6 billion safely managed sanitation services and 2.3 billion basic hygiene services in 2020. one in three people worldwide still lack basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home, leaving them especially vulnerable to the covid 19 virus. among the 42 countries and territories reporting on total wastewater generation and treatment in 2015, 32 per cent of wastewater flows were subject to some form of treatment. an estimated 56 per cent of wastewater generated by households in 2020 was safely treated, according to data from 128 countries and territories."
371,"an assessment of rivers, lakes and aquifers of 89 countries and territories in 2020 indicates that the water quality of 72 per cent of the water bodies assessed is good. protection is easier than restoration, so efforts to protect these water bodies from pollution must be initiated now. improving water use efficiency is a key measure that can contribute to reducing water stress in a country. global efficiency increased from $17.30 per m3 in 2015 to $19 per m3 in 2018, a 10 per cent increase. all economic sectors have experienced an increase in water use efficiency since 2015, with increases of 15 per cent in the industrial sector, 8 per cent in the agricultural sector and 8 per cent in the services sector. in 2018, global water stress was estimated to be 18.4 per cent, an increase from 18.2 per cent in 2015. regions such as western and southern asia and northern africa present very high levels of water stress at more than 70 per cent, while southeastern asia, latin america and the caribbean, and sub saharan africa saw their water stress levels increase from 2017 to 2018. in 2020, 129 countries and territories were not on track to meet the target for implementing integrated water resources management by 2030, which includes financing and intersectoral coordination mechanisms, basin management and monitoring. the rate of implementation needs to double globally. in many countries and territories, the covid 19 pandemic has led to wider stakeholder engagement in water resources management through online consultations."
372,"advancing transboundary water cooperation plays a crucial role in preventing conflicts and supporting wider regional integration, peace and sustainable development. however, according to data from 2017 and 2020, only 24 of the 153 countries and territories that share transboundary rivers, lakes and aquifers have 100 per cent of their transboundary basin area covered by operational arrangements, and only another 22 countries and territories have more than 70 per cent covered. freshwater ecosystems and the multitude of resources that they provide are changing dramatically. one fifth of the worldâ€™s river basins are experiencing rapid increases or decreases in surface water area. this unprecedented situation is compounded by pollution in large lakes and the persistent loss and degradation of wetlands and freshwater biodiversity. between 1970 and 2015, the total area of inland and marine or coastal wetlands declined by approximately 35 per cent, three times the rate of forest loss. existing efforts to protect and restore water related ecosystems must be scaled up and accelerated urgently. from 2015 to 2019, oda disbursements to the water sector remained stable at around $8.8 billion, while oda commitments to the water sector rose by 9 per cent. in the same period, concessional lending for the least developed countries increased by 52 per cent to $2 billion, with oda grants to those countries increasing by only 8 per cent. in 2018 and 2019, two thirds of the 109 reporting countries and territories had procedures for the participation of local communities in water and sanitation management that were defined in laws or policies. however, only 14 countries and territories reported high levels of community and user participation in collaborative management and decision making."
373,"energy is crucial for achieving almost all of the sustainable development goals, from its role in the eradication of poverty through advancements in health, education, water supply and industrialization, to combating climate change. the proportion of the global population with access to electricity has increased steadily, from 79 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2012. still, 1.1 billion people are without this valuable service. recent global progress in this area has been driven largely by asia, where access is expanding at more than twice the pace of demographic growth. of those gaining access to electricity worldwide since 2010, 80 per cent are urban dwellers. the proportion of the worldâ€™s population with access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking increased from 51 per cent in 2000 to 58 per cent in 2014, although there has been limited progress since 2010. the absolute number of people relying on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking, such as solid fuels and kerosene, however, has actually increased, reaching an estimated three billion people. limited progress since 2010 falls substantially short of global population growth and is almost exclusively confined to urban areas. the share of renewable energy (derived from hydropower, solid and liquid biofuels, wind, the sun, biogas, geothermal and marine sources, and waste) in the worldâ€™s total final energy consumption has increased slowly, from 17.4 per cent in 2000 to 18.1 per cent in 2012. more telling is the fact that modern renewable energy consumption, which excludes solid biofuels used for traditional purposes, grew rapidly, at a rate of 4 per cent a year between 2010 and 2012, and accounted for 60 per cent of all new power generating capacity in 2014. "
374,"in absolute terms, about 72 per cent of the increase in energy consumption from modern renewable sources between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions, mostly from eastern asia. the technologies making the largest contribution have been hydropower, wind and solar energy; together they account for 73 per cent of the total increase in modern renewable energy between 2010 and 2012. energy intensity, calculated by dividing total primary energy supply by gdp, reveals how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. globally, energy intensity decreased by 1.7 per cent per year from 2010 to 2012. this represents a considerable improvement over the period from 1990 to 2010, when it decreased by 1.2 per cent a year. as a result, global energy intensity, which stood at 6.7 (millijoules (mj) per 2011 united states dollar ppp) in 2000 fell to 5.7 by 2012. the proportion of the worldâ€™s energy use covered by mandatory energy efficiency regulation, which has almost doubled over the past decade, from 14 per cent in 2005 to 27 per cent in 2014, was a factor. still, current progress is only about two thirds of the pace needed to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. among end use sectors, industry was the largest contributor to reduced energy intensity, followed closely by transportation. about 68 per cent of the savings in energy intensity between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions, with eastern asia as the largest contributor. progress in every area of sustainable energy falls short of what is needed to achieve energy access for all and to meet targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency. "
375,"meaningful improvements will require higher levels of financing and bolder policy commitments, together with the willingness of countries to embrace new technologies on a much wider scale. globally, 85.3 per cent of the population had access to electricity in 2014, an increase of only 0.3 percentage points since 2012. that means that 1.06 billion people, predominantly rural dwellers, still function without electricity. half of those people live in sub saharan africa. access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking climbed to 57.4 per cent in 2014, up slightly from 56.5 per cent in 2012. more than 3 billion people, the majority of them in asia and sub saharan africa, are still cooking without clean fuels and more efficient technologies. the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption grew modestly from 2012 to 2014, from 17.9 per cent to 18.3 per cent. most of the increase was from renewable electricity from water, solar and wind power. solar and wind power still make up a relatively minor share of energy consumption, despite their rapid growth in recent years. the challenge is to increase the share of renewable energy in the heat and transport sectors, which together account for 80 per cent of global energy consumption. from 2012 to 2014, three quarters of the worldâ€™s 20 largest energy consuming countries had reduced their energy intensity â€” the ratio of energy used per unit of gdp. the reduction was driven mainly by greater efficiencies in the industry and transport sectors. however, that progress is still not sufficient to meet the target of doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency."
376,"ensuring access to affordable, reliable and modern energy for all has come one step closer due to recent progress in electrification, particularly in ldcs, and improvements in industrial energy efficiency. however, national priorities and policy ambitions still need to be strengthened to put the world on track to meet the energy targets for 2030. from 2000 to 2016, the proportion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 78 per cent to 87 per cent, with the absolute number of people living without electricity dipping to just below 1 billion. in the least developed countries, the proportion of the people with access to electricity more than doubled between 2000 and 2016. in 2016, 3 billion people (41 per cent of the worldâ€™s population) were still cooking with polluting fuel and stove combinations. the share of renewables in final energy consumption increased modestly, from 17.3 per cent in 2014 to 17.5 per cent in 2015. yet only 55 per cent of the renewable share was derived from modern forms of renewable energy. global energy intensity decreased by 2.8 per cent from 2014 to 2015, double the rate of improvement seen between 1990 and 2010. access to electricity in the poorest countries has begun to accelerate, energy efficiency continues to improve and renewable energy is making gains in electricity sector. despite this progress, some 800 million people remain without electricity while access to clean cooking fuels and technologies needs dedicated attention. per capita hydropower capacity remained stable in 2019, as total capacity increased in line with population growth during the year at approximately 0.4 per cent. solar and wind capacities both expanded much faster than population growth, leading to increases in per capita capacity of 22.2 and 11.3 per cent, respectively."
377,"in addition, if sustainable development goals 7, 13 and related goals are to be met, much higher levels of ambition are required with regard to renewable energy, including transportation and heating. the global electrification rate rose from 83 per cent in 2010 to 87 per cent in 2015, with the increase accelerating to reach 89 per cent in 2017. however, some 840 million people around the world are still without access to electricity. the global share of the population with access to clean cooking fuels and technologies reached 61 per cent in 2017, up from 57 per cent in 2010. despite this progress, close to 3 billion people still rely primarily on inefficient and polluting cooking systems. the renewable energy share of total final energy consumption gradually increased from 16.6 per cent in 2010 to 17.5 per cent in 2016, though much faster change is required to meet climate goals. even though the absolute level of renewable energy consumption has grown by more than 18 per cent since 2010, only since 2012 has the growth of renewables outpaced the growth of total energy consumption. e/2019/68 14/39 19 07404 global primary energy intensity (ratio of energy used per unit of gdp) improved from 5.9 in 2010 to 5.1 in 2016, a rate of improvement of 2.3 per cent, which is still short of the 2.7 per cent annual rate needed to reach target 3 of sustainable development goal 7. international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy reached $18.6 billion in 2016, almost doubling from $9.9 billion in 2010."
378,"the world is making good progress on increasing access to electricity and improving energy efficiency. however, millions of people throughout the world still lack such access, and progress on facilitating access to clean cooking fuels and technologies is too slow. the pandemic has highlighted the need for reliable and affordable electricity in health centres. in addition, a survey conducted in selected developing countries revealed that one quarter of the health facilities surveyed were not electrified, and another quarter had unscheduled outages, affecting their capacity to deliver essential health services. such deficiencies weaken the health systemâ€™s response to the current health crisis. the global electrification rate rose, from 83 per cent in 2010 to 90 per cent by 2018. latin america and the caribbean and eastern and south eastern asia maintained strong progress, exceeding 98 per cent access to electricity by 2018. however, the worldâ€™s deficit was increasingly concentrated in sub saharan africa, where some 548 million persons, or 53 per cent of the population, lacked access to electricity. access to clean cooking fuels and technologies increased to 63 per cent in 2018, from 60 per cent in 2015 and 56 per cent in 2010. still, 2.8 billion persons lacked such access and relied primarily on inefficient and polluting cooking systems. because of the stagnant rate and rapid population growth, in sub saharan africa, the number of people without access to clean fuels for cooking increased. the renewable energy share of total final energy consumption gradually increased, from 16.3 per cent in 2010 to 17.0 per cent in 2015 and 17.3 per cent in 2017. much faster growth is required to meet long term climate goals. "
379,
380,"global primary energy intensity (the energy used per unit of gdp) improved by 2.2 per cent annually, from 5.2 per cent in 2015 to 5.0 per cent in 2017, but was still short of the 2.7 per cent annual rate needed to reach target 7.3. international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy reached $21.4 billion in 2017, 13 per cent higher than in 2016 and a twofold increase from flows committed in 2010. hydropower projects received 46 per cent of 2017 flows, while solar projects received 19 per cent, wind 7 per cent and geothermal 6 per cent. despite significant progress over the past decade on improving access to electricity, increasing renewable energy use in the electricity sector and improving energy efficiency, the world is still falling short in providing affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. clean and sustainable energy should be at the heart of the covid 19 response and of efforts to combat climate change. global access to electricity increased from 83 per cent in 2010 to 90 per cent in 2019, with an increase in average annual electrification of 0.876 percentage points. the global access deficit decreased from 1.22 billion in 2010 to 759 million in 2019. despite the significant effort made, there may still be as many as 660 million people without access worldwide in 2030. in addition, the covid 19 pandemic will impede progress on future electrification. in 2019, 66 per cent of the global population had access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. for the period 2010â€“2019, most of the increases in such access occurred in the most populous low  and middle income countries and territories: brazil, china, india, indonesia and pakistan. people reliant on polluting fuels and technologies are exposed to high levels of household air pollution with serious consequences for their cardiovascular and respiratory systems, increasing their vulnerability to diseases including the covid 19 virus. "
381,"the share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption increased gradually from 16.4 per cent in 2010 to 17.1 per cent in 2018. however, the share of modern renewable sources in total final energy consumption rose by only 2.5 percentage points in a decade, remaining below 11 per cent in 2018. the pandemic is having a mixed impact on renewable energy development across end use sectors: global electricity demand declined by 2 per cent in 2020 compared to 2019, but the use of renewables for power generation increased by almost 7 per cent year on year. global primary energy intensity increased from 5.6 megajoules per dollar of gross domestic product (gdp) in 2010 to 4.8 megajoules in 2018, an average annual rate of improvement of 2 per cent. while early estimates for 2019 also indicate an improvement of 2 per cent, the outlook for 2020 suggests a rate of only 0.8 per cent because of the pandemic. annual improvement until 2030 will need to average 3 per cent if the goal 7.3 target is to be met. international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy reached $14 billion in 2018, 35 per cent lower than in 2017 but 32 per cent higher than in 2010. hydropower projects received 27 per cent of flows in 2018, while projects relating to solar received 26 per cent, geothermal 8 per cent, wind 5 per cent and multiple or other renewable energies 34 per cent. developing countries had a renewable energy capacity of 219 watts per capita at the end of 2019, an increase of 7 per cent over the year but slightly less than the 8.8 per cent expansion in per capita capacity for 2018. "
382,"sustained and inclusive economic growth is necessary for achieving sustainable development. the global annual growth rate of real gdp per capita increased by 1.3 per cent in 2014, a significant slowdown compared to 2010 (2.8 per cent growth) and 2000 (3.0 per cent growth). developing regions grew far faster than developed regions, with average annual growth rates in 2014 of 3.1 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively. labour productivity (measured by gdp per worker) spurs economic growth. growth in labour productivity in developing regions far outpaced that of developed regions, especially in asia. between 2010 and 2015, labour productivity grew by 0.9 per cent per year, on average, in developed regions, while rising by 6.7 per cent per year, on average, in eastern asia, the region with the fastest growth. despite rapid growth in some developing regions, labour productivity remains far higher in the developed regions. in 2015, the average worker in developed regions produced 23 times the annual output of an average worker in sub saharan africa (which has the lowest labour productivity in developing regions), and 2.5 times that of an average worker in western asia (which has the highest labour productivity in developing regions). the global unemployment rate stood at 6.1 per cent in 2015, down from a peak of 6.6 per cent in 2009, mostly owing to a decline in unemployment in the developed regions. unemployment affects population groups differently. globally, women and youth (aged 15 to 24) are more likely to face unemployment than men and adults aged 25 and over. in all regions, except eastern asia and the developed regions, the unemployment rate among women is higher than that of men. in almost all regions, the rate of youth unemployment is more than twice that of adults. "
383,"although the number of children engaged in child labour declined globally by one third from 2000 to 2012 (from 246 million to 168 million), more than half of child labourers in 2012 (85 million) were engaged in hazardous forms of work. the incidence of child labour was highest in sub saharan africa, where 21 per cent of children were employed as child labourers. of all child labourers worldwide, 59 per cent were engaged in agricultural activities in 2012. while economic growth and employment are important for economic security, access to financial services is an essential component of inclusive growth. between 2011 and 2014, the proportion of the worldâ€™s adult population with an account at a financial institution or a mobile money service provider increased from 51 per cent to 62 per cent, meaning that 700 million adults became account holders during this period. financial exclusion disproportionately affected women and the poor. the proportion of women who are account holders is 9 percentage points lower than the proportion of men who are account holders. moreover, the proportion of account holders among the poorest 40 per cent of households is 14 percentage points lower than among those living in the richest 60 per cent of households. in 2014, aid for trade assistance was $54.8 billion, an increase of almost 120 per cent over the period from 2002 to 2005. however, total commitments fell slightly (by $1 billion) in 2014 compared to 2013, driven mainly by a $4.7 billion drop in support for transport and storage. a total of 146 developing countries received aid for trade assistance in 2014, with lower middle income countries receiving 39.4 per cent of the total, the least developed countries receiving 26.3 per cent and upper middle income countries receiving 19 per cent. on a per capita basis, however, the least developed countries received $10 per capita, more than any other income group and more than twice the global average."
384,"increasing labour productivity, reducing the unemployment rate, especially for young people, and improving access to financial services and benefits are essential components of sustained and inclusive economic growth. the average annual growth rate of real gdp per capita worldwide was 1.6 per cent from 2010 to 2015, compared to 0.9 per cent in 2005 2009. in the least developed countries, the per capita growth rate accelerated from 3.5 per cent in 2000 2004 to 4.6 per cent in 2005 2009, before slowing to 2.5 per cent in 2010 2015. overall average annual gdp growth in the least developed countries followed a similar trend, decelerating from 7.1 per cent in 2005  2009 to 4.9 per cent in 2010 2015, below the sustainable development goals target of 7 per cent. labour productivity (annual growth rate of real gdp per worker) globally has slowed from an average annual rate of 2.9 per cent from 2000 to 2008 to 1.9 per cent from 2009 to 2016. the slowdown represents a negative development for the global economy, with adverse effects on living standards and real wages. the global unemployment rate stood at 5.7 per cent in 2016, with women more likely to be unemployed than men across all age groups. youth were almost three times as likely as adults to be unemployed, with unemployment rates of 12.8 per cent and 4.4 per cent, respectively, in 2016. moreover, in more than 76 per cent of countries with data, more than 1 in 10 youth are neither in the educational system nor working. young women are more likely than young men to fall into that category in almost 70 per cent of countries with data."
385,"while the number of children from 5 to 17 years of age who are working has declined from 246 million in 2000 to 168 million in 2012, child labour remains a serious concern. more than half of child labourers (85 million children) participate in hazardous work and 59 per cent of them work in the agricultural sector. girls have made greater progress than boys, with the number of girls engaged in child labour declining by 40 per cent during the period 2000 2012, compared to a decline of 25 per cent for boys. access to financial services enables individuals and firms to manage changes in income, deal with fluctuating cash flows, accumulate assets and make productive investments. access to financial services through automated teller machines increased by 55 per cent worldwide from 2010 to 2015. commercial bank branches grew by 5 per cent during the same period, with the lower growth explained by increased digital access to financial services. globally, there were 60 automated teller machines and 17 commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults in 2015. from 2011 to 2014, 700 million adults became new account holders and the share of adults with an account at a financial institution increased from 51 per cent to 61 per cent. after contracting slightly in 2014, aid for trade rose 5.4 per cent in real terms to reach $53.9 billion in 2015 owing to a recovery in commitments for trade related infrastructure and further growth in support of banking and agriculture. aid for trade commitments to the least developed countries increased in 2015 by $4.3 billion, reaching $17.2 billion. the enhanced integrated framework, an aid for trade programme dedicated to those countries, started its second phase in 2016 and will run to 2022. donor commitments to the framework stood at $55.3 million in 2016, with $17.3 million already disbursed to the trust fund."
386,"globally, labour productivity has increased and the unemployment rate has decreased. however, more progress is needed to increase employment opportunities, especially for young people, reduce informal employment and labour market inequality (particularly in terms of the gender pay gap), promote safe and secure working environments, and improve access to financial services to ensure sustained and inclusive economic growth.  in 2016, real gross domestic product (gdp) per capita grew at 1.3 per cent globally, less than the 1.7 per cent average growth rate recorded in 2010â€“2016. for ldcs, the rate fell sharply from 5.7 per cent in 2005â€“2009 to 2.3 per cent in 2010â€“2016. labour productivity at the global level, measured as output produced per employed person in constant 2005 us dollars, grew by 2.1 per cent in 2017. this is the fastest growth registered since 2010. globally, 61 per cent of all workers were engaged in informal employment in 2016. excluding the agricultural sector, 51 per cent of all workers fell into this employment category. data from 45 countries suggest that gender inequality in earnings is still pervasive: in 89 per cent of these countries, the hourly wages of men are, on average, higher than those of women, with a median pay gap of 12.5 per cent. the global unemployment rate in 2017 was 5.6 per cent, down from 6.4 per cent in 2000. the decline has slowed since 2009, when it hit 5.9 per cent. youth are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults, with the global youth unemployment rate at 13 per cent in 2017. in high income countries, almost every adult has an account at a bank or other financial institution, compared to only 35 per cent of adults in low income countries. across all regions, women lag behind men in this regard."
387,"inclusive and sustainable economic growth can drive progress and generate the means to implement the sustainable development goals. globally, labour productivity has increased and unemployment is back to pre financial crisis levels. however, the global economy is growing at a slower rate. more progress is needed to increase employment opportunities, particularly for young people, reduce informal employment and the gender pay gap and promote safe and secure working environments to create decent work for all. in 2017, the global growth rate of real gdp per capita was 1.9 per cent and is expected to remain at about 2 per cent from 2018 to 2020. this is significantly less than the 3 per cent rate attained in 2010 and slightly higher than the 2015 rate of 1.63 per cent. real gdp growth rate for least developed countries is expected to increase from 4.5 per cent in 2017 to 5.7 per cent in 2020, which is less than the 7 per cent envisioned by the 2030 agenda. since the global economic downturn of 2009, labour productivity (measured as gdp per employed person) has been increasing in the world, recording positive annual growth rates consistently since 2010. in 2018, the worldâ€™s labour productivity increased by 2.1 per cent, its highest annual growth since 2010. informal employment, which has an impact on the adequacy of earnings, occupational safety and health and working conditions, remains pervasive: in three quarters of countries with data on the subject, more than half of all persons employed in non agriculture sectors are in informal employment. based on data for 62 countries, the median hourly gender pay gap stood at 12 per cent. the median gender pay gap exceeded 20 per cent in managerial and professional occupations, among workers in crafts and related trades and among plant machine operators and assemblers."
388,"the global unemployment rate has finally recovered from the global economic crisis. in 2018, the global unemployment rate stood at 5.0 per cent â€“ matching pre crisis levels. youth were three times more likely to be unemployed than adults. in 2018, one fifth of the worldâ€™s youth were not in education, employment or training, meaning that they were neither gaining professional experience nor acquiring or developing skills through educational or vocational programmes in their prime years. there is a stark gender difference. young women were more than twice as likely as young men to be unemployed or outside the labour force and not in education or training. many workers around the world are exposed to undue risks in their workplaces. based on recent data from some 55 countries, a median of 3 deaths occurred per 100,000 employees and a median of 889 non fatal injuries occurred per 100,000 employees. access to finance is on the rise globally, but the mode of access seems to be changing with growing reliance on technology. from 2010 to 2017, the number of automated teller machines (atms) per 100,000 adults grew by close to 50 per cent from 45 to 66 globally, and from 2.3 to 5.8 in the least developed countries. the number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults grew by only 2 per cent between 2010 and 2017, with more customers using digital banking solutions. in 2017, aid for trade commitments increased to $58 billion and more than doubled when compared to the 2002â€“2005 baseline, when they represented $23.1 billion. in absolute terms, the increase was highest in the agriculture sector ($1.7 billion), the industry sector ($1.0 billion) and in banking and financial services ($1.0 billion)."
389,"even before the current crisis, the global economy was growing at a slower rate than in previous years notwithstanding improvements in labour productivity and unemployment. the pandemic has abruptly and profoundly disrupted it, pushing the world into a recession. the unprecedented shock to the worldâ€™s labour markets is expected to result in a decrease of around 10.5 per cent in aggregate working hours in the second quarter of 2020, equivalent to 305 million full time workers. small and medium enterprises, workers in informal employment, the self employed, daily wage earners and workers in sectors at the highest risk of disruption have been hit the hardest. in 2018, the rate of growth of global real gdp per capita was 2 per cent. in addition, the rate for least developed countries was 4.5 per cent in 2018, less than the 7 per cent growth rate targeted in the 2030 agenda. the pandemic is pushing the world into the worst global economic crisis since the great depression. after a brief interruption during the global economic downturn of 2008â€“2009, labour productivity has continued to grow; in 2019, it increased by 1.4 per cent from the previous year. globally, 61 per cent of workers were in informal employment in 2016. the need to rely on informal employment was more prevalent in sub saharan africa and central and southern asia, where 89 per cent and 86 per cent of workers, respectively, were in such employment. as young women were already twice as likely as young men not to be in employment, education or training, and as women have been forced into inactivity disproportionately during the pandemic, the covid 19 crisis is likely to worsen the gender gap among young people not in employment, education or training."
390,"owing to the unemployment and underemployment caused by the current crisis, some 1.6 billion workers in the informal economy, half of the global workforce, are affected significantly. globally, the income of informal workers is estimated to fall by 60 per cent in the first months of the crisis. data on average hourly earnings cast light on income inequality. in a global study conducted by the international labour organization, a factor weighted gender pay gap of 19 per cent in 2017 was revealed. in 2019, the global unemployment rate stood at 5 per cent, with the highest rate, 11 per cent, in northern africa and western asia. the rate was considerably higher among young workers than for adults in all regions in 2019, with the difference reaching 18 percentage points in northern africa and western asia, 15 percentage points in central and southern asia and 12 percentage points in latin america and the caribbean. in 2019, 22 per cent of the worldâ€™s young people were not in employment, education or training, a figure that has hardly changed since 2005. in 2018, aid for trade commitments remained stable, at $58 billion, based on current prices. south and central asia received the highest share thereof (31.4 per cent), followed by sub saharan africa (29.2 per cent). lower middle income countries received 37.5 per cent of aid for trade, followed by least developed countries (36.8 per cent). according to data for 2019 from 102 countries, 98 per cent had a youth employment strategy or a plan to develop one in the near future"
391,"before the start of the covid 19 pandemic in 2020, the average growth of the global economy had already slowed. the pandemic has caused the worst global economic recession since the great depression and has had a massive impact on working times and incomes. in 2020, 8.8 per cent of global working hours were lost compared to the figure for the fourth quarter of 2019, which is equivalent to 255 million full time jobs and approximately four times greater than the hours lost during the global financial crisis in 2009. young people and women in the workforce were hit particularly hard by the crisis in the labour market. the global economy is slowly recovering, although activity may remain below pre pandemic levels for a prolonged period. following average growth of about 2 per cent from 2014 to 2018, global real gdp per capita increased by only 1.3 per cent in 2019 and is estimated to have declined by 5.3 per cent in 2020 owing to the pandemic. global real gdp per capita is projected to increase again by 3.6 per cent in 2021 and 2.6 per cent in 2022. the real gdp of the least developed countries increased by 4.8 per cent in 2019 and is estimated to have fallen by 1.3 per cent in 2020 because of the disruption caused by the pandemic. before the onset of the pandemic, informal employment accounted for 60.2 per cent of global employment, equivalent to 2 billion people with informal jobs characterized by a lack of basic protection, including social protection coverage. more than three quarters, 1.6 billion informal workers, were significantly affected by the pandemic related lockdown measures or were working in the sectors hardest hit."
392,"they are at high risk of falling into poverty and will experience greater challenges in regaining their livelihoods during the recovery. the median gender pay gap in countries and territories with data from around 2017 is close to 12 per cent, indicating that womenâ€™s hourly earnings are an average of 12 per cent lower than those of men in half of all countries and territories with data. however, this gender pay gap is an approximate calculation based on average hourly earnings without controlling for sector, occupation, educational level or work experience. in a global study, the international labour organization identified a factor weighted gender pay gap of 19 per cent. in 87 per cent of countries and territories with recent data, professionals earn more than double that of workers in elementary occupations per hour on average. global unemployment increased by 33 million in 2020, with the unemployment rate increasing by 1.1 percentage points to 6.5 per cent. however, unemployment figures reflect only a small proportion of the jobs lost as a result of the pandemic. a further 81 million people were not actively seeking employment or were simply unable to find employment owing to the covid 19 related restrictions. young people and women were particularly hard hit by the crisis, with employment losses in 2020 of 8.7 and 5 per cent, respectively, compared to 3.7 per cent for all adults and 3.9 per cent for men. in 2019, more than one in five of the worldâ€™s young people were not in employment, education or training, a proportion almost unchanged since 2005. quarterly figures indicate that the rate increased from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2020 in 42 out of 49 countries and territories with data.  "
393,"the level of national compliance with the fundamental labour rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining changed little between 2015 and 2018. global gdp from tourism increased at a higher rate than the rest of the economy over the decade preceding 2019 to account for 4.1 per cent of global gdp in 2019, compared to 3.7 per cent in 2008. however, as one of the sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, a reversal in this trend is expected for 2020 and the coming years. globally, international arrivals decreased by 74 per cent in 2020 compared to 2019, which represents a loss of $1.3 trillion in inbound tourism expenditure, more than 11 times the loss resulting from the 2009 global crisis. an estimated 100 to 120 million tourism jobs are at risk because of the pandemic, with a disproportionate effect on women. while the tourism sectors of virtually all countries and territories in the world are affected, the small island developing states suffer most acutely. globally, the number of automated teller machines per 100,000 adults rose by more than 50 per cent during the past decade, from 45 in 2010 to 69 in 2019. however, there was a slight reversal in the trend for commercial bank branches, with the number of branches in 2019 marginally lower than that recorded in 2010. in 2019, aid for trade commitments decreased by 6 per cent to $53 billion on the basis of current prices. the sectors most represented were energy (27.9 per cent of total aid for trade), transport and storage (22.6 per cent) and agriculture (17.8 per cent). in 2020, almost one third of the 107 countries and territories with data had formulated and operationalized a youth employment strategy, while 44 (41.1 per cent) had such strategies but did not provide conclusive evidence of their implementation, and just under one quarter (24.3 per cent) were in the process of developing a strategy."
394,
395,"goal 9 encompasses three important aspects of sustainable development: infrastructure, industrialization and innovation. infrastructure provides the basic physical systems and structures essential to the operation of a society or enterprise. industrialization drives economic growth, creates job opportunities and thereby reduces income poverty. innovation advances the technological capabilities of industrial sectors and prompts the development of new skills. an important component of physical infrastructure is air shipping and air travel. in 2014, 45 per cent of all air passengers originated from developing regions; 55 per cent originated from developed regions. however, in the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states, air passenger volume was extremely low, making up only 0.8 per cent, 0.8 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, of the global total. similar patterns are found for freight volumes in air transit: the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states made up only 1.1 per cent, 0.9 per cent and 2.6 per cent of the global total, respectively, in 2014. manufacturing is a foundation of economic development, employment and social stability.  in 2015, the share of manufacturing value added in terms of gdp of developed regions was estimated at 13 per cent, a decrease over the past decade owing largely to the increasing role of services in developed regions. in contrast, the share of manufacturing value added in gdp remained relatively stagnant for developing regions, increasing marginally from 19 per cent in 2005 to 21 per cent in 2015. those values hide substantial differences, with manufacturing value added contributing over 31 per cent to gdp in eastern asia and 10 per cent or less in both sub saharan africa and oceania.  "
396,"in developing countries, small scale industries accounted for an estimated 15 per cent to 20 per cent of value added and 25 per cent to 30 per cent of total industrial employment in 2015. however, access to financial services in those countries remains a problem. globally, the credit gap for small and medium enterprises (defined as having between 5 and 99 employees) was estimated at $3.2 trillion to $3.9 trillion in 2012. in emerging markets, between 45 per cent and 55 per cent of all small and medium enterprises are unserved or underserved by financial services. as the structure of world economies shifts to less energy intensive industries and countries implement policies for enhanced energy efficiency, almost all regions have shown a reduction in carbon intensity of gdp. global carbon dioxide emissions per unit of value added showed a steady decline between 1990 and 2013, a decrease of about 30 per cent. innovation and the creation of new and more sustainable industries are spurred by investments in research and development. global expenditure on research and development as a proportion of gdp stood at 1.7 per cent in 2013. however, this figure masks wide disparities. expenditure on research and development was 2.4 per cent of gdp for developed regions, 1.2 per cent for developing regions, and below 0.3 per cent for the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries. the number of researchers per 1 million inhabitants showed a similar pattern. while the global average was 1,083 researchers per 1 million inhabitants, the ratio ranged from 65 per 1 million in the least developed countries to 3,641 per 1 million in developed regions. total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing regions reached $59.5 billion in 2014. the main sectors receiving assistance were transport and energy. "
397,
398,"despite steady improvements in manufacturing output and employment, renewed investment will be needed in the least developed countries to build needed infrastructure and ensure the doubling of industryâ€™s share of gdp in those countries by 2030. efficient transportation services generate employment and wealth and drive economic development. in 2015, the estimated global economic impact (both direct and indirect) of air transport was $2.7 trillion, equivalent to 3.5 per cent of global gdp. the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states represent far less air travel and freight volumes, with each country group accounting for only 1 per cent to 2.7 per cent of the global total. manufacturing is a principal driver of economic development, employment and social stability. globally, manufacturing value added as a share of gdp increased from 15.3 per cent in 2005 to 16.2 per cent in 2016. in 2016, manufacturing value added per capita amounted to $4,621 in europe and northern america, compared to about $100 in the least developed countries. as many countries move to more efficient and less energy intensive industries, their emissions of carbon dioxide per unit of manufacturing value added are generally declining. from 2000 to 2014, europe and northern america reduced their emissions intensity by 36 per cent. the least developed countries face particular challenges in industrializing. although those countries represent 13 per cent of the global population, they contribute less than 1 per cent of global manufacturing value added. worldwide, about 500 million people are employed in manufacturing. while manufacturing job numbers have fallen in industrialized countries, they have steadily increased in developing countries. in the least developed countries, agricultural and traditional sectors remain the main sources of employment."
399,"all of the 10 largest manufacturing countries saw decreases in their emissions intensity. such promising trends are not reflected in the global emissions intensity level, however, since a significant share of global manufacturing value added has moved to countries with generally higher intensity levels. in 2014, investments in research and development stood at 1.7 per cent of global gdp, up from 1.5 per cent in 2000. worldwide, there were 1,098 researchers per million inhabitants in 2014, ranging from 63 in the least developed countries to 3,500 in europe and northern america. oda for economic infrastructure in developing countries reached $57 billion in 2015, an increase of 32 per cent in real terms since 2010. the main recipient sectors were transport and energy ($19 billion each). manufacturing is increasingly shifting towards more technologically complex products. while medium  and high tech products continue to dominate manufacturing production in industrialized economies (where they contribute about 80 per cent of total manufacturing output), the share has barely reached 10 per cent in least developed countries. mobile cellular services have spread rapidly and have allowed people living in previously unconnected areas to join the global information society. in 2016, 95 per cent of the worldâ€™s population and 85 per cent of people in the least developed countries were covered by a mobile cellular signal. infrastructure and economic development also rely on information and communications technology. mobile cellular services have spread rapidly around the world, allowing people in previously unconnected areas to join the global information society. by 2015, the percentage of the population living in areas covered by mobile broadband networks stood at 69 per cent globally. in rural areas, the share was only 29 per cent."

"
401,"aspects of the prevailing global economic environment have not been conducive to rapid progress on sustainable development goal 9. while financing for economic infrastructure has increased in developing countries and impressive progress has been made in mobile connectivity, countries that are lagging behind, such as least developed countries, face serious challenges in doubling the manufacturing industryâ€™s share of gdp by 2030, and investment in scientific research and innovation remains below the global average. efficient transportation services are key drivers of economic development, and more than 80 per cent of world merchandise trade by volume is transported by sea, making maritime transport a critical enabler of trade and globalization. international maritime freight increased by an estimated 3.7 per cent globally in 2017 and projected growth will test the capacity of existing maritime transport infrastructure to support increased freight volumes. in 2018, global manufacturing slowed in both developing and developed regions. the slowdown was attributed mainly to emerging trade and tariff barriers that constrained investment and future growth. despite this slowdown, the global share of gdp in terms of manufacturing value added increased marginally from 15.9 per cent in 2008 to 16.5 per cent in 2015, but stalled at the same level in 2018. the share of manufacturing in least developed countries remained low, posing a serious challenge to the target of doubling the industryâ€™s share of gdp by 2030. meanwhile, the share of manufacturing employment in total employment declined from 15.3 per cent in 2000 to 14.7 per cent in 2015 and to 14.2 per cent in 2018, as countries gradually reallocated production factors from agriculture and low value added manufacturing towards high value added manufacturing and services."
402,"the intensity of global carbon dioxide (co2) emissions from manufacturing industries declined by more than 20 per cent between 2000 and 2016, to 0.30 kg co2 per united states dollar, showing a general decoupling of co2 emissions and gdp growth. the proportion of global gdp invested in research and development increased from 1.52 per cent to 1.68 per cent from 2000 to 2016, with europe and northern america standing at 2.21 per cent of gdp spent on research and development and most developing regions falling short of the world average in 2016. while there has been an increase in the number of researchers per million inhabitants from 804 in 2000 to 1,163 in 2016, that number reached only 91 in sub saharan africa. total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing countries reached $59 billion in 2017, an increase of 32.5 per cent in real terms since 2010. within this total, the main sectors assisted were transport ($21.6 billion) and banking and financial services ($13.4 billion). in 2016, medium high and high tech sectors accounted for 44.7 per cent of the global manufacturing value added. medium high and high tech products continued to dominate manufacturing production in northern america and europe, reaching 47.4 per cent in 2016 compared with 10.4 per cent in least developed countries. almost all people around the world now live within range of a mobile cellular network signal, with 90 per cent living within range of a 3g quality or higher network. this evolution of the mobile network, however, is growing more rapidly than the percentage of the population using the internet."
403,"global growth in manufacturing had already steadily declined even before the outbreak. the pandemic is hitting manufacturing industries hard and causing disruptions in global value chains and the supply of products. the air transport sector has been hit the hardest by the pandemic. it is forecasted that airlines will have 1.5 billion fewer international air travellers in 2020 and that international seat capacity could fall by almost three quarters, resulting in a $273 billion loss, compared with previously expected gross operating revenues. in 2019, manufacturing value added grew only 1.5 per cent since 2018, the slowest year on year growth rate since 2012, influenced primarily by tariff and trade tensions affecting all regions. manufacturing activities are at high risk of disruption during the current crisis, which will have an impact on the sectorâ€™s employment levels. the share of manufacturing in gdp in least developed countries increased, from 10 per cent in 2010 to 12.4 per cent in 2019, but the growth rate was too slow for the target, doubling the industryâ€™s share in gdp by 2030, to be reached. in 2019, 14 per cent of the worldâ€™s workers were employed in manufacturing activities, a figure that has not changed much since 2000. the share of manufacturing employment was the largest in eastern and south eastern asia (18 per cent) and the smallest in sub saharan africa (6 per cent). according to surveys covering the period from 2010 to the present, in developing countries, 34 per cent of small scale industries benefit from loans or lines of credit, which enable them to integrate into local and global value chains. however, only 22 per cent of small scale industries in sub saharan africa received loans or lines of credit, compared with 48 per cent in latin america and the caribbean."
404,"after three years of stability, global carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion started to rise again in 2017, reaching 32.8 billion tons, underpinned by economic growth and a slowdown in efficiency improvements. however, the intensity of global carbon dioxide emissions has declined by nearly one quarter since 2000, showing a general decoupling of carbon dioxide emissions from gdp growth. the same trend was visible in manufacturing industries after 2010, with global manufacturing intensity falling at an average annual rate of 3 per cent until 2017. globally, investment in research and development as a proportion of gdp increased, from 1.5 per cent in 2000 to 1.7 per cent in 2015, and remained almost unchanged in 2017, but was only less than 1 per cent in developing regions. the number of researchers per 1 million inhabitants increased, from 1,018 in 2010 to 1,198 in 2017, ranging widely, from 3,707 in europe and northern america to only 99 in sub saharan africa. in addition, women represented only 30 per cent of global researchers. total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing countries reached $61 billion in 2018, an increase of 32.6 per cent in real terms from 2010. the main sectors assisted were transport ($22.8 billion) and energy ($20.3 billion). the share of medium high and high technology goods in world manufacturing production reached nearly 45 per cent in 2017. medium high and high technology products continued to dominate manufacturing production in developed regions, reaching 49 per cent in 2017, compared with 9 per cent in least developed countries. nearly the entire world population lives in an area covered by a mobile network. it is estimated that, in 2019, 96.5 per cent thereof was covered by at least a 2g network, with 81.8 per cent covered by at least a long term evolution network."
405,"in the year before the covid 19 pandemic triggered the greatest economic crisis in decades, manufacturing value added had seen the slowest year on year growth rate since 2012, primarily because of tariff and trade tensions between the most dominant economies. the pandemic has hit the manufacturing and transport industries hard, causing job losses and declining incomes for workers in those sectors. the crisis poses unprecedented challenges for global value chains by disrupting both the supply of and the demand for goods. small scale industries have been severely affected, and many continue to face existential challenges. however, the covid 19 crisis also offers opportunities to foster industrialization and bring groundbreaking technologies to developing countries. according to data from 2018 and 2019 on the 25 countries and territories in africa, asia, south america, central asia and the middle east for which the rural access index of the world bank was updated using a spatial method, almost 300 million out of 520 million rural dwellers still lack reliable access to roads. growth in maritime freight volumes and global container port traffic weakened in 2019, expanding at the marginal rates of 0.5 and 2 per cent, respectively, compared to 2018. as a result of the covid 19 pandemic, the volume of international maritime freight is expected to have fallen by 4.1 per cent and global container port traffic by 2.1 per cent in 2020. by 2016, the proportion of the population covered by a third generation (3g) mobile broadband network stood at 61 per cent in the ldcs and 84 per cent globally."
406,"the pandemic affected manufacturing by disrupting global value chains and restricting the movement of people and goods, resulting in a significant drop of 8.4 per cent in manufacturing production in 2020. the global share of manufacturing value added in gdp fell from 16.5 per cent in 2019 to 15.9 per cent in 2020. manufacturing in the least developed countries is expected to have grown by a negligible 1.2 per cent in 2020, compared to 8.7 per cent in 2019, helping the least developed countries to increase their share of manufacturing value added to 12.8 per cent in 2020 from 10.1 per cent in 2010. however, the growth rate is too slow to meet the target of doubling the share of industry in gdp by 2030. manufacturing value added per capita in 2020 was only $135 in the least developed countries, compared to $4,194 in europe and northern america. in 2019, 13.7 per cent of global workers, or 454 million people, were employed in manufacturing, one of the sectors hardest hit by the pandemic. across 49 countries and territories with data, manufacturing employment declined by an average of 5.6 and 2.5 per cent in the second and third quarters of 2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. in 2015, medium high  and high technology sectors accounted for 44.7 per cent of total manufacturing value added globally. the value added reached 34.6 per cent in developing economies, up from 21.5 per cent in 2005. "
407,"small scale industries have been significantly affected by the pandemic, and many continue to face existential challenges. according to survey data for the period from 2006 to 2020, 29.3 per cent of small scale entrepreneurs benefited from loans or lines of credit before the crisis, with some regional differences. only 15.7 per cent of small scale industries in sub saharan africa received those forms of credit, compared to 44 per cent in latin america and the caribbean. global carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion declined slightly in 2019 from a historic high of 33.5 billion tons in 2018, owing mainly to changes in power sources in advanced economies and milder weather conditions across the continents. global carbon dioxide emissions from manufacturing continued their decline since 2014 and accounted for 5.9 billion tons in 2018. although the world experienced a remarkable drop in carbon dioxide emissions as a result of national lockdowns and travel restrictions in 2020, most economies are likely to resume their usual levels of carbon dioxide emissions as soon as the lockdown measures are lifted. the proportion of global gdp invested in research and development rose at a satisfactory pace, from 1.61 per cent in 2010 to 1.73 per cent in 2018. however, countries and territories in most of the developing regions fell short of the world average, some spending less than 1 per cent of gdp on research and development. steady progress has been made in the manufacturing industry. to achieve inclusive and sustainable industrialization, competitive economic forces need to be unleashed to generate employment and income, facilitate international trade and enable the efficient use of resources."
408,"globally, there has been an increase in the number of researchers per million population from 1,022 in 2010 to 1,235 in 2018, ranging from 3,847 in europe and northern america to only 99 in sub saharan africa. in addition, women represented only 30.5 per cent of global researchers in 2018. total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing countries reached $63.6 billion in 2019, an increase of 39.6 per cent in real terms since 2010. the main sectors assisted were transport ($21.3 billion), and banking and financial services ($15.3 billion). in 2018, the share of medium  and high technology manufacturing in total manufacturing was 49 per cent in developed regions and 41.4 per cent in developing regions, compared to only 8.9 per cent in the least developed countries. the pandemic affected different industries unequally. medium  and high technology industries, such as the pharmaceutical, computer, electronics and automotive sectors, have recovered faster from the crisis than industries involving a lower technological intensity. the roll out of mobile broadband networks slowed in 2020. almost 85 per cent of the global population was covered by a 4g network at the end of 2020, following a twofold increase in coverage since 2015. however, annual growth has been slowing gradually since 2017, with the result that coverage in 2020 was only 1.3 percentage points higher than in 2019. the global share of manufacturing value added in gdp increased from 15.2 per cent in 2005 to 16.3 per cent in 2017, driven by the fast growth of manufacturing in asia. globally, the carbon intensity decreased by 19 per cent from 2000 to 2015â€” from 0.38 to 0.31 kilograms of carbon dioxide per dollar of value added."
409,"the comparative advantage of the least developed countries in duty free access varies depending on the product groups analysed. almost all agricultural products from the least developed countries (98 per cent) were exempt from duties by developed countries, versus 74 per cent of products from developing countries. shares of exports exempt from duties diverged even more for textiles and clothing: the rate for both product groups for the least developed countries was around 70 per cent, while for developing countries it was 41 per cent for textiles and 34 per cent for clothing. official development assistance and financial flows contribute to reducing inequalities within and among countries. in 2014, total resource flows for development to the least developed countries totalled $55.2 billion, and eight donor countries met the target of 0.15 per cent of gross national income (gni) for oda to the least developed countries. preliminary oda figures for 2015 show that bilateral net oda to the least developed countries increased by 4 per cent in real terms, compared to 2014. people migrate for many reasons, including better employment opportunities and higher wages. when successful, many migrants send money back to their country of origin to care of family members. remittances to developing countries have increased slightly, rising to $431.6 billion in 2015, up 0.4 per cent from 2014. in contrast, global remittances (including those to developed countries) were estimated at $582 billion in 2015, a decline of 1.7 per cent from 2014. even with the global contraction in remittance flows in 2015, the longer term trend is upward. however, the cost of sending money across national borders is significant, averaging 7.5 per cent of the amount remitted in 2015, down from 10 per cent in 2008 but still above the 3 per cent called for in target 10.c."
410,"goal 10 calls for reducing inequalities in income as well as those based on age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status within a country. the goal also addresses inequalities among countries, including those related to representation, migration and development assistance. target 10.1 seeks to ensure that income growth among the poorest 40 per cent of the population in every country is more rapid than its national average. this was true in 56 of 94 countries with data available from 2007 to 2012. however, this does not necessarily imply greater prosperity, since nine of those countries experienced negative growth rates over that period. the labour share of gdp, which represents the proportion of wages and social protection transfers in an economy, provides an aggregate measure of primary income inequality. a shift of income away from labour towards capital has contributed to rising inequality. globally, the labour share of gdp decreased from 57 per cent in 2000 to 55 per cent in 2015, mainly owing to stagnating wages and a decline in employersâ€™ social contributions in developed regions, while the trend was stable or slightly upward in developing regions. preferential treatment for developing countries and the least developed countries in trade can help reduce inequalities by creating more export opportunities. major developed country markets already offer duty free market access to the least developed countries on most of their tariff lines. but even when they do not, as in the case of some agricultural products, the average applied tariff rate is often close to zero per cent."
411,"progress in reducing inequality within and among countries has been mixed. the voices of developing countries still need to be strengthened in decisio n making forums of international economic and financial institutions. moreover, while remittances can be a lifeline for families and communities of international migrant workers in their countries of origin, the high cost of transferring money continues to reduce such benefits. from 2008 to 2013, the per capita income or consumption of the poorest 40 per cent of the population improved more rapidly than the national average in 49 of 83 countries (accounting for three quarters of the worldâ€™s population) with data. the international monetary fund, through its recent quota reform, has increased the share of developing countriesâ€™ vote (defined as countries in developing regions, according to the m49 classification) to 37 per cent in 2016, up from 33 per cent in 2010. that increase is still short of the 74 per cent they represent in the membership. while the world bank reforms of 2010 are still being implemented, that effort has not changed the 38 per cent share of voting rights at the international bank for reconstruction and development that developing countries have held since 2000. the proportion of products exported by least developed countries, developing regions and small island developing states that could enter international markets free of duty increased, from 66 to 67.4 per cent, 51.1 to 52.1 per cent and 65.4 to 66.5 per cent, respectively, from 2017 to 2018. in 2018, total resource flows for development to developing countries from development assistance committee donors, multilateral agencies and other key providers were $271 billion, of which $166 billion were oda."
412,"duty free treatment and favourable access conditions for exports from least developed and developing countries have expanded. from 2005 to 2015, the proportion of tariff lines globally with duty free treatment for products that originate in developing countries increased from 41 per cent to 50 per cent; for products that originate in the least developed countries, the proportion rose from 49 per cent to 65 per cent. the least developed countries and small island developing states continue to require additional assistance to ensure that they share in the benefits of sustainable development. in 2015, total resource flows to the least developed countries and small island developing states amounted to $48 billion and $6 billion, respectively. eight donor countries met the target of 0.15 per cent of gross national income (gni) for oda to the least developed countries. the benefits of remittance from international migrant workers are reduced somewhat by the generally high cost of transfer. on average, post offices and money transfer operators charge over 6 per cent of the amount remitted; commercial banks charge 11 per cent. both are significantly above the 3 per cent target. new and improved technologies, such as prepaid cards and mobile operators, result in lower fees for sending money home (between 2 per cent and 4 per cent), but are not yet widely available or used for many remittance corridors."
413,"efforts have been made in some countries to reduce income inequality, increase zero tariff access for exports from ldcs and developing countries, and provide additional assistance to ldcs and small island developing states (sids). however, progress will need to accelerate to reduce growing disparities within and among countries. between 2010 and 2016, in 60 out of 94 countries with data, the incomes of the poorest 40 per cent of the population grew faster than those of the entire population. in 2016, over 64.4 per cent of products exported by ldcs to world markets and 64.1 per cent of those from sids faced zero tariffs, an increase of 20 per cent since 2010. developing countries overall had duty free market access for about 50 per cent of all products exported in 2016. in 2016, receipts by developing countries from member countries of the development assistance committee of the oecd, multilateral agencies and other key providers totalled $315 billion; of this amount, $158 billion was oda. in 2016, total oda to ldcs and sids from all donors totalled $43.1 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. based on provisional data, among the $613 billion in total remittances recorded in 2017, $466 billion went to low  and middle income countries. while the global average cost of sending money has gradually declined in recent years, it was estimated at 7.2 per cent in 2017, more than double the target transaction cost of 3 per cent."
414,"inequality within and among nations continues to be a significant concern despite progress in and efforts at narrowing disparities of opportunity, income and power. income inequality continues to rise in many parts of the world, even as the bottom 40 per cent of the population in many countries has experienced positive growth rates. greater emphasis will need to be placed on reducing inequalities in income as well as those based on other factors. additional efforts are needed to increase zero tariff access for exports from least developed countries and developing countries, and assistance to least developed countries and small island developing states. in more than half of the 92 countries with comparable data during the period 2011â€“2016, the bottom 40 per cent of the population experienced a growth rate that was higher than the overall national average. however, the bottom 40 per cent received less than 25 per cent of the overall income or consumption. in many places, the increasing share of income going to the top 1 per cent of earners is of significant concern. robust and sound financial systems are essential for supporting equal access to financial services. high loan asset impairment, measured by the ratio of non performing loans to total loans for deposit takers, is a potential risk to the soundness of the banking system. for almost half of the 138 reporting countries, the percentage of non performing loans to total loans was less than 5, while the average median for the period 2010â€“2017 was 4.3 per cent."
415,"while countries in developing regions represent over 70 per cent of the membership of the general assembly and world trade organization, which utilize a one member, one vote system, their voting share in other international organizations remains far below these levels. governance reforms are being negotiated at the international monetary fund, and changes were adopted at the world bank in october 2018. however, full implementation will leave developing countries with just over 40 per cent of the voting rights, still short of the 75 per cent they represent in world bank membership in terms of the number of countries. duty free access continued to increase for least developed countries, small island developing states and developing regions at large. more than 50 per cent of exports from developing countries are now eligible for duty free treatment. the increase of duty free access in world markets was the largest for least developed countries, namely in the industrial and agricultural sector. in 2017, total receipts by developing countries from donors of the development assistance committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development, multilateral agencies and other key providers were $414 billion, of which $163 billion were oda. total oda to small island developing states from all donors was $4.3 billion in 2017, a decrease of 33 per cent in real terms over 2016, due to exceptional debt relief operations for cuba in 2016."
416,"notwithstanding positive signs of reducing inequality in some dimensions, such as a reduction of relative income inequality in some countries and preferential trade status benefiting lower income countries, inequality still persists in all forms. the covid 19 crisis is hitting the poorest and most vulnerable people and countries the hardest and threatens to have a particularly damaging impact on the poorest countries. it is exposing the profound inequalities that exist within and among countries and is exacerbating those inequalities. in 73 of the 90 countries with comparable data during the period 2012â€“2017, the bottom 40 per cent of the population saw its incomes grow. moreover, in slightly more than half of those countries, the bottom 40 per cent experienced a growth rate in income that was higher than the overall national average. still, in all countries with data, the bottom 40 per cent of the population received less than 25 per cent of the overall income or consumption, while the top 10 per cent received at least 20 per cent of the income. data from 31 countries over the period 2014â€“2019 show that one in five persons reported having personally experienced discrimination on at least one ground of discrimination prohibited by international human rights law. the pandemic risks exacerbating those patterns. of the 111 countries with available data as at september 2019, 54 per cent reported having a wide range of policy measures to facilitate the orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people. central and southern asia (80 per cent) and latin america and the caribbean (79 per cent) reported having the highest share of countries with such policies, compared with only 33 per cent of the countries in oceania and northern africa and western asia. "
417,
418,"before the pandemic, modest gains had been made in the reduction of inequality in certain areas, for example, reducing income inequality in some countries and territories, continuing preferential trade status for lower income countries and territories and decreasing transaction costs for remittances. however, inequality persists, whether in relation to income, wealth, opportunity or other dimensions. the pandemic is exacerbating existing inequalities within and among countries and territories and hitting the most vulnerable people and the poorest countries and territories hardest, and is likely to delay the progress of the poorest countries and territories on the goals by a full 10 years. globally, the number of refugees reached its highest level on record in 2020. even with strict covid 19 related restrictions on mobility around the world, thousands of migrants died on their migratory journey. according to estimates of the international monetary fund, the covid 19 pandemic would increase the average gini index for emerging market and developing economies by more than 6 per cent, with an even larger impact predicted for lowincome countries and territories. data from 44 countries and territories for the period 2014â€“2020 show that almost one in five people reported having personally experienced discrimination on at least one of the grounds prohibited under international human rights law. moreover, women were more likely to be victims of discrimination than men. the health and socioeconomic situations of many groups already experiencing higher levels of discrimination have been further affected by the pandemic."
419,"the data from 2019 on financial soundness indicators indicated some improvement of overall loan performance, while the levels of capital, which is the main buffer for absorbing losses, remained high despite a slight decline. the share of countries and territories reporting non performing loans whose value exceeds 5 per cent of total loans declined from 41.9 per cent in 2018 to 39.5 per cent in 2019. meanwhile, the share of countries and territories reporting a ratio of total regulatory capital to risk weighted assets of more than 15 per cent declined from 84.6 per cent in 2018 to 82.1 per cent in 2019, although the median rose from 17.9 per cent to 18.2 per cent over the same period. in 2020, 4,186 deaths and disappearances were recorded along migratory routes worldwide, with an increase in fatalities on some routes. despite the pandemic and mobility restrictions at borders across the world, tens of thousands of people continued to leave their homes and embark on dangerous journeys across deserts and seas. by mid 2020, the number of people who had fled their countries and territories and become refugees owing to war, conflict, persecution, human rights violations and events seriously disturbing public order had grown to 24 million, the highest number on record. the number of refugees outside their country of origin has risen to 307 out of every 100,000 persons, more than double the figure at the end of 2010."
420,"globally, in 2019, 54 per cent of the 111 governments with data reported having instituted a comprehensive set of policy measures to facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, which means that they have reported having policy measures in place for at least 80 per cent of the subcategories that make up the six policy domains of this indicator. the degree to which the policy measures were reported, however, varies widely across policy domains, with most countries and territories reporting measures for cooperation and partnerships and for safe, orderly and regular migration, and fewest countries and territories reporting measures for migrant rights and for socioeconomic well being. from 2017 to 2020, the proportion of products exported by the least developed countries and developing countries that receive duty free treatment has remained unchanged at 66 and 52 per cent, respectively. in 2019, total resource flows for development to developing countries from development assistance committee donors, multilateral agencies and other key providers amounted to $400 billion, of which $164 billion was oda. the average global cost of sending a $200 remittance decreased from 9.3 per cent in 2011 to 6.5 per cent in 2020, bringing it closer to the international target of 5 per cent. the average annual decrease was 0.31 percentage points. the share of exports from the least developed countries and developing regions that benefitted from duty free treatment increased from 2000 to 2014, reaching 79 per cent for developing countries and 84 per cent for the least developed countries. "
421,"more than half the worldâ€™s population lives in cities. by 2030, it is projected that 6 out of 10 people will be urban dwellers. despite numerous planning challenges, well managed cities and other human settlements can be incubators for innovation and ingenuity and key drivers of sustainable development. however, as more people migrate to cities in search of a better life and urban populations grow, housing issues intensify. already in 2014, 30 per cent of the urban population lived in slum like conditions; in sub saharan africa, the proportion was 55 per cent, the highest of any region. globally, more than 880 million people were living in slums in 2014. this estimate does not include people in inadequate or unaffordable housing (defined as costing more than 30 per cent of total monthly household income). as population growth outpaces available land, cities expand far beyond their formal administrative boundaries. this urban sprawl can be seen in many cities around the world, and not only in developing regions. from 2000 to 2015, the ratio of the land consumption rate to the population growth rate in eastern asia and the oceania was the highest in the world, with developed regions second. other regions, such as south eastern asia and latin america and the caribbean, showed a decrease in that indicator over the same time period. globally, urban areas are expanding at a faster rate than their populations. between 2000 and 2014, areas occupied by cities grew 1.28 times faster than their populations. closely related to this trend is that the urban densities of cities have been declining, creating profound repercussions for environmental sustainability at the local, regional and global scale. better management of urban growth will be crucial in order to guarantee sustainable urbanization."
422,"unfortunately, a low value for this ratio is not necessarily an indication that urban dwellers are faring well, as this can indicate a prevalence of overcrowded slums. unplanned urban sprawl undermines other determinants of sustainable development. for example, for every 10 per cent increase in sprawl, there is a 5.7 per cent increase in per capita carbon dioxide emissions and a 9.6 per cent increase in per capita hazardous pollution. this illustrates the important interlinkages across the goals and targets. likewise, managing solid waste is often problematic in densely populated areas. in fact, in many developing regions, less than half of solid waste is safely disposed of. as per capita waste generation continues to rise, the collection and safe disposal of solid waste will continue to require serious attention. urban air pollution also challenged cities around the world, causing illness and millions of premature deaths annually. in 2014, around half the global urban population was exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times higher than maximum standards set by the world health organization. the quest for sustainable and coordinated urban development starts with national policies and regional development plans. as of 2015, 142 countries had a national urban policy in place or under development. those countries are home to 75 per cent of the worldâ€™s urban population."
423,"in recent decades, the world has experienced unprecedented urban growth. in 2015, close to 4 billion people â€” 54 per cent of the worldâ€™s population â€” lived in cities and that number is projected to increase to about 5 billion people by 2030. rapid urbanization has brought enormous challenges, including growing numbers of slum dwellers, increased air pollution, inadequate basic services and infrastructure, and unplanned urban sprawl, which also make cities more vulnerable to disasters. better urban planning and management are needed to make the worldâ€™s urban spaces more inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. as of may 2017, 149 countries were developing national level urban policies. the proportion of the urban population that lives in developing country slums fell from 39 per cent in 2000 to 30 per cent in 2014. despite some gains, the absolute number of urban residents who live in slums continued to grow, owing in part to accelerating urbanization, population growth and lack of appropriate land and housing policies. in 2014, an estimated 880 million urban residents lived in slum conditions, compared to 792 million urban residents in 2000. as more and more people move to urban areas, cities typically expand their geographic boundaries to accommodate new inhabitants. from 2000 to 2015, in all regions of the world, the expansion of urban land outpaced the growth of urban populations. as a result, cities are becoming less dense as they grow, with unplanned urban sprawl challenging more sustainable patterns of urban development. the safe removal and management of solid waste represents one of the most vital urban environmental services. "
424,"uncollected solid waste blocks drains, causes flooding and may lead to the spread of water borne diseases. on the basis of data from cities in 101 countries from 2009 to 2013, 65 per cent of the urban population was served by municipal waste collection. air pollution is a major environmental health risk. in 2014, 9 of 10 people who live in cities were breathing air that did not comply with the safety standard set by who. many cities around the world are facing acute challenges in managing rapid urbanizationâ€” from ensuring adequate housing and infrastructure to support growing populations, to confronting the environmental impact of urban sprawl, to reducing vulnerability to disasters. between 2000 and 2014, the proportion of the global urban population living in slums dropped from 28.4 per cent to 22.8 per cent. however, the actual number of people living in slums increased from 807 million to 883 million. based on data collected for 214 cities/municipalities, about three quarters of municipal solid waste generated is collected. in 2016, 91 per cent of the urban population worldwide were breathing air that did not meet the world health organization air quality guidelines value for particulate matter (pm 2.5); more than half were exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times higher than that safety standard. in 2016, an estimated 4.2 million people died as a result of high levels of ambient air pollution. from 1990 to 2013, almost 90 per cent of deaths attributed to internationally reported disasters occurred in low  and middle income countries. reported damage to housing attributed to disasters shows a statistically significant rise from 1990 onwards."
425,"substantial progress has been made in reducing the proportion of the global urban population living in slums, though more than 1 billion people continue to live in such situations. urgent action is needed to reverse the current situation, which sees the vast majority of urban residents breathing poor quality air and having limited access to transport and open public spaces. with the areas occupied by cities growing faster than their populations, there are profound repercussions for sustainability. between 1990 and 2016, the proportion of the global urban population living in slums fell from 46 to 23 per cent. this progress was largely offset by internal population growth and rural urban migration. in 2016, just over 1 billion people lived in slums or informal settlements, with over half (589 million) living in east, south east, central and south asia. the proportion of urban residents who have convenient access to public transport (defined as living within 500 m walking distance of a bus stop and within 1,000 m of a railway and/or ferry terminal) remains low, particularly in developing countries. based on data from 227 cities from 78 countries in 2018, on average, 53 per cent of urban residents in all regions had convenient access to public transport, from a low of 18 per cent in sub saharan africa to a high of 75 per cent in australia and new zealand. in some regions that have low access to public transport, informal transport modes are highly prevalent and in many cases provide reliable transport for the majority of urban populations.

426,"globally, 2 billion people do not have access to waste collection services and 3 billion people lack access to controlled waste disposal facilities. with increasing urban populations and the existence of consumer oriented economies amid rising income levels and rapid urbanization, it is estimated that the total waste generated in the world will double from nearly 2 billion tons in 2016 to about 4 billion tons by 2050. while from 2010 to 2018 the proportion of solid waste collected was about 81 per cent globally, in sub saharan africa it was only 52 per cent. in 2016, 9 in 10 people living in urban areas still breathed air that did not meet the world health organizationâ€™s air quality guidelines value for particulate matter â€“ that particulate matter 2.5 microns or less in size (pm2.5) not exceed an annual mean of 10 micrograms per m3 or a daily mean of 25 micrograms per m3 â€“ and more than half of the world population experienced an increase in pm2.5 from 2010 to 2016. most cities have struggled to ensure that their populations have convenient access to open public spaces (defined as spaces within 400 m walking distance of their residence). based on data from 220 cities in 77 countries in 2018, only 21 per cent of the population had convenient access to open public spaces. however, these results do not necessarily mean that there is an inadequate share of land dedicated to open public spaces in these cities, but rather that their distribution across urban areas is uneven. national urban policies are policy strategies that specifically respond to the urbanization challenges of today. as of the beginning of 2019, 150 countries had developed such policies, and almost half are already implementing them."
427,"access to adequate, reliable and safe public transport is a basic urban need. as shown in data collected in 2019 from a sample of 610 cities in 95 countries, only half of the worldâ€™s urban population had convenient access to public transport, defined as living within 500 metresâ€™ walking distance from a low capacity transport system (such as a bus stop) and within 1,000 metres of a high capacity transport system (such as a railway or a ferry terminal). data collected in 2019 from a sample of 755 cities in 95 countries show that, in the period 1990â€“2015, most urban areas recorded a general increase in the extent of built up area (defined as the presence of buildings) per person. on average, all regions except sub saharan africa and eastern and south eastern asia recorded a consistent increase in the built up area per capita, with australia and new zealand recording the highest values. based on 2019 data from 610 cities in 95 countries, the share of land allocated to streets and open spaces, which is critical to citiesâ€™ productivity and the social and health dimensions of their populations, averaged only about 16 per cent globally. of those, streets accounted for about three times as much urban land as open public spaces, such as parks and riverfronts. the share of the population that could obtain access to open public spaces within 400 metresâ€™ walking distance along a street network averaged 46.7 per cent."
428,"rapid urbanization has resulted in a growing number of slum dwellers, inadequate and overburdened infrastructure and services and worsening air pollution. the pandemic will hit the hardest the more than 1 billion slum dwellers worldwide, who suffer from a lack of adequate housing, no running water at home, shared toilets, few or no waste management systems, overcrowded public transport and limited access to formal health care facilities. many in that population work in the informal sector and are at high risk of losing their livelihood as cities shut down. before the pandemic, cities had rising numbers of slum dwellers, worsening air pollution, minimal open public spaces and limited convenient access to public transport. the direct and indirect impacts of the covid 19 pandemic are making it even more unlikely that this goal will be achieved, with more people forced to live in slums, where quality of life is deteriorating and vulnerability increasing. the number of slum dwellers has continued to grow over the years, exceeding 1 billion in 2018. slum dwellers are most prevalent in the three regions of eastern and south eastern asia (370 million), sub saharan africa (238 million) and central and southern asia (226 million). according to data from 2019 for 610 cities in 95 countries and territories, about half of the urban population has convenient access to public transport, defined as living within a walking distance of 500 metres to low capacity transport systems, such as buses or trams, and 1,000 metres to high capacity systems, such as trains and ferries. as a result of the covid 19 response measures imposed in countries and territories throughout 2020, access to public transport in cities worldwide was significantly disrupted, from partial closures and reduced capacities to total closure of networks."
429,"data collected for a sample of 911 cities from 114 countries and territories in 2020 indicate that between 1990 and 2019, spatial urbanization occurred at a much faster rate than population growth, and smaller cities were being urbanized more quickly than their larger counterparts. on average, all regions except sub saharan africa and eastern and south eastern asia recorded a consistent increase in built up area per capita, with the highest values in australia and new zealand. data on a sample of 911 cities from 114 countries and territories indicate that the share of urban area allocated to streets and open public spaces averaged only about 16 per cent globally in 2020, well below the allocation recommended by united nations human settlements programme (un habitat) of 30 per cent for streets and an additional 10 to 15 per cent for open public spaces. as of march 2021, 156 countries and territories have developed national urban policies, almost half of which are already at the implementation stage. of these countries and territories, 38 per cent are in the early stages of plan development, while 13 per cent are monitoring and evaluating the performance of their plans.  urgent response plans are needed to prepare for and respond to outbreaks in informal settlements and slums. the number of slum dwellers reached more than 1 billion in 2018, which represents 24 per cent of the urban population, up slightly from 23 per cent in 2014. the number of people living in urban slums is highest in eastern and south eastern asia (370 million), sub saharan africa (238 million) and central and southern asia (226 million)."
430,"economic growth and development require the production of goods and services that improve the quality of life. sustainable growth and development require minimizing the natural resources and toxic materials used, and the waste and pollutants generated, throughout the entire production and consumption process. two measures, material footprint and domestic material consumption, provide an accounting of global material extraction and use, as well as flows or consumption of materials in countries. the material footprint reflects the amount of primary materials required to meet a countryâ€™s needs. it is an indicator of the material standard of living or level of capitalization of an economy. domestic material consumption measures the amount of natural resources used in economic processes. in 2010, the total material footprint in developed regions was significantly higher than that of developing regions, 23.6 kg per unit of gdp versus 14.5 kg per unit of gdp, respectively. the material footprint of developing regions increased from 2000 to 2010, with non metallic minerals showing the largest increase. domestic material consumption in developed regions has diminished slightly, from 17.5 tonnes per capita in 2000 to 15.3 tonnes per capita in 2010. it remains significantly higher than the value for developing regions, which stood at 8.9 tonnes per capita in 2010. domestic material consumption per capita increased in almost all developing regions from 2000 to 2010, except in africa, where it remained relatively stable (around 4 tonnes per capita), and oceania, where it decreased from around 10.7 to 7.7 tonnes per capita. the rise in domestic material consumption per capita in asia during that period is primarily a result of rapid industrialization. "

432,"the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal, the rotterdam convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade and the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants established international frameworks to achieve the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes, chemicals and persistent organic pollutants. with six exceptions, all member states are party to at least one of those conventions. the number of parties to those conventions rose significantly from 2005 to 2015, particularly in africa and oceania. there are now 183 parties to the basel convention, 180 to the stockholm convention and 155 to the rotterdam convention. decoupling economic growth from resource use is one of the most critical and complex challenges facing humanity today. doing so effectively will require policies that create a conducive environment for such change, social and physical infrastructure and markets, and a profound transformation of business practices along global value chains. the per capita material footprint of developing countries grew from 5 metric tons in 2000 to 9 metric tons in 2017, representing a significant improvement in the material standard of living. most of the increase is attributed to a rise in the use of non metallic minerals, pointing to growth in the areas of infrastructure and construction. for all types of materials, developed countries have at least double the per capita footprint of developing countries. in particular, the material footprint for fossil fuels is more than four times higher for developed than developing countries."
433,"Decoupling economic growth from resource use is one of the most critical and complex challenges facing humanity today. Doing so effectively will require policies that create a conducive environment for such change, social and physical infrastructure and markets, and a profound transformation of business practices along global value chains.

The per capita “material footprint” of developing countries grew from 5 metric tons in 2000 to 9 metric tons in 2017, representing a significant improvement in the material standard of living. Most of the increase is attributed to a rise in the use of non-metallic minerals, pointing to growth in the areas of infrastructure and construction.
For all types of materials, developed countries have at least double the per capita footprint of developing countries. In particular, the material footprint for fossil fuels is more than four times higher for developed than developing countries.
By 2018, a total of 108 countries had national policies and initiatives relevant to sustainable consumption and production.
According to a recent report from KPMG, 93 per cent of the world’s 250 largest companies (in terms of revenue) are now reporting on sustainability, as are three quarters of the top 100 companies in 49 countries."
434,"worldwide material consumption has expanded rapidly, as has material footprint per capita, seriously jeopardizing the achievement of sustainable development goal 12 and the goals more broadly. urgent action is needed to ensure that current material needs do not lead to the overextraction of resources or to the degradation of environmental resources, and should include policies that improve resource efficiency, reduce waste and mainstream sustainability practices across all sectors of the economy. in 2017, worldwide material consumption reached 92.1 billion tons, up from 87 billion in 2015 and a 254 per cent increase from 27 billion in 1970, with the rate of extraction accelerating every year since 2000. this reflects the increased demand for natural resources that has defined the past decades, resulting in undue burden on environmental resources. without urgent and concerted political action, it is projected that global resource extraction could grow to 190 billion tons by 2060. material footprint per capita has increased considerably as well: in 1990 some 8.1 tons of natural resources were used to satisfy a personâ€™s need, while in 2015, almost 12 tons of resources were extracted per person. well designed national policy frameworks and instruments are necessary to enable the fundamental shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. in 2018, 71 countries and the european union reported on a total of 303 policy instruments. parties to the montreal protocol and the basel, rotterdam and stockholm conventions are required to transmit information on the implementation of their obligations under those agreements. however, the rate of transmission varies, with the average compliance rate across these four agreements at approximately 70 per cent."
435,"worldwide consumption and production, a driving force of the global economy, rely on the use of the natural environment and resources in a model that continues to lead to destructive impacts on the planet. the pandemic offers countries an opportunity to build a recovery plan that will reverse current trends and change consumption and production patterns towards a sustainable future. as at 2019, 79 countries and the european union reported on at least one national policy instrument that contributed to sustainable consumption and production in their efforts towards the implementation of the 10 year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production patterns. global domestic material consumption per capita rose by 7 per cent, from 10.8 metric tons per capita in 2010 to 11.7 metric tons in 2017, with increases in all regions except northern america and africa. however, domestic material consumption per capita in europe and northern america is still 40 per cent higher than the global average, indicating the need to enhance resource efficiency and practices to reduce consumption in the future. the global material footprint rose, from 73.2 billion metric tons in 2010 to 85.9 billion metric tons in 2017, a 17.4 per cent increase since 2010 and a 66.5 per cent increase from 2000. the worldâ€™s reliance on natural resources continued to accelerate in the past two decades. the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer has been universally ratified by 198 parties, and, as a result of its implementation, the overall abundance of ozone depleting substances in the atmosphere has decreased over the past two decades, with projections to return to 1980 values in the 2030s for northern hemisphere mid latitude ozone. from 2010 to 2019, global e waste generation grew continuously, from 5.3 kg per capita to 7.3 kg per capita, while the environmentally sound recycling of eâ€‘waste increased at a slower pace, from 0.8 kg per capita to 1.3 kg per capita. "

437,"global fossil fuel subsidies amounted to more than $400 billion in 2018. the continued prevalence of such subsidies, more than double the estimated subsidies for renewables, adversely affects the task of achieving an early peak in global carbon dioxide emissions. for decades, scientists have been explaining the ways in which humanity is driving the three planetary crises of climate, biodiversity and pollution, all of which are linked to unsustainable production and consumption. changes in consumption and production patterns can help to promote the decoupling of economic growth and human well being from resource use and environmental impact. they can also trigger the transformations envisaged in global commitments on biodiversity, the climate, and sustainable development in general. the covid 19 pandemic provides a window of opportunity for exploring more inclusive and equitable development models that are underpinned by sustainable consumption and production. from 2017 to 2020, 83 countries, territories and the european union shared information on their contribution to the implementation of the 10 year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production patterns. in 2020, 136 policies and 27 implementation activities were reported, bringing the total number to over 700. while specific actions have been taken to improve resource use efficiency in a specific industry or area, this has not resulted in their widespread adoption across sectors and industries. data indicate a rise of almost 40 per cent in the global material footprint per capita, from 8.8 metric tons in 2000 to 12.2 metric tons in 2017. similarly, domestic material consumption per capita increased by more than 40 per cent, from 8.7 metric tons in 2000 to 12.2 metric tons in 2017. although limited data are available, as of 2016, almost 14 per cent of food produced globally was lost before reaching the retail sector. estimates vary across regions, from 20.7 per cent in central and southern asia to 5.8 per cent in australia and new zealand."
438,"in 2019, the amount of e waste generated was 7.3 kg per capita, with only 1.7 kg per capita documented to be managed in an environmentally sustainable manner. e waste generation is expected to grow by 0.16 kg per capita annually to reach 9 kg per capita in 2030. the annual rate of growth in e waste recycling over the past decade was 0.05 kg per capita, which will need to increase more than tenfold if all e waste is to be recycled by 2030. a pilot review conducted in 2020 on a random sample of about 4,000 companies in the united nations global compact database and the sustainability disclosure database of the global reporting initiative indicates that 85 per cent of companies reported on minimum requirements for sustainability issues and 40 per cent on advanced requirements for such issues. as of december 2020, 40 countries and territories had reported on sustainable public procurement policies and action plans or equivalent legal dispositions aimed at encouraging the procurement of environmentally sound, energy efficient products and promoting more socially responsible purchasing practices and sustainable supply chains. fossil fuel subsidies declined in 2019 to $431.6 billion as a result of lower fuel prices, reversing the upward trend from 2017 to 2018. fossil fuel subsidies are expected to fall sharply owing to the collapse in demand caused by covid 19 mitigation efforts and the oil price shock experienced in 2020. by 2018, a total of 108 countries had national policies and initiatives relevant to sustainable consumption and production. according to a recent report from kpmg, 93 per cent of the worldâ€™s 250 largest companies (in terms of revenue) are now reporting on sustainability, as are three quarters of the top 100 companies in 49 countries"
439,"climate change presents the single biggest threat to development, and its widespread, unprecedented impacts disproportionately burden the poorest and most vulnerable. urgent action to combat climate change and minimize its disruptions is integral to the successful implementation of the sustainable development goals. the global nature of climate change calls for broad international cooperation in building resilience and adaptive capacity to its adverse effects, developing sustainable low carbon pathways to the future, and accelerating the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. on 22 april 2016, 175 member states signed the paris agreement under the united nations framework convention on climate change. the new agreement aims to reduce the pace of climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future. climate change often exacerbates disasters. between 1990 and 2013, more than 1.6 million people died in internationally reported disasters, with annual deaths trending upwards. as a result, more countries are acting on the imperative to implement national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. in 2015, 83 countries had legislative and/or regulatory provisions in place for managing disaster risk. parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change are responsible for providing a range of national reports on their efforts to implement the agreement. as of 4 april 2016, 161 intended nationally determined contributions, from 189 of the 197 parties to the framework convention (the european commission submitted one joint intended determined contribution) had been recorded by the secretariat of the framework convention, providing insights into the efforts many countries are taking to integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning. "
440,"among those countries, 137 parties included an adaptation component in their intended nationally determined contributions. some countries stressed that adaptation was their main climate change priority, with strong linkages to other aspects of national development, sustainability and security. in order to help countries move forward on climate action, a global stocktaking was established, in the context of the paris agreement, to assess collective progress every five years. the process will begin in 2018, with a facilitative dialogue to review the efforts of parties towards emissions reductions and to inform the preparation of final nationally determined contributions. as parties scale up climate change action, enhanced cooperation, capacity building and access to financial and technical support will be needed to help many countries realize their priorities, including those identified in intended nationally determined contributions and national adaptation plans. developed countries have committed to mobilizing, by 2020, $100 billion a year in climate financing from a wide variety of sources to help address the needs of developing countries. by 2025, parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change will set a new collective goal of at least $100 billion per year. the green climate fund, a mechanism within the framework convention created to assist developing countries in adaptation and mitigation practices, is an important delivery vehicle for this financing. as of may 2016, the green climate fund had mobilized $10.3 billion. climate change is already affecting the most vulnerable countries and populations, in particular the least developed countries and the small island developing states. "
441,
442,"planetary warming continued in 2016, setting a new record of about 1.1 degrees centigrade above the preindustrial period, according to the world meteorological organization (wmo) statement on the state of the global climate in 2016. drought conditions predominated across much of the globe, aggravated by the el niã±o phenomenon in the statement, wmo also noted that the extent of global sea ice fell to a minimum of 4.14 million km2 in 2016, the second lowest extent on record. atmospheric carbon dioxide levels also reached a record high of 400 parts per million that year. mitigating climate change and its impacts will require building on the momentum achieved by the paris agreement on climate change, which entered into force on 4 november 2016. stronger efforts are needed to build resilience and limit climate related hazards and natural disasters. parties to the paris agreement are expected to prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions. the nationally determined contributions reflect official country responses to climate change and contributions to global climate action. as of 20 april 2017, 143 parties ratified the paris agreement, of which 137 parties (136 countries and the european commission) communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the secretariat of the united nations framework convention on climate change. as of 20 april 2017, seven developing countries successfully completed and submitted the first iteration of their national adaptation plans, in response to climate change. developed countries have committed to jointly mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020 to address the climate related needs of developing countries and to continue that level of support through 2025. initial efforts to mobilize resources for the green climate fund raised $10.3 billion and developed   country parties are strongly urged to scale up their financial support. "
443,"the year 2017 was one of the three warmest on record and was 1.1 degrees celsius above the pre industrial period. an analysis by the world meteorological organization shows that the five year average global temperature from 2013 to 2017 was also the highest on record. the world continues to experience rising sea levels, extreme weather conditions (the north atlantic hurricane season was the costliest ever recorded) and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. this calls for urgent and accelerated action by countries as they implement their commitments to the paris agreement on climate change. as of 9 april 2018, 175 parties had ratified the paris agreement and 168 parties (167 countries plus the european commission) had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the united nations framework convention on climate change secretariat. in addition, as of 9 april 2018, 10 developing countries had successfully completed and submitted the first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change. developed country parties continue to make progress towards the goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions. the number of deaths attributed to natural disasters continues to rise, despite progress in implementing disaster risk reduction strategies. from 1990 to 2015, more than 1.6 million people died in internationally reported natural disasters. many countries have begun implementing national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. in 2014 2015, most reporting countries indicated that environmental impact assessments, legislation on protected areas, climate change adaptation projects and programmes, and integrated planning played a major role in reducing underlying risk factors."
444,"with rising greenhouse gas emissions, climate change is occurring at rates much faster than anticipated and its effects are clearly felt worldwide. while there are positive steps in terms of the climate finance flows and the development of nationally determined contributions, far more ambitious plans and accelerated action are needed on mitigation and adaptation. access to finance and strengthened capacities need to be scaled up at a much faster rate, particularly for least developed countries and small island developing states. increasing greenhouse gas emissions are driving climate change. in 2017, greenhouse gas concentrations reached new highs, with globally averaged mole fractions of co2 at 405.5 parts per million (ppm), up from 400.1 ppm in 2015, and at 146 per cent of pre industrial levels. moving towards 2030 emission objectives compatible with the 2â°c and 1.5â°c pathways requires a peak to be achieved as soon as possible, followed by rapid reductions. as indicated under sustainable development goal 1 (see para. 22 above), during the period 1998â€“2017, direct economic losses from disasters were estimated at almost $3 trillion. climate related and geophysical disasters claimed an estimated 1.3 million lives. as of april 2019, 185 parties had ratified the paris agreement. parties to the paris agreement are expected to prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions, and 183 parties had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the secretariat of the united nations framework convention on climate change, while 1 party had communicated its second. under the agreement, all parties are required to submit new nationally determined contributions, containing revised and much more ambitious targets, by 2020. global climate finance flows increased by 17 per cent in the period 2015â€“2016 compared with the period 2013â€“2014. "
445,
446,"the year 2019 was the second warmest on record and the end of the warmest decade, 2010 to 2019. in addition, with a global average temperature of 1.1â°c above estimated pre industrial levels, the global community is far off track to meet either the 1.5 or 2â°c targets called for in the paris agreement. although greenhouse gas emissions are projected to drop by 6 per cent in 2020, and air quality has improved as a result of travel bans and the economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic, the improvement is only temporary. governments and businesses should utilize the lessons learned to accelerate the transitions needed to achieve the paris agreement, redefine the relationship with the environment and make systemic shifts and transformational changes to lower greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilient economies and societies. a total of 85 countries have reported having a national disaster risk reduction strategy aligned with the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 2015â€“2030 to some extent since its adoption in 2015. in 2018, 55 countries reported that at least some of their local governments had a local disaster risk reduction strategy aimed at contributing to sustainable development and strengthening socioeconomic health and environmental resilience by focusing on poverty eradication, urban resilience and climate change adaptation. the preparation of national adaptation programmes of action under the united nations framework convention on climate change is helping the least developed countries address urgent and immediate needs, with support from the least developed countries fund and the least developed countries expert group. in addition, the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action will help the least developed countries prepare and seek funding for comprehensive national adaptation plans, thereby reducing their risk of being left behind."
447,"as at 31 march 2020, 186 parties (185 countries plus the european union) had communicated their first nationally determined contribution, and several parties had communicated their second or updated nationally determined contribution to the united nations framework convention on climate change. parties have been requested to update existing nationally determined contributions or communicate new ones by 2020, providing a valuable opportunity for parties to increase their level of ambition in climate action. in 2019, at least 120 of 153 developing countries had undertaken activities to formulate and implement national adaptation plans, an increase of 29 countries, compared with 2018. the plans will help countries achieve the global goal on adaptation under the paris agreement. with regard to global climate finance, there was an increase of $584 billion, or 17 per cent, from 2013 to 2014 and of $681 billion from 2015 to 2016. high levels of new private investment in renewable energy account for the spurt in growth and represent the largest segment of the global total. while these financial flows are considerable, they are relatively small in relation to the scale of annual investment needed for a low carbon, climate resilient transition. moreover, investments in climate activities tracked across sectors were still surpassed by those related to fossil fuels in the energy sector alone ($781 billion in 2016). as at 20 may 2019, 28 countries had accessed green climate fund grant financing for the formulation of national adaptation plans and other adaptation planning processes, with a value of $75 million. of these, 67 per cent were for least developed countries, small island developing states and african states. "
448,"atmospheric concentrations of the major greenhouse gases continued to increase despite the temporary reduction in emissions in 2020 related to measures taken in response to the covid 19 pandemic. the six years from 2015 to 2020 are likely to be the warmest on record. climate change is making the achievement of many goals less likely. to limit global warming to 1.5â°c above pre industrial levels in accordance with the paris agreement, the world would need to achieve net zero carbon dioxide emissions by around 2050. as of april 2020, 118 countries and territories had reported the development and adoption of national or local disaster risk reduction strategies, an increase from 48 countries and territories in the first year of the sendai framework. as at 31 december 2020, 190 parties (189 countries and territories plus the european union) had communicated their first nationally determined contribution to the united nations framework convention on climate change, of which 44 were least developed countries and 40 were small island developing states. a further 48 countries and territories, of which one is a least developed country and five are small island developing states, have also communicated a second or updated nationally determined contribution. of these 48 countries and territories, 39 included adaptation information in their new or updated contribution. the nationally determined contributions demonstrate that countries and territories are articulating more quantified targets and indicators for adaptation and identifying links between adaptation, the goals and other frameworks."
449,"as at 31 march 2021, 125 of 154 developing countries were carrying out measures for national adaptation plans and prioritizing the formulation and implementation of the plans in their adaptation efforts. moreover, six least developed countries (including three small island developing states) and another four small island developing states have completed a national adaptation plan. further least developed countries have draft national adaptation plans and are on track to complete and submit these with a view to ensuring that all least developed countries have national adaptation plans by 2021. according to scientists, global emissions should be cut to 45 per cent below 2010 levels by 2030 in order to limit global warming to 1.5â°c above pre  industrial levels. emissions from developed countries were approximately 6.2 per cent lower in 2019 than in 2010, while emissions from 70 developing countries rose by 14.4 per cent in 2014. total climate finance reported by states parties included in annex i to the framework convention on climate change continues to increase, reaching an annual average of $48.7 billion in the period 2017â€“2018. this represents an increase of 10 per cent compared to the 2015â€“2016 period. while more than half of all climatespecific financial support in the 2017 and 2018 was targeted at mitigation action, the share of adaptation support is growing, and many countries and territories are prioritizing adaptation in their financial support provision. proposals from an additional seven countries, with a value of $17 million, are in the final stage of approval. in total, 75 countries are seeking support from the green climate fund for national adaptation plans and other adaptation planning processes, with a combined value of $191 million."
450,"oceans, along with coastal and marine resources, play an essential role in human well being and social and economic development worldwide. they are particularly crucial for people living in coastal communities, who represented 37 per cent of the global population in 2010. oceans provide livelihoods and tourism benefits, as well as subsistence and income. they also help regulate the global ecosystem by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and protecting coastal areas from flooding and erosion. in fact, coastal and marine resources contribute an estimated $28 trillion to the global economy each year through ecosystem services. however, those resources are extremely vulnerable to environmental degradation, overfishing, climate change and pollution. the sustainable use and preservation of marine and coastal ecosystems and their biological diversity is essential to achieving the 2030 agenda, in particular for small island developing states. pollution of both land and seas is a threat in many coastal regions. in addition, since river basins, marine ecosystems and the atmosphere are all part of hydrological systems, the effects of such pollution are often felt far from their source. in many coastal communities, pollution and eutrophication, which is the presence of excessive nutrients in water, frequently owing to runoff from the land, causing dense plant growth and the death of animal life, are driving detrimental changes. the five large marine ecosystems most at risk from coastal eutrophication, according to a global comparative assessment undertaken in 2016 as part of the transboundary water assessment programme, are the bay of bengal, the east china sea, the gulf of mexico, the north brazil shelf and the south china sea."
451,"since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the ocean has absorbed about one third of the carbon dioxide released by human activities, thereby mitigating the full impact of climate change. however, this comes at a steep ecological price, as dissolved carbon dioxide in seawater lowers the ph level of oceans, thereby increasing acidity and changing the biogeochemical carbonate balance. concerns about ocean acidification, first expressed in the early 1980s, have now been confirmed, and the extent of its impact on marine ecosystems is being investigated. fisheries contribute significantly to global food security, livelihoods and the economy. however, if not sustainably managed, fishing can damage fish habitats. ultimately, overfishing impairs the functioning of ecosystems and reduces biodiversity, with negative repercussions for sustainable social and economic development. in order to achieve a healthy balance, fish stocks must be maintained within biologically sustainable limits, at or above the abundance level that can produce maximum sustainable yields. based on an analysis of assessed stocks, the percentage of world marine fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 69 per cent in 2013. fortunately, the downward trend has slowed and appears to have stabilized since 2008. biodiverse marine sites require safeguarding to ensure sustainable long term use of their precious natural resources. globally, in 2014, 8.4 per cent of the marine environment under national jurisdiction (up to 200 nautical miles from shore) and 0.25 per cent of the marine environment beyond national jurisdiction were under protection. "
452,"goal 14. conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development 18. the increasingly adverse impacts of climate change (including ocean acidification), overfishing and marine pollution are jeopardizing recent gains in protecting portions of the worldâ€™s oceans. global trends point to continued deterioration of coastal waters owing to pollution and eutrophication (excessive nutrients in water, frequently a result of run off from land, which causes dense plant growth and the death of animal life from lack of oxygen). of the 63 large marine ecosystems evaluated under the transboundary waters assessment programme, 16 per cent of the ecosystems are in the high or highest risk categories for coastal eutrophication. they are located mainly in western europe, southern and eastern asia, and the gulf of mexico. ocean acidification is closely linked to shifts in the carbonate chemistry of the waters, which can lead to a significant weakening of the shells and skeletons of many marine species (such as reef building corals and shelled molluscs). studies of marine acidity at open ocean and coastal sites around the world have indicated that current levels are often outside preindustrial bounds. overfishing reduces food production, impairs the functioning of ecosystems and reduces biodiversity. the proportion of world marine fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels has declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 68.6 per cent in 2013. however, the trend has slowed and appears to have stabilized from 2008 to 2013. small scale fisheries face numerous challenges. in response, about 70 per cent of the respondents to a survey representing 92 countries and the european union have introduced or developed regulations, policies, laws, plans or strategies specifically targeting small scale fisheries.

"
455,"the expansion of protected areas for marine biodiversity and existing policies and treaties that encourage responsible use of ocean resources are still insufficient to combat the adverse effects of overfishing, growing ocean acidification due to climate change and worsening coastal eutrophication. as billions of people depend on oceans for their livelihood and food source and on the transboundary nature of oceans, increased efforts and interventions are needed to conserve and sustainably use ocean resources at all levels. ocean acidification is caused by the uptake of atmospheric co2 by the ocean, which changes the chemical composition of the seawater. long term observations of ocean acidification over the past 30 years have shown an average increase of acidity of 26 per cent since pre industrial times, and at this rate, an increase of 100 to 150 per cent is predicted by the end of the century, with serious consequences for marine life. to achieve sustainable development of fisheries, fish stocks must be maintained at a biologically sustainable level. analyses reveal that the fraction of world marine fish stocks that are within biologically sustainable levels declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 66.9 per cent in 2015. as of december 2018, over 24 million km2 (17.2 per cent) of waters under national jurisdiction (0â€“200 nautical miles from a national border) were covered by protected areas, a significant increase from 12 per cent in 2015 and more than double the extent covered in 2010. "
456,"the global mean percentage of each marine key biodiversity area covered by protected areas increased from 31.2 per cent in 2000 to 44.7 per cent in 2015 and to 45.7 per cent in 2018. illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing remains one of the greatest threats to sustainable fisheries, the livelihoods of those who depend upon them and marine ecosystems. a framework of international instruments has been developed that addresses different aspects of fisheries management. most countries have taken measures to combat such fishing and have adopted an increasing number of fisheries management instruments in the past decade. for example, the agreement on port state measures to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, the first international binding agreement to combat such fishing, entered into force in june 2016. the number of parties to the agreement has rapidly increased and stood at 58 as of february 2019. small scale fisheries are present in almost all countries, accounting for more than half of total production on average, in terms of both quantity and value. to promote small scale fishersâ€™ access to productive resources, services and markets, most countries have developed targeted regulatory and institutional frameworks. however, more than 20 per cent of countries have a low to medium level of implementation of such frameworks, particularly in oceania and central and south asia. when effectively managed and well resourced, marine protected areas are important mechanisms for safeguarding ocean life. in 2017, protected areas cover 13.2 per cent of the marine environment under national jurisdiction (up to 200 nautical miles from shore), 0.25 per cent of the marine environment beyond national jurisdiction and 5.3 per cent of the total global ocean area."
457,"oceans and fisheries continued to support the global populationâ€™s economic, social and environmental needs while suffering unsustainable depletion, environmental deterioration and carbon dioxide saturation and acidification. current efforts to protect key marine environments and small scale fishers and invest in ocean science are not yet meeting the urgent need to protect this vast, fragile resource. the ocean absorbs around 23 per cent of the annual emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, helping to alleviate the impacts of climate change on the planet, however, resulting in a decreasing ph and acidification of the ocean. a new ocean acidification data portal shows an increase in variability in ph and the acidity of the oceans by 10 to 30 per cent in the period 2015â€“2019. the sustainability of global fishery resources continues to decline, though at a reduced rate, with the proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels at 65.8 per cent in 2017, down from 90 per cent in 1974 and 0.8 percentage point lower than 2015 levels. as at december 2019, more than 24 million km2, or 17 per cent, of waters under national jurisdiction (up to 200 nautical miles from shore) were covered by protected areas, more than doubling in extent since 2010. much of the coverage is concentrated in oceania and latin america and the caribbean. as at february 2020, the number of parties to the agreement on port state measures to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing â€“ the first binding international agreement that specifically targets illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing â€“ increased to 66 (including the european union) from 58 in the previous year, and nearly 70 per cent of countries reported scoring high on the implementation thereof. "
458,"more than 3 billion people rely on the oceans for their livelihoods, and more than 80 per cent of world merchandise trade by volume is carried by sea. the oceans, seas and marine resources are under constant threat from pollution, warming and acidification that are disrupting marine ecosystems and the communities they support. these changes have long term repercussions that require the world to urgently scale up the protection of marine environments, investment in ocean science, support for small scale fishery communities, and the sustainable management of the oceans. while efforts to reduce nutrient inputs into coastal zones are showing success in some regions, algal blooms indicate that coastal eutrophication continues to be a challenge. globally, anomalies of chlorophyll a (the pigment responsible for photosynthesis in all plants and algae) in national exclusive economic zones decreased by 20 per cent from 2018 to 2020. ocean acidification is caused by the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by the ocean, resulting in a decreasing ph and threatening marine organisms and ocean based services. a limited set of long term observation sites in the open ocean have observed a continuous decline in ph over the past 20 to 30 years. mean protected area coverage of marine key biodiversity areas increased globally from 28 per cent in 2000 to 44 per cent in 2020. however, there is considerable geographical variation in this progress, with coverage still less than one quarter of key biodiversity areas in oceania (excluding australia and new zealand). the contribution of sustainable marine capture fisheries remained stable at the global level, with regional variation, representing the largest contribution to the gdp in pacific small island developing states and least developed countries, averaging 1.55 and 1.15 per cent, respectively, in 2011 to 2017."
459,"improved regulation, together with effective monitoring and surveillance, has proved successful in restoring overfished stocks to biologically sustainable levels. however, the adoption of such measures has generally been slow, in many developing countries in particular. in 13 countries and territories that have active assessment and management systems in place, the proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels is higher than the world average of 65.8 per cent, according to data collected in 2019. between 2018 and 2020, the average degree of implementation of international instruments to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing improved around the world, with the global score measuring the implementation of the five principal instruments rising from 3 to 4 out of 5. almost 75 per cent of states scored highly in their degree of implementation in 2020, compared to 70 per cent percent of states in 2018. between 2018 and 2020, the world made progress in implementing regulatory and institutional frameworks that recognize and protect access rights for small scale fisheries, with the global score rising from 3 to 4. at the regional level, northern africa and western asia made this progress, while the regional score for central and southern asia fell from 3 to 2, highlighting the need for efforts there to be redoubled and demonstrating that there is no room for complacency. from 2000 to 2016, the share of marine sites around the world that are designated as key biodiversity areas and are completely covered by protected areas increased from 15 per cent to 19 per cent. "
460,"sustainable fisheries accounted for approximately 0.1 per cent of global gdp in 2017, while contributing more than 0.5 per cent of gdp in certain regions and the least developed countries. the sustainable management of fish stocks remains critical to ensuring that fisheries continue to generate economic growth and support equitable development. the long term impact of the covid 19 pandemic on fisheries poses significant challenges that threaten to undermine sustainable stock management and profitability. on average, only 1.2 per cent of national research budgets was allocated to ocean science between 2013 and 2017, with amounts ranging from 0.02 per cent to 9.5 per cent. this is a small proportion in view of the conservatively estimated $1.5 trillion contribution of the ocean to the global economy in 2010. many states have ratified or acceded to the united nations convention on the law of the sea (168 parties) and its implementing agreements (150 parties for the agreement relating to the implementation of part xi of the united nations convention on the law of the sea and 91 parties for the united nations fish stocks agreement). a number of states have implemented these instruments through legal, policy and institutional frameworks, but further progress is needed in some developing countries, in particular the least developed countries. when effectively managed and well resourced, marine protected areas are important mechanisms for safeguarding ocean life. in 2017, protected areas cover 13.2 per cent of the marine environment under national jurisdiction (up to 200 nautical miles from shore), 0.25 per cent of the marine environment beyond national jurisdiction and 5.3 per cent of the total global ocean area."
461,"preserving diverse forms of life on land requires targeted efforts to protect, restore and promote the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial and other ecosystems. goal 15 focuses specifically on managing forests sustainably, restoring degraded lands and successfully combating desertification, reducing degraded natural habitats and ending biodiversity loss. between 1990 and 2015, the worldâ€™s forest area diminished from 31.7 per cent of the worldâ€™s total land mass to 30.7 per cent. the loss was mainly attributable to the conversion of forest to other land uses, such as agriculture and infrastructure development. meanwhile, other areas were transformed into forests through planting, landscape restoration or the natural expansion of forest. owing to the balance of the two processes and efforts to slow deforestation, the global net loss of forest area declined from 7.3 million hectares per year in the 1990s to 3.3 million hectares per year during the period from 2010 to 2015. to safeguard places that contribute significantly to global biodiversity, protected areas have been established and identified as key biodiversity areas. in 2014, 15.2 per cent of the worldâ€™s terrestrial and freshwater environments were covered by protected areas. the percentage of terrestrial key biodiversity areas covered by protected areas has increased, from 16.5 per cent in 2000 to 19.3 per cent in 2016. over the same period, the share of freshwater key biodiversity areas that are protected has increased from 13.8 per cent to 16.6 per cent, and the share of mountain key biodiversity areas under protection has grown from 18.1 per cent to 20.1 per cent."
462,"the focus in goal 15 on halting biodiversity loss comes at a critical time, since many species of amphibians, birds and mammals are sliding towards extinction. according to the international union for conservation of natureâ€™s red list index, amphibians are declining most rapidly in latin america and the caribbean, primarily as a result of the chytrid fungal disease, one of numerous wildlife diseases on the rise worldwide. the greatest extinction risks for birds and mammals are found in south eastern asia, mainly owing to the conversion of lowland forests. however, their decline is not inevitable, with extinction risks for vertebrate species having been reversed in five small island developing states (the cook islands, fiji, mauritius, seychelles and tonga) as a result of conservation actions over the past several decades. conservation efforts can also be thwarted by poaching and the trafficking of wildlife. since 1999, at least 7,000 species of animals and plants have been detected in illegal trade, and the list of species under international protection continues to grow. comparing the size of legal trade in wildlife products (about 900,000 transactions per year) to the quantity of wildlife seized (about 16,000 seizures per year) provides an indication of the scope of illicit wildlife trafficking. the value of legal and illicit wildlife products can also be compared. for example, the value of recorded seizures of crocodylus genus represents between 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent of the value of legal protected exports of this species between 2009 and 2013, with no clear trend discernible. in 2014, bilateral oda to support biodiversity amounted to $7 billion, an increase of 16 per cent in real terms over 2013. the two largest recipients of biodiversity assistance were the philippines and india, which together received about $1 billion of the total aid."
463,"progress in preserving and sustainably using the earthâ€™s terrestrial species and ecosystems is uneven. the pace of forest loss has slowed and improvements continue to be made in managing forests sustainably and protecting areas important for biodiversity. however, declining trends in land productivity, biodiversity loss and poaching and trafficking of wildlife remain serious concerns. the net loss of forest continues to slow and forest biomass stock per hecta re is stable. more forests are being protected and areas under long term management plans and voluntary certification have increased. from 2010 to 2015, the annual net loss of forest area globally was less than half that of the 1990s. the proportion of land area covered by forest decreased from 31.6 per cent in 1990 to 30.8 per cent in 2010 and 30.6 per cent in 2015. fifteen per cent of land is currently under protection, but that does not cover all areas important for biodiversity. protecting key biodiversity areas is necessary to strengthen natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. from 2000 to 2017, average worldwide coverage of terrestrial, freshwater and mountain key biodiversity areas by protected areas increased from 35 per cent to 47 per cent, from 32 per cent to 43 per cent and from 39 per cent to 49 per cent, respectively. as of 2017, 76 per cent of the worldâ€™s mountain areas are covered by some form of green vegetation, including forests, shrubs, grasses and crops. green cover on mountains is lowest in central asia (31 per cent) and highest in oceania (excluding australia and new zealand) (98 per cent)."
464,"from 1998 to 2013, about one fifth of the earthâ€™s land surface covered by vegetation showed persistent and declining trends in productivity. south america and africa are most affected; in some cases, advanced stages of land degradation there are leading to desertification in dryland areas, particularly in the grasslands and rangelands. land and soil degradation undermine the security and development of all countries. reversing the effects of land degradation and desertification through sustainable land management is key to improving the lives and livelihoods of more than 1 billion people currently under threat. biodiversity loss continues at an alarming rate according to the red list index. the extinction risk for corals is increasing most rapidly among all assessed species groups owing to the growing threat from climate change and local impacts. chytrid fungal disease, another grave concern, is decimating many amphibian species and increasing their risk of extinction. wildlife poaching and trafficking continues to thwart conservation efforts. illicit wildlife markets are complex and subject to rapid fluctuations. demand for a given wildlife product can grow quickly, before the international community can react. in 2013, elephant ivory, rosewood and rhinoceros horn comprised over 60 per cent of total wildlife and timber product seizures. the global community is committed to conserving biodiversity. two international agreements aim at sharing the benefits from using genetic resources in a fair and equitable way. as of april 2017, 144 countries ratified the international treaty on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and 96 countries ratified the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization. "
465,"protection of forest and terrestrial ecosystems is on the rise, and forest loss has slowed. that said, other facets of terrestrial conservation continue to demand accelerated action to protect biodiversity, land productivity and genetic resources and to curtail the loss of species. the earthâ€™s forest areas continue to shrink, down from 4.1 billion hectares in 2000 (or 31.2 per cent of total land area) to about 4 billion hectares (30.7 per cent of total land area) in 2015. however, the rate of forest loss has been cut by 25 per cent since 2000â€“2005. about one fifth of the earthâ€™s land surface covered by vegetation showed persistent and declining trends in productivity from 1999 to 2013, threatening the livelihoods of over one billion people. up to 24 million square kilometres of land were affected, including 19 per cent of cropland, 16 per cent of forest land, 19 per cent of grassland and 28 per cent of rangeland. since 1993, the global red list index of threatened species has fallen from 0.82 to 0.74, indicating an alarming trend in the decline of mammals, birds, amphibians, corals and cycads. the primary drivers of this assault on biodiversity are habitat loss from unsustainable agriculture, deforestation, unsustainable harvest and trade, and invasive alien species. illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife continues to thwart conservation efforts, with nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants reported in illegal trade involving 120 countries. in 2016, bilateral oda in support of biodiversity totalled $7 billion, a decrease of 21 per cent in real terms from 2015."
466,"there are some encouraging global trends in protecting terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity. forest loss is slowing down, more key biodiversity areas are protected and more financial assistance is flowing towards biodiversity protection. yet, the 2020 targets of sustainable development goal 15 are unlikely to be met, land degradation continues, biodiversity loss is occurring at an alarming rate, and invasive species and the illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife continue to thwart efforts to protect and restore vital ecosystems and species. protecting important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity is vital for ensuring long term and sustainable use of terrestrial and freshwater natural resources. the global mean percentage of each key biodiversity area covered by protected areas increased from 33.1 per cent in 2000 to 46.1 per cent in 2018 for terrestrial areas, from 30.5 per cent in 2000 to 43.2 per cent in 2018 for freshwater areas, and from 32.9 per cent in 2000 to 44.7 per cent in 2018 for mountain areas. healthy mountain ecosystems are fundamental to ensuring the provision of ecosystem services to upland communities as well as lowland peoples. as of 2017, 76 per cent of the worldâ€™s mountain areas were covered by a form of green coverage: 41 per cent by forests, 29 per cent by grassland/shrubland and only 6 per cent by cropland. in 2015, bilateral oda in support of biodiversity amounted to $8.8 billion, an increase of 39 per cent in real terms over 2014."
467,"from 2000 to 2015, more than one fifth of the earthâ€™s total land area was degraded, largely due to human induced processes, such as desertification, cropland expansion and urbanization. during the same period, there were significant productivity declines in land cover, with grasslands incurring some of the greatest losses. the most fundamental and irreversible human impact on nature is species extinction. the red list index â€“ which measures the risk of extinction, in which a value of 1 indicates no threat to any species, and a value of 0 indicates that all species are extinct â€“ has deteriorated from 0.82 in 1993 to 0.73 globally in 2019. the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization to the convention on biological diversity creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources and biodiversity. as at 1 february 2019, 116 countries had ratified the nagoya protocol (an increase of 46 since 2016) and 61 countries had shared information on their access and benefit sharing frameworks through the access and benefit sharing clearing house (representing an increase of 55 countries). in 2017, bilateral oda in support of biodiversity was $8.7 billion, an increase of 15 per cent in real terms over 2016. there are now 148 parties to the international treaty on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, and so far, 57 countries and territories have provided information about the measures that they have taken to implement the nagoya protocol."
468,"forest areas continued to decline, protected areas were not concentrated in areas of key biodiversity and species remained threatened with extinction. however, efforts were gaining traction and having positive effects that could help to reverse those outcomes, such as increased progress towards sustainable forest management; gains in protected area coverage for terrestrial, freshwater and mountain areas; and progress in implementing programmes, legislation and accounting principles to protect biodiversity and ecosystems. the proportion of forest area fell, from 31.9 per cent of total land area in 2000 to 31.2 per cent in 2020, representing a net loss of nearly 100 million ha of the worldâ€™s forests. from 2000 to 2020, forest area increased in asia, europe and northern america, while significantly decreasing in latin america, sub saharan africa and south eastern asia, driven by land conversion to agriculture. not withstanding the overall loss, 2017 data showed that the proportion of forests in protected areas and under long term management plans, as well as certified forest area, increased or remained stable at the global level and in most regions of the world. in 2020, the average proportion of each key biodiversity area for terrestrial, freshwater and mountain biodiversity within protected areas was 44, 41 and 41 per cent, respectively, an increase of around 12 to 13 percentage points since 2000. however, most key biodiversity areas still have incomplete or no coverage by protected areas. as at 2019, 123 countries had committed themselves to setting their voluntary targets for achieving land degradation neutrality, and in 60 countries, governments had already officially endorsed those targets."
469,"species extinction, which threatens sustainable development and compromises global heritage, is driven primarily through habitat loss from unsustainable agriculture, harvest and trade; deforestation; and invasive alien species. globally, the species extinction risk has worsened by about 10 per cent over the past three decades, with the red list index (which measures the risk of extinction, whereby a value of 1 indicates no threat of extinction and a value of 0 indicates that all species are extinct) declining, from 0.82 in 1990 to 0.75 in 2015 to 0.73 in 2020. as at 1 february 2020, 122 countries and the european union had ratified the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization to the convention on biological diversity (an increase of 53 from 2019), and 63 countries and the european union had shared information on their access and benefit sharing frameworks. regarding the international treaty on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, there are now 146 contracting parties thereto, and 56 countries have provided information about their access and benefit sharing measures. only about a third of reporting parties are on track to achieving their national biodiversity targets as reported in national reports under the convention on biological diversity. as at january 2020, 129 parties, including the european union, had reported their sixth national report, and 113 parties had assessed progress towards their national targets related to aichi biodiversity target 2. about half the parties had made progress towards their targets, but not at a rate that will allow them to meet their goals."
470,"deforestation and forest degradation, continued biodiversity loss and the ongoing degradation of ecosystems are having profound consequences for human well being and survival. the world fell short on 2020 targets to halt biodiversity loss. the covid 19 pandemic has shown that, by threatening biodiversity, humanity threatens its own survival. while great efforts are being made to expand sustainable forest management, increase coverage of key biodiversity areas and sign up t o legislation and treaties for protecting biodiversity and ecosystems, much more needs to be done to put the health of the planet at the centre of all plans and policies. while the rate of deforestation in tropical regions has slowed in the past decad e, vigilance and targeted efforts are required to maintain this trend. the proportion of forest area fell from 31.9 per cent of total land area in 2000 to 31.2 per cent in 2020, representing a net loss of almost 100 million hectares of the worldâ€™s forests. from 2000 to 2020, forest area increased in asia, europe and northern america, but decreased significantly in latin america and sub saharan africa. despite the losses in forest cover, above ground forest biomass per hectare, the proportion of forest area in protected areas and under long term management plans, and certified forest area all increased or remained stable at the global level and in most of the regions of the world, demonstrating global progress towards sustainable forest management."
471,"in 2020, an average of 43 per cent of each terrestrial key biodiversity area, 42 per cent of each freshwater key biodiversity area, and 41 per cent of each mountain key biodiversity area were within protected areas, an increase of 13 to14 percentage points since 2000. as of february 2021, 127 countries and territories had committed to setting voluntary targets for achieving land degradation neutrality, and 68 countries and territories had already officially endorsed their targets. overall, commitments to la nd restoration are estimated to amount to 1 billion hectares, of which 450 million hectares are covered by commitments through land degradation neutrality targets. data based on satellite imagery reveal that green coverage (forests, grasslands, croplands and wetlands) of the worldâ€™s mountains remained steady at about 73 per cent between 2000 and 2018. green cover tends to be greater in mountain areas that are less than 2,500 metres above sea level. however, mountain green cover varies considerably across geographical regions, ranging from 100 per cent in oceania to 68 per cent in northern africa and western asia. globally, the risk of species extinction has increased by about 10 per cent over the past three decades. the red list index, which ranges from a value of 1 to indicate no risk of extinction to a value of 0 to indicate the extinction of all species, decreased from 0.81 in 1993 to 0.73 in 2021. as at 1 february 2021, 128 countries, territories and the european union had ratified the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization to the convention on biological diversity, which is an increase of 60 countries and territories since 2016, and 67 countries, territories and the european union have shared information on their nagoya protocol frameworks.

472,"the pandemic and the vast subsequent harm to human and economic well being have starkly illustrated the potential global impact of zoonotic diseases, for which wildlife trade â€“ both legal and illegal â€“ is a potential vector. while certain markets for illegal wildlife products are declining, such as the market for ivory, which has decreased 3.5 fold since 2013, other species are under increasing threat as offenders shift their focus to more lucrative products, such as pangolin scales. in 2018, for example, there was a tenfold increase in the number of whole pangolin equivalents seized since 2014. nearly all countries and territories (98 per cent) have adopted national legislation for the prevention or control of invasive alien species, although there is wide variation in its coverage across sectors. the proportion of countries and territories aligning their targets for invasive alien species with global targets has increased, from 74 per cent in 2016 to 84 per cent in 2020. as of march 2021, 89 countries and territories have implemented the system of environmental economic accounting, an increase of 29 per cent since 2017. of these, 62 countries and territories (70 per cent) have integrated the system of accounting into their regular statistical production methods, and compile and publish the accounts on a regular basis. in 2019, oda from development assistance committee members provided in support of biodiversity amounted to $6.6 billion, a decrease of 14 per cent in real terms compared to 2018. in 2021, a total of 232 biodiversity relevant taxes are in force across 62 countries and territories"
473,"peace, justice and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions are at the core of sustainable development. several regions have enjoyed increased and sustained levels of peace and security in recent decades. but many countries still face protracted armed conflict and violence, and far too many people struggle as a result of weak institutions and the lack of access to justice, information and other fundamental freedoms. the number of victims of intentional homicide worldwide remained relatively stable from 2008 to 2014. the worldwide number of victims of intentional homicide was estimated to be between 4.6 and 6.8 per 100,000 people in 2014, a slight decrease with respect to previous years. yet during that period, the homicide rate in developing countries was twice that in developed countries, and increased in the least developed countries. moreover, despite the lack of harmonized data, fatalities and injuries related to armed conflict appear to be increasing in some countries, causing unprecedented population displacements and enormous humanitarian needs. various forms of violence against children are pervasive, including discipline that relies on physical punishment and psychological aggression. in all but 7 of 73 countries and areas with available survey data from 2005 to 2015, more than half of children between the ages of 1 and 14 were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home. in northern africa, the share was more than 90 per cent. globally, the share of girls and boys among victims of human trafficking (21 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively) peaked in 2011."
474,"survey data from 31 low  and middle income countries suggest that the proportion of women aged between 18 and 29 who experienced sexual violence for the first time before the age of 18 varies widely, ranging from zero to 16 per cent. comparable data on the experiences of men are only available for five countries, but values are lower than those reported among women in the same countries. progress with respect to the rule of law and access to justice is mixed. globally, the proportion of people held in detention without sentencing decreased slightly, from 32 per cent of total detainees in 2003 2005 to 30 per cent in 2012 2014. however, the percentage for developing regions has consistently been more than two times that of developed regions. in southern asia, for instance, more than 2 out of 3 prisoners remained unsentenced in 2012 2014, despite some improvement over the data available for the period 2003 to 2005. among victims of robbery, between one quarter and one half reported the crime to the police, in 27 countries with available data. the data suggest a significant gap in citizensâ€™ access to and trust in authorities. although official data on the prevalence of bribery are limited, figures from 19 countries indicate that the rate of prevalence of bribery may reach as high as 50 per cent among citizens who had contact with public officials, undermining trust in state institutions. registering children at birth is a first step in securing recognition before the law and safeguarding individual rights and access to justice. "
475,"efforts are under way to make national and international institutions more effective, inclusive and transparent. over the past 10 years, nearly two thirds of 144 countries with available data were able to plan their national budgets effectively (where final expenses remained within 10 per cent of original budgets). voting rights assigned to various groups of countries in international institutions is one indication of inclusivity at the international level. for example, while developing countries account for 63 per cent of voting rights in the african development bank, this figure is only 35 per cent in the international monetary fund and 38 per cent in the international bank for reconstruction and development of the world bank group. a free press is closely linked to access to information and the protection of human rights, but the trend in this regard is discouraging. the number of journalists killed increased from 65 in 2010 to 114 in 2015, despite the fact that, by 2013, 90 states had adopted laws on freedom of and/or access to information. the proportion of countries with national human rights institutions has doubled over the past 15 years, reaching 35.5 per cent by the end of 2015. the share of such institutions that are compliant with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (paris principles) (adopted by the general assembly in its resolution 48/134) was highest in developed regions (46 per cent) and in latin america and the caribbean (41 per cent)."
476,
477,"many regions of the world continue to suffer untold horrors as a result of armed conflict or other forms of violence that occur within societies and at the domestic level. advances in promoting the rule of law and access to justice are uneven. however, progress is being made in regulations to promote public access to information, albeit slowly, and in strengthening institutions upholding human rights at the national level. nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 years were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment on a regular basis at home in 81 countries (primarily developing), according to available data from 2005 to 2017. in all but seven of these countries, more than half of children experienced violent forms of discipline. more than 570 different flows involving trafficking in persons were detected between 2012 and 2014, affecting all regions; many involved movement from lower income to higher income countries. in 2014, the majority of detected trafficking victims were women and girls (71 per cent), and about 28 per cent were children (20 per cent girls and 8 per cent boys). over 90 per cent of victims detected were trafficked for sexual exploitation or forced labour. globally, children living in urban areas are around 1.5 times more likely to be registered than their rural counterparts. in most regions, birth registration rates tend to be highest among the richest 20 per cent of the population.  almost half of low income economies showed more than plus or minus 10 per cent deviation in budget execution."
478,"the proportion of prisoners held in detention without being sentenced for a crime remained almost constant in the last decade: from 32 per cent in 2003â€“2005 to 31 per cent in 2014â€“2016. almost one in five firms worldwide report receiving at least one bribery payment request when engaged in regulatory or utility transactions. globally, 73 per cent of children under 5 have had their births registered; the proportion is less than half (46 per cent) in sub saharan africa. at least 1,019 human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists have been killed in 61 countries since 2015. this is equivalent to one person killed every day while working to inform the public and build a world free from fear and want. freedom of information laws and policies have been adopted by 116 countries, with at least 25 countries doing so over the last five years. however, implementation remains a challenge. since 1998, more than half of countries (116 of 197) have established a national human rights institution that has been peer reviewed for compliance with internationally agreed standards (the paris principles). however, only 75 of these countries have institutions that are fully compliant.  by 2014, the figures had dropped to 18 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, but were still almost twice the levels recorded for 2004. sexual violence is one of the most unsettling of childrenâ€™s rights violations. yet underreporting and the lack of comparable data limit understanding of the full extent of the problem. "
479,"Many regions of the world continue to suffer untold horrors as a result of armed conflict or other forms of violence that occur within societies and at the domestic level. Advances in promoting the rule of law and access to justice are uneven. However, progress is being made in regulations to promote public access to information, albeit slowly, and in strengthening institutions upholding human rights at the national level.
Nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 years were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment on a regular basis at home in 81 countries (primarily developing), according to available data from 2005 to 2017. In all but seven of these countries, more than half of children experienced violent forms of discipline.
More than 570 different flows involving trafficking in persons were detected between 2012 and 2014, affecting all regions; many involved movement from lower-income to higher-income countries.
In 2014, the majority of detected trafficking victims were women and girls (71 per cent), and about 28 per cent were children (20 per cent girls and 8 per cent boys). Over 90 per cent of victims detected were trafficked for sexual exploitation or forced labour."
480,"The proportion of prisoners held in detention without being sentenced for a crime remained almost constant in the last decade: from 32 per cent in 2003â€“2005 to 31 per cent in 2014â€“2016.
Almost one in five firms worldwide report receiving at least one bribery payment request when engaged in regulatory or utility transactions.
Globally, 73 per cent of children under 5 have had their births registered; the proportion is less than half (46 per cent) in sub-Saharan Africa.
At least 1,019 human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists have been killed in 61 countries since 2015. This is equivalent to one person killed every day while working to inform the public and build a world free from fear and want.
Freedom-of-information laws and policies have been adopted by 116 countries, with at least 25 countries doing so over the last five years. However, implementation remains a challenge.
Since 1998, more than half of countries (116 of 197) have established a national human rights institution that has been peer reviewed for compliance with internationally agreed standards (the Paris Principles). However, only 75 of these countries have institutions that are fully compliant."
481,"advances in ending violence, promoting the rule of law, strengthening institutions and increasing access to justice are uneven and continue to deprive millions of their security, rights and opportunities and undermine the delivery of public services and broader economic development. attacks on civil society are also holding back development progress. renewed efforts are essential to move towards the achievement of sustainable development goal 16. the number of intentional homicides per 100,000 people increased from 6.0 in 2015 to 6.1 in 2017. this slight uptick was largely the result of an increase in the homicide rates in latin america and the caribbean and in some countries in sub saharan africa. various forms of violence against children persist. in 83 countries (mostly from developing regions) with recent data on the subject, nearly 8 in 10 children from 1 to 14 years of age were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home. in all but seven of these countries, at least half of children experienced violent disciplinary methods. sexual violence is perhaps the most disturbing of childrenâ€™s rights violations. based on the limited data available, in 14 of 46 countries with comparable data, at least 5 per cent of women between the ages of 18 and 29 experienced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts that were forced, physically or in other ways, for the first time before they were 18 years of age. despite recent progress, the births of more than 1 in 4 children under the age of 5 worldwide have not been recorded. in sub saharan africa, over half (54 per cent) of children have not been registered by their fifth birthday. "
482,"there has been an overall increase in the detection of victims of trafficking in persons, which could reflect either a positive (enhanced efforts by authorities to identify victims) or negative (larger trafficking problem) development. in a departure from prior findings, recent data show that most trafficking victims were detected domestically: 58 per cent in 2016, up from 43 per cent in 2014. the vast majority (70 per cent) of detected victims of human trafficking were women and girls, most of whom were trafficked for sexual exploitation. the share of unsentenced detainees in the overall prison population has remained largely constant at 30 per cent in recent years. this occurred in a context where the total prison population grew in absolute values while remaining constant as a share of the total population. killings of human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists are on the rise. from 2017 to 2018, the united nations recorded and verified 431 killings across 41 countries. every passing week saw at least eight people murdered at the front lines of efforts to build more inclusive and equal societies â€“ a worrying increase from the previous average of one victim per day observed from 2015 to 2017. ninety nine journalists and bloggers were among the victims. one out of 10 countries had a deviation of more than plus or minus 15 per cent.  access to internationally recognized national human rights institutions, however, remains overdue in 78 countries, in particular in eastern and south eastern asia, latin america and the caribbean, oceania and sub saharan africa."
483,"birth registration plays a primary role in ensuring individual rights and access to justice and social services. even if many regions have reached universal or near universal birth registration, globally the average is just 73 per cent. fewer than half (46 per cent) of all children under the age of 5 in sub saharan africa have had their births registered. binding laws and policies giving individuals a right to access information held by public authorities have been adopted by 125 countries, with at least 31 countries adopting such laws since 2013. among the 123 countries for which data on the legal framework is available, 40 do not include the right to appeal to an independent administrative body, which has been assessed as key for the proper implementation of this right. the pace of progress to put in place national human rights institutions compliant with the paris principles must be accelerated. in 2018, a total of 39 per cent of all countries had in place an institution that was fully compliant with the internationally agreed standard, seven countries more than was the case in 2015. if growth continues at the same rate, by 2030 only a little over one half (54 per cent) of all countries worldwide will have compliant national human rights institutions. the difference between the approved and the implemented budget reflects a governmentâ€™s ability to achieve development objectives, including delivering services to the public. deviation between the approved and actual spending during the period 2006â€“2017 in 108 countries shows that actual spending was within plus or minus 5 per cent of the approved budget in about half of the countries. "
484,"conflict, insecurity, weak institutions and limited access to justice remain a great threat to sustainable development. millions of people have been deprived of their security, human rights and access to justice. in 2018, the number of people fleeing war, persecution and conflict exceeded 70 million, the highest level recorded by the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees in nearly 70 years. the pandemic is potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence, which would greatly undermine the worldâ€™s ability to meet the targets of goal 16. the global rate of homicide per 100,000 persons slowly declined, from 6.8 to 5.9 to 5.8 per cent in 2000, 2015 and 2018, respectively, corresponding to approximately 440,000 victims of homicide, 81 per cent of whom were men and 19 per cent of whom were women. latin america and the caribbean (33 per cent) and sub saharan africa (36 per cent) accounted for more than two thirds of homicide victims globally. violent forms of discipline targeted towards children were widespread. in 69 countries (mostly low  and middle income ones) with available data from 2012 to 2019, nearly 8 in 10 children 1 to 14 years of age were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home in the previous month. sexual violence is one of the most unsettling violations of childrenâ€™s rights. in slightly more than one in four countries with comparable data from 2012 to 2019 (45 countries), at least 5 per cent of women between 18 and 29 years of age reported experiencing sexual violence in childhood."
485,"data from 2016 to 2018 show that the proportion of prisoners held in detention without being sentenced for a crime is 31 per cent, the same level as in 2005. significant increases over the past three years were recorded in asia and oceania. data from 38 countries over the past decade suggest that high income countries have the lowest prevalence of bribery (an average of 3.7 per cent), while lower income countries bear the heaviest bribery burden when accessing public services (22.3 per cent). through the implementation of birth registration with proof of legal identity, childrenâ€™s rights can be protected and universal access to justice and social services can be enabled. however, based on data from 2010 to 2019, the births of around one in four children under 5 years of age were never officially recorded. fewer than half (44 per cent) of all children in sub saharan africa under 5 years of age had their births registered. in 2019, the united nations tracked 357 killings (a decrease from 476 in 2018) and 30 enforced disappearances of human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists in 47 countries. the number of countries with binding laws and policies giving individuals a right to obtain access to information held by public authorities (the right to information) has continued to rise, reaching 127 in 2019. at least 43 countries have adopted such guarantees in the past 10 years, 40 per cent of them in africa. in 2019, 40 per cent of countries had a national human rights institution that had successfully achieved compliance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the paris principles)."
486,"the world is still a long way from achieving the goal of building peaceful, just and inclusive societies, with millions of people living in fragile and conflict affected states. at the end of 2019, 79.5 million people had been forcibly displaced worldwide, equivalent to 1 per cent of the global population. the covid 19 pandemic has exposed inequalities and discrimination and has tested, weakened, and in some cases shattered rights and protection systems in countries and territories. globally, around 437,000 people were victims of homicide in 2019. however, lethal violence is slowly decreasing, and homicide rates declined from 6 v ictims per 100,000 population in 2015 to 5.7 per 100,000 in 2019. two thirds of all homicide victims were in sub saharan africa and latin america and the caribbean, with no sign of numbers falling in sub saharan africa. the united nations recorded 69,276 civilian deaths in 12 of the worldâ€™s deadliest armed conflicts between 2018 and 2020. in 2020, there were five civilians killed per 100,000 population, one in seven of which was a woman or child. even before the pandemic, violence against children was widespread, affecting victims regardless of wealth or social status. in 77 mostly low  and middle income countries and territories with available data from 2012 to 2020, 8 in 10 children, ranging from 1 to 14 years of age, had been subjected to some form of psychological aggression or physical punishment at home in the previous month."
487,"in 2018, some 5 in 10 victims of human trafficking detected globally were women and 2 in 10 were girls. moreover, about one third of all detected victims wer e children. about 50 per cent of the detected victims were trafficked for sexual exploitation and 38 per cent for forced labour. the sharp rise in unemployment brought about by the pandemic is likely to increase trafficking in persons. globally, the proportion of prisoners held in detention in 2019 without being sentenced for a crime remained high at 31 per cent of the total prison population, with no significant change since 2000. data from more than 120 countries and territories indicate that people living in low income countries and territories are those most exposed to bribery. according to the latest data available for the period from 2011 to 2020, the average prevalence of bribery in low income countries and territories is 37.6 per cent, compared to 7.2 per cent in high income countries and territories. establishment level data from 145 countries and territories surveyed between 2006 and 2020 indicate that almost one business in six around the world is subject to requests from public officials for bribe payments. globally as of january 2021, 31.1 per cent of parliamentarians are 45 years of age or less, up from 28.1 per cent in 2018. male parliamentarians remain predominant in the leadership positions of speaker and committee chair. however, progress has stalled in latin america and the caribbean, oceania, western asia, and eastern and south eastern asia, where no new independent national human rights institutions have been recognized or established since 2018."
488,"according to data for the period from 2010 to 2020, the births of around one in four children under 5 years of age worldwide were not officially recorded. only 45 per cent of all children under 5 in sub saharan africa had their births registered in 2020, the united nations tracked 331 killings of human rights defenders in 32 countries and territories, an 18 per cent increase on 2019, and 19 enforced disappearances in 14 countries and territories. women comprised 13 per cent of victims killed and 22 per cent of those forcibly disappeared. a total of 62 journalists were killed in 2020 compared to 57 in 2019, with 65 per cent killed in non conflict countries and territories. as of february 2021, laws on access to information have been adopted by 127 countries and territories, although the implementation of the laws could be improved. the pandemic has slowed the pace of progress in this area, with no countries or territories passing such laws in 2020 and a number of countries and territories temporarily suspending existing legal guarantees. nevertheless, many countries and territories attempted to make data available concerning covid 19 infections, the contracting of emergency equipment and the allocation of rescue packages and relief financing. in 2020, the number of independently functioning national human rights institutions in sub saharan africa and europe increased by three, raising the proportion of countries and territories that had successfully achieved compliance with the principles and guidelines on children associated with armed forces or armed groups to 42 per cent.

548,"safe travel for all road users is a prerequisite for ensuring sustainable and inclusive cities. providing safe transport system is an objective for sustainable transport, because risk of injuries and deaths from traffic crashes has become a major public health concern worldwide (who, 2011). at the same time safety of pedestrians, bicyclists and public transport users also has an impact on the choice of these modes. risk to pedestrians, bicyclists and public transport users can be reduced by appropriate street designs and neighbourhood environment. safer pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure results in increased use of these environment friendly modes (tiwari & jain, 2012). safe travel options for women in general and specifically low income women are important for addressing livelihood and poverty issues for a significant proportion of urban population in low income countries like india. in this paper we present data from two indian cities vishakhapattanam( a city in south india with a population of 1.7 million persons) and delhi the capital city of india having 16.4 million residents to compare the travel patterns of women and men. the household survey in delhi focused on low income settlements since poverty adds another dimension to gender bias. the survey repeated after ten years shows that the travel patterns remain unchanged. women travel shorter distances, are dependent on lower cost modes walking and public transport and perform multi purpose linked trips. in view of the sustainability requirements, lower mobility of women must be addressed by ensuring safe accessibility to employment opportunities by walking, bicycles and public transport. the paper concludes with possible interventions required to ensure safe and secure travel of women at land use planning level and street design level."

551,"this paper examines the labour market impacts of lifestyle risk factors and associated chronic diseases, in terms of employment opportunities, wages, productivity, sick leave, early retirement and receipt of disability benefits. it provides a review of the evidence of the labour market outcomes of key risk factors (obesity, smoking and hazardous drinking) and of a number of related chronic diseases, along with findings from new analyses conducted on data from a selection of oecd countries. overall, the evidence suggests that chronic diseases and associated risk factors have potentially large detrimental labour market impacts, but with mixed findings in some areas. obesity and smoking clearly impair employment prospects, wages and labour productivity. cardiovascular diseases and diabetes have negative impacts on employment prospects and wages, and diabetes, cancer and arthritis lower labour productivity. alcohol use, cancer, high blood pressure and arthritis have mixed effects on employment and wages, and are not always linked with increased sickness absence (e.g. cardiovascular diseases and high blood pressure). finally, this paper stresses the importance of these findings for the economy at large, and supports the use of carefully designed chronic disease prevention strategies targeting people at higher risk of adverse labour market outcomes, which may lead to substantial gains in economic production through a healthier and more productive workforce."
552,"in only a few weeks, covid 19 has profoundly changed our lives, causing tremendous human suffering and challenging the most basic foundations of societal well being. beyond the immediate impacts on health, jobs and incomes, the epidemic is increasing peoples anxiety and worry, affecting their social relations, their trust in other people and in institutions, their personal security and sense of belonging. the short and medium term impacts of covid 19 will be particularly severe for the most disadvantaged and risk compounding existing socio economic divides. this policy brief looks at the broad range of effects that covid 19 will have on different aspects of peoples lives, with a focus on specific population groups such as children, women and the elderly. it calls for rapid and decisive action by governments in order to support the most vulnerable people highlighting the importance of a broad and coordinated policy response that includes strengthened social protection, education, health care, housing support and specific interventions to enhance personal security of women and children, as well as actions supporting vulnerable workers, small businesses, communities and regions left behind. patient reported measures are a critical tool for improving policy and practice in mental health care. however, to date, the use of patient reported measures in mental health care is limited to a small number of countries and settings and there is a pressing need, both within and across countries, to consistently and effectively measure the effects and impact of care for patients who use mental health care services. the paris pilot data collection on mental health included 15 data sources from 12 countries, collected over the course of 2021. "

558,"this working paper begins with an overview of the trends in the volume of emergency department visits across 21 oecd countries. it then explores the main drivers of emergency department visits in hospital settings, paying attention to both demand and supply side determinants. thereafter, national approaches instituted by countries to reduce the demand for emergency care and to guarantee a more efficient use of emergency resources are presented. insecticides that kill the mosquito and drugs that kill the parasite are the only weapons presently available to fight the unbearably high human malaria toll. as mosquito and parasite resistance to these agents limits their effectiveness and there is currently no effective malaria vaccine available, clearly new means to fight the disease must be developed. this chapter explores the feasibility of an alternative strategy: rather than kill the vector mosquito, modify it to render it incapable of sustaining parasite development. this chapter investigates genetically modifying the symbiotic bacteria that naturally occur in the mosquitoes midgut, by producing bacteria that carry the same anti parasite genes. major remaining challenges are to devise means to introduce the modified bacteria into mosquitoes in the field and to resolve regulatory and ethical issues related to the release of genetically modified organisms in nature. life expectancy in the czech republic is higher than in several neighbouring countries and infant mortality rates are amongst the lowest in the oecd. some indicators of the quality of care show very strong performance 30 day mortality after acute myocardial infarction is below average and stroke 30 day mortality is only slightly above the oecd average. nevertheless, compared with other oecd countries, other measures such as regular, open comparison of local quality indicators are less developed. the czech republic foremost aim should be to move to a quality architecture that allows the continuous, detailed and transparent measurement of health service performance. a more sophisticated data infrastructure will be needed to achieve this, as well as greater consistency of vision, policies and coordination across central government authorities."

"
564,
565,"implementing a more comprehensive alcohol policy package, including pricing policies, limiting advertising and introducing regulation of alcohol sports sponsorship, can help tackle harmful alcohol consumption in brazil. embedding more systematically screening and brief interventions in primary health care, and implementing education and awareness programmes, are other key strategies to combat alcohol consumption and reduce its harmful consequences in brazil. building on published patient safety research literature, this paper aims to broaden the existing knowledge base on safety lapses occurring in primary and ambulatory care settings.the findings of this paper show that safety lapses in primary and ambulatory care are common. about half of the global burden of patient harm originates in primary and ambulatory care, and estimates suggest that nearly four out of ten patients experience safety issue(s) in their interaction with this setting. safety lapses in primary and ambulatory care most often result in an increased need for care or hospitalisations. available evidence estimates the direct costs of safety lapses the additional tests, treatments and health care in primary and ambulatory care to be around 2.5% of total health expenditure. safety lapses resulting in hospitalisations each year may count 6% of total hospital bed days and more than 7 million admissions in the oecd. in chile, cancer is the second leading cause of death and could become the first cause in the near future. in order to reduce the disease burden, chile could do more to prevent many deaths due to cancer through cancer screening and prevention. this chapter describes the epidemiological burden of cancer in chile, assesses the governance of chilean cancer care system and public health policies in terms of prevention and early detection of cancer based on cross national comparisons, and concludes with a number of policy recommendations which could help chile strengthen cancer screening and prevention.

(or 1.3% of gdp) is direct spending on health care, another  (1.2% of gdp) is spending on social security programmes, while a further  (1.6% of gdp) is caused by indirect costs in the labour market, driven by lower employment rates and reduced productivity due to mental illness.the heavy economic, social and individual burden of mental illness is not inevitable, and more must be done to prevent and treat mental disorders, and to foster good mental health. the latter part of this chapter explores some effective ways by which european countries are promoting mental well being and preventing mental illness, and identifies critical gaps where more action is needed."
568,"paraguay has set ambitious targets to improve the health of its citizens. the country faces a double burden. the weight of non communicable diseases is growing, fuelled by longer lives but also less healthy lifestyles. at the same time, unresolved issues remain in communicable diseases, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseases. the health system in paraguay suffers from fragmentation and the weaknesses of its stewardship institutions. to measure up to the challenge, the country has undertaken a series of reforms, starting with a landmark law passed in 1996. the reforms have succeeded in setting the stage for a new approach to healthcare based on primary care. however, they have not altered significantly the foundations of the health system and its fragmentation into multiple subsystems. this chapter describes the health challenges that paraguay faces and focuses on challenges in financing healthcare and in achieving universal health coverage. the health, social and economic consequences of poor mental health are substantial. more attention is focusing now on the development of actions to promote better mental health and wellbeing and prevent mental ill health. this paper provides an overview of the development of approaches to promoting mental wellbeing and preventing mental ill health in oecd countries, together with an assessment of what is known on their effectiveness and cost effectiveness. the paper finds that there is a sound and quite extensive evidence base for effective and cost effective actions which can promote mental wellbeing and prevent mental ill health. "
569,
570,"however, the existence of actions and programmes in mental health promotion and prevention is uneven both between countries, and across different points of the life course. many countries could stand to scale up their promotion and prevention efforts in the mental health field, and further efforts are particularly needed to introduce interventions targeted at unemployed and older populations. mental ill health is a significant issue in sweden, with both mild to moderate and severe disorders representing a significant burden of ill health. mild and moderate mental health problems constitute the greatest number of cases, and such disorders have been on the rise over the past several decades. however, mental ill health is also recognised as a vital national issue by swedish authorities. accordingly, sweden has a relatively comprehensive approach to mental health as part of its universal health plan. sweden was also at the forefront of such trends as deinstitutionalisation and official suicide prevention programs. country specific initiatives designed to tackle the most pressing psychological problems in sweden are in place, including suicide, societal stigma and rising levels of mental problems amongst swedish youth and workers. cancer was the second leading cause of death in oecd countries after circulatory diseases, accounting for 24% of all deaths in 2019. leading causes of cancer related mortality included lung cancer (21%), colorectal cancer (11%), breast cancer (15% among women) and prostate cancer (10% among men). these four represent 44% of all cancers diagnosed in oecd countries. mortality rates from cancer have fallen in all oecdã‚ countries since 2000, although on average the decline has been more modest than for circulatory diseases."
571,"the primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of a secondary motor task induced by an interactive seating system (iass) on passive driver fatigue in a monotonous simulated driving task. the effect was compared to that of a state of the art massage seating system (ms), which may reduce monotony through additional tactile stimuli. the secondary objective was to compare the user experience of both systems. the independent variables were three conditions: one with the iass, another with the ms, and a control without intervention. the study included seven dependent variables in total: a rating of subjective fatigue, three parameters measuring lane keeping ability, and three parameters reflecting fatigue related eye movements. the duration of the simulator ride was 40 min in each condition. the study included thirty five subjects. the assessment of subjective fatigue and lane keeping showed that the use of the iass resulted in significantly lower passive driver fatigue compared to the massage and control conditions. the alerting effects of the iass were also reflected by an increased eyelid distance. frequency and duration of blinks, however, showed no clear patterns of fatigue over time in any of the conditions. thus, both parameters did not seem be suitable to capture passive driver fatigue in this study. regarding user experience, the subjects preferred the iass over the ms as well. the iass showed a strong potential as an effective measure against passive driver fatigue within monotonous driving situations. the ms, on the other hand, induced no measurable effects"
572,"the development of a real time monitoring and warning platform for driver fatigue detection is of great importance to avoid traffic accidents and fatalities. due to the explosive growth of biosignal data, especially electroencephalogram (eeg) signals, generated in the wearable iot age, the practical application and recognition stability of these signals should be considered and further studied. the application of eeg signals, especially prefrontal eeg, is a potential key method for effectively determining when a driver is experiencing fatigue, which would promote the development of wearable devices for fatigue warning. in this work, we reported a rapid and effective forehead eeg based multientropy feature driven fatigue identification framework using a robust hybrid model. this method investigated and utilized several common entropies to enhance the characteristic quality of eeg signal, and yielded a better expected outcome than those of several classical algorithms due to the hybrid model. the experimental results using prefrontal eeg for assessing driver fatigue showed that the proposed method is convenient and effective, as validated by 32 healthy participants through double layer nested cross validation. in addition, multi entropy measures were evaluated for single channel eeg fatigue detection, and the results showed that wavelet log energy entropy (wle) outperformed the other entropy indices with a better recognition rate and higher computational efficiency. we demonstrated that multientropy fusion was able to significantly increase detection quality. this study provided a new strategy of using prefrontal eeg signals to construct a high efficiency method for detecting driver fatigue, which could possess great potential for real time single channel signal analysis."
573,"we propose a simple method to measure a drivers fatigue state by detecting the drivers grip force on the steering wheel while driving. we tested the grip force of 36 drivers on the steering wheel in conscious states (alert) and fatigue states under actual road driving conditions. using the stanford sleepiness scale (sss), we divided drivers into alert group a, fatigue group a, and fatigue group b. during 20 min real road driving trials, we measured the steering wheel grip force, electroencephalogram index (r = (î± + î¸)/î²), and blink frequency of each driver synchronously. we found that î”f, the difference between the maximum/minimum grip force and the standard deviation of the grip force, ïƒf, for each driver, strongly correlated with the drivers fatigue state. in the fatigue state, both and increased significantly. we examined these force indices using analysis of variance (anova) and validated them against the r value, blink frequency, and the drivers self reported fatigue state. using the grip force in fatigue detection, our method can achieve an overall recognition rate of 86.6% and an individual recognition rate of 88.3%. these results indicate that this method can effectively detect a driver s fatigue state during actual road driving. this new method has several advantages, such as a high signal to noise ratio, simple data collection, and no influence on daily driving. thus, our proposed method may provide a theoretical foundation for the development of fatigue detecting steering wheels"
574,"one of the main causes of traffic accidents is driver fatigue due to monotonous driving, sleep deprivation, boredom, or a combination of these. thus, fatigue detection systems have been proposed to alert drivers. however, how early driver fatigue can be detected often determines the effectiveness of the system. traditional approaches aim to detect driver fatigue in real time, which can be too late in many critical situations, such as the takeover transition period in highly automated driving. therefore, in this research, we aim to predict the driver s transition from non fatigue to fatigue in highly automated driving using physiological features. first, we capitalized on perclos (i.e., percent of time the eyelids closure) as the ground truth of driver fatigue. next, we selected the most important physiological features to predict driver fatigue proactively. finally, using these critical physiological features, we built prediction models that were able to predict the fatigue transition at least 13.8 s ahead of time using a technique called nonlinear autoregressive exogenous network. the accuracy of fatigue transition prediction was promising for highly automated driving (f1 measure = 97.4% and 99.1% for two types of models), which demonstrated the potential of the proposed method.  by matching the simulated and actual impact responses, it shows that the proposed approach is efficient and reliable for traffic accident reconstruction under uncertainty. this approach can help the accident investigators and judges reasonably evaluate the behavior of accident participants and complete the accident responsibility confirmation"
575,
576,"traffic accident reconstruction accomplished by traditional deterministic inverse method is highly user interactive and time consuming and its solution is hard to convince in court due to various uncertainty in measurements, calculation and modeling. to rapidly identify the unknown impact parameters and simultaneously quantify their uncertainty, an uncertain inverse traffic accident reconstruction is accomplished by combining the modified arbitrary orthogonal polynomial expansion (aope) which can accurately and effectively construct surrogate models and novel optimization technique which solves the uncertain inverse problem by deterministic method. first, a dynamic model is built to simulate a traffic accident. then, using the optimal latin hypercube design, the impact responses fluctuating greatly with the change of unknown impact parameters are selected as the evaluation index of reconstruction quality. using the random forest algorithm, the impact parameter importance is evaluated according to the shap values. subsequently, a modified aope is presented based on the impact parameter importance measures. the mappings for an actual traffic accident are approximated using the modified aope to reduce the computational burden and guarantee the fitting precision. finally, based on the novel optimization technique, the uncertain inverse traffic accident reconstruction is defined to search the optimal distributions of unknown impact parameters which make the distributions of simulation results of impact responses match these of accident investigation. the uncertainty is propagated by the monte carlo simulation in the optimization process. an actual vehicle to two wheeler accident is applied to explain this uncertain inverse traffic accident reconstruction, and the mean values of unknown impact parameters are assigned into the established simulation model to check the effectiveness of results."

580,"the health impact of covid 19 has been devastating. by mid october 2021, 240 million people had contracted the virus with nearly 4.9 million dying from it. moreover, millions of survivors suffer from long lasting symptoms that prevent a return to normal life. mental distress has increased substantially. there has also been a clear social gradient to the risk of infection and death from the virus. furthermore, covid19 has disrupted health care for people with other needs. for example, cancer screening was frequently delayed, non urgent surgeries postponed, emergency department use dropped, and waiting times for elective surgeries increased. nevertheless, vaccinations have been a game changer in 2021, reducing the risk of severe illness and death. however, vaccination hesitancy among some population groups and waning vaccine effectiveness are an ongoing challenge. building higher quality and more efficient mental health care demands a focus on building the innovative and high performing mental health systems of the future. a future focused approach to mental health includes developing a strong mental health workforce for future generations, investments in research, a strong data infrastructure, and a commitment to innovation and integrating new ideas into mental health practice. at the same time, there is more to do to ensure that more people get access to what is already understood to be the best practice care available, and that this care is delivered in the most effective and efficient way possible. this chapter explores the approaches that oecdã‚ countries are already taking to build efficient and sustainable mental health systems, opportunities to maximise uptake of effective and innovative treatment and services, and areas where more investment of attention and resources are needed."

582,"harmful alcohol use is a pressing public health issue and a key driver of non communicable diseases, injuries and premature deaths. this chapter brings together the main messages of this publication and describes the policy implications identified by new oecd analyses of the health, social and economic burden of alcohol related diseases. it presents trends and projections for up to 52 oecd, group of 20 (g20) and european union (eu27) countries, and makes a strong economic case for upscaling investment in policies to tackle harmful alcohol consumption. the chapter presents the expected effectiveness, impact on health expenditure and return on investment for ten policy interventions and four policy packages aimed at addressing harmful alcohol use. it concludes by analysing the potential impact public health policies may have on the industry and approaches to mitigate costs. latvia sees high rates of obesity, smoking and alcohol consumption. in turn, this results in a high incidence of preventable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and many cancers. this puts a burden on a health system which is already operating on a very tight budget as compared to other oecd countries. this oecd report shows that latvia has many of the policies it needs to address these problems in place. however, latvia needs to go further to ensure the health system can effectively prevent diseases, not just cure them. this will require redesigning policies to reach a larger population and efforts to educate the population to understand how to protect their health. better screening programmes are needed, as is a stronger primary care sector, and access to essential medicines for all latvians."

585,"colorectal cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer after lung cancer, for men, and the third most common cancer after breast and lung cancers, for women, in the asia pacific region. in 2018, about 908000 people were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the region. colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cause of death from cancer, with approximately 434000 deaths (iarc, 2020[22]). long term care (ltc) institutions are now providing care to a greater number of people, and more residents with chronic conditions and multiple co morbidities, than ever before. trends suggest this strain will continue to increase as oecd populations continue to age. the total cost of avoidable admissions to hospitals from ltc facilities in 2016 was almost usd 18 billion, equivalent to 2.5% of all spending on hospital inpatient care or 4.4% of all spending on ltc. research shows that over half of the harm that occurs in ltc is preventable, and over 40% of admissions to hospitals from ltc are avoidable. the root causes of these events can be addressed through improved prevention and safety practices and workforce development including skill mix and education. targeted investments in a number of key areas can have a significant impact by mitigating the main cost drivers of adverse events in ltc."

608,the addition of spermine or of spermidine to rat cl ca systems produced marked changes in a number of microsomal drug oxidations the hydroxylation of aniline and the ndemethylation of ethylmorphine were both enhanced with concentrations of mm spermine or of spermidine the results with putrescine on ethylmorphine metabolism were less dramatic and no effect could be observed with putrescine in studies with other drug substrates in contrast to the enhancing effects inhibition was observed when spermine or sd was added to pnitroanisole odemethylation ca mixtures and no effect was observed in assays for acetanilide hydroxylation the inhibiting and enhancing effects of the polyamines can be observed in assays containing liver s9 from both male and female rats and those from rats pretreated with phenobarbital or methylcholanthrene in all studies the alterations were kinetically noncompetitive the effects were shown to be independent of the nadphgenerating system and the cation requirements and were not mediated through an interaction with nadphcytochrome c reductase the possibility is considered that the enhancing and inhibiting effects may be related to the ability of these polycations to bind to microsomal membranes and cause alterations at different sites of substrate interaction the synergistic effects of four su substitutes polysorbate and five artificial sweeteners were studied in vitro on growth pattern and acid production of seven glucosegrown streptococcus mutans strains representing the five serological groups after bratthall four distinct growth patterns during glucose fermentation were observed high rate of growth with low acid production moderate growth rate with moderate acid production moderate growth rate with high acid production and slow rate of growth with moderate acid production depending on the strain used the final od at nm ranged from to and the final ph of the medium varied between and while added sucrose substitutes with exceptions usually enhanced growth rate most artificial sweeteners suppressed or at higher concentrations even inhibited growth of s mutans addition of polysorbate to the medium always increased growth rate of s mutans significantly the presence of sucrose substitutes during glucose fermentation had no effect on final ph of the medium but addition of artificial sweeteners especially sodium saccharin elevated final ph up to units the observed physiological patterns and differences within the several strains of s mutans during glucose fermentation in vitro do not necessarily relate to the five serological groups of the species
609,the kinetics and cellular characteristics of immunosuppression in cbap x cblf mice during graftversushost gvh reaction induced with sp cells from either parental strain have been investigated effects on pfc responses to thymusdependent chicken red blood cells and independent levan antigens have been compared the unresponsive state which developed in gvh mice was expressed to comparable extent by their spleen cells following transfer to irradiated recipients furthermore gvh spleen cells suppressed normal spleen cells in a mixed transfer system but this effect was lost cr by day whereas the original donors or their cells were still totally refractory after days this active suppressor effect was found to be mediated by t cells of perental origin based on cell fractionation analysis and selective deletion of donor or host cells by alloimmune attack the delayed transfer of gvh cells to irradiated repopulated recipients challenged with antigen indicated that suppressor t cells exert an antimitotic influence on antigenstimulated bcell proliferation supplementation of macrophagedepleted antithetatreated gvh spleen cells with purified normal ta demonstrated that b cells in gvh mice are normally reactive even when active suppression by t cells is no longer demonstrable the likelihood that this later phase of immunosuppression is attributable to another mechanism is discussed studied were bacteriologically a total of birds affected with acute mareks disease broilers growing layers and adult layers as well as healthy control birds of the same three categories a chemical analysis was performed of the red and white meat of of the diseased pullets and of the diseased ad layers as well as of of the affected broilers the investigation included the same numbers of the control birds extractions of the sampled meat were studied in terms of catalase number ph value and peroxydase activity it was found that enterobacteria in the viscera of the diseased birds were three to nine times more frequently encountered than in the same organs of the controls in two cases salmonella bacteria were also isolated from the affected chickens in three cases there were enterobacteria in the red musculature of these birds the meat of the diseased birds had higher water content higher catalase number and ph value with lower contents of proteins fats and mineral matter the only exception was the red meat of these birds which had higher content of crude protein as compared with the red meat of the normal birds
610,boys and years with unilateral or bl undescended testes or anorchia were studied retention was severe canalicular or ia in and moderate in of the cases in unilateral retention the volume of the scrotal testis was usually normal throughout childhood whereas pubertal testicular growth was delayed in unilateral anorchia the scrotal testis showed compensatory hypertrophy in all age groups examined the mean volume of the undescended testes was abnormally small undescended testes were accompanied by abnormalities of the epididymis in of cases of the ductus deferens in and of the spermatic vessels in in anorchia such abnormalities were found regularly inguinal hernia accompanied of the undescended testes and was most frequent in severe cases patients aged years with unilateral undescended testis had t3 ba cytogenic investigations of patients revealed one case of klinefelters syndrome xxy gonadotrophin treatment was tried in patients and was succesful in surgical results were satisfactory in of the operated testes comparative studies of protein structure and function can be quite interesting by themselves and even more interesting when interpreted with respect to an animals physiology in the case of fish hemoglobins some success in the latter has been achieved but there are still many unsolved problems it appears that comparative physiology and biochemistry have entered an era where results from comparative studies can shed a great deal of light on biochemical mechanisms in ga the trout hemoglobin system is an example distinctive hemoglobins in this system are presently being used as high resolution probes of the ligandbinding mechanism characterization of the multiple structurally distinct subunits of the s limulus hemocyanin molecule may similarly aid in understanding its cf our studies suggest the possibility of using limulus hemocyanin and other hemocyanins as structural homologs and analogs of more complex macromolecular arrays the rapid development of molecular structural data from xray crystallographers combined with the vast data of comparative physiology and biochemistry makes this one of the most exciting areas in present day science
611,the jumping apparatus of the flea which includes highly modified direct and indirect flight muscles is described attention is drawn to the various specializations of the exoskeleton which stiffen the thorax and also provide the click mechanism triggering takeoff a fingerlike invagination of tall cells within the cavity of the developing pleural arch of the pharate ad secretes the resilin pad this is illustrated with coloured photographs it is suggested that winglessness of a mecopteranlike ancestor preadapted fleas to a parasitic lifestyle and that a jumping mode of progression was a primitive feature of the whole order scattered throughout the siphonaptera today are species which have secondarily lost the pleural arch and with it the power to execute large jumps these are usually found among fleas parasitizing mammals inhabiting caves subterranean burrows and runs high aerial nests and snow or icebound habitats large pleural arches are associated with fleas infesting large mobile hosts pulmonary edema due to disorders in alveolocapillary permeability or lesional are differentiated from hemodynamic pulmonary edema by the fact that they arise in spite of normal pulmonary capillary pressure pcp a hemodynamic study was carried out in cases of lesional pe the pcp was normal whatever the date of the examination and the gravity of the pe pah was only found in the presence of frank hypoxemia and disappeared with the correction of the latter if there was no hemodynamic profile due to pe itself its etiology sometimes induced a hyperkinetic or hypovolemic syndrome finally it was apparent that pcp was significantly higher although normal at the initial stage than t3 hours of pe that an elevation in pcp of only a few mm hg by the perfusion of colloids aggravated the pe that despite the normal value for the pcp dehydration evidently improved hematosis thus this t0 confirms that numerous cases of pe can occur while the pcp remains normal it also confirms the noxious nature of too abundant perfusions in these cases and the effectiveness of dehydration
612,in rat liver cells isolated by perfusion in the perfusion in the presence of mmp 8 the l1 portion of cytochrome p is present in the oxidized nonsubstratebound low spin state drug addition to a suspension of cl cells results in the rapid formation of the cytochrome p fesubstrate complex which in turn is followed by the appearance of other species with different spectral characteristics before steady state drug monooxygenation is achieved cytochrome plinked metabolism of various tested drugs and carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons by isolated rat liver cells is as fast or faster as with rat liver microsomes supplemented with a nadph generating system both experimental models respond similarily to phenobarbital or methylcholanthrene i.c.v. of the animals and to various of the wellknown inhibitors of drug metabolism except with liver cells isolated from fasted phenobarbitaltreated rats generation of cytosolic nadph seems sufficient to support optimal drug metabolism even in the absence of added substrates of intermediary metabolism in isolated cl cells oxidized drug metabolites undergo subsequent metabolic conversion most often to form the corresponding glucuronides and sulphates these are readily excreted whereas nonconjugated products eg free phenols tend to accumulate intracellularly cellular glucuronide formation is strongly inhibited by ethanolpresumably due to an unfavorable effect of the increased nadhnad ratio on the synthesis of uridinediphosphoglucuronic acid udpga in contrast low concentrations of ethanol have no or only a slight stimulatory effect on the cytochrome plinked step of drug metabolism and there are indications that the oxidation of low concentrations of ethanol is in fact stimulated by a facilitated reoxidation of cytosolic nadh occuring during drug monooxygenation
613,seven healthy males were studied during cycle ergometer exercise at and of vo max on three occasions when nhc nahco or caco as a control substance were administered in gelatin capsules double blind and in randomized order plasma growth hormone hgh la and hydrogen ion concentration h were measured at frequent intervals ammonium chloride produced highest blood h and nahco the lowest these differences were maintained during exercise and in recovery plasma lactic acid concentrations were similar at rest at vo max and recovery la was highest with nahco and lowest with nhc exercise stimulated hgh secretion in all studies and the elevation was proportional to the intensity of the exercise nhc caused a vl elevation of hgh at rest and vo max at vo max plasma hgh was significantly elevated to similar concentrations in all studies and at vo max hgh was highest with nahco an infusion of sodium llactate producing plasma lactate concentrations of mmoll did not influence hgh secretion exercise is a physiological stimulus to hgh secretion and the mechanism is independent of blood h and lactate concentrations the kinetics of the action of local anesthetics upon firefly luciferin and luciferase systems is presented clinical concentrations of local anesthetics inhibited this atpinduced luminescence in a dosedependent manner from the effects of temperature and ph upon the inhibitory action of the local anesthetics it is concluded that hydrophobic ligandenzyme interaction is the predominant cause of the inhibition but hydrophilic interaction also contributes to the inhibition to a lesser degree a molecular theory of anesthesia is outlined which postulates that release of electrostricted water molecules from the hydrophilic parts of the enzyme due to the protein conformational changes induced by anesthetics is the cause of the decreased luminescence a similar mechanism is expected to occur at the cm which probably dehydrates the sodium channel and suppresses the conductance of this ion across the membrane these events lead to a volume expansion of the total system and the system becomes reactive to a pressure which reverses the anesthesia by shifting the equilibrium to the nonanesthetized original volume the pressure antagonism of anesthesia can be explained by this overall volume expansion and not by a mere swelling of the cell membrane
614,in order to throw light on the problems related to the magnitude and the possibility of maintaining pressor response in the case of bilateral carotid occlusion bco acute experiments were carried out on heparinized cats in chloraloseurethane narcosis and spontaneous respiration the perfusion pressure in a hind leg autoperfused with a rp with a constant flow and the arterial blood pressure were recorded electromanometrically a t0 was made of the changes taking place under the effect of bco in the normal animal in animals in a haemorrhagic state after pharmacological alphaadrenergic blockade haemorrhage after alphaadrenergic blockade retransfusion of blood alphaadrenergic blocking agent and after local application of papaverine it was established that some of the af determining the haemodynamic state of the organism such as blood volume arterial pressure vascular resistance cardiac so etc are of great significance for the realization of the pressor response to bco but the haemodynamic state of the animal before the occlusion and the interactions between the abovementioned af are decisive for the form magnitude and maintenance of the pressor response in bco washed cells of salmonella enteritidis harvested from a defined medium during logarithmic growth were subjected to starvation in ph pb at c viability was measured by slide cultures and plate counts the survival of cell suspensions equivalent to to mg dry wtml was influenced by cryptic growth the rate of cryptic growth assessed by sp counts increased with cell density and could not be alleviated by starvation with dialysis dialysis of the starving sc did retard the onset of cryptic growth but did not eliminate it indicating that the l1 substrates for regrowth were relatively c1 cellular components in phosphate buffer homologous hk cells allowed for the doubling of one s enteritidis cell cryptic growth was not observed when cells were starved on the surface of membrane filters or in suspensions equivalent to mug dry wtml cellsml similar halflife survival times were calculated for both these populations but the shape of their survival curves differed significantly these differences were attributed to stress factors encountered during cell preparation and during starvation the halflife survival time of s enteritidis starved at mug dry wtml was h in phosphate buffer h in endomethylenetetrahydrophthalic acid buffer and h in trishydroxymethylaminomethane buffer
615,the effect of somatic afferent c fiber stimulation on regional cbf blood flow rcbf and cerebral tissue available oxygen ao was studied in dogs under chloralose anesthesia mean arterial blood pressure arterial pco and ph were stabilized before and during the min stimulation of the sciatic sn v ms hz combined goldplatinum electrodes were chronically implanted into the vpl of the th ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and into the vwm tissue ao and rcbf of these regions were measured polarographically the latter by the hgas clearance technique blood flow changed from to ml g per min cvr cvr from to resistance units ru in the th from to ml g per min cvr from to ru in the hypothalamus and from to ml g per min cvr from to ru in the vwm during ipsilateral stimulation contralateral stimulation of the sciatic nerves caused a more moderate but likewise significant drop in rcbf and an increase in cvr except in the vwm parallel to these changes tissue ao decreased by in the thalamic and by in the thy area relative to the prestimulation level in acute and chronic experiments investigations were made concerning the effect of clozapine haloperidol sulpiride and carpipramine on mhpg hva and hiaa in rat brain and on motor activity of the animals the activity of the rats treated with clozapine and haloperidol was reduced on the first day after days of treatment this effected of clozapine was significantly diminished the mhpg level increased slightly on the first day of treatment with all four drugs this elevation was maintained after chronic treatment with carpipramine and sulpiride whereas clozapine and haloperidol decreased the mhpg content hiaa values did not show significant changes in acute experiments whereas in chronic ones there was an increase haloperidol and clozapine induced a strong increase of hva which decreased t3 days in those animals treated with haloperidol in comparison to haloperidol t3 clozapine application the percentage of hvaincrease was higher in the limbic system than in the nigrostriatum
616,the cardiovascular effects of halothanenitrous oxide anesthesia and betareceptor blockade with either propranolol or practolol were studied in dogs in which severe myocardial infarction had been induced ten days earlier the hemodynamic responses to blood loss amounting to per cent of estimated blood volume and its subsequent replacement were studied before and after induction of betareceptor blockade in terms of cardiac so and aortic blood flow acceleration cardiac performance in the absence of betablockade was markedly impaired during steadystate anesthesia compared with corresponding values in normal dogs practolol mgkg administered during anesthesia induced no significant circulatory change other than a per cent decrease in heart rate and a per cent increase in strode volum propranolol mgkg caused a comparable reduction of heart rate but significantly reduced cardiac output per cent aortic blood flow acceleration per cent and peak lv sp per cent and increased systemic v1 resistance per cent the two drugs caused comparable shifts of the isoproterenol doseresponse curve during anesthesia graduated blood loss during anesthesia to a total of per cent of blood volume caused consistent circulatory changes decreased mean arterial pressure cardiac output peak lv power lv minute work that were essentially similar before and t3 betareceptor blockade with either propranolol or practolol the positive inotropic effect of calcium gluconate during hal anesthesia was significantly reduced following either propranolol or practolol but the hemodynamic responses to changes of systemic v1 resistance induced with acetylcholine or phenylephrine were not modified by betareceptor blockade 
617,fiftyeight human isolates of bacteroides melaninogenicus from a variety of clinical infections and the rest from normal flora were studied for pigment production and ultraviolet light fluorescence and by forty biochemical and other tests including endproduct analysis by gasliquid chromatography in a number of instances tests were repeated several times and the results were reproducible agar plate dilution susceptibility tests were also performed to antimicrobial agents these strains could be reliably placed into three groups corresponding to the three subspecies described based on seven characteristics these included acid production in peptoneyeastglucose medium production of nbutyric acid from peptoneyeastglucose medium esculin hydrolysis st hydrolysis indole production effect on milk and lipase production production of hydrogen gas in peptoneyeastfructose medium may be another distinguishing characteristic in ga there was not much difference in the susceptibility of the three groups to the various antimicrobial agents tested two strains had a mics of penicillin g of and uml respectively three strains did not produce a black pigment in spite of prolonged incubation on bloodcontaining media human adenylate cyclase atp pyrophosphatelyase cyclizing ec has been studied in s9 of fat cell membranes ghosts as reported earlier under ordinary ca conditions mm atp mm mg degrees c min incubation the enzyme was activated fold by epinephrine in the presence of the gtp analog guanylylimidodiphosphate gmppnhp cooper b et al j clin invest basal activity was highest during the first min of incubation then slowed and was linear for at least the next min en added ct was often without effect but sometimes maintained the initial high rate of basal activity gmppnhp alone produced inhibition lag of basal enzyme early in the incubation periods augmentation of epinephrine effect by gmppnhp which also proceeded after a brief min lag period was noted over a wide range of atp atp concentrations gtp inhibited basal levels of the enzyme by about gtp also allowed expression of an en effect but only in the sense that the hormone abolished the inhibition by gtp occasionally a slight stimulatory effect on epinephrine action was seen with gtp at high mg concentration greater than mm or elevated temperatures greater than degrees c gmppnhp ct g1 the enzyme maximal activity of human fat cell adenylate cyclase was seen at mm mg mm atp ph and degrees c in the presence of m gmppnhp under these conditions addition of epinephrine did not further enhance activity human fat cell adenylate cyclase of adults was insensitive to acth and glucagon even in the presence of gmppnhp
618,the differences between the results of controlled clinical research and the experiences of the practitioners can be attributed to a certain extent to the artificiality of the setting in which controlled studies are performed the system developed in the wards of the department of psychopharmacology of the institute of psychiatry in prague is an attempt to overcome some of these difficulties certain similarities exist between this system called continuous controlled trial and silent trial proposed by ross et al the main characteristics of the system are all patients admitted to the ward are assigned to the trial without exception the trial goes on continuously without interruption for more than years except that the patients do not know the quality of drugs administered they do not realize any difference between this research setting and the usual routine treatment the advantages of this system are reduction of artificiality the possibility to perform early pcts in controlled conditions and to shorten the usual threephase testing of a new drug the possibility to perform longterm longitudinal studies with individual patients admitted several times in doubleblind conditions  the effect of nadp on lightinduced steadystate redox changes of mb cytochromes was investigated in membrane fragements prepared from the bluegreen algae nostoc muscorum cs that had high rates of electron transport from water to nadp and from an artificial electron donor reduced dichlorophenolindophenol dciph to ndap the membrane fragments contained very little pc and had excellent optical properties for spectrophotometric assays with dciph as the electron donor nadp had no effect on the lightinduced redox changes of cytochromes with or without nadp or nm illumination resulted mainly in the oxidation of cytochrome f and of other components which may include a ctype cytochrome with an alpha peak at nm with nm illumination and water as the electron donor nadp had a pronounced effect on the redox state of cytochromes causing a shift toward oxidation of a component with a peak at nm possibly a ctype cytochrome cytochrome f and particularly cytochrome b cytochrome b appeared to be a component of the main noncyclic electron transport chain and was photooxidized at physiological temperatures by ps ii this photooxidation was apparent only in the presence of a terminal acceptor nadp for the electron flow from water
619,the relationship between respiratory insufficiency expressed by gas tensions in blood and bone marrow and haematologic adaptation has been studied in men with cb and persistent breathlessness for at least one year for the group as a whole and for various subgroups a linear correlation was demonstrated between arterial hypoxia and hb concentration haematocrit blood volume hb mass and erythrocyte volume respectively the increase in hb concentration compensated for the fall in arterial oxygen saturation only for one subgroup with a ph difference between arterial and venous blood larger than or equal to was no correlation found between the degree of hypoxia and hb concentration the haematologic parameters correlated significantly better with arterial oxygen tensions than with oxygen tensions in the bone marrow there was no indication that decreased oxygen supply to the bone marrow led to the increased erythrocyte and hb production in patients with arterial hypoxia caused by chronic bronchitis nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy has been used to t0 a fully as e coli fluorotyrosine alkaline phosphatase the fluorotyrosine resonances provide sensitive probes of the conformational states of the protein they were used to follow the addition of zinc or cobalt to the apoprotein and the titration of the protein with inorganic phosphate or the inhibitor hydroxynitrobenzylphosphonate the results indicate that molecules of inorganic phosphate per dimer of alkaline phosphatase are required to cr a ga conformational nc in the protein involving perturbations to the environment of several tyrosines spectra of the cobalt enzyme indicate that on specific tyrosine per subunit may be near the metal site the f nmr results combined with the p nmr results in the accompanying paper lead directly to the conclusion that dissociation of noncovalently bound inorganic phosphate from the enzyme is the ratelimiting process in enzyme catalysis at high ph the local environment of the individual fluorotyrosines is also discussed
620,volatiles of which nh is a major component were evolved from decomposing immature corn tissue cn and affected r solani in culture two ways they supplied additional nitrogen to the growth medium so that fungal mycelial growth increased and they raised atp ph from to which induced melanization of mycelium volatiles increased fungus growth and pigmentation within weeks of amendment addition to soil increases were concomitant with nh production from corn tissue more nh evolved from decomposing corn tissues of cn and than from those of cn and more growth and pigmentation occurred in flasks through which volatiles from decomposing corn cn were passed than in flasks through which volatiles from nonamended soil or decomposing corn cn were passed carbon dioxide from decomposing tissues did not affect growth or pigmentation twice as much nh evolved from corn tissue cn which decomposed in saturated soil than from tissue which decomposed in soil at of its waterholding capacity pigment production doubled under saturated conditions total body potassium has been estimated in hypertensive patients who were hypokalaemic as a result of longterm chlorthalidone treatment mean months while they were on chlorthalidone and weeks after this had been discontinued the mean difference amounted to only meq not significant in additional patients not previously treated with chlorthalidone serial total body potassium estimations revealed a mean potassium deficiency of meq t3 days and of meq t3 days these results suggest that the mechanism causing the initial potassium loss is partly reversed or compensated later on in patients with uncomplicated hypertension no significant potassium deficiency was detected during longterm treatment eighteen of our patients received meq potassium chloride supplements daily for weeks this caused a mean rise in sk from meql to meql not significant tb potassium did not nc at all we conclude that potassium chloride supplements are not an erp treatment of hypokalaemia in this condition correction of the extracellular ph by ammonium chloride in patients on chlorthalidone who demonstrated a slight metabolic alkalosis gave rise to a mean increase in plasma potassium from meql to meql not significant the hypokalaemia in ht on lt chlorthalidone treatment cannot be explained by either a potassium deficiency or the change in extracellular ph
621,amino acid concentrations were determined in plasma whole blood csf fluid and brain tissue of patients with grade or coma due to fulminant hepatic failure the concentration of of the amino acids determined were significantly increased in blood and the increases were greatest for the amino acids concerned with neurotransmitter metabolism there was no rho however between the plasma concentration of these amino acids and changes in the grade of hepatic coma the plasma concentrations of the branched chain amino acids were normal except in those patients who subsequently recovered in whom levels were slightly decreased phenylalanine tyrosine and methionine were among the out of amino acids which were significantly increased in cerebrospinal fluid and among the out of amino acids which were significantly increased in the bb the increase in tryptophan was associated with a significant elevation in brain hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration suggesting an increase in hydroxytryptamine turnover in hepatic coma bb to plasma ratios of most amino acids in hepatic coma patients were similar to control subjects suggesting that plasma concentration is the main factor controlling the cerebral concentration however for the branched chain amino acids csf fluid and brain concentrations were increased when plasma concentrations were normal suggesting an increase in bb uptake in adults of both sexes the influence on the basal and the maximal by means of pg stimulated gastric secretion of a single i.v. of mg to mgkg oxyfedrine or of two intramuscular i.v. of mg to mgkg or of mg to mgkg in each case isoproterenol consecutively administered at an interval of minutes was studied at a dose which evokes cardiovascular responses isoproterenol does not produce a significant nc of the sec rates of h c na k ca and mg or of the ionic composition of gastric juice both during basal and maximal acid output oxyfedrine shows only during maximal acid stimulation some effects on gastric secretion a significant rise of the concentration and sec rate of h and of the secretory rate of c and a significant decline of the concentration of na and of both the concentration and secretory rate of mg betaadrenergic receptors seem not to play any part in the regulation of the production of gastric juice possibly the action of oxyfedrine on the stimulated gm may be mediated by a stimulation of alphaadrenergic receptors or by inhibition of the activity of ampphosphodiesterase
622,a newly developed dualfunction ph and pco sensor was evaluated in this study the sensors were placed in the femoral arteries of dogs anesthetized with sp comparisons were made between systemic arterial ph and pco measured using the sensor and those measured from blood samples drawn at min intervals over a h period using a bench instrument the mean ph of the bench instrument measurements was the mean difference of the sensor measurements from the bench instrument measurements for comparisons was ph sd the mean pco of the bench instrument measurements was mmhg the mean difference of the sensor measurements from those of the bench instrument for comparisons was mmhg sd the sensors performed equally well in the presence of metabolic or respiratory acidosis and alkalosis the dualfunction sensors evaluated in this t0 are useful for trend monitoring of ph and pco over at least a h period without recalibration with improvement in the consistency of sensor construction these sensors will be reliable in vivo sensing devices for blood ph and pco and thus valuable research and clinical instruments the effect of insulininduced hypoglycemia on the blood levels of catecholamines and renin activity has been studied in five patients with moderate hypertension before and after treatment for months with penbutolol pen mg twice daily penbutolol caused no nc in fasting blood glucose level insulin o iu per kg body weight iv reduced blood gl concentration by approximately per cent after min both before and during treatment with penbutolol hypoglycemia prior to medication was accompanied by a marked increase in the production of adrenaline and a minor increase of noradrenaline in all five patients during treatment the response of adrenaline to hypoglycemia was reduced in four patients and the data was inconclusive in one basal renin activity was rather low in three patients within the normal range in one and relatively high in one before penbutolol the hypoglycemiainduced increase in catecholamine production caused no change in plasma renin activity in the three patients with low basal levels whereas a marked increase was observed in the other two during medication plasma renin activity remained unchanged on induction of hypoglycemia regardless of the catecholamine response despite the marked increase in plasma adrenaline following insulininduced hypoglycemia no statistically significant increase in pulse rate was recorded
