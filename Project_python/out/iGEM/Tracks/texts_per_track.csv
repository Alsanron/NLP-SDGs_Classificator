0,"b'Kopi Luwak coffee is the rarest and the most expensive type of coffee in the world, and is processed from feces of the Asian Palm Civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). As the coffee berries are digested, bitter components of the coffee bean are broken down. Later, the beans are cleaned, roasted, and brewed to make the Kopi Luwak coffee. The problem with the procedure today is that farming industries keeps tens of thousands of civets living in battery cages, and force-feeds them only coffee berries. As a result of the treatment, the Asian Palm Civet population is declining. We propose to make this process humane, efficient, and sanitary by instead using bacteria to produce the coffee. We will accomplish this by genetically engineering E. coli with genes for various digestive enzymes, thus simulating the digestive process of the civets with coffee berries so we can finally save the Asian Palm Civets.'","['Food & Energy', 'Food & Nutrition', 'Energy']"
1,"b'The Arizona State iGEM team aims to produce biodiesel in a new and efficient way using Escherichia coli. Using a wax esterase, fatty acids and ethanol, both naturally produced by E. coli, can be combined to form biodiesel. However, E. coli uses the same intermediate products to produce both fatty acids and ethanol, which reduces the efficiency of this process. This problem can be avoided by engineering two different strains of E. coli to work in tandem. One strain will be engineered to produce free fatty acids (FFA) through expression of enzymes including as TesA and acc. The other strain will be engineered to produce ethanol through expression of enzymes including pdc and adhB. These two products will be combined in one of the two cells using a waxy esterase, producing the final biodiesel product. Cooperative production will hopefully produce more ethanol than current single strain methods using E. coli.'","['Food & Energy', 'Food & Nutrition', 'Energy']"
2,"b'The supply with electricity is facing three major problems: the storage of electricity, the increasing amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the development of alternative energy sources. Therefore we want to implement a proof of concept for the production of the biofuel isobutanol from carbon dioxide. A bacterial microcompartment originated from cyanobacteria, called carboxysome, is used to realize the fixation of carbon dioxide in Escherichia coli. Within this microcompartment the carbon dioxide fixation is enabled under aerobic conditions. The needed energy for this process is provided by electricity. The electrons are transferred with a mediator into the cells and its uptake is empowered by different modifications of E. coli, like over-expression of the fumarate reductase. This concept is realized in a self-constructed bioreactor. Finally the production of isobutanol is established by hetereologous expression of various enzymes from different species.'","['Food & Energy', 'Food & Nutrition', 'Energy']"
3,"b'Humans rely on carbon resources for nutrition and energy. Biofuels derived from corn-based ethanol and the microbial degradation of cellulose are not fully sustainable, due to the competition of food supply and expense of input energy. Cyanbacteria are bacteria with similar features as microalge in the sense that they are known to fix carbon dioxide into alkanes through the collective processes of photosynthesis, glycolysis, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The CAPS iGEM Team 2014 continues metabolic engineering of these pathways by expressing yeast-derived pyruvate kinase, known to be a key regulator of glycolysis, within the cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC 6803 in an effort to increase alkane production. Assays for the production of pyruvate, fatty acids, and alkanes will be used to characterize our system. In addition, we will be determining various environmental conditions that increase the effectiveness of alkane production such as CO2 and O2 limitation.'","['Food & Energy', 'Food & Nutrition', 'Energy']"

Instead of trying to detect the cholerae toxin, specific sequences of nucleic acid, or antigens, we propose detecting V. cholerae Autoinducer 1 (CAI-1), the bacterias species-specific quorum sensing molecule. If we rewire V. choleraes own quorum sensing mechanism used in nature to gauge population levels and regulate pathogenicity in a harmless E. coli chassis, we can build a cheap and easy-to-use biosensor that gives a color output when it senses the pathogen.

5,"b'Were seeking to create microbial fuel cells to experiment with genetic engineering and produce a clean source of energy and water. In order to fashion a more effective microbial fuel cell, we need to monitor the viability of bacteria within the fuel cell. Microbial fuel cells produce electricity and water when metal-breathing bacteria respire via an anode placed within an anaerobic compartment of the fuel cell. In order to monitor the health of these power-generating anaerobes, we designed an operon that will cause the microbes to fluoresce when growing in the oxygen-depleted anode chamber. Our operon consists of an oxygen-sensitive promoter, which activates gene expression in the absence of oxygen, and an open reading frame, which encodes a protein that fluoresces without the need for oxygen. This simple reporter system will allow us to determine when anaerobic conditions inside the fuel cell are optimal for bacteria growth and power generation.'","['Food & Energy', 'Food & Nutrition', 'Energy']"

8,"b' Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) is a popular method that relies on microorganisms and their metabolic products to mobilize residual oil. Rhamnolipid, a widely-used biosurfactant produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa under aerobic conditions, is helpful in reducing oil-water interfacial tension, which makes it easier to remove oil. However, because of the anaerobic environment in oil reservoirs, rhamnolipid has to be produced ex situ, and then injected into the oil reservoirs. Our project is to build a bacterial strain that is able to utilize oil as its carbon resource as well as producing rhamnolipid in anaerobic environment. We start with a Pseudomonas stutzeri strain that lives in the oil reservoirs, clone and make it express the rhamnosyltransferase operon genes rhlABRI from Pseudomonas aeruginosa so that it can produce and excrete rhamnolipid into the oil constantly. With all the strengths enhancing the oil recovery, we name our engineered bacterium ""Super Petroleum Magician"".'","['Food & Energy', 'Food & Nutrition', 'Energy']"
9,"b'Fatty acid(FFA) plays an essential role in many aspects of modern society, such as food industry, rubber industry, fuel, etc. Relied on animal grease or plant oil currently, the FFA production, however, is highly restricted by seasonal, regional factors and the expensive manufacturing cost. Therefore, we strive to transform E.coli into a biological factory that produces more FFAs of different length of carbon chain and saturation levels in both an efficient and a controlled manner. To achieve that, we will introduce FFA desaturase and various thioesterase, key enzymes for unsaturated FFA production and FFA synthesis respectively, and different operon structure into the engineering E.coli. Also, we design a fluorescence system composed of Transcriptional Regulatory Protein FadR to monitor the FFA producing status in E.coli. In this case, we can produce different FFAs by applying different signals to operons in E.coli and detect the real time production status by fluorescence report.'","['Food & Energy', 'Food & Nutrition', 'Energy']"
10,"b'Food security is a prominent health challenge faced by the increasing global population, which is exacerbated by high loss of crop yields to pests and diseases. Applying synthetic biology approaches, we aim to produce proof of concept, sentinel plants that will diagnose the presence of two pathogens, Xanthomonas oryzae and Xanthomonas campestris. The plant sentinels will produce a chromoprotein output, observable by the human eye, within 48 hours of pathogen infection. The sentinels would allow growers to apply appropriate agrochemical application before the diseases progress to symptomatic pathogenesis in neighbouring crops. This approach will reduce crop losses whilst decreasing the necessity for continual use of agrochemicals. Furthermore, we are constructing a series of BioBricks that will allow Golden Gate assembly to assist cloning of transcriptional units within the iGEM standard.

11,"b'Due to environmental concerns and fuel prices, much research has been invested in alternative sources of fuels. Development of biofuels, in particular, is beneficial in the sense that it provides a renewable source of energy with a wide range of energy densities. Clostridium acetobutylicum has great potential for producing biofuels due to its native ABE (acetone, butanol, ethanol) fermentation pathways and its ability to metabolize a variety of carbon substrates. In addition to C. acetobutylicums native pathways, the introduction of non-native genes makes it possible to expand the types of alcohols produced. The goal of this research endeavor was to develop an iGEM compliant Clostridial shuttle vector to introduce genes for the production of branched and longer chain alcohols within Clostridial species. We are in the process of testing our shuttle vector and plan to compare alcohol production efficiency between anaerobes and aerobes.'","['Food & Energy', 'Food & Nutrition', 'Energy']"

A solution is presented by utilizing synthetic biology to engineer Bacillus subtilis to increase plants ability to uptake iron, through production of plant phytosiderophores. Phytosiderophores are small, high-affinity iron chelating molecules that many microorganisms and plants use to increase bioavailable iron by reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+. Our genetically engineered system combines five corn genes to produce these phytosiderophores: SAMS, NAS1, NAATI, DMAS, and TOM1. We are using corn and rice to confirm that plants grown with our engineered bacteria will have higher iron content than plants grown with wild-type Bacillus or with no Bacillus at all.

13,"b'Photovoltaics are one of the main sources of renewable energy and are likely to become more widely used in the future, but their production is expensive and involves toxic materials. Biological photovoltaics (BPVs) have the potential to provide a cheaper and more sustainable alternative, especially where energy demand is lower. They could power the social, welfare and economic growth for the 1.2 billion people without access to electricity. BPVs take advantage of photosynthetic organisms by harnessing the electrons they produce from water and sunlight.

Therefore, we came up with a system that aids the healthy growth of these plants by protecting them from overly low temperatures through smart temperature control. Our system of temperature moderation, including temperature sensing and temperature regulating, is able to produce heat once the temperature drops below 27 and stops heating when the temperature reaches 27~28.

In this study, we have successfully generated synthetic genetic materials to produce four chimeric mycotoxin-detoxifying enzymes. The levels of extracellular secretion is also characterized and analyzed.

Autoinducer2 (AI-2), a signal molecule in quorum sensing system, serves as the key of our project. We constructed the AI-2 response pathway of Salmonella in Lactobacillus. Produced by pathogenic bacteria, the extracellular AI-2 will enter the cytoplasm of our engineered bacteria, and then lead to the expression of the report gene. As pathogenic bacteria produce AI-2 constantly, our engineered bacteria will make the existence of pathogenic bacteria visible to naked eyes.

Studies suggest that resistant starches may reduce colon cancer by enabling colonic bacteria to produce short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate. Our project took two approaches to increase colonic butyrate. The first approach was to develop a screen for enzymes that could transfer acyl/butyryl groups to alpha 1,4 carbohydrates in bacteria and plants. To support this we modelled and modified carbohydrate branching. Enzymatic modification of carbohydrates could also provide environmentally-friendly methods for the production of modified starches used in a wide range of industries. The second approach aimed to transfer the butyrate biosynthetic pathway to Escherichia coli. Our work could be applied to the production of butyrylated starches for consumption as prebiotics or butyrate-producing probiotics.

We, therefore, attempted to improve the MFC platform by exclusively using E. coli engineered to survive under stressful conditions. E. coli cells were modified to express a light-driven proton pump, which required the assembly of a cofactor synthesis pathway. The proton gradient generated upon the exposure of light was then used by the bacteria to synthesize ATP, thereby turning E. coli into a type of pseudo-autotroph.

Despite its potential, hydroponics farmers face low crop yields due to diseases and nutrient imbalances. It is well-documented that a sufficient level of oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species (ROS) is necessary for and can enhance crop growth. To that end, Cornell iGEM developed a novel redox biosensor in E. coli that uses a redox-sensitive fluorescent protein reporter to couple an optogenetic transcriptional circuit to an external optics system. In addition to offering enhanced sensitivity to ROS, this system optimizes oxidative stress by controlling redox-sensitive transcriptional responses with greater precision through an external LED.

Therefore, it is important to detect the concentration of L-lactate. Acid-base titration is a common method for it, but this method is complicated and time-consuming. In order to monitor L-lactate quickly and conveniently, we designed a biosensor for detecting L-lactate concentration by using the lldPRD L-lactate operon and QS system in E. coli. One of these parts is able to induce the lldPRD genes expression, LuxS protein, in the presence of L-lactate. LuxS protein catalyzes the SAM cycle and produces a small signaling molecule AI-2 that motivates our second part promoter of LsrA&K to promote GFP expression. The optic fiber is able to detect the GFP signal and convert it into current.

We believe the solution lies in cyanobacteria - photosynthetic prokaryotes - as they were the first organisms to sink carbon dioxide billions of years ago and are some of the most efficient autotrophs. Our approach is to induce sucrose secretion for the industrial production of biofuels and bioplastics, while simultaneously sinking CO2. Additionally, to address the lack of promoters available for cyanobacteria synthetic biology research, our team developed a variety of constitutive, light-inducible, and nutrient-repressible promoter BioBricks for our strain of Synechococcus elongatus.

The causal agents of these ailments are gram-positive bacteria: Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius respectively. Nowadays, two techniques for the treatment of Foulbrood are used: antibiotics and incineration of hives. The former promotes the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria while the latter results unprofitable for beekeepers. Therefore, we propose the production of bee antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in Escherichia coli to treat P. larvae and M. plutonius infections. Defensin 1, abaecin, defensin 2, and apidaecin are each expressed in a different BL21 (DE3) culture. PelB leader peptide and a 6X His-tag foster adequate expression and further purification.

122,"b'Nosema ceranae is a microsporidian parasite which infects the European honey bee, Apis mellifera. Nosema infections cause energetic stress in bees and decreases their immune response. The detrimental effects of Nosema can lead to lower hive productivity, and ultimately colony failure. To counteract this infection, Team UAlberta designed an Antifungal Porphyrin-based Intervention System (APIS) to treat Nosema infections in honey bees. APIS uses a modified heme biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), the eighth intermediate in the pathway. When ingested, PPIX-like molecules have been shown to decrease N. ceranae spore load in infected bees. Re-introducing the heme pathway in E. coli controlled by an inducible promoter overproduces PPIX using existing cell machinery. APIS allows bypassing of mechanisms regulating the endogenous pathway. Our system allows for directly introducing the bacteria into bees, as well as the mass production of PPIX in bioreactors.'","['Food & Energy', 'Food & Nutrition', 'Energy']"

This pathogen is wiping out economically important crops, including olives and grapevine, with no effective cure found yet. Currently, the containment methods for this disease are pre-emptively burning trees and using high doses of pesticides. Our team, Xylencer, develops an effective solution for this disease by using bacteriophage therapy for X. fastidiosa. To overcome current limitations, including UV degradation of bacteriophages, we design a protective carrier bacterium that produces bacteriophages upon sensing X. fastidiosa. Bacteriophages will lyse the bacteria, while simultaneously triggering a plant immune response with specific peptides, forming an alliance between plant and bacteriophage. In order to have the bacteriophage spread to all infected plants, we mimic X. fastidiosa's spread by fusing chitin-binding proteins to the bacteriophage capsid, facilitating their spread by insects. Using our modular approach Xylencer, we believe we can eradicate X. fastidiosa.""","['Food & Energy', 'Food & Nutrition', 'Energy']"

Post harvest, invertase cleaves sucrose which reduces sugar retrieval rates by up to 10.25%. We wanted to devise a solution that initiated grassroots-level changes for farmers. The farmer would administer our novel polymer-based inoculant, which would release our bacteria into the stem of the sugarcane, by employing an injector mechanism. Once inside, our genetic circuit inside the bacterial E.coli chassis is designed to exhibit anti-invertase activity, regulated by the amount of fructose inside the sugarcane in a continuous and controlled manner, through a biosensor mechanism.

Then a novel MFC system was designed. For anode strain, weve cloned a PNP sensor sequence and a riboflavin into Escherichia coli. The recombinants is able to detect PNP and produce riboflavin to boost electrical generation when co-cultured with Shewanella oneidensis. In the cathode, gene codes chromate (VI) reductase Yief was cloned into E.coli. The stability of MFCs has been improved and the electricity generated was correlated with the substrates. Moreover, weve designed a program which can monitor the contaminants concentrations in MFCs.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
194,"b'Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a malignant tumor with 640,000 new cases annually worldwide. Saliva testing is non-invasive procedure that allows detecting OSCC biomarkers. Elevated level of p53 protein was identified in OSCC patients at different stages of the disease. Camelid antibodies containing only variable regions, nanobodies (VHH) and single-chain variable regions (scFv) with VH and VL, are becoming popular in research and diagnostics. It was identified that VL region showed higher affinity for p53 than VHH, and dimerization of VL regions increases their affinity up to ten folds. Camelid antibodies can be conjugated to other proteins without loss of function. They can be expressed and secreted in such common model organism as E. coli, reducing the cost of antibody production. Therefore, the aim of this project is to design biosensor to detect p53 in saliva samples for OSCC diagnosis using nanobodies expressed in bacteria.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"

Our circuit utilizes catabolite repression mechanism of E coli to measure the concentration of glucose in honey. We construct plasmid Bba_J04450 by inserting either Adenylate cyclase or IIA Glc which may affect the sensitivity of catabolite repression. Creation of novel circuit which consists of constitutive promoter followed by either Adenylate Cyclase or IIAGlc genes, which placed downward lac-mRFP circuit, may affect the sensitivity of catabolite repression.

However, due to a lack of well-characterized devices capable of producing multiple states, the design of organisms with multiple changing functionalities has been hampered. This year, we have engineered yeast that can make multiple decisions based on environmental cues and indefinitely maintain their state until conditions change. We will achieve this by implementing a synthetic cellular decision making transcriptional network: the tri-stable switch. We have designed and tested new dual input promoters that use transcriptional activators as both activators and repressors. We have also generated a mathematical model of our system from our constructed promoter characterizations, along with continuing with our outreach program to elementary and high school students.

For magnetic receiver, we chose ferritin, the iron-storage protein in organisms, which could synthesize ferric oxihydroxide core in its hollow protein shell. When exposed to electromagnetic field, the ferric oxihydroxide core would be heated, which would trigger thermosensitive regulator. For thermosensitive regulator, we chose RNA thermometer and constructed a thermosensitive T7 RNA polymerase. RNA thermometer is a structured RNA which could expose RBS only when heated. The thermosensitive T7 RNA polymerase is a normal T7 RNA polymerase at the selected locus of which was inserted by a temperature-sensitive intein, which could self-splice at specific temperature.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
202,"b'Given the number of possible cellular conditions, existing approaches/mathematical models are limited in how they can predict and optimize metabolic pathways. The ability to stoichiometrically control enzyme levels allows for empirical testing of rate limiting steps. As a proof of principle, we tested our ability to identify rate limiting steps using the bacterial LUX system, a bioluminescent reaction, in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. We have expressed several permutations of the bacterial LUX metabolic pathway to empirically determine its rate limiting steps by measuring the resulting light production. The identification of rate-limiting steps then allows us to optimize the pathway. Furthermore, with these findings, an improved and experimentally validated mathematical model of the LUX pathway will be constructed. By strategically altering biosynthetic gene expression, we have gained a means to tailor the reporter/sensor to better suit our needs (i.e. make it brighter) and a generalizable method to rapidly optimize metabolic pathways.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"

Different molecules are produced by cancer cells such as proteins, and secondary metabolites. Because of their specificity, they have been used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis over past decades. Recently, volatile organic compounds have been identified as biomarker to discriminate the types of cancer. In this project, we plan to construct bacterial whole-cell biosensors for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose cancer.

207,"b'We will assess the viability of a novel bioluminescence detection system for point-of-care diagnostic testing. In our proposed system, a Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9 isoform codon optimised for Escherichia coli is fused to the N-or C- terminal fragments of a thermostable pH-tolerant Pyrophorus plagiopthalamus luciferase (LUC). We aim to coexpress guideRNAs to target these chimeric dCas9-LUC proteins to adjacent DNA sequences. This will enable the reconstitution of luciferase activity and subsequent bioluminescence in the presence of luciferin. This light output constitutes a signal for detection of any targeted DNA sequence, dependent on access to the target sequence. We plan to undertake a proof of concept study of this system using gRNAs targeted to the E.coli 16S rRNA locus, to describe both the effective output of this system in vitro, and the optimum distance between gRNA targets.

208,"b'Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results in chronic inflammation of the intestines. Current diagnostic methods are invasive and rely on biomarkers that are not sufficiently disease-specific. We have engineered E. coli to detect several disease-specific biomarkers, memorize this event, and allow specific readout of the memory state. While the sensor cells travel through the gut, simultaneously occurring signals are memorized by activating an AND gate which triggers a recombination-based unidirectional switch and commits the observation to memory. After isolation from the patients faeces, the memory can be read out through the expression of a fluorescent protein induced by the addition of the candidate biomarker. Thus a single fluorescent protein can differentiate between many different candidate markers. A community of sensor cells can be utilized at the same time, enabling a high degree of multiplexing.

Rather than treating chlamydial infections, which can be easily done by broadband antibiotics, the problem is the diagnostic identification of the exact bacterial strain. Current diagnostic methods are costly, since they mostly rely on immunologic methods like antibody staining, ranging between 30 to 150 Dollars. This is fine in industrial nations, but for many people in developing countries living close to the poverty line (earning 1.25$ per day) the cost is far from affordable.

The goal of the MIT iGEM teams project is to expedite this diagnosis process with a genetic circuit that can sense the unique biomarkers of endometriosis. Our circuit identifies whether cells are diseased by checking the cells miRNA profiles and by sensing progesterone resistance, a hallmark of endometriosis.

Engineered systems that have the ability to sense and respond to specific stimuli present in the microenvironment of pathogenic cells are able to overcome these issues. We propose to engineer a dual-sensor bacterium that can sense increased metabolite levels in its microenvironment and then respond by delivering biomolecules into target cells. As a proof-of-concept, Escherichia coli was engineered to detect increased level of lactate, then respond by attaching itself to a cancer cell marker, and subsequently release biomolecules into the cell. A kill switch will be activated when there is insufficient lactate present, thus minimising non-specific targeting.

Over-prescription of antibiotics is a major issue promoting antibiotic resistance. We have designed a device that aims to rapidly distinguish bacterial infections, thereby preventing mis-prescription of antibiotics. In the war for iron, bacteria produce siderophores that scavenge Fe3+ from blood. In response, the immune system produces lipocalin-2 which sequesters siderophores. Lipocalin-2 levels can increase 5-fold during a bacterial infection. Our device detects this difference by utilising Fur, an iron-dependant repressor regulating levels of RyhB which acts as an inverter repressing GFP, our reporter protein. Therefore, bacterial infection results in a weak GFP signal in contrast to a strong signal in patients without bacterial infection.

This is due to the conformational change that occurs within the gRNA strand when the targeted foreign RNA is recognised and binds. As a proof of principle, the sensor will be modified to detect two bacterial diseases: Lyme disease and Leptospirosis, and potentially two heavy metal pollutants: mercury and lead. The modularity of the system should allow simple modification to change sensor-specificity. Bacterial lysates will be detected by reconstituting the detection machinery in a low-cost in vitro transcription kit, including a paper-based support.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
235,"b' For many years, overusing of antibiotics results in antibiotic resistance of many bacteria. Focusing on this, our team uses the way of synthetic biology to detect and kill the drug-resistant bacteria. In the project one,we designed a self-regulated gene circuit, which can detect and kill both the Gram-positive and the Gram-negative. It can express different fluorescent proteins when the engineering bacteria encounter differnet types of pathogenic bacteria.Then toxins are released out of the cell to kill the targets. We found that the pre-loading of the drug and the systemic inflammatory response are the barriers in most drug delivery strategies. So in the project two,we designed a pulsatile delivery cycles called ""SSLC""( Synthetically Synchronized Lysis Circuit) ,based on the ""SLC"" (Synchronized Lysis Circuit) systems designed by M.Omar.Din in 2016. this system can become a therapeutic strategy for antibiotic resistance E.coli.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"

The disease is endemic in rural Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Currently there is no suitable diagnostic screening test available to identify patients in need of treatment. We set out to develop such a test using toehold switches that generate a visible color reaction on a paper test-strip upon binding of specific tapeworm RNA. We have established SOPs to screen toehold switches using in silico design, nested PCR, and cell-free expression. First sensor candidates show positive results and we succeeded in immobilizing our detection system on paper strips. We have organized a conference with over 150 participants, providing a forum for leaders from academia, pharmaceutical companies, NGOs, and members of the German Parliament, to raise awareness about neglected tropical diseases and to win scientific and financial support.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
237,"b'Cancer is one of the most common and lethal disease in the world and it is always highlighted that early diagnosis is crucial in terms of cancer treatment. It can often be invasive and painful to diagnose cancer and harmful to the body with the existing methods. At this point, breath test appears as a promising non-invasive and real-time technique which allows the monitoring of metabolic status. Volatile organic compounds(VOCs) in the exhaled breath could provide in vitro detection, classification and discrimination of diseases and microorganisms which can alter the metabolic activities of the body. So that, concentration of VOCs in the exhaled breath changes. Due to metabolic changes that cancer causes, concentration of some specific VOCs increases in the breath of patients and our aim is to have bacteria sensed those VOCs to detect four most common cancer types: lung, breast, colorectal and prostate.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
238,"b'To facilitate early diagnosis, we contrived a biosensor of onset-pathological biomarkers with high sensitivity, affordability, and analyte modifiability. Detection of Alpha Fetal Protein (AFP, a well-studied cancer indicator) is an exemplar demonstration of this device. Here is how it works: first, lysine is attached to DNA segment that is complementary to AFP-bonding aptamers. When AFP is bonded with aptamer, complementary chain is released; then, trypsin detaches lysine, which then enters fluorescents-producing, lysine-deficient E. coli system. Results are recorded, analyzed, visualized by independently designed device. Here are three highlights: first, biosensor (aptamer) is able to be artificially designed aimed at target biomarker; second, bioamplifier (gene knock-out, strong promoter, cycle amplifier and dual-fluorescence) realizes improvement of signal to noise ratio; third, micro-fluidic chip and fluorescence detector make it possible that the assay can work in practical. Therefore, the performance of system indicates it could be a promising assay in in-vitro diagnosis.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
239,"b'Lung cancer is the cancer form with the highest death toll. Late occurring symptoms and limited expensive detection methods leads to late detection of the disease, which is the most important reason to the high death toll. Specific Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC)s are molecules that have been found in the breath of lung cancer patients. In our project we are creating a biosensor for two of these VOCs. Receptors natively present in the membrane of yeast are replaced with xenogeneic receptors that are able to recognize the VOCs. When the VOCs are sensed the pheromone pathway is initiated and a detection system triggered, ultimately leading to that the yeast cells turns red through interruption of the ADE2 gene. The goal of this project is to create a simple, cheap and harmless method enabling detection of lung cancer in an early stage, leading to more lives being saved.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
240,"b'Envenomation by snakebite is one of the most neglected diseases with an estimated 5 million cases each year. These result in an estimated 100,000 deaths and 400,000 disabilities annually. The only effective treatment is animal derived antivenoms, which frequently causes adverse reactions. As a result, they are often only administered as a last resort. We aim to develop a detection-assay that enables us to determine what type of snake a victim is envenomed by. The strategy is to target distinguishable enzymatic features in the different snake venoms by developing suitable substrate-based diagnostics. Our diagnostic tool can be useful in identifying the relative composition of specific venom components in a blood sample and thereby allow for the safest course of treatment.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
241,"b'Our project focuses on developing a lateral flow assay-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for inexpensive, early-stage, point-of-care diagnosis of HIV and Zika. Treatment access and public health interventions for these diseases are seriously limited by diagnostics, as current RDTs detect either poorly-conserved viral antigens or the patients own delayed antibody response and thus are unable to reliably diagnose early-stage infection, while more sophisticated tests are not widely accessible where the disease burden is greatest. Our novel approach enables modular, early-stage detection within an inexpensive, scalable RDT format by using a lectin to detect carbohydrates universal to a number of important viral pathogens in combination with antibodies targeting virus-specific conserved sites. Additionally, we have rationally engineered a thermostable variant of the diagnostic lectin to improve manufacturing economics and device robustness. By enabling earlier and larger-scale diagnosis, we hope this approach will help to improve interventions for these critical global health challenges.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
242,"b'The emerging field of cell-free synthetic biology promises to significantly improve molecular diagnostics. Cell-free systems for engineering and implementation allows for fast testing cycles, ready-to-use detection devices, better biosafety, as well as cheap and easy transport and storage. Previously, Pardee et al. developed a cell-free system for detecting viral RNA in patients by engineering toehold switches coupled to lacZ for signal generation. Since many clinical tests rely on the detection of protein biomarkers, we developed a novel scheme for detecting proteins by coupling aptamer based affinity reagents to the toehold-switch concept in cell-free system. We furthermore improved on various aspects of the original Pardee cell-free system to create a tool that is more effective, cheaper and easier to use. Because the system can be rapidly engineered and deployed, and all parts can be modified to recognize different protein or RNA molecules, its a highly modular and novel diagnostic tool.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
243,"b'Endotoxin contamination is a concern for pharmaceutical and medical devices that are intended to encounter human blood. The most widely accepted test for detection is the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL), which is produced by harvesting the blood of horseshoe crabs and this has devastated their population. LAL detects concentrations as low as one part per trillion of endotoxins by using the natural clotting mechanism of the horseshoe crab blood in the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) found on the surface of gram-negative bacteria. Factor C is a component of LAL that self-cleaves in the presence of LPS to initiate clotting. We used the cleaving property of factor C to design a novel contamination biosensor. Producing a recombinant fusion of factor C with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), will allow us to detect our system using over-the-counter pregnancy tests creating a cheaper and more efficient way to detect endotoxins.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
244,"b'We are designing a pathogen sensitive detector, allowing an easier and more specific diagnostic of cholera. After extracting DNA from the feces and performing the analysis, a nucleic acid sequence will be detected if the patient is infected with cholera. Once these sequences are introduced into the bacteria, fluorescence will be emitted and captured by the camera of a smartphone. The application that we will design will perform the analysis and do the image processing. Plus, the temperature will continuously be monitored within the kit. The greatest advantage of this device will be its capability to communicate the results to its user and to map the cases of cholera. That way, we will be able to know which area is the most affected by the epidemic. Going forward, this kind of device will be replicable for different pathogens, thus allowing to widen the spectrum of this kits use.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"

Challenges of disease control in the modern world with high population mobility remains at the speed and accuracy of diagnosis. However, nowadays influenza A subtyping method rely greatly on RT-PCR, which requires long time, expertise and laboratory space. Meanwhile, a novel type of riboswitch, namely toehold switch, shows its potential in subtyping Influenza A with quicker detection and lower production cost.

The presence of target would induce a conformational change of our nanostructure, which we can be assessed through gel electrophoresis, colorimetric and fluorescence assay. Lastly, we will transform the construct with our biobrick , consisting of our oligos, and reverse transcriptase into E. coli that can facilitate the synthesis of our nanostructure inside the cell.

We aim to create an inexpensive device which can be used by diagnosticians on a day-to-day basis without using microscopic equipment. Our project has three modules: The Hijack module will facilitate faster growth of M. tuberculosis by increasing the frequency of oscillations of certain cell cycle proteins. The Detection module will make the bacteria express chromoproteins, which can be seen by the eye. The Termination module will ensure that the fast growing bacteria are killed after they reach a required population using quorum sensing based killer gene expression.

248,"b'Everybody poops. A stool analysis is a cheap and useful pre-diagnostic tool for many human diseases by chemical and biological examinations of daily stools. For instance, the colon cancer can be pre-screened by checking the presence of occult blood in feces. However, the procedure of collecting samples and delivering it to the laboratory often makes people cumbersome and therefore causes a delay of the examination. This year at iGEM, team KUAS_Korea presents POO-robiotics, a do-it-yourself (DIY) stool analysis at home. We employ Lactobacillus plantarum L67 as a chassis, a probiotic with antiallergic activity and used as a yogurt starter. The designed genetic circuit will convert bowel conditions into color pigments. As a proof of concept, we focused on the screening of occult blood, pH variation, and bile salt residues. After ingesting our POO-robiotics, individuals can identify their own bowel conditions at home by simply checking the color of their feces.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
249,"b'The most commonly used input signals in iGEM generally include chemicals and light. Temperature-based input signals are not used as frequently and remain a reservoir of potential for future synthetic biology tools. Our project explores the characterization and standardization of thermosensitive ion channels, known as TRPV1, to function as a thermal actuator and regulate calcium-sensitive gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. At the activation temperature, gating of the thermal actuator allows for an influx of extracellular calcium ions, which initiate the calmodulin-calcineurin signaling pathway, and promote the expression of genes regulated by Crz1p-sensitive promoters. The characterization of the thermal actuator was conducted in S. cerevisiae because yeast offers an accessible eukaryotic chassis for other iGEM teams to work with. By varying the temperature, the thermal actuator can be used to control genetic circuits that function as temperature-sensitive kill switches, drug delivery devices, or biosensors.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
250,"b'Current point-of-care diagnostics for bacterial infections are costly, time-consuming, and offer limited strain specificity. These challenges contribute to improper antibiotic usage, accelerating the propagation of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria. We are developing DNAzymes - catalytically active ssDNA generated via in vitro selection - to serve as inexpensive and sensitive probes for the rapid detection of AMR bacteria. In the presence of targeted strains, the DNAzyme cleaves a fluorophore-RNA-quencher motif at the RNA site, generating fluorescence. As a proof-of-concept, we have adapted a known E. coli K12 DNAzyme for use in a plate-based assay, and are generating a novel DNAzyme to detect resistant strains of C. difficile. Simultaneously, we are leveraging machine learning techniques to predict potential DNAzymes, and are developing kinetic models to describe DNAzyme behaviour. Our project addresses the need for novel approaches within AMR detection and active antimicrobial stewardship  issues widely recognized by the experts in this field.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
251,"b'The ongoing crisis of increasing antibiotic resistance demands innovative preventive strategies. Recently, the RNA-targeting protein CRISPR-Cas13a has been used for highly sensitive DNA and RNA detection, promising diverse applications in point-of-care diagnostics. We integrated Cas13a in the detection unit of CascAID, our GMO-free diagnostic platform. CascAID combines an automated microfluidic device for rapid lysis and extraction of nucleic acids with a paper-based readout system. We demonstrated the performance of our device by targeting the 16S RNA from E. coli. We improved the detection limit of our platform, using simulations to optimize our amplification scheme and the final readout. Conceived as a distributable platform for rapid point-of-care diagnostics, CascAID can be used to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections, thus minimizing the widespread use of antibiotics. Furthermore, Cas13a allows the fast design of target sequences, making our system adaptive to the emergence of new viral outbreaks or fast mutating pathogens.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
252,"b'Odor molecule can be sensed via the specific binding with its cognate olfactory receptors and the following elicited signaling cascade within the cell. Our research aims to build a mammalian cell-based biological odor detection system (iSmeller, intensified Smeller) with enhanced sensitivity by employing the CRISPR/Cas9 activation technology. Once an odor binds to the specific olfactory receptors on the cell membrane, it leads to a series of signaling rally and consequently generates a flux of cAMP (cyclic AMP) which could be detected by a cAMP-activated reporter gene system. We implement CRISPR activation apparatus to simultaneously amplify several core components endogenously along the olfactory signal cascade to enhance power and sensitivity of the cellular odor sensor. We will evaluate the performance of iSmeller with two odor/receptor pairs: -citronellol/OR1A1 and bourgeonal/OR1D2. The iSmeller holds great promise in various applications such as cancer diagnosis, environmental pollution evaluation and food quality control.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
253,"b'Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is one of the leading causes of food-borne illnesses. Shiga toxins mode of action involves the inhibition of protein synthesis, consequently leading to cell death. While most countries have stringent food safety regulations to prevent the sale of contaminated foods, small scale manufacturers often do not have the access, time, or resources to ensure the safety of their food. Therefore, the aim of this project was to design a cost-effective, portable device that can readily detect the presence of STEC. The device functions by lysing the bacterial cell wall and amplifying a STEC-specific gene sequence using loop-mediated isothermal amplification. It is envisioned that the use of this device in the developing world would be an effective means of reducing the incidence of food-borne illnesses.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"

Caused by the parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, it is endemic to much of Latin America. Chagas disease claims over 12,000 lives per year, yet remains difficult to diagnose in its treatable acute phase. Existing diagnostics require highly-trained personnel and expensive equipment. Our solution is to develop an accurate, low cost, and portable cell-free diagnostic kit that detects the presence of cruzipain, a protease specific to T. cruzi. We have developed, modelled, and tested two designs: (i) a cell-free DNA circuit-based diagnostic utilising the TetR repressor system and (ii) a protein-based outer membrane vesicle (OMV) diagnostic using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system for localisation of our parts to the outer membrane and a split-protease-based protein circuit to amplify the signal.

Understanding the elements of nutrition will aid in engineering solutions to current -and future- nutrition concerns. One set of vitamins where deficiencies are presently a concern, especially among pregnant women, are vitamins B9 and B12. The primary goal of this project was to characterize and document riboswitches responsive to vitamins B9 and B12. Five riboswitches regulated by either vitamin B9 or B12 were selected and synthesized. E. coli were engineered to express the mRNA regulating GFP expression constitutively using the well-documented promoter BBa_J23106. The GFP expression when exposed to varied levels of the ligand were measured over time through fluorescence measurements, and the binding affinity of the ligand to each riboswitch was determined through isothermal titration calorimetry. These data and subsequent documentation will aid in providing a usable, documented part for further use.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
256,"b'Current state-of-the-art inorganic hardware sensors for biological and chemical agent detection are highly tailored for specific chemicals and find difficulty when used to detect compounds outside of a highly defined analyte set. Olfactory receptors are G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) that discriminate thousands of odorants based on genetic sequences that in the presence of a ligand cause cells to generate an electric potential that is measurable using microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Here, we modify HT-22 cells by adding individual olfactory receptors plasmids via nucleofection. A bioreactor was designed with a peristaltic pump system allowing for media to flow across a MEA cultured with neurons which enables the controlled addition of liquid samples for action potential measurement.

257,"b'We aim to create a DNA detection kit for diagnosis of diseases caused by microorganisms, such as Chagas disease. Current test-kits for Chagas disease lack in specificity or sensitivity and require trained personnel and a well-equipped laboratory, which are often not available in rural areas. Our system, called OUTCASST, detects pathogen DNA, allowing for direct diagnosis in a simple, robust and inexpensive manner that can be used in absence of laboratory equipment. It works through DNA binding and colocalization of catalytically inactive Cas9 and Cpf1 fused to membrane proteins and exposed to the extracellular medium. To assemble OUTCASST, we generated inactive Cas9 and Cpf1 variants and checked for functionality. In parallel, several modelling techniques were employed to identify venues for optimization. OUTCASST can be adapted easily to detect any desired DNA sequence and is therefore a valuable addition to the pool of toolkits for disease diagnosis.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"

The Mantis project aims to detect antigens in blood samples of patients using an in vivo bacterial system, allowing for efficient diagnosis even in rural areas. Mantis is fast, robust, modular, and requires little equipment. Moreover, the whole-cell system allows for more affordable production and longer storage compared to current systems. Detection is based on affinity bodies, an antibody mimetic that can be produced by bacteria. Through rational design, the system can be adapted to detect a wide range of pathogens. The addition of the affinity body to a bacterial receptor will rapidly generate a clear fluorescent signal, measured by our portable, 3D-printed diagnostic device directly in the field.

259,"b'We plan on developing a melatonin biosensor. Our approach for the biosensor is to genetically modify Saccharomyces cerevisiae by integrating a highly specific human melatonin receptor into the cells. Melatonin has a high membrane permeability which permits us to use the nuclear retinoid z receptor (RZR) which is directly regulating gene expression. We express the RZR as a fusion-protein with the recognition sequence of the human estrogen receptor alpha (ER). When melatonin is bound, the modified receptor binds to the estrogen receptor responsive element (ERE) and as a consequence regulate expression of firefly luciferase reporter genes. In our second approach, we will use the membrane-receptor MT1 for our biosensor. When melatonin binds to the G protein-coupled receptor, -arrestins can be recruited. This mechanism allows us to use an enzyme fragment complementation assay based on two fusion-proteins.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"

We aim to develop a rapid, low-cost test for MERS-CoV for potential use in field diagnosis. Our biosensor is based on the toehold switch mechanism. The designed switches regulate the expression of trehalase, an enzyme which hydrolyzes the disaccharide trehalose to glucose. Thus, overall, the presence of viral load in the sample triggers glucose production, which is measured by a repurposed glucometer, signaling the diagnosis. Finally, attempting to accelerate the diagnosis, we lower the complexity of the switches using an alternative reporter, an engineered split trehalase. The two split fragments assemble to a functional enzyme through coiled-coil interactions. Our proposed diagnostic workflow is easily customizable for the detection of other viruses threatening global health, aiming to contribute to travel medicine and diagnostics.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"

We have devised a replacement for the LAL test using cloned Factor C and an artificial substrate consisting of a reporter fused to cellulose binding domain with the Factor C protease site connecting them. The substrate is bound to paper by the cellulose binding domain. When exposed to Factor C mixed with the injectable liquid formulation to be tested, the presence of endotoxins will activate the protease and the substrate will be cleaved, releasing the reporter.

Our system relies on CRISPRs ability to recognize specific sequences. We plan on using different read-outs, our first idea being site-specific DNA cleavage if a cystic fibrosis associated mutation is present. Another approach would be a pair of dCas9 proteins, linked to split halves of a reporter molecule that restores its activity if the target sequence is identified.

Utilizing CRISPR for purposes other than gene editing has allowed us to create a novel, field-ready, diagnostic technique for carriers of recessive traits. Cas12a proteins are DNA targeting enzymes that recognize DNA based on a guide RNA sequence designed to match a target. The binding initiates non-specific single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity in Cas12a sufficient to degrade linear and circular ssDNA within minutes. Through this, ssDNA attached to fluorescent dye and quencher, serving as reporters, will undergo degradation. Upon cleavage, the quencher is released and fluorescence is emitted. We designed, built and programmed a hand-held device that can detect the fluorescence with high sensitivity. Simply, DNA obtained from cheek swabs, inserted into the device, diagnoses carriers of Sickle Cell Anemia.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"

This self-contained platform encodes all components for diagnosis from detection to a readout in a cell-free solution. By combining the collateral cleavage of CRISPR-cas13a and small molecule sensing via metal sensitive operons, this system becomes modular, allowing for multiple diagnostic targets. To demonstrate, gene fragments of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were detected through the creation of specific targeting guide RNAs. CRISPR-cas13as collateral cleavage and its preferential cleaving towards certain motifs allowed for the development of a ratiometric read-out due to the preferential degradation of chromoprotein expressing mRNA.

The goal of our project is to create an easy, cost-effective, and sensitive detection device for use in synthetic biology, it can even be used by other iGEM teams to get an all-or-nothing response indicating the presence of targeted protein using pregnancy test strips. We plan to create a pGEX plasmid containing recombinant HCG preceded by new restriction sites which is where the promoter is inserted, only to be activated in the presence of the protein in question.

As a proof of concept, we targeted Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, a bacterium causing opportunistic lung infections in immunosuppressed patient. We created DNA probes targeting a housekeeping gene and an antibiotic marker of PAO1. In parallel we automated the different processes required for detection with DNA probes: from the DNA extraction after lysis to a fluorescence measurement via a bacterial transformation.

The sensing parts of the reporter cells are powered by nanobodies, the single-domain antibody that can be engineered to detect different biomarkers. Binding of biomarkers on nanobodies triggers cleavages and releases of transcriptional activators. Activating the expression of lux gene, in turn, induces bioluminescent emission as a readout for devices to detect.

273,"b'The common yeast infection, vulvovaginal candidiasis, affects 75% of women throughout their lifetime. This disease is caused by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, which is also a major cause of systemic candidiasis, a rarer but deadly disease with up to a 49% lethality rate. Existing diagnostics for both infection types are lacking in accessibility, speed, or accuracy  far from the ideal test. This project focuses on creating such a test by detecting farnesol and tyrosol, biomarkers indicative of C. albicans, by binding them to the split proteins pqsR and tyrosinase. Upon binding, a split horseradish peroxidase catalyzes and produces a blue color on a paper test strip by oxidizing the substrate tetramethylbenzidine. This test will produce a colorimetric output for a simple-to-understand diagnosis without any infrastructure. It also may provide an easy and cheap way to diagnose candidiasis worldwide, reducing antifungal abuse.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
274,"b'This years project has focused on the production of protein biosensors for detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of salivary hormones. We have taken two approaches to our design process. Firstly, we constructed a reagent-less, and continuous glucocorticoid sensor which utilizes changes in Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer to detect hormones. Secondly, we have begun developing a novel, and easy to use biosensor which utilizes ligand-dependent intein splicing to produce a luminescent signal. The resulting signal could then be quantified, providing a dose-dependent measurement of analytes. In addition to our laboratory work, we have constructed a complimentary diagnostic pacifier featuring a built in luminometer, allowing for the potential to passively collect, and analyze saliva in a portable and non-invasive fashion. In practice, a child would use the pacifier as normal, and the babys salivary hormones would be collected, analyzed, and wirelessly transmitted to the parent or a healthcare professional through a smartphone application.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
275,"b'Colorectal cancer being a severe illness worldwide, its mortality rises along with diagnosis delay. As a result, an accurate method for early diagnosis is in desperate need. Therefore, this year our team comes up with an engineered E.coli used for early, non-invasive detection of colorectal cancer. Due to the combination with ultrasound technique, we name it, ECHO. When our device arrives at the colorectal area after capsule degradation, it stabilizes on cancerated tissue through antigen-peptide binding, meanwhile expressing gas vesicles in vivo, enabling the rapid detection and location of the cancer foci using ultrasound. Besides usage on detection, ECHO also synthesizes azurin used to eliminate cancer cells after being triggered by environmental factors in cancerated area. At last, after ultrasound detection and medicine synthesis, arabinose will be consumed to trigger self-destruction pathway. To sum up, our device introduces an applicable and innovative non-invasive technique in early diagnosis of colorectal cancer.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"

277,"b'Histamine increases significantly in blood when allergy happens. So, we engineered the pheromone pathway in yeast to test histamine release in blood sample under one specific allergen per time. The pheromone receptor ste2 in original pathway is replaced by human Histamine receptor H3 or H4. In order to reinforce the coupling between H3/H4 and yeast G-protein, C-terminal of  subunit of G-protein is modified by replacing several amino acids from the homologous protein in human. EGFP is set behind promoter Fus1 as the reporter gene. Many previous works support our modifications. Then the models of histamine and EGFP intensity relationship and the diagnosis credence can help to give the final result.

Key promoter regions of interest are first identified via unsupervised machine learning applied to the Cancer Genome Atlas via our in silico predictive tool. After this, our specially-designed assay can detect the presence of these hypermethylated regions of interest and provide a quantitative, fluorescent readout in order to generate clinical insight. Special advances in material science and microfluidics are then used to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of our assay.

280,"b'During their lifetime 75% of women will experience a Candida albicans infection, one of the most common vulvovaginal yeast infections. Currently there are no fast methods to detect whether an infection is caused by C. albicans. As a result, women purchase over-the-counter antimycotics without knowing the cause of their infection. This contributes to the rise of antimycotic resistance, making treatment of future infections more difficult. Based on previous projects, UiOslo_Norway aims to develop a fast detection kit for C. albicans infections, using CRISPR/dCas9. Upon a suspected infection, a vaginal sample will be treated with glucanase to selectively lyse yeast cells walls, exposing the fungal DNA. Afterwards, modified dCas9 enzymes fused with split -lactamase are added. Using specifically designed guideRNAs, the dCas9 complexes bind adjacently on C. albicans specific DNA sequences. This activates the -lactamase to cleave its substrate nitrocefin, producing a colored product indicating the presence of C. albicans DNA.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"

Recently, there has been diphtheria outbreak affecting major provinces in Indonesia. We realize the urgency of fast, reliable, and cheap early detection method for diphtheria infection to overcome this issue. Therefore, we plan to combine Escherichia coli Tar chemotaxis receptor with human heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) receptor so the bacteria can detect diphtheria toxin. In addition, we will combine CheA and CheY in E. coli chemotaxis pathway with LuxAB and eYFP, respectively. When in contact, LuxAB and eYFP will create resonance energy transfer system. Without diphtheria toxin, CheA will interact with CheY and thus LuxAB-eYFP energy resonance will happen, resulting in yellow color. With toxin presence, CheA will not interact with CheY and energy resonance will not happen, resulting in blue color (i.e. LuxAB native color).'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
282,"b'Antibody based diagnostic tests or immunoassays are widely used to quicken treatment decision-making and to enable patients to test themselves for example for pregnancy. However, the analyte binding antibodies in conventional immunoassays are randomly immobilized onto a test surface blocking some binding sites from the analytes. When the concentration of a disease marker as the analyte is below the detection limit or the sensitivity, the signal could be improved by orienting the antibodies. Our objective was to orientate a digoxigenin binding Fab fragment of the antibody by incorporating a p-azido-L-phenylalanine, an unnatural amino acid with click chemistry properties. As a control, we used a chemically treated Fab including azide in random locations. The Fabs were immobilized onto DBCO coated magnetic beads and the bound fluorescently labeled digoxigenin was measured with flow cytometry. According to the results, orientation improved the signal and made the test surface more homogeneous.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"

Current diagnostic methods are time-consuming and barely available at the point-of-care in many endemic regions in Africa and the Americas, as they require sophisticated laboratory equipment and highly trained personnel. As a solution, we propose a novel, easy-to-use diagnostic test detecting mycolactone, the toxin excreted by the causative agent Mycobacterium ulcerans, in a patients sample. The molecular mechanism is based on a riboswitch which, in the presence of mycolactone, specifically induces chromoprotein expression in an engineered Escherichia coli strain, generating a simple visual read-out. As an alternative to GMOs, the test may also be used as cell-free system. After expert consultations, an instruction manual was designed to ensure proper and safe use, thus rendering the test a quick and efficient tool for diagnosing Buruli ulcer.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
285,"b'African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) is a serious epidemic disease worldwide. The ease of infection and high mortality rate has caused serious market imbalance. ASF has spread throughout Asia, so Taiwan is surrounded by epidemic regions. Recognizing this problem, we created ""ASFAST"". ASFAST combines the CRISPR Cas system with PicoGreen fluorescence signal transduction. We use Cas12a protein with crRNA to recognize the ASFV p72 capsid protein sequence. When the Cas12a protein is activated, a fluorescent signal will be detected by our sensor. ASFAST can detect the virus within 7 days of infection, which means during the incubation period. Based on this advantage, we plan to develop an early detection system as part of a routine health check for non-epidemic regions. After the test, the ASFAST device will immediately send the data to a cloud database so the government can monitor the results in real time.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"
286,"b'In an effort to reduce the inequality in global healthcare, increase the efficiency of labs, and minimize biohazards, our team developed CASPRE; a synthetic biology kit that provides preliminary genetic testing for carriers of recessive traits. CASPREs biological mechanism utilizes CRISPR-Cas12a protein, specifically- designed guide RNA (gRNA), and fluorescing reporters to identify the presence of a disorder-causing SNP. Upon the extraction of the DNA from a saliva sample, Cas12a scans the DNA searching for a complementary sequence to the gRNA. If complementary binding occurs, a reaction complex forms and triggers an indiscriminate cleavage activity. Through this, a single-stranded DNA linking the reporter and its quencher degrades and allows the emission of fluorescence. Then, CASPREs developed, hand-held device and user-friendly application work in tandem to detect and interpret the emitted fluorescence producing a +/- diagnoses.

Antigenic drift and shift make the prediction of the upcoming epidemic subtype of influenza a challenging task. Antibodies take time to be developed, but this slow yet potent remedy cant meet its urgent demands. To solve this problem, we utilize aptamer which is known for its specific recognition of unique proteins of influenza viruses. By improving the conventional method, we developed a rapid detection device which effectively targets influenza. Furthermore, we have also managed to exploit the aptamers to inhibit virus infection.

289,"b'What can your tears tell about you? Joy, sadness, pain What if they could tell so much more? Tears are often neglected as potential diagnostic fluids. However, in addition to their advantageous accessibility, they are unexpectedly rich and contain lots of biological materials. Due to the close spatial proximity of the lacrimal glands and the cranial nerves, an overview of tear composition captures also the pathophysiological changes in the central nervous system. Thus, even if research in tear fluid biomarkers is at an early stage, tear fluid sampling may become a non-invasive and non-painful technique to diagnose patients with neurodegenerative disorders. NeuroDrop aims to demonstrate that the detection of small amounts of biomarkers is possible in small volumes, like tears for example.

290,"b'Contemporary use of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture has resulted in the sharp increase of drug-resistant bacteria. These resistant bacteria pose risks to human and livestock health, as commonly-used antibiotics become less effective for treating infections. Additionally, if animal products contaminated with antibiotics are consumed by humans, there is a risk that the consumers intestinal microbiota will be damaged or create their own resistant bacteria. In light of this, antibiotic detection and monitoring in the environment and in animal products are of very current relevance. In our project, weve used synthetic biology to develop a bacterial system that can sense tetracycline and respond to its presence by producing a non-toxic biological pigment. The resulting system produces a visible colour change after induction with water, dairy, or meat samples that contain tetracycline.

This will enable people to visibly check if animals are under stress, helping them to identify and eliminate possible causes of animal stress. To achieve this, we employed a newly discovered fungal bioluminescent system to design and construct a genetic circuit that detects cellular signals.

To solve this problem, our team proposes a portable biosensor device that can detect the presence of Borrelia spp. in ticks - LymeExpess. It comprises tick homogenization followed by detection of pathogen-specific DNA motifs. The detection is based on using specially engineered dCas proteins from various organisms fused with split domains of beta-lactamase. The dCas complexes target the complementing split domains to the nearby DNA locus allowing for the fully functional reporter protein to be formed.

313,"b'The incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in China has continued to rise. To solve the problem, our team designed and manufactured a set of household HPV detector for HPV early screening. Our detector will use female menstrual blood as teat sample and support two detection methods. The first method is based on CRISPR/Cas system. After rupturing the cervical epithelial cells in menstrual blood, we amplified the target with RPA, then identified it with Cas12a protein. This method is highly specific and can be used for HPV typing. However, in HPV screening, the key is to detect multiple HPV subtypes simultaneously. Therefore, to implement multi-channel detection, we designed another method. It uses Exo to assist signal amplification and uses hybridization chain reaction to further amplify the signal.

319,"b'The placement of implants is one of the most frequently performed operations in hospitals all over the world, still increasing in number. Unfortunately, the risk to develop an implant-associated inflammation after such surgeries is very high. The origin of an implant-associated inflammation is often biofilms, which attach to the implant surface. Targeted treatment of such bacterial biofilms is challenging. A typical therapeutic approach with antibiotics often fails. In the worst case, a generous removal of the region is mandatory. Therefore, it would be helpful to detect the formation of a biofilm at an early stage, increasing the probability of successful treatment.

In our work, we recombined the PmrA-PmrB two-component system derived from Salmonella to the surface of E. coli, and replaced the Fe(III) recognition site of PmrB with the core region of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)which could recognize the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2. Upon recognition, the downstream signal pathways and the reporter gene are activated. Furthermore, an amplifier (Hrp regulatory machinery) and extra cytoplasmic function (ECF)  factor were used to improve the sensitivity of the biosensor.

By coupling this communication system with a fluorescent reporter and electronic components, we can improve upon pre-existing biosensors by increasing scalability and portability. Through the use of bioengineered E. coli cells that react to the presence of autoinducer-2, we produce a measurable fluorescent signal. The amount of fluorescence is then correlated to contamination using our dry-lab mechanical/electrical device: a cost-effective fluorometer built to test samples in common microcentrifuge tubes.

Therefore, we decided to create a test system based on CRISPR-Cas. It detects herpesvirus by its RNA. We use deadCas13 protein, connected by a linker with two halves of reporter protein - beta-lactamase. Two deadCas13 proteins are directed by gRNA to the RNA of the virus. When the distance between two Cas-proteins is correctly selected, two beta-lactamase proteins can fuse into a functional protein that destroys nitrocefin  the solution's color changes from yellow to red. To avoid false-positive results, we use two guide RNAs. With one guide, RNA reporter protein will not become functional.

Here, we developed a G-quadruplex-based, highly specific, expedite and economic RNA virus detection system using SARS-CoV-2 as an example. The procedure includes recombinase-polymerase-mediated viral sequence amplification, nCas9-Phi29-mediated DNA nicking and displacement, rolling cycle amplification of G-quadruplex, and color development.

Therefore, the bacteria can capture coronavirus via binding to their receptors and transport signaling to the downstream components. LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing system from E. coli and Hrp amplifier from Pseudomonas syringae were used to enhance the sensitivity and output signal.

In Canada, 33% of the population experiences insufficiency. Current testing methods in northern British Columbia, Canada, are expensive, time-consuming, and inaccessible. A benchtop vitamin D biosensor that can be implemented in local healthcare facilities would address this problem. Our biosensor will detect vitamin D (25(OH)D) in a blood serum sample. The biosensor is contained in E. coli, and consists of two components: (i) 1-alpha-hydroxylase, and (ii) a chimeric protein consisting of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of vitamin D receptor and a FRET system (VDR-FRET). The 1-alpha-hydroxylase activates 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, which has high affinity for the VDR-LBD.

Hence, we have developed a sensitive and easy-to-use diagnostic kit that can accommodate direct patient samples without RNA extraction and deliver results in under 40 minutes. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was utilised to amplify the target genes. After amplification, a novel CRISPR-Cas12a Lb-RVRR enzyme was employed to identify different mutations based on the fluorescence intensity.

357,"b'Chytridiomycosis is a fungal disease that has devastated amphibian populations, leading to substantial losses in biodiversity. Caused by the infection of the fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) or Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), chytridiomycosis causes rapid decline and extinction of amphibian populations. Both species are responsible for fatal disease; however, Bd infects frogs and toads, while Bsal generally affects salamanders. Amphibians rarely display visible symptoms, limiting diagnosis of chytridiomycosis to post-mortem examination, which highlights the need for diagnostic devices. Current methods for identification of the pathogen are laboratory equipment-dependent, time-consuming, and expensive which contributes to the spread of infection. Thus, our team is developing a diagnostic device that allows for rapid detection of the two disease-causing fungi in a field setting. To bypass the time consuming DNA amplification step, we use electrokinetic concentration of the extracted DNA, followed by a CRISPR-Cas 12a complex binding to the Bd or Bsal target DNA for detection.'","['Measurement', 'Diagnostics']"

To colonize colorectal cells, we have proposed engineering E. coli cells with chimeric fimbrial cap protein that can be anchored to surfaces. Anchoring occurs via interaction with customized antigens using a SNAP tag. We then sense a hypoxic environment in cancer cells through the oxidative stress response transcription factor OxyR. To achieve this goal, we designed and built plasmids in which OxyR promoters regulate the transcription of the B-galactosidase lac-alpha fragment.

To achieve our goal, we will build a reporter construct that uses an alkane sensitive promoter to drive the expression of a blue chromoprotein from the coral Acropora millepora which should cause the yeast to turn blue in the presence of alkanes. Our parts include an alkane response element (3xARE1), a leu minimal promoter, our reporter gene (blue chromoprotein), and a terminator (XPR2).

One of the most accepted theories explaining its origin suggests that it is triggered by the chemical modifications of Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL), which are susceptible to oxdiations; it is believed that these oxidized products accumulate on the artery walls (tunica intima), generating an inflammatory process that will ultimately cause the development of atheroma plaques. LDL products are being oxidized by the interaction with Reactive Oxygen Species in the bloodstream, this can occur either within fatty acids or sterols, such as 7-ketocholesterol, one of the most common reaction products.

To address this, we have genetically engineered a system to diagnose and treat Alzheimers disease. Diagnosis is based on the detection of two Alzheimers-specific biomarkers in the brain: extracellular beta-amyloid protein oligomers and the intracellular miRNA profile of afflicted neurons. Successful detection triggers a treatment module that reduces beta-amyloid levels, thereby preventing neuronal death and slowing the progression of Alzheimers symptoms.

429,"b'Lactose intolerance is a digestive condition associated with the inability to fully digest lactose (a sugar found in milk products), and affects ~ 5 billion people worldwide. The symptoms include bloating, stomach cramps, diarrhea and nausea. In this project, we propose to use a synthetic biology approach to achieve 2 major aims: (1) design and construct an Escherichia coli probiotic strain (Lac Breaker) to tackle the lactose intolerance problem which involves high expression of the beta-galactosidase enzyme (driven by expression vector A) and its release from the E. coli cell by autolysis (using a lysis gene cassette on vector B); and (2) evaluate different lysis gene cassette constructs as an effective means to extract high value-added recombinant proteins in biotechnology. This is an improvement of the iGEM project of the 2008 Caltech team (Curing Lactose Intolerance) with greater emphasis on the design, construction and evaluation of various lysis gene cassettes.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"
430,"b""Our project is a novel bacterial method of DNA detection. We've developed a customisable, linearised, double stranded plasmid with two sticky overhangs. When the sticky overhangs come into contact with a target sequence, the binding of the DNA sequence to the overhangs circularises the plasmid. The circularised plasmid is then transformed into competent E. coli cells. Bacterial growth of green fluorescent colonies indicates a positive result, confirming presence of complementary DNA target sequence. This system could act as a cheap alternative to digital and real time PCR, as target DNA fragments are amplified in living cells without use of a costly PCR machine. This system could potentially be used as a diagnostic or screening tool for viral and/or bacterial infection such as Human Papilloma Virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. By improving sensitivity and specificity this system could also be used for detection of genetic mutations resulting in disease such as cystic fibrosis.""","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"
431,"b'The IOD band is a general diagnostic test enabling early detection and mapping of tumor mobility. Over a billion unique tests are made accessible to field experts outside of synthetic biology with a unique clone-free assembly feature. Tumor mobility is incredibly difficult to diagnose due to the rarity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and the complexity of surface marker combinations. The IOD band strives to make it easy. The central players are processing units called Input Output Diploids or IODs. IODs use antigen recognition and intercellular communication to create a logical network by which even single cells carrying the desired marker profile can be identified in a background of millions. Affirmative CTC localisation triggers a global response manifested by IOD initiated clumping at levels visible to the naked eye. As such, IOD bands do in a test tube what normally requires days to do in the lab.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"
432,"b'Non-ribosomal peptides have important anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, and immunosuppressive biological activities. They are synthesized by modular, high molecular weight enzymes that assemble more than 500 different amino acid substrates in an assembly line manner. For this reason, synthetic biologists have tried to engineer these proteins and to switch modules to create analogs and novel natural products, but with little success. Despite being modular, the interactions between modules have evolved to be highly specific, making synthetic Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthases (NRPS) a challenge to engineer. Instead of switching modules we introduced a recombination system targeting oligo integration in Bacillus subtilis. We used the recombineering system to alter the active sites determining substrate specificity, thereby creating variants of antibiotics. Our focus was the tyrocidine antibiotic, which cannot be used intravenously due to its toxicity. Our goal is to create new analogs through multiplex automated genome engineering to reduce toxicity.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

434,"b' Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are indicators of the initial stages of metastasis. However, most state-of-the-art detection methods target only a few cancer-type-specific markers. We developed a bacterial signal processing system for sensitive and selective single-cell detection of CTCs in blood samples. We start by selectively inducing apoptosis in CTCs using sTRAIL before adding our engineered Escherichia coli, called MicroBeacons. Through the expression of the Annexin V protein on their outer membrane, MicroBeacons bind to the apoptotic CTCs. Upon binding, MicroBeacons detect the increased lactate production of the CTCs via a lactate sensor and trigger quorum sensing between each other, which results in expression of fluorescent protein. Overall, the MicroBeacons selectively generate stronger fluorescence on the surface of sTRAIL-sensitive and lactate-secreting tumor cells compared to healthy cells. We anticipate our device to be a reliable, fast, and cheap method for the detection of metastasis for a wide range of cancers.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"
435,"b'Cancer thrives by preventing the immune system from targeting tumor cells. While current immunotherapies use dendritic cells to activate T-cells towards specific tumor antigens, they remain expensive and of variable efficiency against tumor immunosuppressive environment. To address these issues, our team mainly focused on engineering a S. cerevisiae yeast immunotherapy that was ultimately tested in vivo on mice presenting melanoma. Three complementary strategies were combined: First, in order to modulate the tumor environment, yeast secreting immune modulators, GM-CSF and IFNgamma, were encapsulated into alginate beads and injected in tumors. Secondly, to break the immune tolerance against cancer cells, T4 and T8 lymphocytes were elicited by a yeast antigen display system. Last, to deliver cytotoxic compounds solely in the tumor environment, a yeast hypoxia bio-sensor was designed. A side project consisted in engineering E. coli to drive MAIT lymphocytes against cancer cells instead of their original targets, parasitized cells.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

Therefore a DNA-binding and a histone modification domain are required. Up to now, these domains are connected pre-transcriptional as fusion proteins. Alternatively, our team is developing a modular system consisting of SpyCatcher and SpyTag that forms a post-translational covalent isopeptide bond. To ensure sequence specificity, we fused a SpyTag to three different TAL effectors. For the epigenetic modification RPD3 was chosen, a histone deacetylase from S. cerevisiae highly conserved among eukaryotes, to which the corresponding SpyCatcher was added. Compared to established methods, this technique greatly simplifies the epigenetic applications that require the control of several gene loci simultaneously.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"
437,"b'In modern medicine, fast detection and differentiation of diseases is a crucial and fundamental task. Typical ELISA-based assays are time-consuming and expensive. We propose an advanced procedure for the simultaneous detection of various diseases in a fast and inexpensive manner, the DiaCHIP. Our approach is based on the interaction of antibodies with their respective antigens. Different antigens are immobilized on a protein array generated by cell-free protein expression, using the corresponding DNA array as a template. Placed in a microfluidic chamber, the protein array is incubated with a patients blood sample. The interaction between an antibody in the sample and the corresponding immobilized antigen results in a local change of the optical thickness of the surface. This change can be detected using a label-free and real-time measurement technology called iRIf (imaging Reflectometric Interference). Offering simultaneous screening for several diseases, our DiaCHIP has strong potential to improve future diagnostics.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

Microbusters are biological device which secretes AMPs. They can be applied to making anti-microbial products or foods. Characteristics of each Microbuster depend on what AMP it secretes, so Microbusters with variety of functions can be designed. We designed two Microbusters.

The genes and killswitch will be inserted into E. coli, whilst the remaining aspects of the project will be theoretical due to ethical and safety restrictions. Speculatively, increased NAD+/NAD(H) could treat neurodegenerative disorders by mitigating the destruction of neurons and help with muscle fatigue. Regeneration of muscle fibres to restore strength and overall energy levels would be achieved by increased oxidative phosphorylation triggered by NAD+/NAD(H).

By filling the exosomes with siRNA of the mu opioid receptor (MOR, a primary target for opioids) and injecting the exosomes into mouse bloodstream, we detected efficient passage of the siRNA through blood-brain barrier and specific accumulation of the siRNA in mouse brain.

We hope that our work would provide the proof of principle for future gene therapy. cGMP can transduce nitric oxide and natriuretic peptide coupled signaling and remit the myocardial hypertrophy by relaxing the blood vessels. We up-regulate the soluble guanylate cyclase(sGC), an enzyme that synthesize cGMP from GTPby overexpressing the  and  subunits of sGC in a mammalian cell line. However, elevated level of cGMP leads to the feed-back expression of PDE5A, a cGMP-specific phosphodiesteras that degrades cGMP. Thus, we further modify the pathway by knocking down the PDE5A gene.

To solve that problem, we will construct scFv (single chain fragment variable) antibody that can detect dengue virus antigen. This scFv can be produced by E. coli by means of plasmid transformation that has been fused with OsmY. That scFv antibody will be put in construction diagnostic kit.

This protozoan may be a good new chassis, because of its ability to infect macrophages efficiently and expresses proteins with proper post-translational modifications, delivering these proteins inside macrophages. INF- is used to treat autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, as well as inflammatory joint diseases, such as gout and rheumatoid arthritis. However, INF- is an expensive drug, making the treatment costly. Moreover, the current treatment is systemic and has several side effects. Therefore, our team aims to use the non-virulent strain of Leishmania donovani to constitutively produce and deliver INF- directly at the inflammation site. Since Leishmania is cultivable in large scale, so it could become an actual pharmaceutical product.

However, this approach does not explain many complex and finely-tuned phenomena in the cell. We believe that a special genetic network, known as a tri-stable switch, can model cell differentiation. This network would allow a cell to specialize from a quasi-pluripotent state to one of two differentiated states. By repurposing native transcription factors, we can build such a switch in the organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or bakers yeast.

475,"b'Postprandial glycemic spikes (PGSs) occur when the concentration of blood sugar rises and falls following a meal. For diabetics, complications resulting from PGSs are the leading cause of death. Of the 100 million U.S. hyperglycemic patients, twenty-six percent regulate spikes through self-administered insulin, which is costly or easily misdosed. To reduce the amplitude of PGSs, we designed a sugar-concentration-dependent microbial system that delays and reduces the absorption of glucose and fructose from the small intestine. To show proof of principle, we introduced two genetic devices into E.coli to polymerize glucose into glycogen, to polymerize fructose into levan, and to induce cell lysis to release the polymerized sugar into the gut, thus reducing the amplitude of the glycemic spike. This microbial system, as a one-dose-fits-all solution, dynamically adjusts to glycemic spikes of fluctuating amplitudes.

Therefore, it is possible to discriminate tumor cells from other tissue cells by detecting the low glucose concentration. Using liposome as a vector, we hope to design a drug expression system with the ability to respond to different glucose level. To achieve this, we combine the CRP activator, a regulatory protein activated by cAMP, with red fluorescent protein (RPF) as a reporter of expression level. Since glucose concentration is reversely related with cAMP level, a change of glucose level can influence the binding of CRP with target operon, thus altering the fluorescent intensity.

TolC homologs are found in a variety of gram negative bacteria, including those causing diarrheal diseases. We focused on expressing tolC found in pathogenic bacteria, such as Cholera and Salmonella, in E. coli. The transgenic strains of E. coli were used to search for bacteriophages specific human GI tract pathogens. Once bacteriophages are identified for this tolC receptor, we hope to combine this phage therapy with an antibiotic resisted via efflux.

Genetically-engineered Leishmania that can be inactivated by light exposure acts as a safe carrier to deliver specific antigens to the APCs for T cells and humoral response. Based on this concept, we established a new model system to generate antigen-specific Leishmania adjuvant--Leijuvant.

The bacteria are contained within a patch, allowing for continuous secretion of the peptide into the body. While the initial system is designed to produce BBI, restriction sites within the gene constructs allow for any gene to be inserted, creating a versatile expression platform. This can be customized for the secretion of bio-therapeutics for future space missions.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

This probiotic will consist on polyamine auxotrophic bacteria, extracted from the intestinal human microflora, that will contain specific enzymes also found in our body. Additionally, we have planned to develop a cancer risk detector by engineering a bacterial cell and developing a reactive strip that, in contact with urine, can test the risk of having a growing tumor. The principle behind this idea is that an acetylated version of polyamines are exported to the blood and later to urine. This molecules have been targeted in previous studies with a high success in both sensibility and specificity of cancer risk detection.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"
509,"b'Phenylketonuria is a genetically inherited condition which is defined by the inability of a patient to break down an essential amino acid phenylalanine. Due to that, phenylalanine derivatives accumulate in the brain of a patient causing severe mental retardation. The aim of our team is to construct a bacterial probiotic with an enhanced rate of phenylalanine uptake and two independent systems for discharging phenylalanine. The first system will metabolize phenylalanine directly in the intestinal tract with phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) whilst the second system will incorporate excess phenylalanine into inclusion bodies made of synthetic phenylalnine-rich proteins. The production of these proteins is controlled by a postranscriptional regulator - a riboswitch, which is sensitive to phenylalanine. The final stage of the project will include verification of the system in a bacterial probiotic strain.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"
510,"b'Acne vulgaris affects 85% of adolescents at some point of their life, influencing their self-esteem negatively. Currently, antibiotics are among the most common acne treatments. However, 50% of bacteria associated with acne are already resistant to the antibiotics used. Our project aims to develop a novel treatment for acne using an antimicrobial peptide, dermcidin, naturally found in human sweat. Dermcidin has shown to be active against Propionibacterium acnes, the bacterium associated with acne. Patients with acne also have reduced expression of dermcidin, which suggests that it might contribute to the condition. We aim to produce dermcidin tied to a cellulose-binding domain, which would enable the immobilization of the peptide on a cellulose surface. This would allow the usage of dermcidin in various skin care products, such as hydrogel masks and exfoliation pads.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

""Grabbing the problem from the roots"" is the best way to decently describe the use of CRISPR, a special gene editing technique that we will be using to modulate a certain circRNA and adjust its gene expression, which is down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. This in consequence modifies miRNA expression thus amending the mRNA gene expression; which is the visible problem in our trials. This will lead us to adopt a novel strategy for miRNA suppression by using circRNAs. This is accomplished by utilizing a synthetic circuit to give rise to a springboard in our battle against cancer.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

The lack of less invasive treatments has motivated us to develop a new treatment based on the probiotic bacteria Lactococcus lactis, that was engineered to produce a single-chain analog insulin in human diabetics microbiota. The bacteria will be able to produce the insulin associated with a secretion signal sequence and cell-penetrating peptides, to ensure its uptake. Moreover, the synthesis of the insulin will be controlled by the natural bacteria system of catabolite repression with regulation by a sRNA. At the presence of glucose, the insulin gene expression will be activated, and then, it will be ready to be secreted and absorbed, reaching the blood and performing its biological function. The final product could be a fermented milk or a lyophilized that could be easily ingested by patients.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"
513,"b'Since the discovery of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, there has been interest in using foods containing genetically engineered probiotics as alternative forms of medicine. Our project is aimed at designing a probiotic (specifically Lactobacillus plantarum) capable of producing high levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to treat patients with anxiety and bowel disorders. To make our probiotic overproduce GABA, we intend to overexpress gadB, which encodes glutamate decarboxylase, the enzyme that converts L-glutamate into GABA. Overexpression of gadB will be accomplished by placing it under the control of a Lactococcus lactis constitutive promoter. The efficacy of our probiotic in the human gut will be modeled using the gut of Apis mellifera. Additionally, we have created the Broad Host Range Plasmid Kit, a genetic toolset composed of part plasmids that can be quickly assembled into cassette plasmids, which can then be used to easily genetically modify Lactobacillus plantarum and other non-model organisms.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"
514,"b'Our project involves expressing the human thyroid stimulating hormone antagonist (TSHantag) protein in the tobacco Nicotiana benthamiana.

TSHantag has been used to treat hyperthyroid disorders such as Graves Disease, but has not been produced in large amounts appropriate for therapeutic use. The TSHantag protein works by inhibiting autoimmune autoantibodies, which in turn decreases elevated thyroxine levels and reduces pathologic symptoms. In addition, we are expanding the set of tools available for regulating gene expression in plant synthetic biology. Currently, only a small number of regulatory elements have been introduced into the iGEM Phytobrick standard. Therefore, we are generating novel inducible promoter Phytobricks that are responsive to jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).

Challenges for efficient and cell-specific RNAi therapies abound, like rapid renal clearance, degradation by serum nucleases, traversing the lipid bilayer and escape from the intracellular endosome. Bacteria innately colonize the hypoxic and immune-privileged cores of tumors and as such have been explored as potent delivery systems for RNAi-based cancer therapeutics. We are engineering an RNAi gene therapy, utilizing recombinant E. coli that invade mammalian cells and deliver an shRNA payload targeting the aberrantly expressed receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR and transcription factor c-Myc. Bacterial uptake by mammalian cells and endosomal breakdown are mediated by a quorum-inducible Invasin-HlyA operon.

It is of great essence to develop a kind of novel cell-targeted therapy for RA because there is no radical cure for RA for the time being. To solve the problems existing in the current treatment of RA, we design and build a brand new immunotherapy. FOXP3+ regulatory T cells(Tregs), which can suppress and regulate immune reactions, are modified utilizing a lentiviral vector system to express a chimeric antigen receptor(CAR) targeting inflammatory cells associated with RA. Meanwhile, we insert the Syn-Notch receptor to activate the functional stability pathway of Tregs in the inflammatory environment, which enables them to play their role of immunosuppression in lesions more efficiently and more stably. These two redirections of the two different but interrelated systems on Tregs ensure this novel therapy a promising anti-RA effect.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"
517,b'The ability to control the compartmentalization of enzymes and biologics is needed for drug discovery. Bacterial Microcompartments BMCs are naturally occurring protein structures that act to either sequester harmful metabolic intermediates or concentrate critical cytosolic substrates. Light triggered release of toxic therapeutics from molecular compartments would activate them only where needed and potentially minimize their side effects. We have engineered a BMC with a light activated open/close switch that could be used for drug delivery. We did this by incorporating the light-sensitive compound azobenzene as a non-canonical amino acid into the structure of a BMC coat protein. This allows us to induce the disassembly of the BMC and release its enclosed cargo via photo-stimulation. Our work developing the first light activated BMC expands the synthetic biology toolkit and has the potential to help precisely deliver future therapeutics.',"['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

Many studies have found a correlation between imbalances in the gut microbiome and disease states. Can altering the gut microbiome at all change disease state? In order to evaluate this question, methods are currently needed that can allow researchers to make targeted manipulations to modulate the populations of specific microbes within a microbiome. The goal of our project is to overexpress bacteriocin genes (toxins that bacteria produce that affect other bacteria) in E. coli. The rationale for our methodology this year is to answer questions similar to ""how much of a specific bacteriocin is needed to reduce the abundance of a single microbe by 60%?""

519,"b'The threat posed by antibiotic resistant bacteria is a pressing issue which must be addressed. It is difficult and expensive to develop new antibiotics, so our project is designed to make currently available antibiotics useful again. Our aim is to create a toolkit to re-sensitise pathogens to antibiotics using CRISPR and a two-phage system, based on work by Yosef et al. (2015). An engineered lysogenic phage will transfer a CRISPR system to its host bacterium, designed to cleave resistance genes and also confer protection from an engineered lytic phage. When this lytic phage is added to the population, it kills any bacteria that have not been successfully re-sensitised. We chose to target genes found in the highly-resistant ESKAPE pathogens, and worked with 4 different phages - P1, lambda, T4 and T7. Our system was modelled in silico and tested empirically on a specially designed E. coli testing platform.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"
520,"b'Treating cancer remains a challenge for modern medicine. Current treatments are often invasive, time-consuming and limited by toxic effects on healthy tissue. An ideal therapeutic should be effective, safe and targeted. We engineered a non-pathogenic strain of E. coli to approach this goal. The combination of autonomous targeting, visualization and externally controlled toxin release provides a novel non-invasive, quick and safe approach to treating cancer. Specifically, following intravenous administration, our E. coli preferentially populates solid tumors due to the properties of the tumor microenvironment. Intracellular accumulation of the cytotoxin azurin and the MRI contrast agent bacterioferritin is controlled by an AND gate which is activated once a population threshold is reached AND lactate, a tumor marker, is present. However, azurin release happens only if the physician confirms the correct localization of the bacteria via MRI and subsequently heats them via focused ultrasound, which activates a thermo-inducible cell lysis system.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"
521,"b'A new approach to cancer treatment is the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy, which shows promising results fighting tumors in clinical trials. It consists of autologous isolated T cells modified with a chimeric receptor based on the T-cell receptor combined with the recognition domain of an antibody. Upon reinjection, CAR T-cells exhibit cytotoxicity with high affinity towards cells displaying the antigen. However, clinical trials have shown that as tumor antigens are not solely expressed on tumor cells, but also on healthy tissues, grave off-target effects like the Graft-versus-Host-Disease may occur. In order to avoid such side-effects, we engineer CAR T-cell lines specifically activated by factors of the tumor microenvironment. Controlled by a genetic AND-gate system the T cells need two input signals in order to express CAR. This would allow highly localized cytotoxic activity of T cells and provide safer cell-based cancer immunotherapy especially for solid tumors.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

Common symptoms are abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and malnutrition. The current practice for treating Celiac Disease is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. Gluten-free diets are difficult to maintain, diminish the quality of life of CD patients, and on average are 242% more expensive than diets that contain gluten. We are proposing a new approach in the prevention and management of CD where patients are able to enjoy foods that contain gluten through population of the gut with engineered therapeutic cells. The cells will be able to: 1) Degrade gliadin, a peptide in gluten that elicits an inflammatory response 2) Sequester gliadin by binding it to the surface of the therapeutic cells 3) Sequester zonulin, a hormone responsible for enhancing inflammation.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"
523,"b'Antigen density on tumor cells surface is heterogeneous, which constrains current solid tumor immunotherapy to target only highly expressed tumor associated antigens (TAAs). We designed an antigen density targeting immunotherapy platform, SwordS (SynNotch-Stripe system), that is capable of generating non-monotonic therapeutic responses. To demonstrate the concept, we took advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common malignant tumors and a leading cause of cancer-related death in China, as a potential target of disease treatment by SwordS. In combination with HCC associated antigen responding SynNotch, our genetically engineered cells would generate an antigen density-dependent, triple HCC therapeutic response patterns. Our approach is aimed to reduce the on-target/off-tumor effects and greatly expand the diversification and combined potency of tumor therapy.

As a proof-of-principle, we are employing this strategy to build a cell-type classifier for colorectal cancer cells inducing fluorescence and/or triggering apoptosis. Simultaneously, in order to design a multi-pronged treatment approach for colorectal neoplasia, we are engineering a novel anti-cancer E.coli agent, facilitating selective adhesion and cell density-dependent invasion into cancer cells, as the delivery module for our classifier circuit.

We propose a novel therapeutic using a bacterial vector that expresses acyl-homoserine lactone C12, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa signalling molecule known to induce cancer cell apoptosis through a Bcl-2 independent pathway. Upon detection of hypoxia and low pH, known tumour microenvironment markers, C12 will be released by the bacteria containing our genetically engineered circuit to act as: (1) a cytotoxic agent that induces cancer cell death, and (2) a signalling molecule that coordinates actions between bacterial colonies. Furthermore, the quorum sensing properties of C12 have been manipulated to activate a kill mechanism that arrests bacterial growth upon destruction of the tumour and the ensuing loss of its microenvironment. Thus, we propose constructing a genetic circuit that not only removes tumours, but also self-regulates itself to mitigate the risk of bacterial infection in the absence of cancerous cells.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

The siRNA will function to bring out the apoptosis of fat tissue. Our validation experiments will be carried out at the level of cells and animals (mice) to prove both the targeting and function of siRNA.

In 2014, the World Health Organization classified antibiotic resistance as a global epidemic. Inactivating resistance genes via Cas9 nuclease-mediated cleavage has been shown to be an effective means of combating this epidemic; however, methods of in vivo delivery are currently limited. Our team aims to deliver Cas9 to antibiotic-resistant, pathogenic bacteria through submicron bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as a companion re-sensitization therapeutic to antibiotic treatment. OMVs are naturally produced by all Gram-negative bacteria and are used for crosstalk, stress responses, and nutrient acquisition.

These phages should be capable of infecting the target bacteria in our coupled chemostat system. We have created a cheap, fast and simple system as well as a mathematical model for understanding its regulation.

As proof-of-concept we evaluated the ability of engineered E. coli to degrade benzene via gas chromatography and measured improvements in the benzene tolerance of engineered strains. We also demonstrated that nebulizers can efficiently deliver BREaTHER into the lungs. To define the conditions under which BREaTHER is safe and effective, we developed a mathematical model.

In our project, gene edition will be incorporated with immunotherapy to eradicate the immune escape occurred in NSCLC. By constructing plasmid with Crispr-Cas 9 system targeting the gene coding for PD-L1, the expression of PD-L1 will be inhibited to restore immune system supervision.

First, we identified a dsRNA-binding chaperone, Hfq, which acts to stabilize the sRNA-mRNA duplex in order to recruit RNase III to degrade the dsRNA. We then designed complimentary sRNAs for each mRNA target and tested the affinity of Hfq to our custom designed (AU)7A binding region on the sRNAs using a fluorescence polarization assay.

If a microorganism were engineered to respond to an ionic change, the respiratory microbiome could detect and respond to an environmental toxicant exposure in real-time. Our project will demonstrate a cation responsive genetic sensor by regulating expression of GFP using the sodium responsive transcriptional regulator, NhaR. We will use the ionophore monensin, known to create a change in Na+ equilibrium across the cell membrane, as a proxy to imitate an ionic response within a biofilm.

We genetically engineer Lactococcus lactis (Grenadier Guards) to closely detect the presence of S. aureus and throw AMPs (grenades) to eradicate them within a short time after infection. The mechanism includes utilizing the S. aureuss own quorum sensing system as a sensor, or using the cells osmoregulatory system to control the expression of the AMP genes in tandem repeats, which can produce a relatively high quantity level, subsequently Lactococcus lactis will undergo autolysis controlled by a toggle switch to release AMPs to attack S. aureus, thus relieving the symptoms.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

Tremendous progress has been made in understanding the role of the immune system in driving the development of cancers, including CRC. As sensors of cell death and tissue remodeling, Toll like receptors(TLRs) may have a universal role in cancer. There are different TLRs that respond to a variety of Pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide . The evidence of existence of relevance between bacterial microbiota and carcinogenesis is increasing. its suggested that microRNAs act as ligands of TLRs playing a role in epigenetic immune modulation.

However, no efficient treatment exists. The BGU-IGEM team aims to develop a system that will ultimately prolong survival of ALS patients by targeting microglia and reactive astrocytes, which are both non-neuronal cells that directly contribute to motor neuronal damage. Our approach is based on: (1) inhibition of toxic pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion in microglia cells and (2) on promoting intrinsic apoptotic signal in reactive astrocytes and preventing their toxic effect on motor neurons. Using modified genome editing technique, we build a system that specifically target toxic astrocytes and prevent the formation of new ones which hopefully will slow down the progression of the disease. As the reactivity of microglia and astrocytes is a common in neurodegenerative diseases, our novel approach could be expanded to other neurodegenerative diseases.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

550,"b'The goal of our team is to develop a sensitive system to specifically kill liver cancer cells via genetic circuits, by using the combination of liver cancer-specific promoters and miRNAs. The expression of Gal4-VP16 fusion protein was under the control of liver cancer cells-specific AFP, hTERT or ZEB1-AS1 promoters. The Gal4-VP16 in turn drives the HSV-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) expression by binding to nine tandem UAS elements in the promoter. Furthermore, the expression of Gal80, a Gal4 inhibitor, is controlled under a CMV promoter as well as a cluster of miRNA93/miRNA-362-5p/miRNA-221 binding sites at the 3-end. As miRNA93/miRNA-362-5p/miRNA-221 are liver cancer cells-specific miRNAs, the expression of Gal80 is significantly suppressed in the liver cancer cells compared with normal cells. As a result, the nontoxic ganciclovir is converted by HSV-TK to a cell-killing drug in the liver cancer cells, but not normal cells.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

Recent studies have demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of GasderminD protein accounts for pyroptosis of the host cell, which may be exploited for tumor suppression. In our project, we redesign Salmonella to act as a delivery vehicle that can target tumor cells and replicate in their cytoplasm. By inducing the bacterial expression of the N-terminal domain of GasderminD, bacteria are led to lysis and release this protein into the cytoplasm of tumor cell and then induce pyroptosis to the tumor cell by making membrane pores. The lysate of cell rupture during pyroptosis destroys the tumor microenvironment and attracts immune cells into tumor bed to kill tumor cells.

An engineered phage with high affinity for phosphoethanolamine, the molecule that confers colistin resistance, has been developed as a proof-of-concept. This system has potential applications in drug delivery, ligand extraction and study of bacterial membrane proteins. We are also building a phage mediated immune recruitment system that ensures removal of the pathogen without significant toxin release - a fatal condition in immuno-compromised individuals.

A bilateral switch is put in control of the pathways, conferring the microbe an exquisite trait to express either pathway at an optimal time according to the changing chemical environment inside digestive track.

620,"b'exoCar is designed to apply mRNA-contained exosomes to alleviate the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases, since the early treatments are limited due to the difficulty in diagnosis of specific clinical subgroups. At the early stage of neurodegenerative disease, the overstimulation-led neuronal injury, or excitatoxicity has an high risk to induce degeneration of neurons. In the extracellular matrix of CNS, the uncontrolled over-high concentration of glutamate, as a primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter, is common in the cases of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, we chose an mRNA which codes the glutamate transporter that generally expressed on the surface of mammals glial cells, the Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2 (EAAT2), to be enclosed in exosomes, which are designed to carry the therapeutic cargo to pass the BBB. The EAAT2 will be translated in the glial cells, and increase the efficiency of glutamate clearance as a useful method in the early treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

A key component of biofilm formation in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharides Pel and Psl, which are involved in the formation and maintenance of the structural biofilm scaffold and protection against antimicrobials and host defenses. So, we used synthetic biology methods to overexpress the hydrolyzing enzyme that decomposes the corresponding extracelluar polysaccharide in engineering bacteria to destroy the wild type P. aeruginosa biofilm. Since the extracellular polysaccharide hydrolase is an instracellular enzyme and can't be secreted into the extracellular environment, this project designed two protocols to induce the engineering bacteria to cleave, thereby releasing the extracellular polysaccharide hydroalase into the extracellular environment and destroying the wild biofilm. We hope to solve problems of antibiotic resistance caused by biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa in clinical treatment , and provide a new idea for eradication of chronic bacteria infection.""","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

This season, we focused on designing a novel immunotherapeutic approach involving DNA-launched RNA Replicons (DREP). We utilized our hotspot detection tool, Custommune, to generate a list of candidate neo-epitopes from clinically prioritized neoantigens thus reducing the need for extensive sequencing approaches. After in silico validation of our generated neo-epitope predictions, we devised a DREP-based platform to effectively deliver our multi-neo-epitope vaccine. The platform utilizes the inherent self-amplification ability of RNA-replicons to ensure enhanced neo-antigen uptake and presentation leading to the mounting of efficient cellular and humoral immune responses against TNBC. Embedded with optimized subgenomic regulation and linker-peptides alongside glycine-alanine repeats (GAr), a miRNA-based immune evasion mechanism and an OFF-switch, our platform is predicted to be highly safe and efficient through experimentally-driven mathematical simulations.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

In this phase-I project, we propose a SynBio-based therapeutic solution for COVID-19. Our approach consists of a SARS-CoV-2-like particle that is capable of targeting cells expressing the ACE2 receptor. Upon delivery, our sensing moiety (Toehold Riboswitch adjusted for mammalian systems) is constitutively expressed. If SARS-CoV-2 triggers are present within the cell, the sensor will unfold initiating a GAL4-VP16-dependent interference pathway. Consequently, we designed two de novo siRNAs that play a critical role in our antiviral therapeutic approach. They inhibit viral replication via RISC-mediated degradation of the replicase region of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We also created a deterministic model to predict the levels of siRNAs as well as a structural model to predict the thermodynamic stability of our toehold riboswitches.

658,"b'Depression is a common but serious mood disorder. Although there are treatments for depression, the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication and the decline of treatments from patients can be problematic. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), as an important inhibitory neurotransmitter, has been shown to play a significant role in the regulation of mood disorders. Studies show that in healthy individuals, GABA-producing pathways are actively expressed in human gut microbiota. Based on these findings, we aim to engineer a dynamically controlled gut bacteria which can synthesize GABA to alleviate depression. We engineer a strain of E. coli to contain an optogenetic switch. When the switch is on, GadB (enzyme) and X174E (lysis protein) can be made. GadB can catalyze the conversion of glutamate (which is abundant in foods) into GABA inside the cell. After the GABA concentration reaches a threshold, X174E can lyse the cell and release GABA into the environment.'","['Health & Medicine', 'Therapeutics']"

Osteoarthritis is characterized by an intense inflammation cycle, in which chondrocytes produce certain proteins that cause cartilage degradation. Our approach aims to halt this inflammatory cycle by inserting specifically transfected cells in the osteoarthritic joint. The cells produce synthetically designed exosomes that contain miRNA-140. miRNA-140 has been shown to inhibit the expression of certain cartilage destructive proteins and promote the expression of regenerative agents. The exosomes are also designed to carry a Chondrocyte Affinity Peptide (CAP) in their membrane which guides them to deliver their cargo specifically towards chondrocytes.

662,"b""Osteogenesis imperfecta is a group of genetic disorders that results in brittle bones due to improper collagen formation. In osteoblasts of OI patients, the Wnt signalling pathway is inhibited by sclerostin via binding to LRP5/6 co-receptors, thus lowering beta-catenin concentrations, gene expression and thus bone formation. Suppressing sclerostin by a sclerostin antibody has been shown to enhance bone mass and bone strength. However, in phase III clinical trials, the antibody also imposes severe cardiac ischemic events and worsen cardiovascular diseases in OI patients. Ostamer, our therapeutic aptamer, tackles this development via selectively binding and inhibiting loop3 of sclerostin in order to prevent sclerostin from binding to the osteoblast receptors for treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta, as well as to preserve sclerostin's secondary role as a cardiovascular regulator.

We applied gibson assembly and restriction enzyme cloning to attempt to insert our inhibitor genes into an L. reuteri expression vector. However, most likely due to our chosen selection marker, transformations were unsuccessful. During the last weeks, we successfully inserted one construct into pET11a, yet with an inconclusive expression assay.

In order to offer a security system, we have designed a stratagem and a series of tools to posses the ability to hack the genetic composition of GMOs, either to ""reset"" the genetic programmation back to wild-type or to modify it for a different one if an ""update"" is required. To achieve this, we integrated a DNA delivery system that works in situ and a sequence-specific DNA digestion system that works in vivo. The main advantage our work provides against suicide switches, a different type of security system for GMOs, is that our technology does not trigger a ""shut down"" to the target organism.

However, cellular communities often need to resolve this variation to respond in a concerted and robust way. Our project seeks to understand complex intercellular interactions underlying specific community phenotypes by engineering communication motifs with the goal of reaching a community behavior to either converge or diverge in response. To do this, we have engineered novel sense-and-secrete circuits into yeast. To model community signaling, we repurposed endogenous yeast mating factor alpha(MF) as an extracellular signal. Our designed circuit outputs initial individual responses to stimuli as GFP signal and, after signaling through secreted MF, a downstream community-coordinated response is reported as RFP signal. By tuning parameters like positive and negative feedback strength and MF-sensitivity, we hope to develop a circuit capable of analyzing cellular community interactions.'",['Information Processing']

Such memory devices include a cellular counter; a fundamental device which memorizes the number of induction events. Recent efforts have resulted in a cellular counter that can count up to three events. However, this counter cannot be reset to its initial state. Here, we propose a resettable cellular counter called sigma recounter. This counter utilizes the regulation system of sigma factor and anti-sigma factor as the key of its resetting mechanism. In this system a set of sigma factors are designed to update and maintain a count that responds to each inducted event. By the other stimulus, the system initiates a genetic circuit that can express a suitable set of anti-sigma factors and erases the existing memory, which will enable our device to restart the count from any state.'",['Information Processing']

703,"b'Engineering transcriptional logic gates to program cellular behavior remains an important challenge for synthetic biology. Currently, genetic circuits reproducing digital logic are limited in scalability and robustness by output discrepancies and crosstalk between transcriptional pathways. We propose to address these issues using RNA-guided dCas9 fused to a transcription activation domain as a programmable transcription factor. Fusion dCas9 targeted upstream of the transcription starting site (TSS) recruits RNA polymerase. Yet, dCas9 may also sterically hinder transcription initiation if bound too close to the TSS. The guide RNA acts as a biological wire: it determines dCas9s binding site and enables specific regulation of homogenous synthetic promoters. Exploiting these properties we aim to build biocompatible transistor-like elements whose assembly may allow for the creation of chainable and parallelizable bio-logic gates.

Developed by Dr. Farzadfard and Dr. Lu at MIT, SCRIBE is a modular device that can be engineered to produce single-stranded DNA in vivo in response to transcriptional signals. Furthermore, a recombinase is coexpressed in order to introduce precise mutations across a population of cells, which accumulate as a function of the magnitude and duration of these signals, thereby creating a long-term and stable system for analog cellular recording.

A challenge is that it is more beneficial for cells to use their resources exclusively for growth, resulting in a loss of production ability. Therefore, we have developed Forbidden FRUITS, a pipeline that can solve this problem by calculating and optimizing engineering strategies to couple a product forming pathway to microbial growth. Multiple databases, constraint-based programming and gene-protein-reaction associations are used to devise suitable strategies. These strategies are then optimized using pathfinding methods and sequence optimization. As proof-of-principle, we applied Forbidden FRUITS to salicylic acid, lactate and mannitol production in Synechocystis PCC6803, lactate in Synechococcus UTEX 2973 and salicylic acid in Escherichia Coli. Forbidden FRUITS is shown to be flexible and allow for the fast development of stable production strains, making the full-potential of biotechnology evermore attainable.'",['Information Processing']

We used it to generate several entangled genes encoding reporter and antibiotic resistance proteins. We cloned the sequence encoding GFP and KNT. Since the cloned entangled genes lost functionality, we improved CAMEOS to generate sequences preserving conserved amino acids and to choose the best overlap. We have written comprehensive tutorials on utilizing CAMEOS. The improved software generated sequences that are currently tested by a research team optimizing lipid synthesis in yeast.

785,"b'Advances in synthetic biology, including cellular agriculture, enable the sustainable production of food on Earth. However, in-space biomanufacturing, for which maintaining cultures in bioreactors for extended periods is essential, has proved challenging. Microgravity induces global changes in gene expression profiles, triggering stress responses in cells. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibits stress responses characterized by aberrant cell polarity, budding, and separation, which affects cell growth and productivity in space. There is also a lack of bioinformatics tools for microgravity researchers. To fill this gap, we developed AstroBio, an open-source database compiling literature findings on microgravity-induced gene expression changes in different model organisms. The database informs our development of AstroYeast, yeast strains that are resistant to microgravity-induced stress. This will be done in a high-throughput manner either by strain adaptive evolution, or genome-wide overexpression and knockdown screens. AstroYeasts can be used to sustainably and renewably produce nutrients in space under microgravity conditions.'",['Software']

Previous researchers have developed biological methods of heavy metal sequestration utilizing heavy metal transport proteins and metallothioneins, a class of low-molecular weight proteins with high binding affinities for heavy metals. In these genetically engineered systems, the transport proteins will preferentially transport a specific heavy metal into the cell and the metallothionein will aggressively bind--driving flux into the cell and sequestering the toxic metal. Our research aims to modularize previous sequestration systems for nickel and mercury utilizing a yeast metallothionein/glutathione-s-transferase fusion protein as well the transport proteins NixA (nickel transporter) and merT/merP (mercury transporter). We also plan to extend this sequestration system using a putative lead transport protein.'",['Environment']

The work presented here has profound implications for future studies of synthetic biology and might help to solve the problems of desertification. We are planning to use Klebsiella oxytoca and type of free nitrogen bacteria to settle the environment that plants could live.

In this line of thinking we are driven to design a bioremediation tool to decrease the marine pollution and protect aquatic ecosystems. We aim at tackling elements of the main pollutant families by focusing on 5 toxic agents: Polychlorinated Biphenyls, nitrite, phenol, lead and cadmium. The bioremediation tool will be based on Pseudovibrio denitrificans, a bacterium living in symbiosis with Spongia officinalis. Our goal is to engineer the bacterium to detect, signal and degrade/capture pollutants and to bring it as new chassis in the iGEM competition. The projects originality lies on the duo formed by Pseudovibrio denitrificans and its symbiotic sponge.

Our second aim is to study some of the most commonly used regulators found in the iGEM Registry to assess how reliable they are, by combining them in different contexts. The reliability of such parts is essential when optimizing biological systems.

When this happens, antibiotics can enter the water table. This selective pressure causes organisms in the water to adapt and become resistant to the antibiotics. Reducing the amount of antibiotics in the water supply will help to reduce this selective pressure.

866,"b'Mercury (Hg) is a widely used metal in mining and industrial processes. Its easily spread in the environment and is considered a global pollutant, even reaching environments which have never been exposed to it. Among the contaminant metals, Hg is one of the most toxic and the only one able to undergo bio-magnification in most food chains. Besides, being the only known metal that causes human death through ingestion of contaminated aquatic organisms. To solve this problem, we used a bacterial mechanism of mercury resistance - operon mer - as inspiration. Mer operon is composed mainly by MerR, MerT, MerP and MerA proteins responsible for transport and reduction of mercury, being up regulated in its presence. Our project aims to develop contaminated waters treatment using mer proteins for bioremediation, attach a fluorescent protein for bio-detection and metallothionein for bioaccumulation in order to reduce damage caused by mercury in the ecosystem.'",['Environment']
867,"b'The population of Crasseoterra virginica, the Eastern oyster, is a fraction of what it once was. A major reason for this decline is the spread of Perkinsus marinus, a protist that infests oyster cells, causing tissue damage and eventual oyster death. P. marinus infection requires recognition of a four-domain galectin protein, CvGal1, produced by oyster hemocytes to capture bacteria by binding surface sugars. P. marinus targets CvGal1 using unknown carbohydrate ligands on the protest surface. As a first step in generating a bacterial biosensor for P. marinus, a recombinant OmpA-CvGal1 protein was engineered to anchor on the E. coli outer cell membrane. OmpA fusions with mammalian two-domain galectins were similarly engineered to investigate the effect of galectin size on the efficiency of membrane display and pathogen recognition. The receptor was designed to couple to a defensive response, such as the production of anchored beta-galactosidase to cleave P. marinus recognition ligands.'",['Environment']

Our project design is centered on the creation of BioBricks that facilitate the formation of an E.coli biofilm that captures and degrades nylon microplastics. Biofilm formation is achieved through the overexpression of the transcriptional regulator NhaR, which increases the production of poly-beta-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PGA). This exopolysaccharide creates a stable biofilm capable of adhering microplastics. Microplastics are then degraded by manganese peroxidase and nylon hydrolase that are secreted by the biofilm. Using these modified E. coli, our team designed a biofilter to effectively remove the threat of microplastics from water supplies.'",['Environment']

To keep up with our population growth, farmers are more dependent on inorganic fertilizers (which can be expensive, inaccessible, and harmful) to enrich the soil and increase yield. If only we could engineer crops to fix nitrogen! Endosymbiotic theory states that chloroplasts in plants originally came from a symbiotic relationship between prokaryotes. A certain cyanobacterium, Cyanothece sp. 51142, can photosynthesize and fix nitrogen within the same cell. Another photosynthetic cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. 6803, has light activated proteins. Our project is to study the systems in a simpler environment by expressing nitrogen-fixing genes in E. coli, and to work on a light repressed system for gene expression, because the nitrogenase enzyme is poisoned by oxygen, a product of photosynthesis.'",['Environment']

Arsenic has also been known to lead to heart disease, stroke, cancer, and eventually death. A reliable biosensor would allow these areas to observe arsenic contamination. This inspired the WHHS iGEM to design a project similar and just as effective, yet with our own spin. Instead of pH, a pigment output would also be a viable method.

And the Street Cleaner System could change formaldehyde into water and carbon dioxide through several reactions with the help of specific enzymes. The Lysis System can help to split E.coli and release the enzymes into the reaction mixture, in which way it enhances the function of the Street Cleaner System.

The University of York iGEM team has developed a new approach to remove cadmium and sulfates from wastewater using genetically engineered Escherichia coli. Our circuit is activated by a cadmium inducible promoter and is divided into two interconnected mechanisms: (i)increasing sulphate uptake and its targeting into cysteine production by engineering the cysteine biosynthesis pathway; (ii) increasing cadmium uptake and targeting of the free-cysteine into metal binding proteins (phytochelatins) for metal chelation/stabilization inside and outside cell.'",['Environment']

In view of these alarming facts, we have decided to create a new environmentally-friendly way to clean our streets.   Our project is to create an E.coli strain that produces enzymes , which can degrade rubber polymers.

It consists of a surface made up of cellulose, which acts as a biocompatible carrier, to which bacterial flagella will be immobilized via a cellulose-binding domain. The single flagellum subunits, also known as flagellin, will be interlinked with plastic degrading enzymes. Using flagella as a scaffold for enzymes has two major advantages. Firstly, it enables the creation of a three-dimensional reactive nanostructure that has an increased specific surface with highly catalytic activity. Secondly, flagella may consist of various different active sites, which will enable the combination of multiple enzymatic steps in close proximity.'",['Environment']

The fluorescence signal is detected via smartphone. With these novel biosensor designs we tackle the problem of date rape drug intoxications, which is of increasing relevance in our area, by detecting a common ingredient. Another major problem is the contamination of water with heavy metals. Heavy metal sensors designed by previous iGEM teams as well as new biosensors are combined to a modular cell-free test strip for simultaneous detection.

For degradation of vulcanized rubber, the project includes a pre-treatment using Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, a bacterium that naturally devulcanizes rubber. Both of these processes will be scaled up in bioreactors. The major resulting compound of the designed process is ODTD (12-oxo-4,8-dimethyl-trideca-4,8-diene-1-al), a triisoprene unit that we are working to transform in fuel, a product of high commercial interest.

Our project aims to engineer Gilliamella to metabolize imidacloprid, a common neonicotinoid, into harmless organic compounds using three cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP6CM1vQ, CYP6G1, and HUMCYPDB1. Though 6-CNA, the breakdown product of imidacloprid, displays significantly lower toxicity, it still induces sublethal effects. As such, we have also incorporated a pre-existing 6-CNA degradation pathway from Pseudomonas putida for complete breakdown of imidacloprid. We believe honeybees that harbour this engineered bacterium in probiotic form will become less susceptible to common field doses of imidacloprid; thus, significantly reducing the risk of CCD.'",['Environment']

Naphthalene detection and output signal amplification can be achieved using the Lux promoter and the Bxb1 integrase. Our biosensor uses a naphthalene induced promoter located upstream of the BxB1 integrase. Once expressed, Bxb1 acts on a logic gate to express RFP.

We wanted to help both local farmers and farmers in other countries, especially third-world ones, who have found their crops tainted by heavy metals such as cadmium, arsenic, and lead. In 2013, we read reports showing that areas surrounding Duke Energy's Buck Steam Station are affected by coal ash containing cadmium, in a region fairly close to home for our team. We decided to focus primarily on our cadmium detector, especially after learning that water affected by the cadmium containing coal ash becomes hazardous and can potentially cause health issues ranging from kidney damage to death. Our detector creates green fluorescence while in the presence of cadmium. After building the first version of our detector, we worked to increase its sensitivity, allowing it to respond to much lower levels of cadmium, at an amount where the knowledge could be useful and not redundant due to the deaths already caused by the cadmium. Last year, we added the 2007 Cambridge team's sensitivity tuners to the detector. After seeing indications of a peak at lower levels of cadmium than we had previously, we began to use test points that were closer together and discovered a peak of fluorescence. This year we built and tested an alternate version of our previous detector.""",['Environment']

The system consists in both a physical confinement which still allows the GEO to carry out its main function, and a temperature-based containment which ensures the survival of the organism in a restricted temperature range. Escherichia coli was chosen to implement the temperature based system due to its wide use in the iGEM projects.

Because trehalose is a major termite blood sugar and trehalase is essential for trehalose metabolism, G3DH essentially converts trehalose into an insecticide. The pseudo-egg delivery system takes advantage of a habit termites have of carrying their eggs to their nests and licking them. Termites recognize their eggs by sensing -glucosidase and lysozyme, which act as egg-recognition pheromones. The pseudo eggs, containing both termite egg-recognition molecules and engineered E. coli, will be delivered to their nests and then licked by the termites present, thus allowing the G3DH produced by the E. coli to convert trehalose into insecticide inside the termite bodies.

We solved this predicament by using one of the smaller PAHs as an indicator to degrade the heavier PAHs. The degradation of this small PAH inside the cell relieves repression of genes under the control of the NahR/Psal promoter system.

We have cloned genes coding insecticidal toxic proteins from Photorhabdus luminescens TT01, a bacteria poisonous to numerous insects, and express them in E.coli. We enhance the production of Avermectin in S.A. Then, we prepared cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) , and generated the nanofibrous microspheres (NCM) self-assembled from CNC as bacteria carriers, in order to reduce the loss, improve transport efficiency, and target the carrying to aimed location and preventing bacteria from releasing into the environment. Finally, a series of simulation experiments have been conducted. They can help us to understand the cellulase, and confirm the terminator are efficient.

907,"b'Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are an annual problem in many water systems. During the summer, the bacteria release hepatotoxins called microcystins (MCs) which pose health risks to humans and animals. The goal of our project is to build a two-part system to detect and then degrade MCs. Our detection system is based on the natural oxidative stress response of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Exposure to MCs is linked to higher levels of oxidative stress, and we will couple this response to the expression of yellow fluorescent protein. Thus, fluorescence levels will indicate the amount of MCs present in a sample. To understand and validate our MC detection mechanism, we will also create mathematical and molecular models. For degrading the detected toxins, we will express and purify the enzyme microcystinase (MlrA), which is naturally found in some gram-negative bacteria. The enzyme renders the MCs harmless by modifying their structure.'",['Environment']

910,"b'Current methods of chemical synthesis from petroleum have led to great environmental disruption and continue to be a strong contributor to the emission of carbon dioxide. To overcome this problem, biosynthesis is the most viable alternative. The main drawback of biosynthesis is the high price of raw material, comprising over 60% of the production cost. Our solution for this complex problem is to create a self-sustaining co-culture of microorganisms that produces its own raw material, using light and carbon dioxide. Cyanobacteria provide the carbon source for the production organism, which in exchange produces an essential amino acid for the cyanobacteria while creating the desired product. By making several species compatible with this synthetic symbiosis, the platform will allow efficient conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide into products in an environmentally friendly and sustainable way.'",['Environment']

In Nova Scotia, softwood waste from the lumber industry is an untapped source for low-cost biofuel feedstock; however, this waste cannot be utilized by traditional biofuel processes due to toxic compounds such as turpentines and unavailable carbon compounds such as cellulose. The porcupine microbiome provides a unique solution as it is capable of digesting bark and toxic products. Working with Schubenacadie Wildlife Park, we aim to not only identify cellulose and/or turpentine-degrading bacteria in the porcupine microbiome, but to also characterize microbial communities found within the Parks mammal population. To achieve these goals, we are using fecal samples to construct a DNA library of the porcupine and to analyze each mammals microbial rRNA.

Resistance can spread from non-harmful strains of bacteria to potentially dangerous ones if these bacteria escape the laboratory. This year our team continued work on a passive killswitch for E. coli K12. The goal is to prevent environmental contamination by programming a death response in the absence of arabinose. After researching toxins for E. coli K12, we selected colicin E7, which E.coli produce to eliminate competition between species. Colicin E7 is FDA approved as harmless to Eukaryotic cells. The tetracyclin repressor protein is produced using an arabinose inducible promoter and the colicin gene is behind a tetracyclin repressible promoter. If the level of arabinose falls, as would happen in an accidental release, the Tet repressor will not prevent colicin production and consequently destroy the bacteria.'",['Environment']

Terephthalic acid, a byproduct of PET degradation, is then processed in a microbial fuel cell by Delftia tsuruhatensis to generate electricity.

This biosensor relies on bioluminescence, a biochemical phenomenon that is commonly used in cell imaging. We are trying to develop a new application for bioluminescence that should allow us to create a biosensor of a new kind, entirely different from the existing devices.

Current methods including physical-chemical remediation, phytoremediation and others are limited to deal with heavy metal pollution. We proposed a new approach named gut remediation to reduce bioaccumulated heavy metals in fish by gut microbiota. We designed a polypeptide which can bind to heavy metals including mercury and copper. Then a novel gene Metal Catcher was designed based on the polypeptide with GFP and N-terminal region of INP. Subsequent display of Metal Catcher on the E. coli surface showed highly sensitivity and selectivity of copper, mercury and cadmium, and permitted selective adsorption of copper, mercury. Then, we fed cyprinoid fish with the transformant strains. Result showed that experiment group have lower accumulation of heavy metals compared to the control.

Previous research has attempted to modify algae to promote the lipid synthesis thereby optimizing them for biofuel production. In this project we want to create new Biobricks consisting of inducible promoters to couple with a CRISPR/Cas9-system in C. reinhardtii. The reason for the inducible promoters is to avoid complications such as toxicity of a constitutively active Cas9.

946,"b'The bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis was discovered in 2016 by Japanese researchers from the Kyoto Institute of Technology. It is able to degrade PET - a common consumer plastic - into terephthalic acid, which poses no threat to our environment. We aim to isolate the two enzymes within Ideonella sakaiensis that undertake this reaction, PETase and MHETase, and express them in Escherichia coli. PETase first breaks down PET into methyl-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate or MHET. MHETase then converts MHET into terephthalic acid. The two enzymes will be assayed for activity, after which we shall analyse them using Cryo Electron Microscopy to produce a 3D structure with a point resolution of 0.27 nm. We then aim to secrete these enzymes into the periplasm of the bacterium using the OmpA secretion system within E. coli. This will be achieved by fusing a leader sequence to the two enzymes from the OmpA gene.'",['Environment']

Eventually, a reverse API gallery system could be set up with multiple factors detection using our Bee subtilis.""",['Environment']

Biofilms are excellent catalysts of biotechnological processes, as they are more efficient, robust and resistant than bacteria in suspension. Glycerol is a byproduct from the biodiesel industry that has become a preferred substrate for industrial fermentations. The purpose of this project is to generate a platform P. putida strain to catalyze biofilm-based conversion of glycerol to interesting end-products. To this end, we intend to genetically manipulate P. putida to incorporate a synthetic genetic switch that will allow us to reprogram bacteria either to induce robust biofilm formation appropriate for biocatalysis, or biofilm dispersal to allow easy recycling of the substrate materials of the reactor.

949,"b'Synthetic biologists struggle to prevent the proliferation of genetically engineered organisms (GEOs) in natural systems. Containment methods that operate in ecological settings must provide security comparable to physical containment. Current methods fail to effectively inhibit horizontal gene transfer and environmental supplementation, and impose evolutionary pressure through the propagation of spontaneous revertants. Synthetic Translational Control (STC) currently utilizes a redesigned leucyl-tRNA synthetase and cleavage enzyme in an E. coli chassis to confer metabolic dependence on a synthetically modified leucine capable of conversion to L-leucine. Due to the semi-semantic property of this device, organisms cannot metabolically bypass our constraints using environmental supplementation and will display greater resistance to evolutionary escape relative to traditional synthetic auxotrophs. Our work provides advancement in biosafety by isolating GEOs from the environment via a reliance on modified metabolites. STC will become a benchmark for biocontainment devices and will allow for countless new applications in synthetic biology.'",['Environment']
950,"b'The Nitrogen Project, of which this iGEM team is a part, seeks to drastically reduce the quantity of nitrogen-based fertilizers used in agriculture. Soluble nitrates can runoff into water systems with environmental consequences such as algal blooms and human illnesses like methemoglobinemia. If nitrogenase, the enzyme in soil bacteria that fixes nitrogen gas into usable nitrates, can be inserted into plants, it would eliminate the need for artificial fertilization. Before this can be done, nitrogenase must first be expressed non-diazotrophic bacteria like E. coli. For proper expression, however, E. coli must have an excess of intracellular ATP and reduced electron donors. We worked to overexpress glycolytic kinases to increase ATP production and overexpress native and foreign electron donors to produce more reduced electron donors. Besides nitrogenase, however, the intracellular environment of our super cells may help produce other recombinant proteins.'",['Environment']

Some of this decline is due to Serratia marcescens, a gram-negative bacterium that contributes to the loss of Acropora palmata (Caribbean Elkhorn coral). Bacteriophage therapy, the focus of WLC-Milwaukee, is not a recent innovation but it could be the key to stopping the decline of coral reefs from this pathogen. Building on methods and research conducted by the 2015 WLC-Milwaukee iGEM team, we conducted screens to find bacteriophages that destroy or incapacitate this and other waterborne pathogens using a specific bacterial protein, TolC. Using Escherichia coli as a surrogate to express Serratia proteins, we can isolate Serratia-specific phages using a simple lab strain of E. coli.

This will be achieved by upregulation of native (vacuolar) ion importers and knock-out of ion exporters. Furthermore, we are expressing heterologous genes from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in yeast to improve vacuolar ion accumulation, thus creating a microbial dustbin.

In the presence of free gold, the two parts will be in close proximity and thus an energy transfer can take place between the donor and acceptor proteins and the red protein will be excited giving off a fluorescent signal. Using calibration experiments we can relate the amount of fluorescence to the amount the gold present, and liberated by the organism from the ore.'",['Environment']

Produced predominantly by car emissions, NOx causes significant morbidity and mortality; it exacerbates lung disease and in Bristol alone kills 300 people per year (8.5% of deaths). NOx is also the third most detrimental greenhouse gas. We aim to engineer E. coli to metabolise NOx using the cytochrome c nitrite reductase (NrfA), which reduces nitrite (NO2-) to ammonia, and the Nap periplasmic nitrate reductase to convert nitrate (NO3-) to nitrite. As NOx dissolves to form both nitrite and nitrate, the use of Nap will improve efficiency. The ammonia produced could be used to make fertiliser, or electricity if incorporated into a microbial fuel cell. An agent-based bacterial model will be adapted to predict system efficiency and behaviour.

Infection with this bacteria causes bizarre growths and tumors on plants that repurpose the plant cell to reallocate its nutrients to the bacterial cell, causing plant death and agricultural loss. In Agrobacterium, the ability to infect a plant is contained in a tumour inducing plasmid which can spread through conjugation between cells. Here we have constructed aGROW, a strain of Agrobacterium capable of disarming pathogenic Agrobacterium and remediating infected soil. We have armed aGROW with a stable plasmid carrying a CRISPR/Cas9 system programmed to remove a key virulence region of the tumour inducing plasmid. Our plasmid employs a separate conjugation system to carry itself through a population of Agrobacterium, preventing them from becoming virulent.

The identification of dangerous arsenic concentrations in groundwater and soil is important because arsenic poses a serious health risk to living organisms. Unfortunately, arsenic testing is expensive, time consuming, and requires sophisticated equipment. This is especially relevant to soldiers deployed to resource-scarce, field environments. Our team is using synthetic biology to develop a more affordable, portable, and accessible means of testing. We designed a plasmid that uses ArsR, a negative transcriptional repressor, to regulate the expression of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).

SRB require high salt and low oxygen so first we plan to genetically engineer a strain of bacteria that would report the osmolarity in oil pipelines, thus act as a biosensor for salt concentrations. The ratio of salinity in the seawater flowing in versus the seawater flowing out of the well will be used to estimate SRB populations in the pipelines, thus limiting the amount of biocides added in times of high Microbial counts.

Because the primary diet of porcupines is lignified plant material, we reasoned that the porcupine microbiome would be filled with enzymes required to degrade lignocellulose. Using in silico metagenomic analysis, we mined the porcupine microbiome to identify, synthesize and characterize microbial enzymes required for cellulose and hemi-cellulose degradation. Using an orthogonal approach, we created a metagenomic library in E. coli from the porcupine microbiome, to be screened for the ability to grow on lignocellulose, or other pathway intermediates, as a sole carbon source.

The first approach requires using copious amounts of water, which is not abundantly available in many parts of the world, while the second is not cost-effective. Finally, spraying air fresheners is not a solution, as it does not get rid of ammonia. We propose to engineer Escherichia coli to assimilate ammonia and convert it into indigoidine, a blue colored compound.

We separated oil degradation bacteria from areas contaminated by oil, then we confirmed this bacteria is Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain by measuring its 16S rRNA and named it DN1. For oil degradation is an alternative metabolic pathway in bacteria, there is a manipulator for oil degradation gene, such as GntR. It codes GntR protein, which can bind with promoter on upstream of alkB2. When alkane exists, GntR will unbind with the promoter, and the RFP gene we added on downstream will express to show a signal. We used P.a DN1 and DH5 as our chassis to explore which bacteria will be a better chassis for our device.'",['Environment']

989,"b'Biofilms are often maligned because of their roles in antibiotic-resistant infections and dental plaque. However, biofilms also offer an attractive platform for the design of self-assembling biomaterials programmed for specific functionality.

CsgA has been shown to be tolerant of C-terminal fusions, allowing CsgA endowed with diverse peptide domains to be secreted and self-assembled extracellularly similar to normal curli nanofibres. We present the genetic engineering of CsgA to create a biofilm that binds ice and degrades hydrocarbons. A type I antifreeze protein, AFP8, will be fused to CsgA for ice binding, and a PA-14 adhesin domain will be fused, via the SpyTag-SpyCatcher system, to bind the hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus.

Glyphosate is the prominent example for a total-herbicide, as its usage rate is ever increasing since its introduction in 1974, making it the most-used herbicide in the USA today. Glyphosate has a bad reputation as it is thought to be harmful to human health. We want to improve the knowledge of the influence of glyphosate on the physiology of a model organism. For this purpose, we aim to engineer the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis for the detection and degradation of glyphosate. So far, we have isolated B. subtilis variants tolerating high amounts of glyphosate. Currently, these strains are used to develop and characterize a glyphosate detection system, which is based on fluorescently labeled bacteria.

Degradation through physical and chemical methods exist but are often inefficient, unsustainable or expensive. We propose MethotrExit, a bioreactor-based approach to tackle this problem. We focused on the biotransformation of methotrexate (MTX), a widely used anticancer drug. We designed synthetic cassettes encoding a new biotransformation pathway using a heterologous carboxypeptidase in Escherichia coli. In only five hours, MethotrExit drastically removes MTX from the media. However, anticancer drug degradation products and/or the biotransformation pathway itself might be toxic for E. coli. To overcome this issue, biobricks generating heterogeneity in enzyme expression were built to ensure survival of a subpopulation. Modeling of this system highlights the interest of a division of labor between cleaning and stem bacterial cells.'",['Environment']

All currently available applications, which look to prevent transmission by mosquitoes, are limited by the vast infrastructural differences in affected regions. With the Sustainable Human-Imitating Elimination and Lure Device (S.H.I.E.L.D.) we developed a mosquito trap tailored especially to the requirements of infrastructurally and economically disadvantaged regions. S.H.I.E.L.D. employs a self-sustaining co-culture of cyanobacteria and engineered E. coli which produce a complex mosquito attractant mixture as well as a targeted bioinsecticide. Careful implementation of novel regulatory circuits limiting cell growth, responding to nutrient availability, and monitoring metabolic load allows sustained in-trap production of attractants and insecticide over extended periods of time. The durable trap case with nano filter, co-culture separation and hydrogel reservoir ensures biosafety and brings together our no-maintenance sustainable solution to one of worlds biggest problems.'",['Environment']

Two shortcomings of the previous design were a small measurement range, and low precision. This year we added the nickel ions channel protein NikABCDE gene to the original gene element allowing the ions to enter the cell more smoothly, which has improved both of these issues. We also replaced the RFP gene with the luciferase LuxCDABE gene. The reporter gene emits fluorescence in response to nickel ions which further enhances our measurement precision. It also provided the opportunity to develop a biosensing instrument for real-time nickel ions detection. Our changes improved sensitivity and range, as well as provided an opportunity for a new method of nickel ions detection.""",['Environment']

The pathway would involve the uptake of these pollutants and their subsequent breakdown into molecules that would enter organisms native metabolism. We are testing the pathway in S. cerevisiae, and have prepared expression vectors and means to engineer a multitude of plants. By deploying such pathways directly into endemic plants, our solution can be tailored to specific regions.

These elements temporarily increase nutrients; however, they promote excessive growth of certain bacteria, such as phosphate solubilizing bacteria, damaging soil integrity. We developed a regulation system to manipulate soil microbiota, using bacteriocins as bio-stimulants to maintain nutrient levels while balancing bacterial ratios. First, we determine ideal levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium for plant growth. After determining a volume of fertilizer, we use a nutrient-to-microbiota model that relates element levels to bacteria amounts to determine the distribution of bacteria after fertilization. We use our bacteriocin-effect-model to predict an ideal bacteriocin volume. A correlation model relates inhibition to changes in bacterial ratios. This system predicts the bacteriocin volume needed to prevent bacteria that thrive off chemical fertilizers from becoming too dominant. Our innovative system of regulating microbiotas using bio-stimulants is a long-term solution, balancing high productivity with environmental sustainability.'",['Environment']

Development of a plant-colonising chassis provides novel mechanisms for soil microbiome manipulation without genetically modified crops. As proof of concept, we focus on improving nitrogen supply via naringenin biosynthesis - a potential chemoattractant of free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

However, very little is being done to raise citizen awareness or to combat the negative effects on the ecosystem. Thus, the goal of this project is to create a paper-based cell-free assay that detects whether chromium or lead is present in a given water supply. Cell free systems are ideal for heavy metal detection because they are field-deplorable, eliminate issues of biocontamination, and facilitate increased reaction control via the open reaction environment. For each metal, there are two plasmids; one that produces a repressor protein while the other constitutively produces GFP. With this combination, the repressor interferes with the production of GFP until the specified heavy metal is present, resulting in a fluorescent output. The benefit of creating an easy-to-use sensor is that it empowers everyday citizens to test their water quality.'",['Environment']

Other researchers have mutated PETases active site to increase its substrate turnover. We are cloning the DNA sequences of these mutated enzymes into an E. coli plasmid and developing a second plasmid to overexpress the native E.coli enzymes for ethylene glycol metabolism. With both plasmids, the transformed bacteria should be able to survive solely off the PET carbon. The only byproduct would be terephthalic acid, a precipitate which can be recycled into new plastic.

Because the virus is spread between plants via pollinators such as bees, the preventative solution has been to use pesticides to avoid interaction between the bees and the affected crops. To alleviate the spread of TMV while simultaneously preserving environmental safety, we looked into expressing the yeast gene, XRN1 in plants. By producing the protein XRN1-p, yeast has a means of breaking down non-local and invasive RNA, a system that the eukaryotic N. Benthamiana does not have.

Our team plans to replicate the phaseolotoxin production pathway in Escherichia coli and utilize the toxin as a more environmentally friendly option to remove kudzu. After the removal of kudzu, local endangered species can regrow without competition.

Genetically modifying corals symbiotic microalgae, Symbiodinium, to better withstand heat stress may combat coral bleaching. We have attempted several transformations, creatively designed an algae house, and built a temperature-ecological amplitude model based on the Shelford's Law of Tolerance to find the best conditions for culturing Symbiodinium. In addition, we have successfully designed a recombinant plasmid by inserting a GUS reporter gene and the most appropriate modified heat resistant gene, heat shock factor, into a dinoflagellate-optimized expression DinoIII plasmid. We will perform a biolistics gene gun-mediated transformation. Because the commercial gene gun is so expensive, we will use 2018 iGEM team Worcesters design to build our own gene gun.

These wastes are discarded into the environment causing serious environmental pollution problems. This has inspired our team to search for effective scientific options to help reduce plastic pollution. In this project, we have adopted an in-silico mutagenesis approach to design two PUR-degrading enzymes - papain and polyurethanase esterase A (PueA) - that could be used to enhance PET and PUR biodegradation. Ultimately, we are aiming to construct a multi plastic-degrading E. coli bug by combining the genes of the two mutant enzymes (papain and PueA) with the well-studied polyethylene terephthalate hydrolase (PETase) gene in a single biobrick. It is hoped that this technology will contribute to reducing plastic wastes and help better protect our environment.'",['Environment']

Earthworms was used as carrier of bacteria, and we transformed bacteria to secrete phytase specifically by using oxygen-regulated switch to hydrolyze phytate in the intestines of earthworms. Lead ions can be precipitated into insolubles by combining with phosphate and chloride ions, thus purifying soil.

Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), including PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), have been of great concern, due to their toxicity in low concentrations and bioaccumulating properties that lead to alarming concentrations in the ecosystem. Current detection methods, which are performed by analyzing massive amounts of water samples in the lab, cannot properly measure the low levels of POPs nor differentiate between the various iterations that exist. Our project S-POP aims to solve this issue by creating a monitor containing two major parts, a modular E. coli biosensor coupled with a Microbial Fuel Cell.

Silica-based materials are well suited because they are environmentally friendly, biocompatible and resistant to organic solvents and microbial attacks. Because the enzymes are bound to a matrix via our innovative poly-lysine tag, no genetically modified organisms are released into the environment. Furthermore, the degradation products have no negative effects on nature anymore. We were able to express the laccase of S. cyaneus and to synthesize the silica foam.

1185,"b""The Pine River is found in central Michigan, near Alma College's campus. Following the closure of the Velsicol Chemical Plant in 1978, many environmental pollutants -- including DDT and its derivatives -- were improperly disposed of and leached into the surroundings, thus coining the name, the Poisoned River. These organochlorides are endocrine disruptors and possible carcinogens have wreaked havoc on the local ecosystem. More than this population were affected. Our solution: a biosensor that uses estrogen receptors to detect these harmful pollutants. Several species of animals have estrogen receptors known to bind DDT, a known xenoestrogen. Linking this to a reporting gene, such as RFP, within a microbe will allow the detection of organochlorides. This can lead to the screening of contaminated areas locally and globally. Ultimately, this biosensor has the potential to save thousands of dollars in not only our superfund sites, but pollution cleanup effort across the globe.""",['Environment']
1186,"b'Arsenic contamination in groundwater is a serious problem both in local Arizonan communities and abroad: prolonged exposure to arsenic contamination can cause cancer, vascular damage, and liver failure. This project aims to engineer the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to sequester arsenic out of water. Metallothionein, arsenate reductase, and ferritin were integrated into the microalgae via the pASapI plasmid in varying permutations. The plasmid rescues function of the photosystem II gene, leveraging the ability to photosynthesize as a selective trait. Metallothionein and ferritin bind the two most common forms of arsenic: arsenite and arsenate, respectively. Arsenate reductase catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite, allowing for the ultimate sequestration of the toxic metal to occur in the chloroplast. Transformed algae were incubated with multiple concentrations of arsenic-contaminated media and the final concentration of arsenic after 2-3 days of exposure was measured using ICP-MS to quantify uptake efficacy.'",['Environment']
1187,"b'Ocean pollution by crude oil and its derivative, plastic, is a pervasive environmental issue. With OCTOPUS, we intend to create a P1 phage-based system for delivering surfactant and plastic-degradation genes to marine bacteria to disperse oil slicks and degrade PET plastics, creating more accessible droplets and simple hydrocarbons to allow both pollutants to be metabolized by native hydrocarbon-degrading marine bacteria. We are focusing on the surfactant genes Ranaspumin-2 and Latherin which work individually, and the plastic-degrading genes PETase and MHETase which work together. Using Golden Gate assembly, we are creating plasmids containing either surfactant or plastic-degrading genes plus a packaging sequence that allows P1 to take up the plasmid. Once these phages have been successfully produced, we will analyze their lysates with a variety of assays such as the oil spreading assay for measuring surfactant activity and the blue-dye assay for measuring plastic degradation.'",['Environment']
1188,"b'Reliable access to potable water is a major problem in Bolivia and other nations. Scarcity of this essential resource drives populations to seek drinking water from rivers, lakes, and wells. However, these sources can be dangerous if they are contaminated by heavy metals. Preliminary studies show that drinking water in Bolivian cities often contains highly hazardous levels of arsenic. In response, we designed and constructed a bacterial biosensor to rapidly quantify water sample arsenic content. The biosensor design strategy is called traffic light; it employs 4 genetic constructs to quantify defined ppb ranges of arsenic content in water. Light color responses indicate lower metal concentrations while increasingly dark color responses correspond to increased arsenic content. We created a portable device that houses the biosensor and allows one to quantify water samples anywhere. Our goal is to make the biosensor available to users in Bolivia and eventually around the world.'",['Environment']

This bacterium is designed to be able to measure the amount of phosphate in water. If the phosphate exceeds a certain threshold concentration, the bacterium will start to form a system to pick it up. This consists of an enzyme that will bind the phosphate into long chains (polyphosphate kinase) and protein vesicles (bacterial microcompartments, BMCs) that will enclose the phosphate chains. According to the design, these modified bacteria will be placed in water in a system that prevents their escape into the environment. After a period of time, the bacteria with the accumulated phosphates will be removed from the water, inactivated, and can be further utilized.

In Phase 1, we gathered information for known antibiotic resistance genes by running full metagenomic sequencing, as well as through selective amplification and sequencing of integrons. This allowed early detection of antibiotic resistance factors relevant to clinically significant antibiotics. Then we singled out genes related to antibiotic resistance, which havent been found in the territory of Bulgaria yet. Upon the discovery of new determinants, our project entered Phase 2, in which the determinants were generated using synthesis and gene cloning. The successful completion of our project would lead to the development of streamlined protocols for the examination of the cumulative resistome. This allows for an adequate estimation of antibiotic resistance and provide us with information for future emergence and treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.'",['Environment']

Presently, REEs are not mined sustainably, and current trends indicate that an alternate source is critical to avoid a period of REE scarcity. Neocycle is a system that works to selectively recover REEs from an underutilized source, electronic waste. First, REE extraction is necessary through the process of bioleaching, where the acid-producing organisms Gluconobacter oxydans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, solubilize the electronic waste feedstock. Next, REEs are recovered from the e-waste leachate through the use of the novel lanthanide-ion binding protein, lanmodulin, in an adsorption column system. Finally, the recovered REE ions are measured using one of three novel measurement systems, which are based on lanmodulin fusion proteins. Through this pipeline, Neocycle aims to provide a sustainable and more accessible source of REEs.'",['Environment']

Aimed to restore saline-alkaline soil, above all, we engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum to make it produce -PGA based on genes from Bacillus subtilis. Secondly, to harvest -PGA as much as possible, we modified genes in oxaloacetic acid node and -ketoglutarate node to yield more glutamic acid, the raw material for -PGA.

In response, microbe Ideonella sakaiensis was reported to be capable of secreting two efficient enzymes to deconstruct PET polymers in mild temperature. However, this two-enzyme system degradation capacity is highly limited by inhibition effects, diffusion of intermediates and PET surface physicochemical properties. Therefore, we design a delicate multicomplex enzyme system, in which short peptide tags (RIAD and RIDD) are applied to create scaffold-free modular enzymes assemblies. In order to effectively degrade microplastic PET particles, we construct enzymes of IsPETase and MHETase and protein hydrophobin in our complex system via scaffold modular part, which reveal higher catalytic efficiency in mild temperature.

For more than a century, mildew has been treated with bio farming compatible copper-based fungicides which adhere to plant leaves. However, though only trace amounts of copper is present in wine made from treated plants, when rain washes the fungicide away, toxic levels of copper contaminate the surrounding soil, inhibiting new cultivation and biodiversity. Our goal is to remove copper from grapevine rainwater runoff to prevent this pollution. We generated yeast strains which express the normally intracellular copper-binding protein CUP1 in multiple copies and configurations on their surface to enable bioadsorption of environmental copper. As a proof-of-concept for a real-world implementation of our decontamination strategy, we have designed and built a prototype bioreactor to enable the removal of copper from rainwater by our modified yeast.

To better understand this problem, we will assess the potential risk of lateral transfer of E. coli plasmids by T4 bacteriophages under different conditions. We have shown that T4 can transfer plasmid DNA, which does increase the risk of lateral transfer. However, the number of E. coli phages present in our local environment appears to be quite low, reducing the risk. We added four new T4 early promoters to the registry to support our project.

Thus, we have engineered Saccharomyces spp. to synthesize alpha-amylase, an enzyme that optimizes cattles digestion. This way, their milk production and growth will be enhanced while ammonia emissions will be reduced simultaneously. Residual ammonia will be captured by a state-of-the-art filter device, a Metal-Organic Framework (MOF), and fed back to our GMO.

Biofilms are communities of microorganisms that irreversibly stick to non-biological surfaces and grow on the surfaces, producing exopolysaccharides that facilitate attachment and matrix formation. To break down such biofilms, we constructed a vector for expression of a glycolytic enzyme fused to RFP (red) that degrades exopolysaccharides. An Escherichia coli strain was used not only as an expression host but also as a carrier of the enzyme to biofilms. The strain also contained a suicide vector as the second vector that can cause bacteriolysis under some specific condition. Our findings showed that experimental biofilms were efficiently degraded by the glycolytic enzyme that leaked from the lysed transformant cells .

Our goal is to design R-DetoX, a two-component genetic circuit for the detection and biodegradation of RDX. An RDX-inducible sensor element is transcriptionally coupled with the quorum-sensing (QS) signal biosynthesis and transcriptional regulator genes, luxI and luxR, respectively. The second component is induced by acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)mediated QS, activating PluxR,, which initiates the transcription of the xplA/B system. As a result, denitrification and ring-cleavage of RDX occurs, reducing the compounds recalcitrance. A fluorescent reporter follows the catabolic component, allowing for quantification of biodegradation gene expression through fluorometry. The biodetection/biodegradation of RDX by R-DetoX will allow recovery of the biodiversity and provide new tools for environmental monitoring and remediation.'",['Environment']

Removing MC-LR with conventional techniques is costly and produces toxic byproducts. Therefore, we plan to use MlrA, an enzyme native to Sphingomonas spp., which linearizes the ring structure of MC-LR and reduces its toxicity. While previous works have expressed this enzyme in E. coli, we hope to achieve higher yields through two novel methods. The first anchors MlrA on the outer membrane of E. coli via a fusion protein with poly--glutamate. The second secretes MlrA into the periplasm using TatExpress, a super-secreting strain, to increase the expression of transport membrane proteins. This project also proposes a microcystin detection method using a two-hybrid bacterial assay.

The aim during the Phase II stage was to clone constitutive genes into plasmids, transform these into BL21 E. coli cells, and finally test for the expression of the enzymes of the Shinorine-producing pathway. ATPG, the initial gene in the Shinorine-producing pathway, was successfully cloned into the pETDuet-1 plasmid, however cloning the other three genes into their plasmids proved difficult.

PETase is a novel PET-degrading enzyme with the ability to degrade the highly crystallized PET. However, the heat-labile property seriously hinders its industrial applications. To over this limitation, we firstly rationally designed several PETase mutants through our combine bioinformatics strategies. Then we cloned and expressed these mutant genes by using the E. coli system. We next purified all the expressed PETase mutants and tested their thermostability at several conditions. We found 7 of PETase mutants with increasing thermostability.

To control the cell cycle, this project relies on a re-engineered chemotaxis system which instead of controlling the flagellar rotation direction drives changes in gene expression in response of the cell community through the use of a series of on/off switches and a modified serine production pathway which allows between cell communication.

To this end, three separate quorum sensing systemsagrBDCA, lamBDCA, and fsrABCwere investigated. We constructed various cell strains expressing separately the signaling and receiving components of the quorum sensing systems and measured their efficacy in creating and receiving the signaling molecule.

The goal of this project is to address this problem with a synthetic biology approach. We design and implement in Saccharomyces cerevisiae a synthetic gene circuit that colors mother cells depending on their replicative age.

We demonstrate our approach on a 5-enzyme catabolic pathway that functions in P. putida, but not in E. coli. Once a multi-enzyme pathway functions in a preferred host, the DNA sequence of the system must then be optimized to achieve a desired metabolic activity. We took a forward engineering approach to systematically investigate the differences in translation rate capacity when using either ""frequent"", ""fast"", ""rare"", or ""slow"" synonymous codons during codon optimization of protein coding sequences.

Initially, they used isolated enzymes, which can be disadvantageous for that enzymes are always destabilized in the isolation and purification process. What's more, the cofactor-NADH is rather an expensive raw material, which will enhance the cost. So scientists introduced whole-cell bio-catalysts to L-tert-leucine production. Whole-cell biocatalysts could stabilize enzymes and reduce the addition level of co-factor NADH. However, the NADH consumption rate does not equal to its regeneration. The criminal is different strength of enzymes, we regulate the efficiency of RBS to control its strength. With mathematical modeling, we will get the most suitable efficiency of RBS of leucine dehydrogenase to decrease additional NADH.""",['Foundational Advance']

The Australian National University iGEM team explored the principles of optogenetics, an emerging field in which gene expression can be precisely controlled by light. We developed an application for the CRY2 and CIB1 light-inducible expression system to synthesise NAD in Escherichia coli. NAD is a commercially valuable metabolite, however in large quantities NAD is toxic to E. coli. Our light-inducible expression system enables the accumulation of the NAD precursor, -iminosuccinic acid in darkness. Blue-light induction of an irreversible, blue-light activated switch with a split, modular CRY2/CIB1-Cre-recombinase construct enables production of a late-stage biosynthetic enzyme, allowing the rapid production of the toxic metabolite from the accumulated precursor. We have further developed a customisable blue-light source for the activation of our construct under different light conditions.'",['Foundational Advance']
1267,"b'After an organism is reprogrammed with a genetic device, the device will often mutate, or break, decreasing the metabolic load on the organism and giving it a competitive advantage. This commonly allows the organism with the broken genetic device to dominate the population, undermining the purpose of the original reprogramming. Our goal is to characterize sequences within genes and plasmids that are more likely to mutate, since our research suggests that certain devices are more easily broken than others. We expanded on this research by transforming four E. coli strains with fluorescent protein plasmids. Breaking times varied noticeably between strains, suggesting that the hosts own genetic material also influenced device stability. Based on our findings, we decided to increase the stability of a few genetic devices, including the pDCAF3 plasmid, which the 2012 UT Austin iGEM team designed to allow E. coli to measure caffeine content through caffeine metabolism.'",['Foundational Advance']
1268,"b'The field of synthetic biology seeks to engineer desirable cellular functionalities by developing molecular technologies that enable precise genetic manipulation. A promising solution is to reliably control proteins that naturally execute genetic modifications. Current strategies to regulate activity of such proteins primarily rely on modulating protein expression level through transcriptional control; however, these methods are susceptible to slow response and leaky expression. In contrast, strategies that exploit post-translational regulation of activity, such as conditional dimerization of split protein halves, have been demonstrated to bypass these limitations. Here, we compare the relative efficiency of previously characterized dimerization domains in regulating activities of three important genetic manipulation proteins - integrases and recombination directionality factors for genetic logic applications, and saCas9 for in vivo genome editing applications. We also establish guidelines to rationally identify promising protein split sites. Our characterization of these systems in mammalian cells ultimately paves way for important biomedical applications.'",['Foundational Advance']

In order to solve the problem, a novel use of herbicide has been figured out the mix of herbicide. The mix use of the herbicide has plenty of benefits including decreasing the dose, increasing the efficacy, decreasing the poison residual and expanding the weed control spectrum.

By using the protein products known as cohesins and dockerins, we were able to create an organized and customizable array of enzymes on the outer surface of the cell. The cohesins are single elements orderly arranged as part of the scaffold and act as highly-specific bays for the display of the proteins of interest. The dockerins act as adaptors for the enzymes to be displayed, and allow them to anchor themselves onto the cohesin elements. For each type of cohesin element, there exists a complementary dockerin that binds specifically to it, which makes the scaffold a very powerful tool in the biotechnology landscape.'",['Foundational Advance']

In our project, we looked at this gene circuit in the context of detecting antibiotic resistance to activate a cell death gene. In preparing for this, we also performed a review of existing BioBricks and novel cell death genes in terms of their efficacy and safety.

By fusing heterologous peptides to the adhesin domain, we first show that our mutant E. coli can be regulated to grab heavy metals like Nickel out of water. Next, we show a knock-out of the adhesive domain's pathogenic binding activity and introduce a peptide known to bind to colon cancer.

We used mutant of Dronpa, Dronpa145N. Dronpa 145N switches on under 400nm light and forms a tetramer, and switches off under 500nm light and forms monomer. Fuse target protein with Dronpa 145N. Dronpa 145N domain reversibly change monomer and tetramer by light, the target protein between Dronpa 145N domain can change active conformation and inactive conformation.

Furthermore, we have developed a mathematical model to estimate gene order for optimal biosynthetic production using 2A sequence and present it as a community tool to streamline future applications.

1277,"b'Communication between cells is instrumental in coordinating population-level activity. In a process known as ""quorum sensing,"" bacteria both secrete and sense autoinducer signaling molecules to enable synchronization of group gene expression paradigms. The synthetic biology community has rapidly adopted these quorum signaling pathways for use in programmed circuitry. However, chemical signals must diffuse between sender and receiver cells, limiting such communication to a common environment. In electronics, when electrical signals must be transferred between two circuits operating at incompatible voltages, electrical engineers use optocouplers, components that transfer information between isolated circuits via light. The 2015 Penn iGEM team presents a biological analog of the optocoupler, a cell-to-cell communication system in which a ""sender"" cell generates light via bioluminesence and a ""receiver"" cell expresses photoreceptors to enable light-dependent physiological responses. We show that light elicits a response in light-sensitive receivers and illuminated potential applications for this alternative form of cell communication.'",['Foundational Advance']

That is why in recent years it has sought new strategies for effective transformation of cells at low cost. One of these strategies is the use of nanotechnology, which has the potential of crossing cell membranes and increase solubility, stability and bioavailability of biomolecules, thereby improving efficiency of release.

In order to permanently memorise the sensor state of the snapshot time point in cells we use an altered version of the DNA recombinase Cre to switch on a luciferase reporter. The ability to quickly capture the current state of the sensor is achieved by fusing Cre with two copies of the protein Dronpa, that oligomerises after illumination and thereby cages and inhibits the recombinase. Because the oligomerisation of Dronpa is reversible through another wavelength, we can control the activity of the recombinase and fine tune the read out of the luciferase reporter.'",['Foundational Advance']

As such, this device can detect a larger dynamic range of concentrations of selected molecules (e.g., glucose). Our project aims to provide a cheaper alternative for diabetics than current, more expensive, glucose-monitoring systems.

Afterwards, we use a special DNA-Polymerase, for increasing diversity through error-prone replication of the desired sequence. Finally, binding proteins with high affinity to the target protein are selected. This selection is mediated by protein-protein interaction, granting a selective advantage to cells in which tight binding proteins are expressed by an increase in fitness under selective pressure.

1301,"b""Generally, stem-loops forming polynucleotides are more stable than the single-stranded ones. Particularly, mRNA with a stem-loop at its 3'- or 5'-end often has a longer half-life than their linear counterpart owing to the stem loops' resistance to exoribonucleases. Our team designed a polycistron gene expression construct, in which each gene followed by a stem-loop and an endoribonuclease cleavage site. When it is transcribed, digested by the endoribonuclease, and cleaved into independent mRNAs with different stem-loops, different mRNA shows different stability, determined by the designed Gibbs free energy (G) of their stem-loops, resulting in different expression level of their encoded proteins. In this way, we decouple the gene expression level of the same operon simply by designing different stem-loops. In addition, by quantitatively adjusting the free energy of the stem-loops, we can even achieve a stoichiometry expression of the target proteins precisely, like playing a beautiful concerto of cistrons.""",['Foundational Advance']

1306,"b'Chemotaxis is the movement of bacteria in response to chemical stimuli. This process is mediated by chemoreceptors  membrane proteins that bind to substances with high specificity depending on their ligand binding domain (LBD). FlashLab offers a set of tools for harnessing the bacterial chemotaxis system. By replacing the LBD of the E. coli Tar-chemoreceptor with various LBDs, or by inserting a switchable lock and key mechanism into the receptor, chemotaxis can be programmed to respond to a substance of our choice. As an implementation of our system we introduce a novel method for detecting an array of materials, such as pollutants, hormones and allergens. The engineered bacteria are confined to a microfluidics chip; the user simply inserts a sample into the chip and if the matching substance exists, the cells will either move towards or away from the sample forming a visible cluster.'",['Foundational Advance']
1307,"b'Probiotics are widely applied in food industry, agriculture and biotechnology. Lactococcus lactis is a food grade probiotic and generally regarded as safe. It is widely used in synthetic biology. Genes introduced by plasmids usually accompanied by antibiotic resistance genes and are unstable when selection pressure is absent. Genes can also be integrated into the genome but this process is extrmely time-consuming. The blue-white screening system is widely used in molecular cloning. We apply this system to select marker free gene integrated strains. DNA of interest replaced the chromosome integrated lacZ gene, which yield white colonies in the presence of X-gal. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we will integrate some ORFs and devices in different length, including salmon calcitonin for the treatment of osteoporosis, Lux operon from Vibrio harveyi for L. lactis in vivo detection , and Vi antigen of Salmonella typhi to make typhoid vaccine.'",['Foundational Advance']
1308,"b'As the field of synthetic biology increases and becomes more present in the everyday live the topic of bio safety becomes more important likewise. However, there are no functional safety approaches available from previous years that the teams could easily choose and apply on their current projects. To this end, we want to generate a safety approach to enable all iGEM Teams to work safely with E.coli. A genetic circuit is integrated into the E.coli genome ensuring that genetically modified E.coli cannot survive outside of the required conditions. This genetic circuit is based on the availability of an unnatural amino acid (UAA) which continuously has to be added to the medium. A reporter protein is expressed as the level of UAA in the medium decreases, signalizing the low UAA concentration. If the level decreases further, the expression of colicin is induced, resulting in the death of the bacteria.'",['Foundational Advance']
1309,"b'Most promoters in the iGEM registry can be separated into two categories. There are constitutive, or always on, promoters of various strengths. There are also inducible promoters, which activate transcription based on environmental factors such as light, pH, or the presence of certain molecules. UIUC_Illinois is characterizing a promoter library that gives more control over gene expression, without the need for inducers. We are isolating a set of e. coli promoters that turn on and off according to the hosts growth phase. For example, one promoter may become active during exponential growth but shut off as growth slows. Another promoter may exhibit little to no activity until stationary phase has been reached. These promoters will be useful tools for any teams wishing to time protein production in vivo, for applications such as metabolic engineering, probiotics, or more.'",['Foundational Advance']
1310,"b'Much like proteins, solitary strands of RNA develop secondary structures due to the bonding between nucleotides which comprise the RNA strand. The secondary structures can inhibit ribosomal binding and translation initiation, preventing synthesis of amino acids and proteins. Through the introduction of heat, the bonds between nucleotides can be separated creating a linear strand of RNA which may be translated. This temperature-controlled gene expression may be used in any variety of applications given further foundational research in quantifying protein production whilst knowing the secondary structure and melting temperatures. To allow for such quantification, synthetic RNA sequences of known secondary structure and corresponding melting temperatures will be ligated upstream of reporter fluorescent and chromaprotein genes. The varying levels of color or fluorescence expression based on the temperature of the studied cells will be used to create mathematical models for future use of RNA thermometers.'",['Foundational Advance']
1311,"b'Some bacteria naturally bleb: a process whereby their outer membrane pinches in and buds off. The result of this is an outer membrane vesicle (OMV), a nanoscale lipid bubble, released into the environment. These OMVs can be decorated on the outside with outer membrane proteins, and can encapsulate periplasmic proteins within. Given this, OMVs have the potential to be tailored to a variety of functions, by targeting proteins either to the periplasm or outer membrane. This customisable nature means that OMVs could become a new platform technology for the application of future synthetic biology projects. Currently, however, there is no standardised system for inducing hypervesiculation in bacteria, and thus our project compares the effect of different genetic factors on OMV formation. With this data we will produce the ultimate strain of blebbing bacteria which can be utilised for the production of OMVs adapted for environmental, medical, or industry purposes.'",['Foundational Advance']
1312,"b'The time has come for synthetic biology to free itself from the constraints of evolution. As an engineering discipline, synthetic biology depends on its genetically-encoded parts operating in consistent and predictable ways. Yet mutation and evolution break that predictability, altering the systems behavior in disruptive or even dangerous ways, and selecting against intended transgene function. As long as evolution and mutation are allowed to proceed unchecked, the long-term stability, effectiveness, and safety of any genetic technology are at risk. Our solution began by characterizing a set of mutation-prone hotspot nucleotide sequences, which we then applied to create new algorithmic tools for modulating any genes susceptibility to mutation without affecting its function. With these tools we have achieved precise and predictable control over the frequency of mutation. Through rational design principles, our works shows that it is possible to counteract even the seemingly inescapable forces of evolution. Score one for engineering.'",['Foundational Advance']
1313,"b'Prions, or zombie proteins, are infectious agents that lead to a variety of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). They sicken cells by aggregating with each other and prevent proper protein folding leading to cell death from the accumulated damage. We propose a synthetic biology approach to better study prion propagation in the model organism S. cerevisiae. Our system involves inserting a premature stop codon into a protein open reading frame of interest or into dCas9 to respectively overexpress or knock-down protein levels during a [PSI+] response. We use Hsp104, a chaperone protein in S. cerevisiae, to demonstrate that our set-up phenotypically responds to the stop codon readthrough. This research is useful for continuously observing a phenotypic output during prion propagation in yeast and may have implications for helping to identify protein targets for both prevention and treatment of NDDs in the future.'",['Foundational Advance']
1314,"b'We present a toolbox of BioBrick parts which can orthogonally modify the input-output response of arbitrary genetic circuits. By applying our decoy binding arrays, RBS library, and synthetic enhancers to their circuits, biologists will be able to tune their circuits sensitivity to input, magnitude of response, and number of distinct output states. We thoroughly characterize the behavior of each toolbox part and incorporate this information into a comprehensive mathematical model called the Circuit Control Calculator, which guides users on how best to use our toolbox to achieve a desired response in their circuit.'",['Foundational Advance']
1315,"b'XJTLU-CHINA aims to develop a novel in vivo method to construct DNA mutagenesis library. Unlike the conventional method that uses in vitro synthesized oligo-pools, we utilize a pathway constructed in bacterium Escherichia coli to guide the cells to mutate the DNA that has been preset as target. The mutagenesis guiding pathway that XJTLU-CHINA developed involves two major sections, the error-prone replication of RNA by Q replicase and the reverse transcription accompanied by retrohoming of group II intron. The ultimate product upon the ending of the pathway will be a mutagenesis library of DNA target of interest that ready for in situ characterization or harvesting for the future use. The new method will be inexpensive to use and supposed be more robust in performance.'",['Foundational Advance']
1316,"b'Multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) is a genetic engineering technique that increases genetic diversity by introducing synthetic oligonucleotides. Two strains of rhizobia were chosen to provide a framework for implementing MAGE in non-model organisms. To optimize MAGE in Rhizobium tropici and Sinorhizobium meliloti, several experiments were conducted, including characterizing the activity of pORTMAGE-3 in rhizobia. Current data indicates the successful transformation and stability of pORTMAGE-3 in rhizobia. To improve how oligonucleotides are stabilized during MAGE, a second experiment consisted of characterizing a library of beta-homologous recombinases to find a beta protein optimized for rhizobia. Synthetic entry vectors carrying each of the rhizobium-specific recombinases are currently being constructed. A third experiment is to characterize a library of inducible promoters hypothesized to be compatible with rhizobia and a set of Anderson promoters. These promoters are being characterized using a citrine fluorescent assay to determine the most suitable promoter strength when performing MAGE.'",['Foundational Advance']
1317,"b'The building block of Synthetic Biology is to turn biological systems easier to engineer. Standardization is a fundamental key to that goal. CRISPR/Cas9 machinery paves the way for precisely edit living cell genomes. Although revolutionary, SynBio community has an obstacle: CRISPR/Cas9 protocol is superficially standardized and requires a considerable amount of wet lab work due to the multi-plasmid system. We aim to build a toolbox for one-step genome engineering based on a standard BioBrick vector. To go further and beyond, we unified human practice with pattern recognition and machine learning in order to overcome boundaries in the way of SynBio advancement. We also bring the concept of computational repository for lab ""algorithms"", the protocols, developing an open and integrated platform to expand the iGEM experience. Our perspective is to leave a legacy and provide a bacterial genome editing machinery based on BioBrick parts assembly easy to engineer as A-B-C CRISPR.'",['Foundational Advance']
1318,"b'Homoserine lactones (HSLs) are a family of small molecules used to coordinate behavior in some bacteria. Group regulation is known as quorum sensing (QS) and is responsible for behaviors such as bacterial virulence, growth, and bioluminescence. Genetic components from QS systems have been modularized by synthetic biologists and incorporated into synthetic circuits. A significant hurdle to using HSLs in synthetic systems is cross-reactivity between a sender and non-target receivers. Crosstalk can be mitigated by orthogonal systems that do not communicate with each other. Our project characterizes interactions between HSL-producing sender cells and our newly developed receivers (LasR, TraR, and RpaR) using an HSL-induced GFP reporter system. We expect to add 3 new well-characterized receivers to build upon foundational advances such as the work with LuxR (BBa_F2620) by B. Canton. Our work also builds upon important research in biosafety (from our 2016 project) by using ethyl alcohol eliminate HSL bioactivity.'",['Foundational Advance']
1319,"b'We are exploring the application of unnatural base pairs as an expansion of the genetic code. To prevent loss of unnatural base pairs during replication, we will utilize several systems including CRISPR/Cas9. The expanded genetic code allows for the ribosomal incorporation of multiple non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into peptides. With their broad chemical and functional diversity, ncAAs provide a variety of promising applications including protein labeling, photocaging, structure analysis, and specific protein interactions. Therefore, our innovative toolkit for the translational incorporation of ncAAs in E. coli is a valuable contribution to iGEM. Directed evolution of tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs enables the site-specific incorporation of ncAAs into peptides. This approach results in an optimal orthogonality to the autologous translation apparatus and a high flexibility concerning the incorporation of multiple ncAAs. As proof of concept, we are developing a rapid test for prions and a new chromatography method for mild protein elution.'",['Foundational Advance']
1320,"b' Our project aims to improve the loading capacity of yeast surface display system by displaying the microtubules and the flagellar filaments, respectively, onto the yeast surface. To start with, By using the agglutinin system, we anchored subunits of fibrous polymers which are represented here by microtubulin subunits or FilC, on the cell wall of yeast. Since the particular polymers self-assembly can take place outside cell membrane, we provide the engineered yeast with an environment rich of pre-secreted polymers subunits. In this way, an extracellular tridimensional display system could be formed, which can enlarge the loading capacity by roughly an order of magnitudes. Moreover, we remodify the structure of FliC, substituting its D3 domain by the particular enzyme. By means of display and assemble specific combination of FilC-enzymes, the co-display ability can be greatly enhanced. As a result, a highly efficient, whole-cell biocatalyst system would be established at the meantime.'",['Foundational Advance']
1321,"b'In vivo continuous directed evolution offers significant advantages over classic in vitro methods as it drastically reduces the amount of time and actual lab work required. Most current approaches, however, are based on globally accelerated mutagenesis inevitably leading to unwanted off-target mutations. D.I.V.E.R.T. represents the concept of a new continuous in vivo evolution strategy that allows full spatial control of mutagenesis by building systems that resemble the retrotransposon life cycle: The gene of interests mRNA is reverse transcribed in an error prone way and reintegrated into the genome at the respective locus replacing the original gene for several cycles. To demonstrate the generalizability of the process we plan on carrying out our proof of concept experiment in yeast and E. coli. By the end of August we are still in the cloning stage.

1323,"b'The presence of specific RNAs in cells can be indicative of their state. Detecting these RNAs on a small scale allows for identification of viruses such as Zika and Ebola, however measuring larger sets of RNA remains complex. Current methods of RNA detection are time consuming and require expensive machinery and technical expertise. Toehold switches, biological devices that drive the expression of a gene when activated by trigger RNA, present an alternative with high specificity, wide dynamic range, and ease of use. We present a platform whereby trigger RNAs activate toeholds and induce recombinase expression, driving downstream genetic logic. We integrate this RNA-inducible logic within a cell-free transcription translation system to reduce the experimental burden on time and supplies. This work serves to establish functionality of RNA-inducible logic in a cell-free system, and provides a platform for future implementation in applications that require detection of multiple RNAs, including disease diagnostics.'",['Foundational Advance']
1324,"b'Unknown, unpredictable reactions inside cells pose a major problem in synthetic biological designs as they are affecting the purposed applications. Nature solves the problems of unavoidable interactions or toxification by intermediates and by-products by separating enzymatic reactions through compartmentalization. The integration of pathways into organelles leads to the concentration of enzymes and metabolites, sustains unstable intermediates and enables naturally incompatible reactions to take place simultaneously. We intend to follow natures example and engineer yeasts peroxisomes to create an intracellular space with customized properties. To do so we establish an open source toolbox and enable booting up a compartment perfectly tailored for a specific application. To demonstrate the potential of this approach we relocate the nootkatone and violacein pathway into peroxisomes, modify the compartments characteristics using our toolbox applications and thereby create an artificial compartment with optimal reaction conditions.'",['Foundational Advance']
1325,"b'Site-specific recombination is widely utilized for genetic engineering; however, a synthetic biology approach is needed to facilitate its use in a rational and bottom-up way. Therefore, we created SMORE, a toolkit containing well-characterized recombinases, their respective target sites, and recombinase activity assay constructs, with their utility demonstrated by three constructs: a gene randomizer, logic gates, and a pulse generator. Among other applications, these could be applied to metabolic engineering to improve the industrial production of high-value compounds. Our human practices concerns the accessibility of SMORE, making it easier to use. First, we systematically reviewed iGEM team composition in previous years to determine whether diversified teams enjoyed more success; second, we built a microfluidic device and had its protocols open-sourced to promote its use outside of the discipline of engineering; lastly, we adjusted the readability of our promotional material and created animations to facilitate the understanding of the concept of SMORE.'",['Foundational Advance']
1326,"b'Darwinian evolution is an enormously powerful concept that drove biology towards astonishing complexity and beauty. This year, the iGEM team Heidelberg aims at harnessing this power to accelerate the engineering of biomolecules for human benefit. To this end, we built upon the PACE (phage-assisted continuous evolution) method: Synthetic biological circuits couple the survival of quickly mutating phages carrying a protein of interest to directed selection within E. coli hosts. Thereby, proteins with improved functions can be evolved within hours. We designed a standardized toolbox that highly simplifies PACE and expands its utility towards various new areas of application, including the development of enzymes for pharmaceutical production. Additionally, we applied machine learning techniques to evaluate and systematically improve protein sequences to serve a desired purpose. Taken together, we provide a new foundational advance by introducing a unique combination of in silico and in vivo directed evolution to Synthetic Biology.'",['Foundational Advance']

Different approaches of genetic containment strategy such as kill-switches and auxotrophic mutants pose some issues of horizontal gene transfer of modified genes and metabolic cross-feeding that may limit the effectiveness of those approaches. To circumvent the shortcomings, we present an alternative safety circuit which is capable of sensing and amplifying a signalling molecule under a time-delay mechanism. After the time-delay, the circuit will trigger the production of a recombinase that splices out the genetically modified segment from the origin of replication (ORI) of the carrier vector, thus preventing replication of the genetically modified segment in the host. Through this genetic containment approach, we hope to create a standardized design to lower the risk of leakage of genetically modified materials to the environment and alleviate public concerns.'",['Foundational Advance']
1328,"b'Cell cycle synchronization is highly needed in many fields and the traditional synchronization methods have different limitations; for example, chemical methods usually have severe side-effects on the natural physiological states of cells while physical methods (like cell sorting) cannot sustain long time synchronization. In this project, we proposed a cell synchronization approach based on a synthetic circuit of light-controlled CRISPR system targeted at OriC to block the initiation of chromosome replication in E. coli cells. Under the control of computer, the cell cycles can be synchronized with tuned lightening patterns. Our synthetic biological approach of cell synchronization has multiple advantages than traditional methods and may become a fundamental tool for biological research.'",['Foundational Advance']
1329,"b""In synthetic biology, its essential to implement control mechanisms that disable microbes that are unintentionally released into the enviroment.

This complements our previous project (which we are continuing to explore); enhancing E. coli metabolism for wastewater treatment, in dark conditions. The kill-switch is based upon the pDawn system, activating transcription in the presence of blue light. It features MazF, a mRNA-targeting endonuclease. We have designed controls to verify the expression pattern. Furthermore, we introduced additional layers of regulation to prevent premature cell death. Completion of our previous work, together with our kill-switch, is a step towards an environmentally friendly and safe bacterium for nitrogen removal. Moreover, the creation of an effective light inducible kill-switch is a useful addition to the synthetic biology toolkit.""",['Foundational Advance']
1330,"b'We aim to develop a standardized, modular, and open-source ex vivo transcription and translation (TX/TL) system available for research and teaching communities worldwide. Ex vivo systems provide several advantages to cell-based platforms, including: simple input and output, non-proliferation, precise control of molecular interactions, and incorporation of unnatural amino acids. Thus, ex vivo systems are highly useful tools in making synthetic biology accessible to novices, providing enthusiasts with inexpensive cell-free synthesis, and empowering experts with modular control over robust expression systems. With our end-users in mind, we have designed, modelled, and built a plasmid-based multi-protein parts collection for the stoichiometric expression of all required biomachinery for coupled TX/TL reactions, as well as a novel purification method that makes these parts readily available from an inexpensive single-step elution.

1331,"b'Alternative splicing is the eukaryotic mechanism that selects which exons will be included in processed mRNA. It increases the diversity of the human proteome by allowing more than one protein isoform to be produced from the same gene. The inclusion or exclusion of particular exons is regulated by splicing factors which bind to specific motifs in the pre-mRNA. Our project aims to control alternative splicing by using the RNA-binding proteins dCas13a and Ms2 to interfere with these splicing factors binding, allowing us to control which exons are included in the final processed mRNA. By choosing between different protein isoforms, this control method may allow synthetic genes to dynamically change functionality. It also has therapeutic potential for diseases that arise from aberrant splicing, including an aggressive form of breast cancer where one splice variant produces a nonfunctional tumor suppressor, contributing to tumor formation.'",['Foundational Advance']
1332,"b'Biosensor applications are wide-reaching, but their development is complex, inefficient, and uptake limited. We propose a new foundational paradigm for biosensor development; a modular, multicellular development platform, Sensynova. Biosensor designs were reviewed, identifying design-patterns of commonly used subcomponents and configurations. Separating biosensor subcomponents as modules, in different bacterial cells, promotes off-the-shelf reuse. New sensors are developed simply by mixing proportions of these cells which communicate using small molecules. A synthetic biology dialogue helped derive designs for new modules (adaptors, detectors, processors, and reporters), and a proof-of-concept system.

1333,"b'Production of recombinant proteins has enabled or improved the treatment of numerous diseases including anemia, diabetes, and cystic fibrosis. However, recombinant protein production requires industrial infrastructure and the biologics produced in this manner typically have stringent storage requirements, including refrigeration. Many areas of the world lack infrastructure for local production or cold-chain infrastructure for effective delivery of recombinant proteins. Cell-free manufacturing based on freeze dried protein expression reaction pellets may be a solution. These pellets contain the molecular machinery to manufacture proteins and can withstand variations in temperature and humidity. Cell-free expression in this context has limited ability to produce complex proteins. Our project uses anti-microbial peptides as model molecules in order to characterize limits of cell-free expression of functional molecules. We then attempt to expand the production of functional molecules by introducing proteins for post-translational modification of expressed anti-microbial peptides to rescue functionality and demonstrate improved cell-free expression.'",['Foundational Advance']

There are three projects that we are working on. First, we are interested in enhancing the efficiency of HDR repair, which is utilized by scientists to precisely edit certain genes of their interest, by fusing the Cas9 enzyme with a HDR protein. Second, we are trying to deploy the enhanced design to correct a non-small-cell lung cancer mutation.

The microRNA lockers we assembled were proven to be able to bind miRNAs in an Ago2 dependent manner, and were able to trigger gene expression and phenotypic changes consistent to commercialized miRNA inhibitors while decreasing costs significantly. We also demonstrate a computer-aided designing software to facilitate the lockers design and optimization.

However, existing kill switches have limitations and, more importantly, it is difficult to readily tailor make kill switches for different applications. Team NUSgem aims to make engineering of customised, effective kill switches easier. To this end, we are developing a library of characterized sensors, a killing and verification module which can be used in a computer aided design tool (e.g., Cello) and can be readily modelled.

Photosensory transmembrane proteins as well as photoswitchable protein caging were investigated to further expand the existing library of optogenetic tools. For spatial control at the subcellular level, we explored the use of a novel synthetic RNA organelles to manipulate enzymatic activity. Finally, in an effort to promote synthetic biology, we sought the input of the DIY community and chose to illustrate the power of our system by 3D-printing biomaterials.'",['Foundational Advance']
1338,"b'With metabolic channeling, the speed of the reaction of a metabolic pathway is raised by putting the enzymes close together, thus the diffusion distances for the intermediates are reduced. Therefor we have two approaches. In the first approach, we are utilizing the DNA-binding property of the dCas9-protein to put the enzymes next to each other on a DNA-scaffold. The proteins bind via Aptamers and specific binding proteins to dCAS9. This approach is tested in E. coli while the second one will be implemented in yeast. The second approach works with liquid-liquid-phase separation. In this process, membraneless organelles are formed, induced by specific variable domains of Ddx4.

Using the Drosophila gut as our model host and E.coli as our microbiome component, we developed techniques to engineer the gut microbiome. The E. coli was engineered to fluoresce GFP or RFP when induced by arabinose, its localization in the gut confirmed by fluorescent microscopy of dissected gut. To increase uptake of e. coli, it was mixed with bakers yeast, thus coexistence of 3 species was required to deliver the bacteria to fly gut, When continuously fed, the bacteria remained in the gut, but removing bacteria from food led to a gut residence time of E. coli of 24 hours. The work showed the resistance of the host to establish a foreign persistent microbiome; future work would involve engineering a more native bacterial species such as Lactobacillus to increase gut residence time.'",['Foundational Advance']
1340,"b'In synthetic biology, building complex logic circuits are often difficult, especially in a single cell population. It requires many non-crosstalking information processing units such as quorum sensing (QS) factors, to work within a cell without significant interference. However, these non-crosstalking QS factors are very limited. Furthermore, even for simple circuits, one has to create de novo which can be difficult for beginners. It would be ideal to use modularized parts assemble directly into circuits. Therefore, we aimed to create a multilayer signal-processing system by using compartmentalized QS factors. We have provided proof-of-concept data and modeling to show that our system would allow faithful information flow between bacterial population. Also, we aimed to build QS part libraries to allow easily switching of parts, changing signal inputs and outputs without de novo cloning.

What is the determination of the formation of behaviors and how to control it? Taking the response to alcohol of C.elegans as an example, a platform of optofluidics is established to provide deeper insights into these questions. Expression of two channelrhodopsins in the olfactory receptor neuron pair provides worms with the preference and aversion to specific wavelengths, and the lights are employed to reinforce their addictive or abstemious attitude to alcohol. The neo-behaviorism theory is expected to be verified in C.elegans, demonstrating the learning capability of model organisms based on both behavioral observation and quantification at the molecular level. Hopefully, downstream neurons of the new-learned behavior will be revealed by using this platform, and it depicts a future of training human brains through optogenetics.'",['Foundational Advance']
1342,"b'Synthetic biologists over the years have regulated protein expression using two types of regulators - transcriptional and translational. While transcriptional regulators are easily composable and are capable of regulating multiple genes(operons) and complex genetic circuits, they are difficult to engineer. On the other hand, translational regulators are not capable of regulating multiple genes and complex genetic circuits but can be easily engineered de novo using predictive thermodynamic models. Hence an ideal regulator is found wanting, one which is capable of regulating multiple genes simultaneously and at the same time easily engineerable. ReguloGEM provides such a regulator based on the tnaC operon. This regulator termed the Adaptor is capable of converting the translational regulatory property of riboswitches into transcriptional regulation. The Adaptor will be tested using temperature and pH sensitive riboswitches.

In this project, we want to develope a QS tool kit for Gram-positive bacteria. We will build this tool kit based on the Agr system from S.aureus, the PlcR-PapR system from Bacillus cereus, and the AimR-AimP system from the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage Phi3T.

At this interphase, our project wants to introduce Peptidosomes as a new fundamental approach for generating and applying encapsulated bacteria. These spheres possess advantageous properties like stability in different media and a mesh-like structure that allows for the selective exchange of compounds via diffusion. Therefore, we are able to benefit from the entrapped cells abilities, while ensuring that they are not released into their surroundings. Using the powerful genetics of Bacillus subtilis and its secretory capabilities we demonstrate communication and cooperation between separately encapsulated bacterial populations as well as the environment. Peptidosomes can be further enhanced by incorporating magnetic or biological beads  which can be functionalized with proteins  into their peptide-based shell.

To enhance enrichment of desired variants Team UAlberta designed a protein-protein interaction assay based on the reconstitution of adenylate cyclase in Escherichia coli to accelerate screening for successful variants. We have built two constructs to act as reporters for our system. The first contains genes required for gas vesicle formation and bacterial buoyancy while the second encodes for fluorescent proteins. Our current efforts are focused on characterizing and validating our system using well-characterized protein interactions and our reporters.'",['Foundational Advance']
1347,"b'We are developing optogenetic tools to improve two areas of human life: architecture and regenerative medicine. In contrast to current mechanical and chemical methods for gene control, our light-based strategies allow for the precise spatiotemporal and non-invasive control of complex gene circuits. To minimize the usage of electricity for illumination and fossil fuels for building materials, we are testing the feasibility of optogenetics to provide an eco-friendly and sustainable alternative. We are engineering bacterial cells that i) control their bioluminescence in response to day/night cycles and ii) can be directed by light to form physical structures out of biodegradable plastic. Additionally, to address the scalability and speed issues in tissue engineering, we are developing an optical guidance system for inter-cell adhesion and directed gene expression of mammalian cells for tissue generation. This will enable fast in situ cell adhesion for tissue-specific organ healing.'",['Foundational Advance']
1348,"b'Incell is a new synthetic biology platform with near future applications in research, industry and services. We are rewriting natures code for endosymbiosis and transforming an evolutionary phenomenon into a technology compatible with standard biological parts. Our vision is to produce synthetic hostendosymbiont systems. We set out with a trinity of experiments intrinsic to the synthetic reconstruction of endosymbiosis. First, creating and sustaining dependence between a host and its endosymbionts by fulfilling the amino acid requirement of an auxotrophic host. Next, to build a modular system of cell-penetrating peptides for protein transport of host nuclear encoded proteins into an endosymbiont, recapitulating a crucial feature of the natural process. Finally, regulating the number of endosymbionts within a host using a CRISPR-Cas system for control of replication. Further ahead we see a safe, customisable, sustainable technology providing biological solutions to present and future challenges in biotechnology, agriculture and medicine.'",['Foundational Advance']
1349,"b'Despite the fundamental role transcription factors play, they place many constraints on experimental designs due to limited types available. Synthetic guide RNA can be modulated to match existing promoters, allowing for targeted regulation without the need for DNA manipulation. Inspired by Ganders study, Digital logic circuits in yeast with CRISPR-dCas9 NOR gates, we have decided to build a NOR gate, whose output is controlled via inducible production of gRNA-complexed dCas9. First, we will create four different strains of yeast, each representing a stationary state. The system has two different gRNA; the expression of either results in the inhibition or transcription of yeGFP. Finally, we will create another strain containing a NOR gate, whose different output states can be modified by controlling the production of both gRNAs using different inducible promoters. Thus, our project verifies regulated recruitment using synthetic guide RNA as a viable alternative to conventional transcriptional regulatory modules.'",['Foundational Advance']
1350,"b'Gene copy number serves as a fundamental parameter in the dynamics of synthetic gene circuits, but is often not explicitly considered. Coupled with transcriptional and translational regulation, copy number control would offer an effective coordination and increased dynamic range of multiple gene expression. Therefore, we modified the ColE1 replicon to develop a synthetic origin of replication - SynORI - which enables the alteration of plasmid copy number. SynORI framework also incorporates a multi-plasmid regulation system based on uniquely barcoded regulatory RNA molecules, allowing to co-maintain different-group plasmids at preselected copy numbers in a standardized manner. In case certain plasmids are chosen to have a low copy number, an active partitioning system will minimize the risk of plasmid loss and increase the stability of our system. SynORI enables the creation of more complex metabolic pathways, smart assembly of protein complexes and a more precise information processing in synthetic biology.'",['Foundational Advance']
1351,"b'By providing a well-defined, biocompatible surface coating, the risk of bone and dental implant failure will be greatly reduced. We aim to accomplish this by controlling the spatial production of extra-cellular cellulose with light. Our modified E.coli builds on previous teams work, utilising a transmembrane protein complex, which upon exposure to red light, phosphorylates a promoter and initiates the synthesis cascade. Using this technology, our team will be able to build a 3D printer where living bacteria act as the bioink. Our team will then be able to produce cellulose structures, featuring micrometer pores, which mimic the surface of broken bone, for implants. This structure has been shown to promote osseointegration, helping to reduce overall failure rates.'",['Foundational Advance']
1352,"b'Prions are perhaps most famous for their implication in neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are also proteins that bear strong similarities to prions while not being associated with an infectious disease. These proteins have been deemed functional prions. Here, engineered functional prions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provide a proof of concept for using prions as a tool in synthetic biology to co-localize different proteins. These engineered proteins have prion-like aggregative behaviour, as well as a fluorescent tag. They will be used to test the viability of using engineered prions to bring and keep proteins in close proximity to each other while maintaining their function.'",['Foundational Advance']
1353,"b'It has become apparent that a fundamental principle of cellular signal processing is the encoding of information within the temporal dynamics of regulatory circuits. For synthetic circuits to achieve the versatility and effectiveness of endogenous circuits, it is necessary to develop simple, effective methods to control a circuits speed. Current approaches to speed control are too complex for widespread use we lack a modular system that allows one to swap out a sequence to predictably change a genes speed just as swapping an RBS can change the genes expression strength. To address this need, we developed a BioBrick suite of degradation tags associated with an E. coli-orthogonal protease, providing the parts and characterization necessary for controlling genetic circuit speed in a simple, modular, and predictable way. Additionally, we created a searchable database of previous iGEM teams outreach projects, designed to better enable future teams to build upon previous outreach efforts.'",['Foundational Advance']
1354,"b'Synthetic biologists often reach for a handful of well characterized organisms when designing experiments due to their ability to be reliably engineered with standard protocols. However, there are many non-model organisms that perform useful functions, survive extreme environments, or are optimized to produce certain materials which are largely ignored because the methods of engineering them are not well established. The broad host range kit aims to use genetic parts that function in a wide range of bacteria to make this process more efficient. The kit contains a combination of plasmid parts and assembled plasmids with origins of replication known to function in diverse bacteria. Each origin is linked to a fluorescent protein or chromoprotein so successful transformations can be easily identified when plated. Additionally, origins are associated with a specific barcode that can be sequenced to confirm the assembly. Several assemblies containing broad host range origins have been constructed.'",['Foundational Advance']
1355,"b'Bioengineering uses stable, highly productive mutants, target strains, which contain foreign genes. However, screening these mutants costs vast time and workforce, and it is difficult to avoid using antibiotics. We applies synthetic biology methods, constructing a novel pathway to screen mutants by giving target strains growth advantages. Here, utilizing AND gate, the gene of interest expresses to a certain level, making the downstream pchAB gene express and catalyze the generation of salicylic acidSA. SA can activate the expression of glucose dehydrogenase, which gives the target strains an additional growth advantage. Besides, we integrate the most important control module of the system into the genome using Chemically Inducible Chromosomal Evolution(CIChE). In summary, the target strain will finally obtain the greatest growth advantage in bacterial suspensions and achieve screening internally. This new screening method is simple to operate and provides a new idea for antibiotic-free screening.'",['Foundational Advance']
1356,"b'BostonU is characterizing and optimizing two light-inducible promoters, LOV2 and PhiReX, in S. cerevisiae to improve eukaryotic transcriptional control with applications in industrial fermentation. Light-inducible promoters lend greater spatiotemporal control over transcription than small molecule-inducible promoters. Further, LOV2 is activated by blue light and PhiReX by red light, allowing for multiplexed control. We characterize these systems using the eVOLVER, a novel automated cell culturing platform developed by Brandon Wong at Boston Universitys Khalil Lab. The eVOLVERs specificity and high throughput allows for unprecedented characterization across light pulse programs, temperature, and OD thresholds. We then apply LOV2 and PhiReX to the violacein pathway, demonstrating the induction of four distinctly-colored phenotypes in a single strain, providing a proof-of-concept for the multiplexed control and finely-tuned expression of genes required for effective control of metabolic flux via transcriptional regulation.'",['Foundational Advance']
1357,"b""The ideal medicine is not a perfect treatment - it's a cure. Gene therapy, by correcting the genetic basis of disease, may represent humanity's best chance to develop such ultimate health solutions. Despite its unbounded potential, gene therapy is constrained by safety concerns surrounding existing gene transfer technologies. Highlighting a path forward, the 2018 Calgary team has developed a targeted gene integration strategy that leverages CRISPR knock-in, FLP recombinase vector integration and beta-resolvase backbone excision. Extending the integration strategy, the team tested chromatin-modifying elements to reduce variability in therapeutic gene regulation, built a droplet microfluidic device for a scalable gene transfer system, and developed a search tool to help iGEMers find past teams' software. As an extensible platform, the strategy promises greater reproducibility for transgenic research and industrial applications. As a vision for the future, the approach represents a shift away from legacy technologies and towards a safer gene therapy.""",['Foundational Advance']
1358,"b'As the field of synthetic biology grows, it becomes increasingly necessary to have a reliable cell signaling platform that is more resilient to noise than traditional promoter-controlled systems. This year, we developed a robust new paradigm for cellular signaling based on frequency, rather than amplitude-based signals. Our system is analogous to a band-pass filter in electronics; the bacteria respond only to signals of an intermediate frequency, but not those of low or high frequency. By adding tunable degradation tags to proteins in the system, it is possible to frequency at which the reporter was expressed. Versatile deterministic and stochastic models were developed by our team and used to simulate and predict properties of the system. Creating a more robust paradigm for cellular signaling has several implications for the future of synthetic biology, including advancements in biological data storage and computing, chemical production, and biosensing.'",['Foundational Advance']
1359,"b'Release of the living prokaryotic chassis used in synthetic biology outside of laboratory conditions can cause unforeseeable damage to the environment and the ecosystems present there. However, the inability to release synthetic biology inhibits its usefulness, and limits its potential in solving global and localised problems. At team Maxed OOT we believe we have the solution Maxicells! Maxicells are achromosomal E. coli cells that cannot replicate. Maxicells remain metabolically active following the loss of their chromosome and express genes given to them on an instructor plasmid. In our project we analyse the most efficient methods for maxicell production, quantify their active metabolic timeframe, and characterise them as a biosensor. Additionally, we present our triple lock system for preventing horizontal gene transfer. The resulting novel chassis could re-contextualise many previous Synthetic Biology projects and open doors for the field as a whole.'",['Foundational Advance']
1360,"b'Communication is Key is a universal principle that applies to all levels of organization: from microbial colonies to human social networks. Communication helps single-celled organisms to determine their collective fate by quorum sensing, and individual footballers to coordinate the winning goal for their team (Allez les bleus!). However, if the language used to communicate has limited vocabulary, its hard to have any meaningful conversation. Synthetic bacterial consortia are currently engineered using a very small set of signalling molecules for cell-to-cell communication, thus limiting the potential of this powerful technology. In our project, PepTalk, we repurpose the small peptide based signalling system of SPbeta group bacteriophages for application in the more widely used laboratory workhorse Escherichia coli by engineering hybrid E. coli promoters in order to demonstrate orthogonal communication channels between cells. The PepTalk system will expand the repertoire of unique bacterial communication signals, enabling more complex conversations in bacterial consortia.'",['Foundational Advance']
1361,"b'The idea of this project is the improvement of biocatalytic properties of enzyme cascades using surface-layer (S-layer) proteins. S-layers are prokaryotic protein membranes which assemble into two-dimensional lattices with different symmetries. As components of a model system, the S-layer proteins SbsB (p1, Geobacillus stearothermophilus), PS2 (p2, Corynebacterium glutamicum) and RsaA (p3, Caulobacter crescentus) were isolated. In solution these S-layer proteins arrange into three-dimensional nanostructures. Cluster formation of S-layer proteins was examined by mixing different symmetries (p1, p2 and p3). Structure formation was predicted with Monte-Carlo Markov chain simulations. To explore novel potential applications, S-layer proteins were conjugated with Streptavidin. Thus, various biotinylated fluorescence markers can be applied for FRET analysis. This can serve as model system for S-layer conjugates with biocatalysts.'",['Foundational Advance']
1362,"b'QUESTION: Can sound be used to induce gene expression in E. coli? IMPACT: It is routine to use a small molecule to induce gene expression in cells. Can sound become a routine means to induce gene expression? The Human Practices Team revealed that success in using sound to induce gene expression in cells has the potential to impact the brewing industry and molecular biology research. A potential negative impact could be the activation of pathogenic cells with sound guns. RESULTS: We characterized promoters submitted by the 2008 UC Berkeley team that potentially could be activated by sound. In parallel, we selected additional promoters that also have the potential to be induced by sound. We tested the promoters in new genetic devices to evaluate if different sound frequencies and amplitudes correlated with increased gene expression. The results of the tests are available on the wiki and will be presented.'",['Foundational Advance']
1363,"b'Contact-dependent signaling is critical for multicellular biological events, yet customizing contact-dependent signal transduction between cells remains challenging. Here we have developed the ENABLE toolbox, a complete set of transmembrane binary logic gates. Each gate consists of 3 layers: Receptor, Amplifier, and Combiner. We first optimized synthetic Notch receptors to enable cells to respond to different signals across the membrane reliably. These signals, individually amplified intracellularly by transcription, are further combined for computing. Our engineered zinc finger-based transcription factors perform binary computation and output designed products. In summary, we have combined spatially different signals in mammalian cells, and revealed new potentials for biological oscillators, tissue engineering, cancer treatments, bio-computing, etc. ENABLE is a toolbox for constructing contact-dependent signaling networks in mammals. The 3-layer design principle underlying ENABLE empowers any future development of transmembrane logic circuits, thus contributes a foundational advance to Synthetic Biology.'",['Foundational Advance']
1364,"b'In vivo circular RNA expression can be a cutting edge method to perform mass-production of protein. During the translation of coding information of DNA into amino acids, function of ribosomes is naturally influential. The translation is initiated by binding ribosomes to mRNA and termination of translation is induced by a stop codon. When a start codon is recognized by ribosomes, the protein producing organelles release the protein. To produce large amount of protein and long-chain protein we can utilize circular RNA without the stop codon. iGEM Gifu 2015 performed the method of the Permuted Intron-Exon Method (PIE method). Currently 2.5% of transcribed RNA can be formed as circular RNA. With PIE method, mass-production of protein was confirmed in E.coli, however the protein had no function because of aggregation. This year our team will try to produce functional protein from the circular RNA in PURE system, a kind of cell-free system.'",['Foundational Advance']

This year, we plan to expand the toolkit for A. baylyi ADP1 by making a synthetic promoter library along with codon optimized fluorescent reporter proteins to achieve better control over its expression rates. The codon table is not available for this organism. So we obtained sequence data of well-characterised proteins of this organism by filtering manually putative and hypothetical sequences and used this data to generate the codon table using CUTE - a tool of ChassiDex. The codon optimisation is done manually by replacing the less frequent codons with high-frequency codons based on the generated table.

1367,"b'With the growth of synthetic biology, there has been an increase in the development of digital synthetic circuits, which requires biological logic gates that can accept a binary input and generate a suitable binary output. Often biological systems are unable to provide sharp and accurate input to output response due to reasons like noise, growth factors etc. Hence there exists a need of robust and reliable modules that can transform the analog and stochastic behaviour of biology into a digital response. We aim to develop recombinase based elementary constructs that would allow development of complex circuits with specialized functions with greater ease. Recombinases are enzymes that trigger site-specific recombination to perform excision/incision or inversion of genetic circuits, to produce the desired gene expression.

It functions through altering transcriptional activation of the SoxR/PsoxS redox-signalling system by controlling the oxidation of redox-mediators using an electrode. The potential of this system for precise spatial control is demonstrated using an affordable, custom electrode array to induce pattern formation in a lawn of cells. Patterning was a necessary condition for the evolution of complex multicellular life, and as such the programmable patterning demonstrated serves as an essential tool for the development of multicellular synthetic biology.'",['Foundational Advance']
1369,"b"" Many strategies could be used by bacteria to coordinate temperature-dependent gene expression. A well-known class of biological temperature sensitive element is RNA-based thermosensor, which is thermoregulatory RNA sequence in the 5'-untranslated region of mRNAs. RNA thermosensors could induce equilibrium shift between closed and open conformations of the translation initiation region under temperature variation condition, and lead to mRNA degradation or ribosome accessibility, thereby controlling the efficiency of translation initiation. However, natural RNA-based thermosensors are difficult to be engineered with the narrow sensing temperature range. Therefore, this year based on free-energy method, we designed a series of synthetic RNA-based thermosensors, which can be engineered easily with broader sensing range. Then, we predicted their theoretical sensing temperature, detected the practical threshold by experimenting setting temperature gradient, and built the standard parts collection.""",['Foundational Advance']
1370,"b'Antibiotic resistance is a major concern worldwide, estimated to cause 1 death every 4 minutes. Antibiotics for fatal infections such as tuberculosis and pneumonia have become less effective due to bacterial resistance to drug-based treatments. This phenomenon has led pharmaceutical companies to develop new antibiotics to try overcome this problem. However, this is costly and contributes to the emergence of multi-resistant bacterial strains. Throughout the years bacteria have developed mechanisms to resist antibiotics such as DNA mutagenesis, cell wall modification and other; most involve various bacterial proteins that have been modified or repurposed to protect bacteria. It has been shown that down-regulating these proteins expression helps maximise the effects of antibiotics. Therefore, our team aim to engineer a library of sRNAs, providing a platform for new tools to regulate gene expression. Our approach therefore synergises with current antibiotic treatment regimes, creating an innovative therapeutic tool.'",['Foundational Advance']

This year we focused on Na+ which is basic ion in biology, and desalination system can be realized by salvaging Na+ in solution as paste of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by applying two attributes. One is highly Na+ uptake of their plasma membrane and vacuolar by transfer of transporters. The other is surface interaction aggregation system using SdrG-Fg protein connection through surface display.

PNC design will be facilitated by our software platform, enabling informed selection of cell-targeting surface modifications, encapsulation proteins, and cargo-loading approaches tailored to the intended application. PNCs have wide-ranging utility from targeted drug delivery and gene therapy to materials synthesis and distribution of biological control agents. With the simplified design, standardized protocols, and modular components, less experienced users will be able to design and produce PNCs in a basic laboratory environment.

By taking advantage of its unbeaten doubling time of 7 minutes, we substantially reduced waiting time and made one-day-cloning a reality. We built and characterized a flexible golden-gate-based part collection, consisting of more than 100 parts, which enables the creation of complex pathways in a short amount of time.

We designed a testing platform for comparing engineered Cas9 variants to the natural form through direct competition. Our model relies on competition between two Cas9s from Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus as a proof of concept in an assay termed Guardian/Assassin.

The upstream of this genetic circuit uses synNotch to transduce extracellular signals into cells. The concentration of signals corresponds to different threshold values, and the system can respond accordingly under different concentrations. We achieved some level of logical effects by applying recombinase\'s reverse mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of downstream output.

We employed bioinformatics algorithms to analyze the function and conservation of various parts of the original mitochondrial genome, providing a criterion for determining the non-essential sequences that could be deleted. The complexity of the mitochondrial genome sequence, low GC content and the existence of local GC clusters make it difficult to synthesize the genome, which was solved by specialised separation, parameter optimization, etc. This genome will be transferred into S. cerevisiae cells that have lost mitochondria genome, verify their function, feed back the result and optimize our original design.'",['Foundational Advance']

To tackle the size issue, we developed novel compact Cas9 protein scaffolds that, when fused to deaminase domains, will be both small enough to fit into delivery vehicles and only exhibit sufficient editing activity for downstream therapeutic applications. With our human practice, similar efforts were made on analogous RNA modifications using the Cas13 protein family.

Recent work has shown that another Cas family protein, Cas13, can target and degrade specific RNA transcripts, thus effectively silencing target gene expression. The targeting of RNA strands has many advantages over DNA, as any changes are not permanent and its effect is transient. Our project aims to extend the application of CRISPR-Cas13 guided RNA targeting system for editing specific RNA bases on RNA strand (RESCUE system).

1382,"b'This year, we design a toolkit focused on post-transcriptional regulation, which is composed of a RNA endoribonuclease (Csy4) and a RNA module named miniToe. Csy4 (Csy6f), a member of CRISPR family, recognizes a specific 22nt hairpin. The RNA module was constructed by inserting the 22nt Csy4 recognition site between a RBS and cis-repressive RNA element, which can be specifically cleaved upon Csy4 expression, so the RBS is usually masked. Cleaved at the specific recognition site, it can release the masked RBS, thus endowing the programming of gene expression in the translation level with higher feasibility. We want to use one system to achieve diverse expression of target gene. So we further design four Csy4 mutants and five miniToe mutants. The whole system including five Csy4s and six miniToes is called miniToe family. By combining each Csy4 and hairpin, we can achieve different expression level of the target proteins in a polycistron.'",['Foundational Advance']

Based on this principle, we fused interactional modules into homo-oligometric tags (HOTags) to form droplets in the yeast. Various interactional modules provide diverse control methods while different promoters alter the features and kinetics of our systems.

1384,"b'With the ever-growing demand for designing proteins with better sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and affinity, oligo-based site-directed mutagenesis has become instrumental and indispensable in Genetic Engineering. The conventional method is considered cumbersome, for it relies on replica-plating to screen the mutants based on the reversal in resistance and sensitivity to two antibiotics: Tetracycline and Ampicillin respectively. It also necessitates sub-cloning the mutated gene in an expression vector to ultimately express the mutant-protein. Our orthogonal system facilitates fluorescence-based screening of mutants, using a novel Red-Green Dual-Fluorescent GFP-mutant. While point-mutating the gene-of-interest, introducing a single point-mutation in the coding sequence of this GFP-mutant codes for its Green-Only isoform.

1385,"b'The unique properties of non-model bacteria can expand the applications of synthetic biology. However, currently there are few reliable tools for engineering non-model bacteria. A central obstacle to the development of such tools is the dependence of circuit expression on host machinery. To address this problem, we developed PORTAL, a system which uses T7 transcription and orthogonal ribosomes to insulate the circuit from host processes. We characterized PORTAL in four E. coli strains, Shewanella oneidensis, and Pseudomonas putida, comparing PORTAL-driven and host-driven expression of a reporter. To design orthogonal ribosomes, we created software that analyzes binding energies of 16S rRNA and determines the optimal orthogonality-promoting anti-Shine-Dalgarno mutations. We created a model that simulates the performance of PORTAL and shows that the system is minimally sensitive to metabolic differences. PORTAL presents a tunable virtual machine to facilitate insulated synthetic gene circuit expression in non-model bacteria.'",['Foundational Advance']
1386,"b'Inspired by the modularization, call-and-return and do-not-reinvent-the-wheel philosophy in computer programming, we came up with the idea of using the dCas9 to manipulate the expression of proteins and to implement complex logic in E. coli. Ideally, we would like to generate a versatile Library strain containing the CDS of commonly used proteins. Individuals would simply transform a much smaller Minimid which contains specific sgRNAs targeting the sequence of desired proteins into the Library strain, then the dCas9-sgRNA complex can control the expression. To show the practicality of the design, we tested the system in E. coli by using a series of simple logic circuits based on dCas9-sgRNA complex, with fluorescent proteins as reporters. We also thought about the further application of our design in the synthesis of indigo and try to modularize two enzymes that participated. This project will contribute to the construction of engineered bacteria and green manufacturing.'",['Foundational Advance']
1387,"b'Input, controller, and output have been the standard procedure of engineered regulatory biocircuit. However, the precise input-to-output control may fail at times mainly due to (i) delayed responses from input signals to output signals, and (ii) unexpected interactions between the host and exogenous circuits. For example, previous iGEM projects primarily focused on the single time response of systems, which underestimated the fact that continuously changing inputs may cause the disorder of output signals. Therefore, a system needs to be constructed for rapidly responding to the changing input signals and eliminating the superposition between outputs from different input signals. In this context, we design a high-fidelity control system with a feedback loop and orthogonal ribosome, which allows the outputs to respond precisely to the changing input signals. We envision that our control system will offer the synthetic biology community a novel solution to manipulate uncertain input.'",['Foundational Advance']
1388,"b'Sugar is the main source of energy for the cell factories used in synthetic biology. However, its massive production has dramatic impacts on the environment. Therefore, in order to bring a solution to this serious environmental issue, we want to engineer a green microalgae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtti, to allow an ecofriendly sugar production within marine waters, limiting the competition with arable lands. Moreover, to be able to spread the use of microalgae as a chassis, more genetic tools to engineer it are still required. To do so, we will enrich the recently developed Modular Cloning (MoClo) toolkit for C. reinhardtti with a synthetic retrotransposon to generate in vivo continuous directed evolution. It will be the first time that such genetic tool is applied to non-baring plasmid cells such as microalgae. This approach enables the generation of new proteins with tailor-made functional properties as well as the optimization of biological systems.'",['Foundational Advance']
1389,"b'With rapid development of Molecular and Cellular Biology, we know more about what\'s in a cell but still know little about how cells interact among populations. Cell-Cell Interactions form a complicated signaling network which is far beyond our imagination. SUSTech 2018 Team developed a ""time-saving machine"" to study cell signaling networks based on genetically engineered Two-Cell system, a Secreting and Responding cell. Wnt signaling pathway was our proof-of-principle. Secreting cells secret Wnt signal and were modified by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout system for genetic screening on Wnt secretion. Responding cells were constructed by inserting a strong TCF promoter with GFP fluorescence for visualization of Wnt signal level. Two types of cells were then encapsulated by our microfluidic system producing thousands of Two-Cell droplets at a time. Unlike traditional coculture method, this is time-saving. In future, our systems may have wider applications in synthetic biology, drug screening and immunological recognitions.'",['Foundational Advance']
1390,"b'CRISPR-Cas technology has the capability of storing information. This year, iGEM team Tec-Monterrey aims to use the CRISPR-Cas system to store specific DNA sequences in the genome of E. coli in order to save information about the environment surrounding the bacteria. To make this possible, Cas1-Cas2 proteins, which create the protospacer acquisition in the CRISPR system, are used to insert a synthetic DNA sequence in the CRISPR array within the genome of the bacteria. This synthetic sequence is produced by a second system, called SCRIBE. The final step of our project is reading out the inserted DNA sequence. Using specific primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are used to amplify a section of the CRISPR array where the sequence is inserted. Taking together both systems, our project intends to act as a biological tape recorder capable of sensing external stimuli in the environment and storing their presence in the genome.'",['Foundational Advance']
1391,"b'Biological systems are unpredictable, noisy and difficult to maintain stable even under standardized conditions, thus making controlled gene expression difficult. Combined with the fickleness and stochasticity associated with genetic circuitry, fluctuations in the production rate of a desired protein are inevitable. Through model-driven design, we engineer systems which guarantee constant gene expression, decoupled from gene/plasmid copy number, that can be induced to meet the desired expression level. We implement a Type I incoherent feedforward loop in E. coli cells to stabilize promoters using TAL Effectors, CRISPRi and cis-acting sRNA repressors that regulate a downstream attenuator. Furthermore, to render our system versatile, we introduce a theophylline riboswitch that allows on-the-fly control of stabilized protein production. We provide a foundational advance tool that enables fine tuning of complex metabolic pathways, functionality improvement of logic gates and suppression of fluctuations in gene expression.'",['Foundational Advance']
1392,"b'Organisms are adapted to the relentless cycles of day and night thanks to circadian clocks which regulate biological activities with ~24-hour rhythms. This year, we reconstruct KaiABC clock system in the bio-rhythm expression of yeast. This will not only perfect the experimental data of the template xenotransplantation, but also provide more reliable materials in regulating and exploring the oscillation. Correlated with the yeast two-hybrid technique, reporter genes help detect the results of our construction. To work as a powerful heterologous regulator, we investigate the regulatory mechanism of the clock through the systematic alteration of chromosome topology. And a novel application we envisioned was that S. cerevisiae can produce different products alternately under the periodic regulation day and night.'",['Foundational Advance']
1393,"b'In modern medicine treatment options involve many substances modified from natural sources, occasionally even toxins. We modify botulinum toxin in a way that leads to its detoxification. Thus, it can be coupled with a variety of other substances while not losing its specific shuttle mechanism for neuronal cells. In detail, we develop a library of different detoxified botulinum toxin derivatives which can accommodate other proteins, small molecules, and fluorochromes by specific linkers. To investigate the influence of the point mutations leading to detoxification in the active site, we conduct MD simulations. Since our shuttle mechanism could potentially be used in patients, we remove the most prevalent immune epitopes by a theoretical bioinformatics approach. Ultimately, our system is supposed to be utilized for therapy strategies and specific neuronal targeting in basic research. With our project we want to encourage future teams to think outside the box while keeping safety in mind.'",['Foundational Advance']
1394,"b'Metabolic engineering aims to produce complex high-value compounds for industry from simpler and cheaper substrates by enhancing rates of reaction. The rates of metabolic reactions can be greatly enhanced by substrate channelling, which spatially brings together the enzymes of a multi-step reaction, increasing the effective concentration of metabolic intermediates. We have designed a novel protein scaffold that specifically and covalently co-localises enzymes in a modular system. Our Assemblase system consists of a heterohexameric complex of a highly thermostable and chemical resistant archaeal protein, prefoldin, which has been engineered to recruit enzymes using covalent protein-protein interactions. The design is being tested with a two step enzyme pathway to produce the horticultural plant hormone, indole 3-acetic acid, from tryptophan. We propose that the Assemblase system could be used for accelerating the production of pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals, bioremediation and as a foundational research tool.'",['Foundational Advance']
1395,"b'Quorum sensing is a mechanism for communication within and between bacterial populations, and it presents interesting possibilities for biotechnology in controlling populational behavior, ranging from task division in bioprocesses to biofilm disruption in infections. However, to generate complex patterns in a predictable manner, orthogonality between different quorum sensing pathways is essential, so the toolkit of quorum sensing parts needs to be thoroughly characterized, expanded and optimized so that this technology may see its full potential. Thus, our project aims to characterize activity and quantify the genetic crosstalk between a variety of quorum sensing systems that showed promising activity in prior works, while also using this information to predict, model and ultimately aid possible design applications and solutions for microbial communication. This way we will build on a growing bank of data of quorum sensing parts that will help future projects work with this technology.'",['Foundational Advance']
1396,"b'Biological part characterization is the core requirement for engineering complex, yet predictable biosystems. The immense complexity of nature makes this a challenging task. Currently, there is a considerable lack of well-defined, standardized parts and an insufficient grasp of their sequence-function relationship. Notably, state of the art screening methods have insufficient throughput to effectively navigate the extensive biomolecule sequence space. To address this issue we have developed a novel approach to part characterization based on microfluidics and modified nucleotides: Catalytic Activity Sequencing (CAT-Seq). CAT-Seq enables the simultaneous activity measurements of billions of biomolecule variants in parallel. Unique biomolecules are each synthesized in separate water droplets and their activity is recorded and stored into their individual DNA sequences. This information can then be readily retrieved by next-generation sequencing. CAT-Seq can rapidly assess sequence-function relationships, characterize regulatory parts, their interactions, and provide much-needed data for predictively designing novel biological systems.'",['Foundational Advance']
1397,"b'Membrane proteins (MPs) are an essential part of major cellular processes and key targets for drug development. Since distinct obstacles, including cell-toxicity and irreversible aggregation in hydrophilic environment impede MP research, we employ microfluidics and bottom-up forward engineering approach to revolutionize it. Octanol-assisted liposome assembly is implemented for synthesis of monodisperse cell-sized liposomes. We encapsulate modified MP assembly machinery alongside cell-free protein synthesis system within liposomes with excellent efficiency. This system serves as overarching framework for effective synthesis, folding, and competent insertion into the membrane of active prone-to-aggregate membrane proteins. We offer a full-synthetic microfactory that, coupled with directed evolution, solves contemporary problems in MP engineering. Additionally, synthetic liposomes enable building artificial logic gates and signaling pathways to study metabolic cascades and protein interaction completely noise-free. Utilizing liposomes as simplified synthetic models of living cells, SynDrop will facilitate scientists to step into fully controlled synthetic era of membrane protein research.'",['Foundational Advance']
1398,"b'Chemically induced dimerization (CID), in which two proteins dimerize only in the presence of a small molecule, has been widely used to control cell signaling, regulatory, and metabolic pathways, and used as logic gates for biological computation in living mammalian cells. However, few naturally occuring CID systems and their derivatives are currently available. Creating a CID system with desired affinity and specificity for any given small molecule remains an unsolved problem for computational design and other protein engineering approaches. To address this challenge, we have used a novel strategy to select CID binders from a vastly diverse combinatorial nanobody library. We have created new CID systems that can sense cholecalciferol and artemisinin. We are validating CID biosensors by a yeast three-hybrid system and built structural models to understand the small molecule-induced dimerization. Our work is a proof-of-concept that can be generalized to create CID systems for many applications.'",['Foundational Advance']
1399,"b'When a construct is added to a cell, resources are allocated towards expression of the construct. This creates additional cellular burden, making engineered bacterial populations less fit than the wild type. Over time, cells accumulate loss-of-function mutations within the construct, freeing cellular resources. These mutations increase cell fitness, prompting the mutation to sweep through the population. Therefore, the population cannot maintain the burden associated with the construct for a sustained number of generations. Our goal is to measure the growth rates of genetically modified cells to identify burdensome parts. We used the Ellis Labs burden monitor for E. coli to measure the burden of BioBricks from the iGEM Registry (Ceroni 2015). We transformed 500+ BioBricks into burden monitor DH10B E. coli and assayed growth rate versus GFP expression rate. We identified burdensome parts by analyzing measurements with a pipeline of scripts, determining growth rate reduction percentages against GFP expression rates.'",['Foundational Advance']
1400,"b'Remember the trojan horse? With this trick Greeks snuck into Troy. Inspired by this story we engineered Troygenics, molecular trojan horses, that enter and transform eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic pathogens including numerous fungi are a growing threat to crops, animals and humans. Common treatments lack specificity and are frequently overcome by resistances. In a novel mode of action, our Troygenics enter these pathogens via endocytosis and deliver a Cell Death Inducing System (CeDIS). Troygenics consist of modified M13 coat-proteins assembled by Escherichia coli and contain ssDNA encoding the specific CeDIS based on Cas13a. Pathogen-specific ligands fused to the coat proteins enhance uptake via endocytosis. We incorporated sophisticated biosafety mechanisms to achieve selective transformation of the targeted pathogen. Among other methods, we demonstrated the functionality of the Troygenics applying a self-developed low-cost microfluidic system. In conclusion, we engineered an innovative platform technology customizable to target various eukaryotic pathogens.'",['Foundational Advance']
1401,"b""To this date, many research and developments have been implemented but the primary source of development is still lagging, which is our autoclave. So we developed, steriport, a system that can sterilize and dispense the media within just 8-10 mins. The best thing about our model is that it's very handy in use and also portable. The sterilization is carried out by the action of AMPs such as Lantibiotic nisin-A, AlbB, and sporulation killing factor. These all are mass-produced by the use of chassis Escherichia coli BL21 DE3, and will mainly target on bacteria contaminants. For fungal contaminants, we make use of endophytes extracted from Holy Basil and Indian lilac. The main feature is the Ohmic heating and UV type C (inactivate or kill the contaminant). While, UV-C effects on human skin aren't harmful, but only irritable to the eyes, for that reason, we coated our UV chamber with acrylic.""",['Foundational Advance']

However, existing techniques for acquiring cell landscapes have defects such as complicated operation, time consuming, and destruction of cells. Our goal is to accurately reflect the landscape of cells by detecting several simple indicators such as fluorescent phenotypes. After in-depth communication, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of embryonic stem cells is used as our research vector. Our experiments focused on giving cells specific and regulatable fluorescent phenotypes, controlling EMT processes, monitoring fluorescence changes and collecting RNA omics data.'",['Foundational Advance']
1403,"b'We, iGEM GIFU_TOKAI, focus on mRNA and changing its topological form into circular to create a new method for mass-production of protein in cell-free system this year. In the current research of circular RNA (circRNA) for protein production, expressing tandem-repeated protein was generated by circRNA without a stop codon. It shows circRNA has a potential ability that it can skip the rate-limiting process of the central dogma of molecular biology, binding ribosomes to mRNA. However, with conventional circRNA, functional protein cannot be translated because protein aggregation quickly occurs. Therefore, we decided to use translation-coupling system, which is found in operons of bacteria to produce monomer protein from circRNA. With applying it to circRNA, ribosomes repeat translation-coupling phenomenon in circRNA and are expected to express monomer protein. Our final goal is to produce functional proteins such as antibodies more efficiently and cheaper in cell-free system to provide medicaments consistently'",['Foundational Advance']
1404,"b'DNA constitutes the book of life with all the instructions for survival and proliferation. What could happen without it? This question is at the heart of our project. The void in DNA-less cells led us to invite philosophers and haikus to illustrate our thoughts. Controlled expression of phage nucleases cloned in Escherichia coli generated cells without DNA. Could these dying bacteria host biosynthetic activities? Cells producing a nuclease along with methotrexate-degrading enzymes broke down this toxic anticancer drug showing that DNA-free cells could be used for bioremediation. In another attempt to repurpose DNA-free cells, we infected them with an RNA phage and could observe its proliferation, suggesting that our DNA-less cells may have transiently resembled cells that once thrived in the RNA world, i.e. cells where the replicating genetic information was carried by RNA instead of DNA. Our work opens interesting avenues in developing new kinds of DNA-free synthetic organisms.'",['Foundational Advance']
1405,"b'The conservation of biological diversity is required worldwide, and one measure to achieve this goal would be to confine living genetically-modified organisms in laboratories or plants to prevent them from outgrowing native organisms in environment. If Escherichia coli (E. coli), is endowed with the character of predetermined limited proliferability, such E. coli strain would be very useful for research and development. Here, we designed a system in which E. coli cells lyse spontaneously when they proliferate above certain densities by taking advantage of the mutual inhibition of T7 lysozyme and T7 RNA polymerase. On the other hand, advanced biotechnology cannot be utilized properly when the public does not understand their risk and benefit. As the Information Technology Literacy has become indispensable to everyone, the promotion of Genetic Literacy is now needed. We discussed the importance of Genetic Literacy with high school students by using up-to-date resources we prepared.'",['Foundational Advance']
1406,"b'Engineered genetic circuits have reached high complexity levels. These developments require transformation with more than one plasmid which in turn demands the simultaneous use of different antibiotics. Our aim is to enable transformation with multiple plasmids and just one antibiotic to minimize side-effects. In our study we describe a novel RNA-based approach that allows for selection of several plasmids with only one antibiotic. The strategy is based on toehold switches that easily and reliably introduce a complex AND-logic to our design, thus enabling the selection of bacteria with all required plasmids. Our new method shows clear advantages: it increases cell growth and decreases stress, pushing forward the boundaries of synthetic biology.'",['Foundational Advance']
1407,"b'A core concept of synthetic biology is controlling gene expression, often achieved through inducers and protein repressors to create feedback loops and switches. Our team has combined the CRISPRi system with RNA regulators to achieve a toggle switch. The switch utilizes the catalytically inactive form of Cas9 (dCas9) to achieve targeted and reversible repression of genes via specific single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Alternatively, the transcription of antisense RNA (asRNAs) reverses the effect of the dCas9 modulated repression on the desired genes. This method of regulation would allow for the ability to fine-tune and easily customize the execution of highly complex genetic circuits. Using GFP and RFP in our circuit as a proof of concept, RFP is suppressed under the first inducible promoter while GFP is produced. Under the second inducible promoter, the dCas9 is unable to bind to mrfp, derepressing mrfp and suppressing GFP.'",['Foundational Advance']

The current methods for performing directed evolution come with certain limitations, such as instability of hypermutator strains, toxicity of chemical mutagens and inability to evolve gene networks with error prone PCR. Our project aims to overcome these problems by developing a self-regulated system which can achieve tunable mutation rates in E.coli. To demonstrate the working of the system and to address a pressing local issue of lead pollution in water bodies, we aim to develop a lead biosensor and evolve a lead bioremediating strain for higher efficiency using our tool.'",['Foundational Advance']
1409,"b'With the development of gene editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, TALENS and Zinc finger nucleases gene therapy has become sophisticated enough to be clinically applied. Multiple gene therapy delivery systems are currently available, including viral vectors, but their clinical use is impeded by the capacity of these delivery vehicles. In addition to these gene editing technologies, RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression is another widely used application for gene therapies. The aim of our work was to investigate the fine tuning mechanisms for gene expression and synthetically engineer bacterial short RNAs to precisely regulate protein translation. We measured the level of the GFP protein fluorescence in E.coli with each sRNA BioBrick we created and have demonstrated that the gene expression level can be sufficiently regulated. Our molecular constructs and approach can be used to regulate the ratio of viral capsid proteins to advance novel gene therapy applications.'",['Foundational Advance']
1410,"b'While most iGEM teams were working with conventional chassis like E. coli and S. cerevisiae, phototrophic organisms were always underrepresented. To make it more feasible for other teams to work with phototrophic organisms, a fast growing and easy to handle chassis is necessary. For this purpose we establish Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 with a reported doubling time of 90min - as a viable chassis by developing strains tailored to various applications. Therefore, we restore its natural competence, establish the CRISPR/Cpf1 system for multiplexed genome engineering and enable the utilization of plasmids as a tool for rapid design testing. Furthermore, we expand last years Golden Gate based MoClo toolbox, and accelerate the complete cloning workflow by automating plating, colony picking and plasmid purification on the Opentrons OT-2. By providing our fast phototrophic chassis to the community, we would like to pave the way for other phototrophic organisms in synthetic biology.'",['Foundational Advance']
1411,"b'Cell coordination within a population depends on an individual cells ability to accurately receive and respond to extracellular stimuli from the environment and neighboring cells. Coordinating cellular motility, where cells move in response to external cues, is central to many physiological responses. For example, human neutrophils demonstrate migratory behavior towards chemokine gradients as part of the adaptive immune system. Here, we present a mechanism to harness cellular chemotaxis to control cellular swarming and directed movement. We engineered human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells to secrete chemokines that induce chemotaxis in unengineered neutrophils. To evaluate chemotaxis, we first differentiated HL-60 cells into chemotactic neutrophils. We then introduced chemokines produced by our engineered HEK cells and evaluated neutrophil movement utilizing several cellular migration assays. We anticipate our engineered system will provide insight into how immune systems develop as well as form a preliminary toolbox for recruiting mammalian cells selectively in tissue engineering applications.'",['Foundational Advance']
1412,"b'The discovery of the CRISPR tool has led to a real revolution, allowing genome editing to be controlled in a very specific way. However, this type of tool is not available when it comes to proteins. The first aim of the KARMA project was to create a new tool for specific protein degradation. In order to accomplish that, we thought about using a non-specific protease, to which we add a VHH that will act as a research head to make it more specific, and targeting a protein in a complex environment. We chose to perform a complete proof of concept using well-known systems, the TEV protease and a VHH against sfGFP, to characterize in detail whether this type of tool could be effective. We then considered the possible applications of this tool, particularly to counter the antibiotic resistance caused by outer antibiotic degrading-enzymes like beta-lactamases.'",['Foundational Advance']

Previous studies have revealed the critical contribution of glucagon and glucagon induced hepatic gluconeogenesis in the hyperglycemia of T2D patient. Here we demonstrate a designer cell approach to control hyperglycemia by degrading hepatic Glucagon Receptors (GCGR) in a glycemic dependent manner. We achieved glucose responsiveness by synthetic circuits that couple endogenous CHREBP glucose sensing pathway to a CHREBP activating hybrid promoter controlling GCGR degrading elements. The degradation of GCGR was then executed by proteasome-based system in a Trim21 based, Trim-away alike manner. Circuit-carrying HepG2 cells showed significantly decreased GCGR level and glucogenic ability, similar results were obtained in primary mouse hepatocytes with adenovirus as delivery approach as well.

1415,"b'Engineered organisms are being used to solve global problems today, from cleaning up our environment to diagnosing diseases. Yet, bottlenecks in engineered microbes lie in their limited functional lifespan and inherent stochasticity. We aim to overcome these limitations by engineering an on-off switch for the cells, giving the ability to control their productivity and extend their productive lifespan. Aided by modelling, we developed this switch using Toxin-Antitoxin modules which target global translational process and cellular metabolism to enable dormancy. Our technology allows the insertion of different input control modules to regulate these circuits in a plug-and-play manner. To ensure the safety and retainability of our circuits, a biocontainment module was designed to prevent the unwanted spread of our modules to other organisms. Finally, we successfully demonstrated regulated and lengthened productivity by using luminescence production.

1416,"b'Riboswitches can sense a wide range of small molecules and regulate gene expression. However, because of the diversity of downstream GOI, the structures of the riboswitch are often unstable. So riboswitch cannot be considered as modular components. This year, OUC-China aims to design modular riboswitch consisting of original riboswitch, stabilizer, and tuner from 5\' to 3\'. The stabilizer can stabilize the structure of the riboswitch. The tuner can reduce the expression probability of fusion protein and allow for predictable tuning. Then more tuners are designed to make diverse expression level. Finally, we use asRNA to change the on-off state of riboswitches. All in all, we create modular riboswitch and introduce asRNA so that gene expression in engineered systems can be more easily regulated.

Such system is highly tunable with multiple inputs, large dynamic range and non-detectable leakage. It functions in a gentle and reversible way without harming cell activities. Furthermore, we explored the potential of replication control in synthetic biology, including control of plasmid copy number and gene expression variation.

1418,"b'The design of protein-based cellular circuits offers the potential for rapid information processing. Previously, circuits were designed using kinases and proteases. Here, we propose two methods to design split-intein based cellular circuits. Upon association, split-inteins autosplice the flanking peptide sequences together to form functional proteins. Our first method involves the cascading splicing events through our nested intein design. This involves the insertion of an orthogonal split-intein within an intein half to render it nonfunctional. This creates a multi-input AND gate that can be incorporated into a larger cellular circuit. We propose a second method in which a weakly-associating intein is connected by a flexible linker. This linker is constructed from multi-input AND gates consisting of split-intein pairs, which avoids additional disruption of the extein sequence. We envision using our designed split-intein logic framework to create gene circuits capable of performing various Boolean logic operations through regulated splicing events.'",['Foundational Advance']
1419,"b'Transfection is an established technique to transiently modulate gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Liposome-mediated transfection increases cellular endosomal turnover and stimulates carrier induced autophagy. Transfection efficiency of commercially available liposomal reagents is frequently associated with cellular toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. These complications, in addition to its high cost, augment the unmet need for a cost-effective and less-toxic transfection reagent. Cell-Penetrating Peptides (CPPs) are short (<30 amino acids) linear peptides that facilitate the cellular uptake of diverse macromolecules. The broad range of their cellular targets and their limited toxicity qualify them as ideal carriers for cargo delivery. Our current project involves the novel application of a synthetic CPP for the direct delivery of interfering RNA in the context of transient gene silencing. The selected CPP delivers the un-bound cargo through pore formation and gets selectively targeted for proteasomal degradation, thus averting the possibilities of carrier induced autophagy and cytotoxicity.'",['Foundational Advance']

This system consists of three parts: two orthogonal light-controlled systems, the QS system which is designed for bi-directional communication, and the toxin/antitoxin system that can regulate the amount and ratio of the bacteria.

Specifically, we developed Directed Chassis-agnostic Evolution, or DiCE, a novel, easy-to-implement selection-based directed evolution platform built off Qbeta replicase, an RNA-based RNA polymerase, capable of evolving proteins in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we generated standard selection schema compatible with PREDCEL (Heidelberg 2017) to expand the range of synthetic biological parts that can be created by any SSS.

Our in-silico simulations revealed tRNA availability as a bottleneck in mRNA translation. Our goal was to enhance the applicability of V. natriegens by improving protein expression through increased tRNA availability. To establish a change towards sustainable cultivation of microorganisms, we used CO2 fixing phototrophic microalgae as a base for a climate-friendly substrate. In order to produce an algae-substrate, we cultivated Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella sorokiniana in a self-built bioreactor.

First is to effectively switch the input and to visualize the output of the whole regulation network, thus we transfected into HeLa cell a light-switchable transcriptional factor ""LightOn"" (2012, X.Wang et al) to control cytokine gene expression (input) in and we applied a microfluidics chip to directly observe the cell migration triggered by the cytokine expression (output). Second is to prevent the cell-cell variation during the experiment, hence we designed a automatic illumination and sample collection system to standardize the various factors in experimental conditions. Third, we calibrated mathematical models from experimental data to design input sequences for achieving desired dynamic range of protein expression.'",['Foundational Advance']
1426,"b'The goal of our project is to develop the autolytic yeast strain beneficial for biotech companies. The use of the strain as a basis for yeast cell factories will ease the extraction of valuable compounds from the cells. Usually, chemical cell lysis method is used but it is quite expensive and time-consuming for large scale production. To achieve our goal, we want to introduce extra copies of the genes encoding for yeast cell wall degrading enzymes (glucanases) and modify some enzymes involved in the cell wall biosynthesis. Initially, we will induce the production of glucanases and downregulate cell wall synthesizing enzymes to make the cell wall weaker and to promote releasing of the cellular content into the media. As a next step, we hope to develop a fully automated system to control lysis of the cells. The lysis will be self-activated at a certain point of the cell lifespan.'",['Foundational Advance']

Combination of treatments with antibiotics and mucolytics has become an alternative for treate- ments against P. aeuroginosa, an opportunist pathogen that grows in the respiratory tract of CF patients and has become their principal cause of death. We present a conceptual pipeline for the discovery of antibiotics using a variety of whole-cell biosensors that, when co-cultivated with secondary metabolite producers, sense the presence of antibiotics and the possible chemical identification of such compounds, using a mi- crofluidic system coupled to a mass-spectrometer; as well as a new treatment using a neuraminidase as a mucolytic to reduce the viscos- ity of mucines in CF patients lungs.'",['Foundational Advance']

With functionality determined entirely by the secondary structure of DNA, strand displacement has emerged as a highly adaptable artificial molecular system with programmable behaviour for cell-free biochemical networks. Through the exploitation of DNA Strand Displacement molecular computation, our toolkit is able to quantify and characterize DNA-Protein interactions. Our team has utilized the principles of DNA circuitry to shed light into the mechanisms of gene activation and transcription factor binding by introducing the protein's target sequence in the processing algorithm. As a proof-of-concept, transcription factors participating in metastatic melanoma are being examined through the lens of molecular programming, to elucidate potential intracellular pathways and therapeutic targets.

Cell fusion, as an effective way to exchange genetic material among distant species, is of great significance for the study of species evolution. The goal of iGEM Tianjin this year is to integrate a new chassis organism that contains a set of heterogeneous chromosome stabilization elements. To this end, we have combined Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytic yeast to establish a key component of the chromosome by centromere, and at the same time created a new system based on sequential single-base editing technology to characterize the fusion results.'",['Foundational Advance']
1430,"b'Engineering non-model bacteria is extremely laborious and expensive, which restricts the scope of synthetic biology to a small subset of the bacterial cosmos. In our project, we developed a tool that aims to expand the repertoire of bacterial species and broaden the range of substrates and environmental conditions which is currently used in synthetic biology. Sci-Phi 29 is a tool used to express genetic circuits independently of the bacterial host. Orthogonal replication of an exogenous DNA molecule is performed by the phi29 bacteriophage DNA replication system based on only four proteins. Furthermore, we developed a predictable and transferable expression system across multiple bacterial species. Our approach is based on an incoherent feed forward loop that ensures independence to DNA copy number and is robust to transcriptional and translational variations Sci-Phi 29 is a versatile platform to further explore the bacterial diversity providing new opportunities for the advancement of synthetic biology.'",['Foundational Advance']

1432,"b'Our goal is the development of a standardized, modular system based on biological nanoparticles to accelerate the research and development of novel vaccines, targeted drug delivery and other promising applications. The toolkit is based on virus-like particles (VLPs) which offer a multitude of desirable properties. VLPs are protein shells of viruses which are no longer infectious due to the lack of nucleic acids. For our purposes we use the bacteriophage P22 whose capsid can be produced via heterologous expression in variable hosts. The complex protein shell consists of two important compounds: the scaffold-protein (SP) and the coat-protein (CP). The CP is modified with an extension-tag. Therefore, an enzyme called sortase can connect any protein of interest which contains a corresponding tag. With the sortase modification the VLP functionality can be adapted to ones liking in no time, leading to a reduction in production and development costs for VLP-based technologies.'",['Foundational Advance']
1433,"b'Mammalian synthetic biology promises a future built on advances in personalized medicine, modeling, and manufacturing. However, fewer than 5% of iGEM teams have used mammalian cells in their projects. We examined the factors hindering the accessibility of mammalian synthetic biology, focusing on challenges that limit the rapid prototyping of synthetic systems. Specifically, we worked to simplify the process of characterizing mammalian parts and devices. Through our work characterizing the transfer functions of endogenous gene expression for light-activated CRISPR/dCas9-based effector (LACE) systems, we developed generalizable methods and tools that have application for LACE and other device classes. Our toolkit allowed us to make quantitative comparisons between multiple device variants and to explore the contextual dependence of device function in different cell lines and for multiple genes. We share our methods and propose these foundational advances may help accelerate the spread of mammalian synthetic biology throughout iGEM and beyond.'",['Foundational Advance']

In this project, we develop a library of flexible plasmids that adhere to the Standard and Type IIS Assembly and that allow for the systematic and efficient cloning of a desired gene within target yeast chromosomal loci, while maintaining the plasmids compatibility with E. coli. Our plasmid library targets the Ade2, His3, Ade4, and Gal4 loci, and is equipped with KanMX, NatMX, Ura3, and His3 yeast-selectable markers as well as RFP to enable colorimetric selection in E. coli. We use our experimental procedure to develop simple protocols to allow individuals with minimal laboratory experience to reproduce and expand our library. Finally, we endeavour to expedite and reduce the cost of cloning by making a DIY Gibson Assembly kit, in which all the required enzymes are harvested in the laboratory.'",['Foundational Advance']
1435,"b'Bioproduction, a industrial process that generates useful products through microorganisms, performed in bioreactors and occuring in two main steps: upstream (induction and production of bacterial metabolites) and downstream (isolation and purification). The most common inductor used in bioproduction are expensive chemical compounds (IPTG and arabinose) that lacks in control of what and how much metabolite can be produced. In this way, our goal is to built a genetic circuit that can switch between two different states of activation with just a single input of blue led light and to compare the efficiency between chemical and light inductors by seeing strength and lack. The circuit was built in E.coli and works based on inhibition handles and recombinases, inverting the promoter region according to the presence and absence of the same blue light input, as output fluorescent proteins are used. The project allows a more practical, controlled and economical bioproduction pathway.'",['Foundational Advance']
1436,"b'Synthetic biology aims to design cellular functions rationally. This goal often requires a signal input and for that chemical inducers are mostly used. However, chemical effectors are not optimal as they might cross-react with other pathways, be toxic, work with a delay, and are usually irreversible. In contrast, light-inducible systems are minimally invasive; also, the signal is delivered quickly and in high resolution. These features open new possibilities in research on how protein expression dynamics affect the operation of a synthetic circuit. To realize the potential of optogenetics in bacteria, we have created a three-level light-controlled system for dynamic bacterial control. It includes (1) a repressor based tool for tight transcriptional control, (2) a way to control steady-state protein levels by light-activated degradation, (3) a framework to maintain different plasmid copy numbers in bacterial growth and production stages. Thus Colight provides an innovative approach for real-time bacterial control.'",['Foundational Advance']
1437,"b'Although biosensors are commonly used to detect many different molecules of interest, they cannot effectively detect small hydrophobic molecules in biological systems. We propose combining chemically induced dimerization (CID), in which two proteins dimerize only in the presence of a ligand, with a traditional luciferase assay to create a biosensor that luminesces when the desired molecule is introduced. Using molecule-specific nanobodies, we can design the two CID binders to attach to a wide variety of small molecules, even those that are challenging for conventional biosensors to detect. Through its specificity and ability to bind to small or hydrophobic molecules, the CID system overcomes problems that other biosensors face. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented an in vivo CID biosensor to detect the presence of cannabidiol. With the nanobody CID system, we hope to introduce a novel biosensor that can detect a variety of important small molecules across research, biotechnology, and medicine.'",['Foundational Advance']
1438,"b'Our iGEM project aims to create a toolkit for the precise, controlled design of living biomaterials. Of the many forms of living materials, we have chosen bacterial biofilms due to their ubiquity and outstanding bioengineering potential. Biofilm formation, although frequently associated with deleterious effects, also equips bacteria with emergent properties such as increased resilience, complex signaling, self-repair, and division of labor. Our project harnesses these properties to repurpose biofilms as robust, spatially controlled, patterned, and responsive biomaterials. For robustness, we engineered a library of biofilm-strengthening adhesins, and investigated naturally biofilm-forming bacterial species. To adhere biofilms with precise spatiotemporal control, we incorporated both optogenetic and chemical induction methods. To pattern biomaterials once placed, we utilized the distance-dependent diffusion of quorum signaling molecules and generated Turing patterns that are informed by mathematical modeling. Our biomaterials have immediate applications in wound healing, water and waste treatment, and the creation of next-generation biosensors.'",['Foundational Advance']
1439,"b'The complex regeneration of biochemical energy sources represents a cost-intensive hurdle for many production and research processes. With M.A.R.S., we want to establish an innovative strategy to create light-powered, mitochondrion-like protocells and a bioreactor that will recycle those cells by magnetism. Through the design of our reusable recycling system it will be able to power every ATP-driven enzyme cascade, making M.A.R.S. universally applicable. By extracting bacteriorhodopsin out of Halobacterium salinarum, a phototrophic archaea species, and combining it with an ATP synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in self-produced polymersomes and liposomes, we get simple but effective chassis, which make it possible to cover the energy requirement of any enzyme reaction cascade. Binding those chassis to magnet particles via anchor peptides enables the reuse of the entire protocell system within the reactor by means of magnetic purification, whereby they can be fed directly into enzyme cascades, without depending on living cells.'",['Foundational Advance']
1440,"b'Tracing the lineage of cells is essential in answering diverse and fundamental questions in biology. In recent years, the method combing CRISPR/Cas9 and barcode, a DNA sequence as genetic marker, has attracted extensive attention in lineage tracing. However, the diversity of barcodes is limited and the constitutively expressed Cas9 consumes barcodes quickly. These make barcodes infeasible for the tracking purpose after several generations. We propose to track more generations by two ways. First, we build an inducible expression module of Cas9 in association with cell division to label each cell automatically without wasting barcodes. Second, we use homing guide RNA (hgRNA) to replace the small guide RNA (sgRNA) so that the diversity of barcodes can be increased greatly. In order to make the barcode sequence read at RNA level, we design a double promoter module, so that we can obtain the lineage information together with transcriptomic information.'",['Foundational Advance']
1441,"b'With the increasing antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria, we are entering the post-antibiotic era with no antibiotics available. Phage therapy is one of the promising strategies to fight against pathogenic bacteria. Synthetic biology provides the feasibility to engineer natural phages with desired properties suitable for phage therapy. Here, we are developing a yeast-based platform to genetically manipulate and reboot Coliphage T4, whose 168.9 kbp-sized genome is too huge to manipulate through existing methodologies. The whole T4 genome is amplified and assembled hierarchically through overlapping extension PCR, yeast transformation associated assembly, and CRISPR/Cas9-facilitated homologous recombination assembly. The reconstituted T4 genome is then electroporated into E. coli to generate phage particles. We expect that our platform is suitable for the manipulation of huge phages with large-sized genomes.'",['Foundational Advance']
1442,"b'DNA, RNA and proteins are the fundamental building blocks of synthetic biology and life itself.

To mediate interactions between all three core components of life more flexible we aim to harness the power and flexibility of RNAs We apply machine learning to design flexible RNA modules and binding proteins for assembling complexes of protein domains, RNA and DNA in a sequence-specific manner. In addition, we engineer trans-splicing ribozymes to reconfigure our RNAs and proteins at the transcript level.

Our project aims to develop a versatile set of tools that can help create and maintain stable phenotypic variation in cellular monocultures using bacteriophage-derived Cre recombinases, which recognize and invert a loxP-flanked genetic sequence in a stochastic manner. We introduced and assessed different mutations in the Cre enzyme to improve its accuracy and conducted pilot experiments for establishing ratiometric control of cellular phenotypes.

Incorporation of light-driven proton pump into non-phototrophic bacteria to produce additional proton motive force has gained interest in recent years as several bacterial rhodopsins are utilized for generating larger amounts of adenosine-5-triphosphate(ATP) for alleviating the metabolic stress caused by excessive reliance on glucose and supporting bioengineering reactions. We expressed functional Gloeobacter rhodopsin from ancient bacteria, Gloeobacter violaceus, on E. coli Lemo-21 and evaluated its growth and metabolic reactions and found it potent in creating alternative proton motive force for oxidative phosphorylation and eventually proved it to be ideal for improving protein and molecule yields.

In our project, we constructed mutants to reshape signaling pathway, trying to build a chassis that responds to cheaper inducers. We characterized the intensity of three mostly pheromone responsive promoters, pfus2, pprm1, and pfig1.

1447,"b'Exactitude temporal control of protein abundance is critical for the robustness and dynamics of synthetic circuits. While multiple approaches have been developed to manipulate the protein synthesis, few tools have been demonstrated to precisely control untagged protein degradation. Here, we present Predator Pro, a modularized and signal-controllable method for target protein degradation, on the basis of the Predator system we demonstrated in iGEM 2018-19. By rationally reengineer the Trim21 protein, we demonstrated that the interaction between Trim21 and antibody Fc domain can be replaced with other constitutive or inducible protein dimerization pairs. We demonstrated that constitutive DocS-Coh2 interaction or rapamycin-induced FRP-FKBP interaction enabled constitutive or drug-controlled degradation of untagged EGFP protein.

We believe that the best way to raise safety and confidence in synthetic biology products is by adding genetic biocontainment systems, which are genes and genome edits that give us control over the life of our microbes. These systems range from small genetic circuits of promoters and toxins to complete genomic rewrites, and weve compiled all of them into a simple, flexible database. To accompany this, weve developed predictive models and educational media, all with the express purpose of making biocontainment easier to implement and making synthetic biology safer for public use.'",['Foundational Advance']

First, to understand the perturbaility of the skin microbiome by individual habits such as hygiene, social interaction and exercise, which are all affected by this current unprecedented context of COVID-19 pandemia, we developed a community science project called Quaranskin. In Quaranskin we developed an at-home sampling kit, protocol and survey, where participants swabbed four body sites for metagenomic analysis. We correlated the diversity and composition of these collected microbiome data to behaviours noted in the surveys to uncover any trends. In parallel, we chose the skin commensal microbe Staphylococcus epidermidis to be a chassis for our future vision of microbial therapeutics enabled by synthetic biology. In projects EpiFlex, EpiGlow, and EpiGrow, we built a MoClo kit, expressed fluorescent proteins as a proof of concept, and optimised growth conditions, respectively.'",['Foundational Advance']

The field of magnetogenetics has begun to consider how magnetic fields could affect biological molecules and cells. In our project, we aim to control the function of bacteria via the remote activation of an alternating magnetic field (AMF). E. coli will be engineered to respond to magnetic stimuli by attaching magnetic nanoparticles to the surface of the bacterial membrane in conjunction with cytoplasmic temperature-sensitive transcriptional repressors to regulate gene expression of the green fluorescent protein. Upon AMF stimulation, magnetic nanoparticles heat up and increase cytoplasmic temperature, thereby inducing a conformational change of the repressor dimers and allowing transcription of target genes. This technology critically couples alternating magnetic field stimulation with thermal sensitive parts to enable wireless control of bacteria.'",['Foundational Advance']
1451,"b'The off-target problem of CRISPR technology is the most troublesome factor for its in vivo operations. Regarding this, our project conducted optimization methods to obtain a CRISPR-Cas9 system for specific target with high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we adopted directed evolution and rational design methods. We proposed a pipeline integrating machine learning and Markov process in off-target prediction. Meanwhile, molecular dynamics and graph theory were also applied to guide and interpret directed evolution and rational design. In experiment, the transcriptional activation and inhibition circuits were built to reflect the on/off-target rate, serving as indicators for screening and reporting process. Finally, we hope that our method can be a guidance for further application.'",['Foundational Advance']
1452,"b'RNA binding proteins(RBPs) play an essential role in tumors and neurodegenerative diseases, while most of them lack of effective inhibitors. Since directed evolution has shown its high efficiency, this year we provided a sample combining rational design and directed evolution to obtain dsRNA inhibitors of RBPs and took ADAR1, a dsRNA adenosine deaminase, as an example. In our project, an algorithm-guided model was trained from natural substrates of ADAR1 and used to established a candidate dsRNA library. Those candidates were connected to a self-splicing stem-loop sequence and transferred into HeLa cells with toxic genes regulated by ADAR1 and Tet-on system, which only survived when endogenous ADAR1 was inhibited by transferred dsRNAs. Efficient substrates were extracted and used to train the model above for the next round. Through the continuous cycle of this screening process, we could obtain high-efficiency inhibitors of ADAR1 efficiently, and extend this model to other RBPs.'",['Foundational Advance']
1453,"b'A key challenge in the field of synthetic biology is genomic instability of introduced genes. Once a gene is inserted into a host organism, it can cause an additional metabolic load, significantly reducing host fitness. Mutations that damage the introduced gene are therefore likely to be selected for, diminishing its expression. These mutations could render synthetic-biology products obsolete and require constant maintenance. We propose interlocking a target gene to the N-terminus of an essential gene in the hosts genome, under the same promoter. This way, mutations on the target gene are likely to affect the expression of the essential gene, leading to mutated host mortality. We are developing a software called sTAUbility, that would match the best-fitting essential gene and linker to a given target gene, based on bioinformatic models and novel approaches for measuring stability. Furthermore, sTAUbility optimizes the combined construct for efficient gene expression and increased stability.'",['Foundational Advance']
1454,"b'In the last few years,DNAsequencing has developed rapidly while DNA synthesis still relies on the decades-oldchemical phosphoramidite system. However, this process is toxic and has already reached its limit at around 200 bases. Thus, the demand for more environmentally friendly and effective novel approaches is evident. In this project, we report an enzymatic ssDNA synthesis system with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). In each synthesis cycle, an unspecific number of nucleotides is incorporated. Our unique automated hardware can selectively attach nucleotides to immobilized primers in order to synthesize preset DNA sequences. We present a ternary system to encode and recover the information stored on DNA. This system enables the semi-specific approach, in which information is saved only in the transitions between bases, therefore specific synthesis is not necessary. This opens up a much more approachable and robust system that even allows adding proof-reading properties.'",['Foundational Advance']

We used Komagataella phaffii (P. pastoris), a methylotrophic yeast, to engineer this cell-factory since it has been used extensively in industrial protein production due to its high protein-secretion as well as ease of protein purification. To make the cell factory effectively use methane as a carbon source, recombinant pMMO subunits were incorporated from a natural methanotrophic bacteria, M. capsulatus. This way, methane is converted to methanol and K. phaffii can further use its native metabolic pathway to produce protein of interest.

This process can be accelerated in the laboratory to create new protein variants with desirable properties by diversification of a known DNA sequence followed by selective amplification, an approach known as directed evolution. In vivo diversification with locus-specific targeting has recently become possible using T7-RNAP-guided deaminases. Here, aiming to maximize the effectiveness of this method, we have combined two strategies. First, we use new cytosine and adenosine deaminases with improved mutagenesis rates. Second, our innovative design can target both DNA strands simultaneously, resulting in improved diversification and reducing the bias observed in existing systems that mainly target only one of the strands of DNA in each mutation cycle.

EvolvR, targeted to a gene of interest by a specific guide RNA, continuously diversify the underlying DNA, with cells constantly under selection for improved variants. We have confirmed the efficiency of the approach in E. coli, validated it in a plant-based cell-free system and confirmed its functionality in Tobacco BY-2 cell culture. We have also established mathematical approaches to model and optimize the selection regimens to maximize the efficiency of the pipeline.

1459,"b'A major challenge in synthetic biology is the containment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) outside of the laboratory. This includes restraining the physical spread of the organism and transfer of synthetic genes, via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This challenge remains as regulatory bodies require sound evidence on the safety of GMOs which is difficult due to the lack of knowledge upon release. Additionally, the absence of risks is not necessarily a definitive proof of safety. Therefore, industry is unwilling to invest and scientists only rarely get permission to gather large-scale data. Here, DOPL LOCK can make the difference: we propose a mutually dependent double plasmid lock which will minimize HGT and the spread of GMOs. Our goal is to provide an open-source, standardised, modular and widely applicable Safe-by-Design biocontainment system of GMOs in non-contained applications. With DOPL LOCK, we aim to drive bio-safety innovations, accelerating the field of synthetic biology.'",['Foundational Advance']

Showing that they can be employed as prototyping platforms to characterize genetic constructs, these systems drastically reduce testing times. We use a machine learning guided approach to optimize reaction mixture composition and create a collection of GoldenGate based chloroplast parts to be characterized in our CFS.

In order to understand how our strategy would behave in a microbial community, we developed an assay to assess horizontal gene transfer from donor to recipient. We also use a Markovs model and an agent-based model (ABM) to imitate genetic transfer using biophysical and community-based methods, respectively.

In our project: Vibrio natriegens ""Marionette"", we develop a new strategy for strict and subtle gene regulation aiming at promoting the use of V.n in synthetic biology. By introducing artificial promoters, insulators, UTRs, controllable ORI and Marionette collection, we build a golden-gate-based part collection, which enables strict and tunable gene expression in V.n. Furthermore, we engineered miniature Cas(751aa) and AsCas12f1(422aa) taking high sensitivity of V.n to burden caused by protein expression, to achieve efficient CRISPRa and CRISPRi of multiple genes. We also explore the possibility to build incoherent feed-forward loops (iFFLs) by Cas protein.

Literature on natural transformation in E. coli and related bacterium was reviewed and experts were consulted to identify twenty-five putative natural transformation genes in A. baylyi for insertion into E. coli via a novel recombineering strategy for insertion of multiple gene clusters. K-means clustering used existing data on transcriptome concentration and promoter strength to model the optimal clustering of genes into eight <5kB DNA fragments.

1468,"b'Microbiomes include networks of microorganisms that share genetic information via horizontal gene transfer. Most bacteria in nature are organized in such interconnected communities; thus the ability to engineer microbiomes constitutes an important frontier for the field of synthetic biology. Effective engineering of microbiomes heavily relies on selectivity: the ability to make the desired changes (e.g. introducing new functions) to certain species but not others. Selectivity is also critical from a biosafety perspective as the introduction of genes into unwanted hosts can cause large ecological impacts. We have developed the first computational tool to selectively engineer microbiomes, along with experimental means to evaluate it. By addressing the main biophysical processes related to gene activity and expression, our software designs microbiome- specific plasmids that are expressed optimally in certain microorganisms while having impaired expression in others. Our tool can be applied to any plasmid and microbiome.'",['Foundational Advance']

Our objective is to pursue an incipient focus on genetic circuit development based on sequential logic, enabling new functions and expanding the possible applications for engineered organisms. We first developed a novel genetic counter system from which we constructed and modeled a genetic circuit, whose modularity enables it to behave as a toolbox with applications in all areas. To validate our approach we developed a framework and software which allow the construction of an extensive library of genetic circuits. This library can in turn be explored by several filters, designed to convey expression profiles, processes and functional applications of interest as defined by experts.'",['Foundational Advance']

In our project, we have gotten out of the rut to create the CREATEChromosome Released Eukaryote which is Active, Transitory and Environment-friendly, a yeast without chromosomes. Such cells have no chromosomes and cannot proliferate, but endogenous enzymes still remain active for a certain period of time. Taking advantage of these characteristics, CREATE might be a much safer bio-reactor used in drug delivery and gene therapy. Obviously, the applications of CREATE will never be limited to any certain field. We believe that CREATE has great potential to be applied in more fields deeply and widely.""",['Foundational Advance']
1471,"b'Large quantities of protein are needed every year for research and medical purposes. Production of heterologous proteins in genetically modified microbial hosts has long been established as a biotechnological standard. Still, the production of proteins destined for therapeutic application in humans, often proves to be challenging for conventional host organisms due to complex post-translational modifications most mammalian proteins undergo. Specific modification patterns, such as human-like glycosylation, cannot be replicated in microbial expression hosts, yet are essential to the proteins functionality. Recently, the protozoan parasite Leishmania tarentolae has emerged as a favorable eukaryotic expression host because of its human-like glycosylation capabilities. To facilitate the use of Leishmania tarentolae, we established a library of genetic parts suitable for the usage of the Modular Cloning system within Leishmania tarentolae. This paves the way to a versatile and expandable gene part collection, making the expression of human-like glycosylated proteins more feasible and effective.'",['Foundational Advance']
1472,"b'Indonesia is struggling to independently meet industrial enzyme demands despite efforts to develop cheaper technologies to produce them. Although various enzyme overexpression systems are available, the cost of purification remains a major obstacle. To help address this, we propose the Clean Harvest of Overexpressed Protein (CHOP) system. The system works by anchoring an enzyme of interest (EoI) onto the extracellular terminals of an outer membrane protein (OMP). As the cells grow, they will naturally shed their outer membrane as vesicles (OMV) containing OMP-EoI fusion. Due to OMVs being smaller than cells yet larger than free proteins, they can be separated from the bulk of protein impurities, simplifying the downstream processing. Once separated, the EoI may be released from the OMP by cleaving off a specific linker between the fusion with specific proteases. The development of overexpression systems that simplify downstream purification is expected to significantly reduce enzyme production costs.'",['Foundational Advance']
1473,"b'Team UC Davis seeks to optimize mRNA delivery in vitro for the foundational advancement of mRNA vaccine technology, namely to reduce side effects caused by an innate immune response due to sudden influx of spike protein. We plan to insert an RNA secondary structure known as an Iron Response element (IRE) into the 5 UTR that reduces the sudden influx of spike protein by gradually releasing the available mRNA transcripts for translation. The protein known as an iron response binding protein (IRBP1/IRBP2) binds and blocks translation until an iron allosterically binds and IRBP/1IRBP2 unbinds to allow for translation. A working pipeline was created to automate the insertion process and structural stability by utilizing the RNA folding package, Vienna. To prove the mRNA/IREBP system constructs were expressed transiently in mammalian cell cultures and translation was monitored with destabilized YFP. The design is modular and able to integrate into any mRNA therapy.'",['Foundational Advance']

A biosensor will be incorporated to detect the presence of lipids via the interaction of acyl-CoA with FadR which results in the de-repression of Green Fluorescent Protein. For added security, a kill switch is being developed to destroy the cell if released into the environment. The protein KillerRed is repressed in the presence of tryptophan.

Bacterial cellulose has seen use in clothing and health foods, but we develop its application to the global issue of water purification. Rising demand for limited freshwater supplies will lead to more than half of the global population suffering severe water stress by 2030. Improved filtration techniques would help relieve this problem.

This synthetic biology approach can be used to create a database of scents that can be ordered to consumer demand. By using E. coli to generate these compounds, we aim to reduce the cost of these scents and improve yield in a more environmentally sustainable and less destructive manner.

1478,"b' Chitin, a polysaccharide derived from glucose, is commonly found in the cell walls of fungi and the exoskeletons of organisms. Chitosan is derived from chitin through the N-deacetylation process. Uses include agriculture, medicine, and industry. Research in our local community led us to research applying chitosan in an agriculture setting by preserving post harvest fruit from fungal infections. Current technology to produce chitosan involves a caustic chemical process that is detrimental to the environment. An alkali sodium hydroxide removes the acetyl group from chitin to produce chitosan. Fortunately, this conversion process also takes place in the natural environment in a multitude of organisms through the aid of an enzyme called chitin deacetylase, or CDA. The main focus of our project was to obtain a CDA gene from a eukaryotic source, engineer a suitable vector with promoter, and transform into a bacterial host using the standard Biobrick assembly.'",['Manufacturing']

The arms of these stars may be functionalised with various biomacromolecules, including peptides and proteins. By incorporating various molecules in the star arms (e.g. antimicrobial peptides or anticancer drugs), the star peptides may be applied in a variety of biomedical contexts as drug delivery vehicles or macromolecular linkers.

1480,"b'Polyketides are a class of secondary metabolites produced by almost all living organisms. These are structurally complex organic compounds that are often highly active biologically. Many pharmaceuticals are derived from or inspired by polyketides.

However, such method cant synthetize various polyketides by the same polyketide synthase domains. This year, we are dedicated to using PKS domains as a synthetic unit to diminish the size of the target gene fragments. Meanwhile, the host strain E. coli should be genetically modified in order to enable the synthesis of the corresponding substrate. In this way, PKS domains can be assembled more quickly, enabling the programmed polyketide synthesis. In addition, we can design synthesis pathway of polyketide independently. This system can select the corresponding synthesis polyketide synthase domains to synthetize polyketide programmedly.'",['Manufacturing']

The biological project work focused on development of constructs that produce lipase and keratinase enzymes to degrade FOGs and hair. These constructs are designed to sit within a small, under-sink bioreactor that will produce and feed them into the waste system as the sink is drained.

1483,"b'Directed evolution engineers organisms to produce proteins of novel function and industrially relevant biomolecules. Traditionally, in vivo directed evolution relies on physical or chemical mutagens that cause accumulation of toxic and nonspecific deleterious mutations. A novel system, termed feedback-regulated evolution of phenotype (FREP), overcomes these problems by incorporating a variable mutation rate system to mimic natural evolution. This is achieved through the dynamic control of a mutator element negatively regulated by the desired end product. The 2014 UChicago iGEM team implemented and optimized FREP in E. coli, using the tyrosine pathway as a proof of concept. We combined multiple mutators with different biases for a deeper exploration of the search space, increasing the initial mutation rate and speeding the accumulation of beneficial mutations. Eliminating mutational bias should increase sequence space search efficiency, significantly improving the process of directed evolution for industrial production of any biomolecule.'",['Manufacturing']

MAPs can selectively attach to metal and organic surfaces via L-dopamine (L-DOPA), a nonstandard amino acid that was incorporated using a genomically recoded organism (GRO). Because this peptide is toxic to the GRO in which it is produced, we designed a better controlled inducible system that limits basal expression. This was achieved through a novel T7 riboregulation system that controls expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. This improved system is a precise synthetic switch for the expression of cytotoxic substances in the already robust T7 system. Lastly, the antimicrobial surface-binding peptide was assayed for functionality.'",['Manufacturing']

Increased transcription of FadD will allow our strain to better utilize frying oil waste. Terpenoid production will then be achieved via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway which is endogenous to E. coli. By increasing flux through the MEP pathway we will increase product yields. Safety considerations have been incorporated into the project through design of cellular level biocontainment. A kill switch, KillerRed, has been improved from previous years.

Nine genes are required for the conversion of phenylalanine, which occurs naturally in E. coli, to delphinidin. We have cloned or synthesized all nine plant genes. Our approach is to assemble the nine plant-derived genes into 3 operons and express them in E. coli. Production of specific enzymes will be verified by immunoblotting and production of intermediate compounds will be monitored by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.

We aim to produce a robust co-culture by ensuring stable, efficient ratios of bacteria using synthetic intercellular communication. Our co-culture converts agricultural waste, lignocellulose, into a useful product, biodiesel. It consists of Cytophaga hutchinsonii, a cellulolytic bacterium, and Escherichia coli, which is engineered to produce biodiesel.

In this system, different TALE proteins, which could specifically target the corresponding DNA binding motifs, were generated and fused with fragmented GFP or multi-enzymes (e.g., IAAM and IAAH). The results showed that TALE-based scaffold system could not only efficiently guide the fragmented GFP around the DNA scaffolds and display strong fluorescence, but also promote the rate of IAA production.

We are aiming to standardize this acid defense system so that it may be implemented in other microorganisms to increase their survival under low pH conditions. By utilizing acid-resistant microbes, it is possible to decrease the running costs of bioreactors that are hindered by acid buildup from metabolic processes. Moreover, given that microbes often transition to stationary phase during acid stress, this CFA system may enable higher cell densities and biosynthetic yields in cell cultures because genetically modified microorganisms may more readily tolerate acidic conditions during growth.'",['Manufacturing']

To extend the duration of the limonene, the use of synthetic biology for continuous production was proposed by this project. However, the limonene production in predecessors attempts using bacterial were not efficient, probably due to the fact that the enzyme responsible for the production of geranyl phosphate in limonene was insoluble, the limonene synthase. The gene circuit comprises a promoter activated by osmotic shock inducing production of the enzyme limonene synthase. An osmotic shock is a simple way of inducing the production of chaperones and foldases, creating our repelent.'",['Manufacturing']

One of the greatest difficulties that the cheese industry faces is bacteriophage (virus) infection, which kills bacteria used in the manufacture of cheese. The industry utilizes a variety of approaches to deal with this problem, each having their own drawbacks. The 2015 USU iGEM team is implementing a synthetic biology approach to design and create phage resistant Lactococcus lactis, a commonly-used cheese starter bacteria. The genetic mechanism behind this phage resistance functions by pairing a promoter that is activated in the presence of phage with a kill switch to terminate infected cells before phage are able to propagate.'",['Manufacturing']
1508,"b'Taurine is a pseudo-aminoacid derivative of cysteine which can be obtained naturally by some foods, biosynthesized by some organisms or produced through a series of chemical reactions. Taurine synthesis is an important process as it plays many roles in the functions on the human body, among other organisms. The main aim of our project is to successfully introduce a couple of enzymes into E. colis genome so it can biosynthesize this important molecule. To achieve this, these two taurine-pathway enzymes were selected: cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) and cysteine dioxygenase (COD). It is important to highlight the fact that its the first time we synthesize both of them using synthetic biology techniques.'",['Manufacturing']
1509,"b'Petroleum-derived chemicals are used as building blocks for a variety of products used in daily life, and while critical, their overuse has had significant negative environmental and societal impacts on the world. Finding alternatives to petro-chemicals is highly desired as we transition to renewable sources. Lignocellulosic biomass represents a sustainable feedstock for energy, chemical, and material production. However, efficient deconstruction and valorization of biomass remains a hindrance to its utilization in next generation biorefineries. To harvest the fermentable sugars and aromatics in plant biomass, a consolidated bioprocessing approach is currently needed to provide a cost effective and efficient scheme for funneling lignocellulose into high-value biochemicals. Here, we have constructed a microbial community of E.coli and Caulobacter crescentus, both synergizing in the degradation of biomass through the display of biomass transforming enzymes on the S-layer of C.crescentus; and the funneling of fermentable sugars and transformed aromatics into high-value biochemicals through E.coli.'",['Manufacturing']
1510,"b'Bacterial Microcompartments (BMCs) are naturally occurring, protein-based containers within bacteria that sequester enzymes for particular reaction pathways. BMCs have numerous potential applications, including increasing flux of desired reactions or as targeted drug delivery vehicles. We have re-engineered the ethanolamine utilization BMC with a light inducible open/close switch by introducing the non-canonical amino acid azobenzene into the coat protein of the compartment, enabling the BMC to switch conformation upon light induction. Structural modeling combined with site-directed mutagenesis enabled predictive placement of azobenzene within the structure to induce large-scale rearrangements of the protein shell that allows the compartment to break apart and re-form in response to a light switch. This work expands the synthetic biology toolkit by presenting an outline for the engineering of synthetic BMCs that respond to external stimuli, enabling future biologists to utilize these compartments for controlled synthetic reactions.'",['Manufacturing']
1511,"b'We are currently consuming resources faster than our planet can replenish them, thus it is obvious that we need to rethink resource efficiency in the future. In order to achieve high resource efficiency in biotechnology, the employment of sustainable substrates in industrial processes is imperative. Due to recent developments in biotechnology, it is now both possible and desirable to use non-conventional chassis, rather than relying on traditional organisms. We propose using the yeast Yarrowia Lipolytica as an alternative chassis, as it has an unusually broad substrate range as well as great potential for the production of both proteins and metabolic products. Due to the limited tools available, thus far the use of Y. lipolytica has been limited to research. Our project aims to develop both molecular and bioinformatic tools for Y. lipolytica, in order to introduce the organism as an advantageous chassis for future bio-refineries.'",['Manufacturing']
1512,"b'Taxol, generically known as paclitaxel, is a chemotherapy drug highly efficient in combating multiple forms of cancer via interference with the normal breakdown of microtubules during cell division. Deriving taxol from nature is environmentally unsustainable because the bark of the tree it is harvested from, the Pacific yew, grows too slowly to meet demands for taxol. Chemically synthesis is economically unsustainable because the intricate stereoisomerism and multistep pathway of taxol production result in low yield rates and high production costs. Manufacturing taxol via biosynthesis remedies the shortcomings of both aforementioned production methods; the need for the yew tree is circumvented and production cost is exponentially lower compared to the cost of chemical synthesis. Duke iGEM is optimizing the biosynthesis of taxol in E.coli by individually characterizing and then consolidating enzymes of the taxol biosynthesis pathway into a single strain for fermentation of taxol.'",['Manufacturing']
1513,"b'Plastic waste is one of the most significant causes of environmental pollution. Traditional plastics can take up to 1000 years to degrade, whereas alternative bioplastics can be decomposed in 80 days. The aim of our project is to produce Poly-Lactic Acid (PLA), a biodegradable polymer and a thermoplastic, by engineering Pseudomonas putida. PLA bioproduction presents several benefits compared to chemical synthesis: it uses simple carbon sources and it is inexpensive. On the other hand, P. putida is a safe organism reported to be efficient for polymerization, which gives advantages over other possible chassis. By modification of its metabolic pathways, we aim to improve PLA biosynthesis yields in a sustainable manner and determine the usability of our bioplastic by manufacturing a vesicle for drug delivery.'",['Manufacturing']
1514,"b'Tardigrades, also known as water bears, survive extreme cold and dry conditions through an ability known as cryptobiosis. This process is mediated by a class of intrinsically disordered proteins called the Late Embryonic Abundant (LEA) proteins that become ordered when desiccated, thereby stabilizing DNA and protein cell components. Our team expressed tardigrade proteins in E. coli to investigate their utility as stabilizing agents for biological products, including live cells and purified proteins. Additionally, tardigrades have several properties like small size, transparent bodies, and constant cell number that make them a promising model for the study of developmental processes. To test their genetic tractability for use in such a model, we generated a CRISPR protocol for both knocking out tardigrade genes and heterologously expressing non-tardigrade genes within the tardigrade genome. Overall, our results show promise for the study of tardigrades for their resilience and developmental processes.'",['Manufacturing']

With our project we aim to produce biological systems that manufacture the conjugates of these pharmaceutical that have less adverse side-effects, lack addictive properties, and are inexpensive. To achieve this, three protein expression systems were designed: (1) An Agrobacterium based system in tobacco plants for the synthesis of CBDA synthase, (2) Engineering the pGAPz alpha vector system to express mambalgin in Pichia pastoris, (3) and Manufacturing the constructs of Lethal Toxin-Neutralizing Factor LNTF-10 and LNTF-15 which are serum derivatives of the Didelphis virginiana (opossum) in the pSBC13 vector for assembly in Escherichia coli.

Escherichia coli K12 will be transformed with the genes required to detect P. aeruginosa and also with the alginate lyase gene (ALYG), in tandem with a bacteriocin. The ALYG will have a signal peptide from Bacillus thuringiensis, which allow protein translocation in E. coli. These molecules will destroy the biofilm and the bacterium. Also, a Nisin producer bacterium (L. lactis) will be transformed with the genes required to detect P. aeruginosa and with an additional copy of Nisin. Our objetive is to overexpress the bacteriocin to kill the pathogenic bacterium. Additionally, we will model the conditions to build a patch made of Poly(vinyl alcohol) and nitrocellulose containing the biosensors that will allow the molecule to diffuse through the membrane in order to kill the pathogenic bacteria.'",['Manufacturing']
1517,"b' Bio-manufacturing commonly involves the culturing of genetically engineered microbes that produce product(s) of interest, which is followed by separation of the microbes from the growth media and finally, isolation and purification of the product(s). The infrastructure and running costs for the downstream processing are significant obstacles to the large scale adoption of bio-manufacturing, especially for small-scale start-ups that drive innovation. We have therefore developed a modular set of tools by designing BioBricksTM for E. coli that firstly cause programmed induction of product synthesis upon reaching a certain tuneable population of cells, and secondly, autoaggregate the cells upon utilization of most of the nutrients available; these eliminate external induction and centrifugation, thereby minimizing costs. This is of special importance in India, where financial constraints often bottleneck entrepreneurial efforts in biotechnology, which is still a field in the early stages of its development.'",['Manufacturing']

Spider silk cultivation being a very slow and cumbersome process, we came up with an idea aiming at synthesizing recombinant spider silk protein (MaSp2) and producing it extracellularly in our model bacteria E. coli. Ensuring that the protein is secreted, we can change the nature of the production process from batch to continuous by reusing immobilised cells, and even use it for mass production. We aim at making two constructs for expressing silk outside the cell. We also aim at developing a novel detection system using FRET dye pairs. This system will primarily be used in monitoring and modelling the cleavage activity of the HIV protease used for selective cleavage and controlled release of the silk protein. CFP and YFP will be used as FRET dye pairs.'",['Manufacturing']

Our interdisciplinary work entails creating a novel bioink that exploits the rapid and specific interaction of biotin and its tetrameric binding protein streptavidin. By employing this affinity, we have engineered cells presenting biotin moieties or biotin binding proteins on their surfaces and recombinant biotinylated proteins as spacer molecules, which both co-polymerize upon contact with streptavidin. Furthermore, we have explored different cellular circuits, which allow us to control pancreatic cell lines, induce tissue vascularization, or install biosafety mechanisms for printed tissues. To deliver these cells, we employ a hijacked 3D printer that enables us to manufacture three-dimensional multi-cellular structures in a user-definable manner. Altogether, we are confident that our system provides the necessary means to advance the SynBio community to the next level  the tissue level.'",['Manufacturing']

We aim to improve and optimise the design, primarily with the addition of split inteins. These are a special type of protein sequence which allow each arm of the peptide to be ligated to another protein of choice, which could be an enzyme or even other StarScaffold units. We are focusing primarily on two main applications for the StarScaffold; as a hydrogel with uniquely customisable physical and biochemical properties, and as a method of improving enzyme reaction kinetics. These technologies are currently growing in popularity and we hope our project can help improve the current state of the science.'",['Manufacturing']
1521,"b'Currently, the biotechnologically relevant model strain of cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, lacks resilience to cold temperature perturbations. If large-scale operations for photosynthetic production of industrial compounds are to be realized, robustness to unpredictable weather conditions must be considered. Two complementary approaches are being proposed to increase cold adaptation and resistance to freezing in S. elongatus. Previously, it was shown the expression of lipid desaturase desA increases the cold-growth tolerance of S. elongatus. We now aim to improve this range by fine-tuning the expression of a riboswitch-controlled desA. We also hypothesize that introduction of SFR2 from Arabidopsis thalianaresponsible for remodeling the outer chloroplast membrane for increased freezing tolerancewill increase cellular viability to freezing events. Through this two-pronged approach, we aspire to engineer a cyanobacterial strain that ultimately could be used for the production of industrially-relevant products in unreliable environment conditions.'",['Manufacturing']

To do so we are screening samples from all around the world to look for stain-digesting microbes, we are characterising candidate enzymes with putative stain digesting activity, and we are searching for fabric binding domains to enhance their stain fighting power!

1523,"b'Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used in a variety of valuable industrial processes. Its ability to grow and replicate utilizing aerobic respiration or fermentation, and its ability to survive without functional mitochondria, provide opportunities to control or alter mitochondrial function to optimize production processes or develop novel cellular subsystems in the mitochondrial space. To begin exploring these opportunities, we adapted two commonly used yeast expression vectors to the RFC 10 standard and used them to express yEGFP preceded by the mitochondrial localization signal from the mitoribosomal protein mRPS12. In addition, we attempted to demonstrate that aerobic respiration can be controlled by manipulating the expression of mRPS12. Without mRPS12, yeast mitochondria lack a functioning ribosome and become unable to produce proteins necessary for aerobic respiration. By expressing the mRPS12 protein in a haploid mRPS12 knockout strain, we investigated its usefulness as a means of regulating aerobic respiration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.'",['Manufacturing']

Interestingly, dye motifs are produced in cyanobacteria in the form of tetrapyrollic dyes motifs including; heme, chlorophyll and phycocyanobilin (PCB), where PCB proteins have also been utilized in immunoassay kits. In fact, the biosynthesis of PCB is an attractive pathway to manipulate owing to the potential to prepare a myriad of tetrapyrrollic derivatives. These derivatives, have been studied extensively for light-based applications and the ability to genetically direct the bacterial synthetic machinery would be significantly beneficial towards CO2 sequestration, and the production of low-cost dyes.'",['Manufacturing']

To make the balloon itself, we are engineering bacteria to produce membrane polymers with different properties. To inflate the balloon, we are using algae to produce biological hydrogen to fill the balloon. To increase balloon durability, we are looking for biological ways to make our materials radiation resistant.

The modifications include changes in 5'UTR regions, likely ribosome binding sites and secondary structures to evaluate how those features affect translational machinery. We have also focused on open reading frame (ORF) optimization. Using bioinformatic analysis we have created sfGFP and mRFP variants composed exclusively of the most frequent or the rarest codons.

A cell lysis step is necessary to the recombinant protein extraction, limiting the yield and the purity of the extracted proteins and hindering continuous production. Our solution is the insertion of a phage porin in the outer membrane. We aim to condition the porins opening system to create a gateway between the intra- and extra-cellular environment by getting rid of the cumbersome lysis step. We will use a directed evolution approach to mutate specific regions linked to the gate opening and subject the resulting mutants to strong specific selection pressure. Through this method we will attempt to create a regulating system for our gates opening/closure.

Our project aims to meet these goals by developing a synthetic biology route to generate a library of aromatic aldehydes from their respective inexpensive toluene-based precursors that are an environmentally toxic waste in crude oil processing. We utilize the xyl ortho pathway of Pseudomonas putida, which is cloned into Escherichia coli as a host platform. This pathway converts toluene derivatives with a wide range of functional groups in the meta and para positions on the ring to their corresponding aromatic aldehydes, leaving the meta and para substituents unaltered and therefore allowing for development of a library of products.'",['Manufacturing']

Current ALA production uses a chemical synthesis method which is highly energy demanding producing a low yield at a high cost. The aim of our project is to biosynthesise ALA by up-regulating and down-regulating certain enzymes in the heme biosynthesis (C5) pathway, this will not only increase the yield of ALA but to also decrease the energy required during the synthesis of the product. By metabolic engineering of E. coli we hope to optimise the production of ALA increasing the sustainability and the economical gain when synthesising the product.'",['Manufacturing']

We aim to stably produce, sense and export fumarate under conditions mimicking industrial settings. Stable production is achieved by activating and evolving different metabolic modules in response to natural day/night cycles. To detect fumarate, we developed a biosensor suitable for high-throughput screening. Finally, to allow optimal fumarate export, we investigate its transport mechanism.

A large number of gene knock-out, transcriptional or translational silencing methods were applied for mutator strain generation. Regardless of its great potential, the CRISPR guided dCas9 targeting to transcriptional start sites of bacterial DNA repair genes was not among them.

Our engineered E. coli also secrete the PHB they produce, which improves the efficiency of the system. Our project is a start-to-finish integrated system that can be used in space to generate items useful to astronauts during early Mars missions.

Thus, curli fibers present a promising platform for the scalable production of programmable materials. Our project focuses on optimizing curli production on two fronts. First, we aim to increase curli export efficiency by optimizing the stoichiometric ratio of proteins involved in the curli pathway.

1539,"b'Sophorolipids are a group of amphipathic compounds synthesized by yeasts, including our selected chassis Starmerella bombicola. These compounds are among the most industrially viable biosurfactants. As surfactants, sophorolipids are superior to current synthetic alternatives largely due to their low toxicity and ready biodegradability. Anti-cell proliferation and anti-microbial assays suggest that medium-chain length sophorolipids possess therapeutic potential. However, their higher cost of production poses a major barrier to commercial use. Even when grown on a substrate largely composed of fatty acids, a significant portion of the fatty acids are diverted from sophorolipid production due to competition with the -oxidation pathway. Fatty acids diverted into the -oxidation pathway undergo irregular cleavage, lowering sophorolipid yield and creating a heterogeneous mixture of products. Full suppression of this pathway would result in undesirable metabolic disruption. Selective suppression of this pathway through genetic engineering could reduce production costs through improving the yield of useful chain lengths.'",['Manufacturing']

Chitosans show antimicrobial and wound-healing supportive properties, making chitosan oligomers excellent plaster materials and fluorophor-carriers. De novo biosynthesis in E. coli makes it possible to produce chitosan oligomers with different defined deacetylation patterns which differ in their bioactivity and are therefore useful for various applications for instance plant protection and medical materials.

Our ongoing research project utilizes the 3-HP responsive genes found in P. putida and P. denitrificans as biological reporters which express luciferase in the presence of 3-HP. We will then adapt this system to Bacillus subtilis, which has shown potential as a 3-HP producer for industrial processes due to its high tolerance for concentrations of 3-HP that are toxic in other microorganisms. Our biosensor is a useful tool for metabolic engineering research.'",['Manufacturing']
1547,"b'The aim of this project is to lower the cost of a common recombinant DNA technique, the Gibson Assembly. The concept revolves around the construction and expression of plasmids with DNA polymerase and DNA ligase as the insert genes. The constructed plasmids for these two proteins are transformed into DH5 cells for high cloning and then transformed into BL21(DE3) for high gene expression and production of the proteins of interest. Cell lysate from transformed BL21(DE3) cells is used as DNA ligase and DNA polymerase and the base level of exonuclease present naturally in the cell lysate serves as the T5 exonuclease. Using different combinations of the cell lysates for the DNA ligase and DNA polymerase, a plasmid with known sequence and properties is assembled to test the concept. Sequence results obtained after each trial are recorded as a measure of success or a need to modify the lysate ratios.'",['Manufacturing']

In recent years Crocin has caught the attention of researchers worldwide as a potential treatment for various degenerative diseases such as cancer and Alzheimers. Besides treating diseases we also see potential of Crocin being used as a dye in different industries. The Zeaxanthin pathway is in the registry as well the beta-carotene pathway, but due to that the Zeaxanthin plasmid is quite large and unstable we decided to use lambda red recombineering to transfer it from the plasmid to the chromosome to make it more stable.

However, traditional cell disruption methods (including sonication and homogenization) usually need additional equipments and are laborious/time-consuming. To improve the efficiency of cell disruption and intracellular products extraction, a lysozyme-encoding gene was successfully integrated into a modified blue-light-controlled gene switch which was evaluated through eGFP gene expression. Subsequently, self-lysis of E. coli cells was assessed under blue light. To control the expression of lysis gene regulated by blue light, a model of light-emitting device was constructed and a layout of fermentor with light-emitting device was designed. Moreover, we made an economic analysis after consulting several bio-factories. It indicated that our design not only reduce the cost in cell disruption but also simplify operation process.

Our goal is to address the challenge of regulating population dynamics in a synthetic microbial consortium, by improving the rate of production of naringenin and its pharmaceutically significant derivative, kaempferol, which has anti-cancer properties. This is done by distributing the synthesis of kaempferol between two E. coli strains and optimizing their relative proportions in co-culture. To optimize population dynamics for the production of kaempferol, we regulated the ratio of the two strains using GP2, a transcriptional inhibitor, under the control of a biosensor responsive to the pathway intermediate naringenin. This couples cell growth with the concentration of naringenin, allowing the co-culture to self-optimize based on pathway intermediate abundance. Using our system, we have demonstrated a novel way to optimize microbial polycultures for the synthesis of metabolically complex compounds.'",['Manufacturing']

Current manufacturing methods are unable to achieve high yields; the aim of our project is to greatly improve manufacturing outputs and reduce costs through biosynthesis of taxol from an intermediate in the synthesis pathway in E. coli. We used a modular approach to link the five necessary genes together before recombineering the construct into the E. coli genome; our design thus can be easily adapted to produce next generation taxanes. Five T7 bacteriophage promoters of varying strengths were selected from a promoter library and fitted in random combinations to the pathway genes.

PHBV and other polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are thermoplastics that can be designed with bespoke physical properties based on their relative compositions. By introducing heterologous genes (phaCAB) from Cupriavidus necator, we engineered recombinant Escherichia coli to produce PHBV using co-products from local whisky distilleries.

As an alternative to oil based styrene we aim to produce styrene from a presently underused wastestream: cellulosic waste. Our system consists of both breaking down cellulose to glucose and subsequent styrene production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. First the cellulose is degraded by an established cellulosome complex containing different cellulases and a cellulose binding domain. By complexing the cellulases and anchoring the complex to the cell wall the efficiency of the cellulosome is enhanced synergistically. The freed glucose is taken up and used for growth and production of phenylalanine. Conversion of phenylalanine to styrene occurs in two steps, first the phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme (PAL2) is introduced, which enables the yeast to convert phenylalanine into trans-cinnamate. The final step of our cascade is catalyzed by a native enzyme, producing styrene from trans-cinnamate.'",['Manufacturing']

However, mass production of certain proteins in bacteria is hindered by protein size or the complex folding structure of proteins. Protein folding has been shown to be assisted by chaperones, a protein aiding the expression of other proteins in bacteria. We illustrate this by co-expression of GroES and proteins that are problematic to express in E-coli. GroES is mostly known as a co-chaperone, but some studies indicate that it has a folding property on its own.

Indias primary source of camptothecin is Nothapodytes nimmoniana, a plant endemic to the Western Ghats. N. nimmoniana is now endangered due to overharvesting for medicinal purposes. The fungal endophyte fungal endophyte Fusarium solani can be synthetically modified to produce camptothecin as the camptothecin biosynthesis pathway has been elucidated and F. solani has most components of the pathway except for one - the enzyme strictosidine synthase (STR). This approach of engineering the fungal endophyte with the enzyme STR will reduce the harm caused to native biodiversity.'",['Manufacturing']

1587,"b'-polyglutamic acid (-PGA) is an emerging biopolymer being widely used in cosmetics, biomedicine and othe fields. D-glutamate-rich -PGA is industrially produced by natural strain Bacillus species. D-glutamate degrades more slowly and L- glutamate has better biocompatibility. Therefore, -PGA with tailored L/D glutamate ratio is demanded for more diverse applications. By constructing the biobricks of -PGA synthase complex, 0.696 g/L L-glutamate-rich -PGA was accumulated in Corynebacterium glutamicum. Using the mathematical models based on the fermentation profile, the fermentation was optimized, and 15 times more -PGA was produced than that before. By introducing glutamate racemase gene racE under different Ptac promoter mutants, the L-glutamic acid content in -PGA varies from 97.1% to 36.9%. Finally, we devoted to fine tune the D/L-monomer ratio using standarized RBS elements (RBS modified with bicistron design). Our project provides a method for customerized polymer biosynthesis with precisely controlled D/L ratio, and may expand to other biopolymer synthesis.'",['Manufacturing']
1588,"b'Traditional biosynthesis platforms such as E. coli and yeast require external energy supplies, commonly in the form of sugars or starch. Besides the economic cost associated with these energy sources, such systems are often not considered durable. Indeed, the production processes of sugars and starch are energy inefficient and farmland intensive. To circumvent these issues, photosynthetic systems like cyanobacteria and algae have been gaining increasing interest for biosynthetic purposes as they require only light and CO2. With our project, OCYANO, we present two new cyanobacterial technologies for protein production. The first design comprises the production and secretion of proteins in an ultra-fast growing cyanobacterium. The second system relies on a cyanophage for the conversion of its hosts biomass to the protein of interest. Along with wet-lab exploration of these platforms, the economic and ecological relevances of both systems were investigated and compared to state of the art biosynthesis platforms.'",['Manufacturing']
1589,"b'Severe burn wounds constitute a major public health problem causing 300,000 casualties annually. Besides fatalities, 11 million victims are hospitalized, of which many are left with lifelong disfiguration and disabilities. Donor skin, used in current treatments, is scarce due to specific characteristics and many processing steps leading to high demand for alternative treatments. One interesting alternative is the use of a novel biomaterial recently found in the Humboldt squid suckerin protein. Suckerin assets unique features such as flexibility, strength and ability to self-assemble into -sheets, making it ideal for hydrogel formation. Since molecular engineering enables cheap, fast and high-yield production within microorganisms, we thrive to produce a suckerin-based hydrogel as a donor skin substitute. Introducing a linker system enables the joining of antimicrobial peptides, numbing agents and wound healing stimulators. Therefore, our suckerin-based hydrogel can improve the prognosis for burn wound victims by both preventing infections and promoting skin healing.'",['Manufacturing']
1590,"b'Diabetes, a disease caused by abnormal insulin regulation and production, affects approximately 8.8% of the population. Currently, subcutaneous injection of recombinant insulin is used to self-regulate abnormal blood glucose levels, a treatment that is painful and often prohibitively expensive for patients. Oral insulin alternatives are not yet a cost-effective alternative because the unprotected insulin is rapidly degraded by acidic stomach conditions and so there remains an unmet demand for low-cost methods of manufacturing oral insulin and/or novel methods for delivering insulin directly to the intestines. We are developing an edible recombinant microalgae strain called Algulin that produces either an ultrastable oral insulin analog or proinsulin peptides. Algulin reduces manufacturing costs by eliminating the need for insulin extraction and purification, improves efficacy over previous oral insulins by acting as a protective capsule and shielding the insulin from degradation, and eliminates uncomfortable injections for diabetic patients.'",['Manufacturing']
1591,"b'The vast chemical diversity of plant specialized metabolites has provided a historically long-standing avenue for humankind to access natural products with pharmacologically active properties. Many plants that were domesticated during ancient times for their medicinal and psychoactive value are currently known to produce nitrogenous bicyclic phytochemicals classified as tropane alkaloids (TAs). Examples of notable TAs include atropine and scopolamine, which are listed as essential medicines by the World Health Organization, and even the notoriously addictive stimulant, cocaine. The commercial demand for TAs is largely supplied through plant extraction as the enzymes responsible for the formation of tropinone, an intermediate metabolite central to the biosynthesis of many TAs, were controversial for nearly a century. With the recent elucidation of these enzymes and the increasing global demand for medicinal TAs, we investigate the potential of E. coli as a platform strain for the biosynthesis of TAs.'",['Manufacturing']

The NYU iGEM laboratory has approached this current problem from a biosynthetic perspective with a conjunction of optogenetics and engineering. We have inserted multiple pathways to induce and inhibit the production of our target flavonoids in E.coli. This will work by ligating the pathway genes with an inducible promoter that is activated by green light and repressed by red light in a matter of hours. The testing of the system is being performed in a bioreactor that follows industrial protocol and the extraction quantification will be tested by gas chromatography and High performance liquid chromatography.'",['Manufacturing']

RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved mechanism in eukaryotic organisms, in which sequence specific gene silencing is triggered by the introduction of dsRNA. In this project, we used RNAi technology to silence the genes encoding proteins with essential functions to induce mortality in Mikania micrantha Kunth through topical application of E Coli expressed RNAi molecules.

As time goes by, we come to realize that the new procedure to produce and use indigo is creating too many pollutions. China is the largest indigo supplier in the world, as its environmental law become stricter, local enterprises are facing challenges on the increasing environmental cost.

1597,"b'Plastic pollution is a large-scale environmental burden. An economy of single-use plastics, commonly made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) due to its high crystallinity and resistance to degradation, has led to the production of millions of tons of plastic that is improperly disposed. Remarkably, an enzyme produced by Ideonella sakaiensis, termed PETase, can degrade this polymer at ambient temperatures. Combining the recent mutations derived from Austin et al., (2018) to increase the catalytic activity of PETase, our goal is to further optimize the thermostability and catalytic ability of PETase, through targeted mutagenesis, creating sequences using rational design and machine learning algorithms. With further optimization, we believe PETase may offer an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution to industrial plastic recycling efforts. Moreover, as the byproducts of PET degradation, terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG), are valuable feedstocks for PET production, this approach offers the possibility of close-loop recycling.'",['Manufacturing']

The pathway transforms vanillate, present in BL (initial genetic circuit inductor) in to protocatechuete (secundary inductor), catechol and finally in to cis-cis-Muconate, a chemical used in some polymer production. This strategy will optimize the flux through metabolic channeling, toxic intermediate sequestration and dynamic metabolic control.

1600,"b'Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat many solid tumour cancers. It is obtained by debarking the yew tree species (Taxus Baccata), or through semi-synthesis from rare precursors in the trees needles. Both of these processes are unsustainable and contribute to the expensive production costs. Our project aims to address this in two ways. First, to enhance the rate of product formation by attaching rate-limiting enzymes of Paclitaxel semi-synthesis onto a hexameric protein scaffold called Assemblase. This spatial arrangement co-localises the enzymes, alleviating diffusion-related limitations of enzyme catalysis. The second component applies Assemblase to make the production of Paclitaxel from common analogues commercially viable. This reduces the need to log the yew tree, and lower reagent costs. In addition, the system allows for the recycling of co-products produced between the two pathways. Overall, our project aims to improve upon Paclitaxel manufacturing to meet the demands of the future.'",['Manufacturing']

This project aims to generate a multi-enzyme system, based on characteristics of wood-decaying fungi, to efficiently process lignin into high-value chemicals. To achieve this, Pichia pastoris is engineered to express horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO). HRP degrades lignin under consumption of hydrogen peroxide. AAO, in turn, utilises parts of the degradation products to create more hydrogen peroxide, forming a self-sustaining system.

Further, yeast is designed to self-lyse after production. First, we introduce extra copies of lipid synthesizing enzymes controlled by light-inducible promoters. Next, we coat the cells with light-absorbing nanoparticles to enable the cells to use light as an electron source for NADPH formation  a critical cofactor for lipid synthesis. This leads to increased carbon flux to lipid production.

We observed their behaviour and hypothesized their use as chassis for local production of desired proteins, without purification expenses. This project is centered around the production of compounds through minicells of E.coli MG1655 containing a plasmid of interest. Minicells are produced using two approaches: overexpression of the FtsZ ring and deletion of the min operon. In parallel, a bioreactor for cultivation and isolation of minicells from parental cells was designed to guarantee a final genomic DNA-free sample. Filtration and introduction of an infection-defective lambda phage into the genome of parental cells was implemented to achieve higher separation yield. We focused the project on production of indigo pigment and found a method to safely dye textile without purification or addition of chemicals.'",['Manufacturing']

Therefore, in tropical and subtropical areas, mosquito repellant products are in great demand. Nootkatone is a new mosquito repellent ingredient reported by EPA with more safety and higher stability, but excessively high cost has caused manufacturing limitations. SCUT-China aims at turning S. cerevisiae into a cell factory for Nootkatone production and improving efficiency by promoter engineering modification. Based on the fermentation characteristics of S. cerevisiae, we combined the upstream regulatory elements of different promoters according to the carbon source response mechanism of promoters, and obtained hybrid-promoter supporting high expression in both early and late fermentation. Further, we increased the transcriptional strength of hybrid-promoters by nucleosome affinity model. It is hoped that this project could help achieve higher market shares of Nootkatone and benefit more people.'",['Manufacturing']

Despite recent improvements in heterologous production of psilocybin using either bacteria or yeast, current methods persist to be tedious and costly with a reduced yield. That is why we aim to construct an enhanced biosynthesis of psilocybin from tryptophan, by introducing all four different enzymes from the Funghi in Escherichia coli.

The current lab on a chip microfluidic chips are highly specialized to each experiment and expensive to manufacture. In order to analyze the results of the experiments on microfluidic chips, many designs incorporate embedded sensors directly on chip. However, labs already have dedicated equipment to analyze experiments, such as plate readers and flow cytometers. Traditional analytical equipment could be used to analyze the outputs of microfluidic chips if the outputs were dispensed selectively into standard vessels, such as a 96-well plate. This would increase the design space for microfluidic experiments, enabling biologists to incorporate microfluidic chips into their workflows without having to fabricate highly specialized chips.

This CooA receptor can bind with the carbon monoxide derived from the polluted environment. The binding of the CooA receptor with carbon monoxide results in a change of the protein structure. Due to the changed structure, the CooA protein will be able to bind to a CooA sensitive promoter on the bacterial DNA. The binding of the CooA receptor with the promoter enables the synthesis of the enzyme urease. Accordingly, the formed urease converts the urea which is present in the medium into CO2. The released CO2 gas in the medium will be collected. When a certain threshold is reached in the amount of produced gas an increase in the resistance between two electrodes will occur.

The system we wish design in this occasion hopes to combat the issue of heat regulation that contests scientists and firms alike. 'Mr. Pyrofrost' will maintain the temperature of the system at a specific temperature through the functioning of two inversely affecting reactions regulated by the temperature of the system itself. The system stimulates an endothermic reaction pathway in higher temperatures and an exothermic reaction pathway in lower temperatures with one system inhibiting the other during function. The heat conditions of the system will both affect the functioning of 'Mr. Pyrofrost' and also be regulated by 'Mr. Pyrofrost'.""",['High School']
1669,"b'Industrial construction manufacturers recently switched to using paper instead of trees in some of their products. This leads to an excess of short chain cellulose fibers in the factorys water system. Microbes feed off the starches and produce odorous butyric acid. The current solution is to use biocides, but this is expensive, short term, and environmentally unsafe. Our solution is to engineer a S.cerevisiae cell to produce the alpha amylase enzyme from B.amyloliquefaciens. The alpha amylase breaks down the starch molecules in the water, removing the food source of the butyric acid producing microbes. The genetically modified yeast were tested in both soluble starch concentrations and industrial water samples. The amount of starch dropped from .006% to 0% within two hours. The amylase enzyme is able to degrade starch effectively in industrial water samples, making it a viable, sustainable, and environmentally safe treatment of industrial wastewater.'",['High School']

Due to human error, oil leakage is bound to occur, and because agriculture and the oilfield are closely intertwined, contamination is a cause for concern. ECOS, alginate beads containing modified E. coli, detects crude oil in a sample of soil or water. Detection of oil spills is a major issue because if oil contamination goes unchecked, the carcinogens found in oil can damage the crops and health of animals in the area. The current system for oil detection takes weeks before a sample is tested and returned. By this point, the result is invalid. ECOS allows detection of contamination on site and is easy to use. Testing can be done simply and accurately, allowing us to take action quickly and minimize health hazards in communities worldwide.'",['High School']

Detecting antibiotic resistance quickly is crucial to determine the correct treatment for different patients and for setting up quarantines to prevent spreading. We hypothesized that is possible to use quorum sensing (QS) to devise a rapid way for cells to report the existence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Here, we developed a reporter cell that expresses GFP in the presence of the QS signaling molecule acyl homoserine lactone (AHL). Our test cells (which act as a simulation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria) express lactonase, which breaks down AHL. In our experimental system, test cells should signify their presence by breaking down AHL and preventing GFP expression in reporter cells.

Chitosan has far ranging uses spanning from agriculture, medicine, and biofilm production to industrial water treatment. Chitosan first came to our attention as an anti-fungal agent through our last year\'s project to prevent crop spoilage. However, present methods of chitosan production cause much damage to the environment, and are very expensive. Lambert iGEM tackled this issue last year by dreaming up ""Chitinite"", an inexpensive and bio-friendly alternative to the current caustic and chemically intensive methods of chitosan production. This year we are continuing our project. We have already isolated the chitin deacetylase (CDA) gene from yeast and are working on expressing it in E.coli. Chitosan is toxic to E.coli, but by using a PelB tag to express CDA in the periplasm, we hope to greatly reduce the toxicity. If successful, this method will facilitate cheap mass production of CDA. By engineering cells to be used in a bioreactor with discarded shrimp shells, our ""Chitinite"" can help protect fragile ecosystems.

Furthermore, current sensors rely upon upon the presence of electricity and power, and are thus unable to act in scenarios of natural disasters when CO leaks are most likely. This project introduces a CO-sensing mechanism into E.coli using a CooA transcription activator and corresponding pCoof promoter to regulate the expression of a methyl salicylate pathway (pchBA and BSMT genes). The pathway converts the endogenous molecule chorismate into salicylic acid then methyl salicylate, producing a wintergreen smell in the presence of CO.

1703,"b'Construction of complex circuits is still hampered by ignorance of fundamental principles of genetic circuit design. One key challenge is the isolation of independent genetic components -- genes expressed on the same plasmid (or other DNA molecule) will often unexpectedly interfere with or enhance each others\' expression in an orientation-dependent fashion, even if they are nominally isolated by terminators and other motifs. This form of cross-talk may be caused by supercoiling generated during transcription, which has been shown to enhance or repress gene expression depending on the form of supercoiling. To test this hypothesis, we will test whether base pair spacing, terminators, or DNA ""clamps"" (made from DNA-binding proteins) placed between genes on a plasmid can eliminate their cross-talk.

1711,"b' Tanshinone is an important pharmacologic chemical extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza, a famous Chinese medicinal herb. It was reported that tanshinone can effectively cure Cardiovascular diseases. However, content of tanshinone in Salvia miltiorrhiza and its extraction efficiency are very low. Therefore, synthetic biology becomes the ideal way to produce tanshinone artificially. However, until now, the biosynthesis pathway of tanshinone is not clear. In this research, we aimed to produce one of the key enzymes copalyl diphosphate synthase 1 (SmCPS1) which initiate biosynthesis of tanshinone by building up a gene circuit in plasmid of E.coli. Our gene circuit contains a GST for purification of SmCPS1, a thrombin protease site, our target gene SmCPS1 and the reporter gene GFP. Successful biosynthesis of SmCPS1 will lead the way of biological synthesis of all the enzymes in synthesis of tanshinone, accelerate tanshinone production by fermentation, increase its yield and lower the cost effectively.'",['High School']

We further measured the expression efficiency of HHL1 promoted by various photosensitive promoters with high-light exposure, and named the most effective one as Super-HHL1.

We identified two potential biochemicals, cinnamaldehyde and phenylpyruvic acid, which are possibly attractant or repellent to the Nematode. We have designed a chemosensation assay to demonstrate the attraction and repulsion ability of the biochemical of interest.

A class of ATPases known as AAA+ Proteins involves a well-known proteolysis mechanism known as ClpXP in which ClpX unfolds and translocates a tagged protein into a sequestered proteolytic compartment in ClpP. We devised an inducible genetic construct in which ClpXP will degrade a chromoprotein upon induction. The data will be gathered using a device that can quantify the color of the light reflected by the chromoprotein before and after induction. This will ultimately allow us to measure the relative strength of degradation and further characterize a well-known proteolysis mechanism.

1722,"b'Blood clotting is controlled by a highly regulated pathway that attempts to ensure a balance between clotted and unclotted blood within a wound. As a response to trauma, enzymes in the pathway activate sequentially to convert fibrinogen into fibrin.The fibrin strands cross-link together to form a polymer mesh that causes blood flow to slow and eventually cease at the wound site. However, without external intervention the natural clotting process is too slow to prevent excessive hemorrhage and death when bleeding is severe. Proteins in some snake venoms have the ability to act as thrombin analogues and induce the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin at an accelerated rate, bypassing the regulatory pathway. The increased concentration of fibrin causes clots to form quickly within the bloodstream. Our goal is to utilize recombinant protein from Cerastes cerastes venom to prevent fatal hemorrhage and minimize thrombosis in cases of traumatic injury.'",['High School']

All these processes take their toll on the environment. However, Keratinase is a serine protease that primarily attacks the disulfide bonds in keratin wastesuch as feathers and hair. Thus, the expression of bacterial keratinases provides an opportunity to manage this degradation-resistant keratin waste and turn it into a high quality protein product such as fertilizer or animal feed.

1751,"b""Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder that causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain, and currently has no cure. HD is usually adult-onset, and includes symptoms such as amnesia, involuntary movements, and physical incoordination, rendering the patient with a lifespan of a mere ten years after onset. The main cause is a trinucleotide repeat of CAG in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, where a repeat of 40 or more can cause the disease to manifestation. Our goal is to create a synthetic RNA strand displacement technology that targets and blocks endogenous faulty mRNA and releases a corrected RNA strand for proper protein synthesis of the HTT protein. For this, we aim to generate a plamsid with an identical sequence to the human mutant form of Huntington's disease. Ultimately, once technologies are developed to overcome endocytosis and blood brain barrier traversal, an injectable cure can be produced.""",['High School']

But the nitrite generated in the production of pickles has always been a concerning problem to health and food safety, due to its conversion to carcinogenic nitrosamine once taken up by humans. Currently, most industrial production of pickles relies on the natural decomposing process of nitrite, which is inefficient and often takes months to complete. To make an improvement, we designed a bio-device to make the degradation of nitrite more rapid and environmental-friendly. Our device consists of a positive feedback loop device followed by a fusion enzyme which can reduce nitrite to nitrogen and oxygen. The feedback loop is regulated by a nitrite/nitrate specific promoter to ensure the expression of downstream function proteins only in pickles environment.

Because it induces the increased expression of growth related genes, oncogene amplification is one of the driving forces of cancer cell replication. Recently, it was discovered that some oncogenes resided on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). Like the DNA on chromosomes, ecDNAs are double stranded. A key difference, however, is the circular shape of ecDNAs; they are able to randomly distribute because they do not have centromeres, which increases heterogeneity in daughter cells. This can cause the cancerous tumors to develop faster resistance to current treatments. To target the ecDNA, we used CRISPR technology to create double strand breaks specifically in the ecDNA.

The key is that the Miraculin in the Synsepalum dulcificum Could turn the taste of sour foods to sweat briefly, allowing patients with diabetes mellitus to enjoy the sweat taste. However, the current technology couldnt make the collection of Miraculin from the Synsepalum dulcificum easy and efficiently. Our goal is to compound the Synsepalum dulcificum protein by using genetically modified technology, and we believe that the new compound method could increase the quantity of the Miraculin and decrease the cost of production, with the intention to help diabetes mellitus patients.'",['High School']
1791,"b'Our project is inspired by the possible contamination of the carcinogenic aflatoxins (AFTs), in Pu?er, a Chinese traditional fermented tea. We aim to design a genetically engineered yeast system to detect and degrade its widely occurred species AFT-B1. Our system contains three modules-induction, detection and degradation. The induction module was designed based on an iGEM project in 2017 using two fragments of an antibody against AFT-B1. The detection module utilizes enhanced yellow fluorescent protein to indicate the presence of ATF-B1. In the degradation module, four candidate enzymes were incorporated individually and their activities were assessed. Both detection and degradation modules are triggered when AFT-B1 bridges the two antibody fragments. Our design not only provides a parallel detection and degradation in yeast with potential practical value for Pu?er Tea and other agricultural products, but also establishes a convenient screening system for identifying novel AFT-B1-degrading enzymes.'",['High School']

We are working with T.A.S.A., exporter of anchovy fish meal to detect, accumulate, and isolate mercury (Hg) from their fish meal product. Our first construct contains a Hg accumulator and Green Fluorescence protein (GFP) to detect and accumulate the Hg. The second construct, with delayed expressed of a Killer Red (KR) protein, will kill the bacteria in response to light. We aim to characterize the delayed expression of the KR protein under three different RBSs using unique constructs. The construct enabling delayed expression of the KR protein will be coupled with GFP/accumulator construct. We are building the GFP/accumulator construct using overlapping PCR.

1793,"b'Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial species, often infects major burns and cystic fibrosis. Historically, antibiotics can treat these infections; however, P. aeruginosa quickly grow resistance, increasing colonization in human flora and decreasing treatment efficiency. Alternatively to antibiotics, inhibition of quorum sensing (QS), chemical communication among bacterial colonies, is under speculation. This experiment compares the effects of common antibiotics (gentamicin and tobramycin) to QS inhibitors (salicylic acid and zeaxanthin) on Pseudomonas survival and QS activity. Bacteria transformed with a plasmid that detected LasR, a P. aeruginosa QS indicator, levels and correspondingly produced green fluorescence protein (GFP) would be transformed to P. aeruginosa and grown in the presence of each antibiotic and QS inhibitor over 3 days. Absorbance and fluorescence would then be measured through serial dilution. This experiment explores a promising possibility for the future of antibacterial care efficiency and success in saving the lives of cystic fibrosis and burn patients.'",['High School']
1794,"b'Fluoride, in appropriate quantities, has been recognized as beneficial for protecting tooth enamel from decay. However, a significant problem arises when excess amounts of fluoride infiltrate drinking water. High fluoride concentrations can result in dental fluorosis, which is characterized in children by hypomineralization of the enamel. To address this challenge by efficiently detecting fluoride in water, we aim to develop a fluoride biosensor using previously characterized fluoride riboswitches. Last year, we have developed an operon that, when fluoride binds, activates the riboswitch resulting in transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Thus, when fluoride is present, bacterial growth can be observed in the presence of chloramphenicol. However, this system was only able to detect high fluoride concentrations. To improve the efficacy and reduce the detection threshold, we used restriction enzymes to test various promoters and riboswitch sequences. We found that two of the new sequences promoted higher bacterial growth.'",['High School']

Endogenous genes in yeast are deleted to reduce shunt products. Besides, we design, characterize, and use a library of transcription activator-like effectors (TALE) stabilized promoter to regulate the heterologous gene expression in E. coli.

1797,"b'Our project is to make a new biological mosquito killer to kill mosquitoes in an environmentally friendly way. Mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and Zika are prevailing around the world and causing death of a great number of people every year. Therefore, controlling mosquitoes is of great importance. There are two active components in our product: protein Cry11Aa and recombinant Aedes aegypti densoviruses. Protein Cry11Aa is solubilized in mosquito mid-gut and can lead to cell lysis when binding the receptor on cell membrane. The recombinant Aedes aegypti densoviruses can express insect-specific toxin, which kill mosquito by to affect insect neuronal sodium conductance. We mix them together to make effective and environmental mosquito killer. The new mosquito killer shows a high specificity for mosquitoes as a host. It is relatively stable in the environment and have the potential to spread and persist in mosquito populations.'",['High School']

1799,"b'Type 1 and 2 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM, T2DM) are caused by inappropriate insulin production. The former results from the lack of  cell, while the later results from insulin resistance. In order to treat T1DM as well as severe cases of T2DM, patients should be injected with insulin analog multiple times a day. Because these analogues are readily degraded upon oral intake, the only method of injecting insulin analog is via invasive methods. We aimed to develop minicell-based insulin delivery system that can be orally administered. Minicells are achromosomal cells that do not reproduce. Overexpression of FtsZ gene in Escherichia coli induces abnormal cell division that produces minicells. Through gibson assembly, we have engineered the minicell that produce single chain insulin associated with cell penetrating peptide that facilitates cellular intake. The cells lyses in response to bile salt, which leads to targeted secretion of insulin in intestine.'",['High School']

1801,"b'Poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) is a prevalent material which can is used in various applications, while bringing adverse effects to the environment. An enzyme, PETase, can degrade the highly-crystalized PET to mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), terephthalate and Bis(2-Hydroxyethyl) terephthalate. MHET is also further decomposed by MHETase to terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol (EG). EG can be further broken down in E. coli K-12 to produce carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide, however, is a notable greenhouse gas. Using the mutagenesis of the amino acid residues of nifD in nitrogenase, the substrate binding site can be modified so that carbon dioxide can undergo the multi-electron reduction to methane. We propose an efficient carbon dioxide reduction system with the decomposition of PET as the primary carbon source. PETase, MHETase, and amino acid substituted nitrogen fixation genes in MoFe nitrogenase will be expressed in a fast-growing bacterium, E. coli.'",['High School']
1802,"b'The situation of SCA was described by Professor Edwin Chan during interviews. The difficulties encountered by patients from different stages of SCA were shared in a workshop with Hong Kong Spinocerebellar Ataxia Association. The SCA3 relates to either up or down regulation of four miRNAs biomarkers. A new approach for the diagnosis of SCA3 will be developed under this study. Under the mentorship of the University of Hong Kong, a DNA tweezer nanomachine is employed to detect target SCA3 biomarkers. When the desired miRNA hybridized to the recognition site on the tweezers, the nanomachine is turned from an open state to a closed state, which allows the assembly of the split strand G-quadruplex. The G-quadruplex acts as an aptamer and binds to hemin. The hemin-mediated peroxidase activity produces a color change as a signal. This alternative diagnostic method would have further implication on monitoring the onset and progress of SCA3.'",['High School']
1803,"b'Heavy metal pollution has been a hot issue among the society, copper is one of the most universal types of pollutant. In aquaponics, accumulation of copper ions is toxic to organisms. In sight of this, we aimed to create a cost-effective device for metal ions removal from water. In this project, metallothioneins, a type of protein capable of binding metal ions, was expressed in E. coli. Copper absorption capacity of the transformed bacteria is tested. From our results, E. coli can absorb copper ions at 10 mg/L and 2 mg/L. The is no significance difference between untransformed and transformed bacteria at 10 mg/L. At 2 mg/L, the transformed bacteria expressing Elsholtzia haichowensis Metallothionein 1 (EhMT1) slightly enhances the copper absorption ability. At last, we tried circulating E. coli inside dialysis tubings, receiving positive results, it is confirmed the idea using bacteria to remove copper ions in water is feasible.'",['High School']
1804,"b'Many gram-negative bacteria naturally create compounds called endotoxins, which induce pathological symptoms including septic shock in humans. Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) testing, the gold-standard endotoxin detection test, is used in virtually every area of biomedical product development. The test is derived from horseshoe crab blood, including coagulation Factor C, the primary effector protein. Many horseshoe crabs die each year due to the bleeding process, straining populations and ecosystems along the US Atlantic Coast and in Asia, where it is less sustainable. Moreover, LAL testing is expensive, creating a barrier to biomedical innovation in low-resource settings. For these reasons, our team sought to synthesize a codon-optimized sequence of Factor C and integrate it into Bacillus subtilis (a gram-positive bacterium) using a pAX01 backbone with a xylose inducible promoter. In the future, we hope to design a detection mechanism to signal for the cleavage of Factor C and the presence of endotoxin.'",['High School']

HCV C gene was expressed, and collected secreted HCV C protein was used to bind specifically with the nucleic acid aptamer. Using the competing reaction of the target antigen, a highly sensitive fluorescent aptamer sensor was developed based on the rolling circle replication. When there is no target antigen, the aptamer complementary sequence binds with aptamer instead of the padlock probe; whereas when the aptamer probe binds with the target antigen, the complementary sequence hybridizes with padlock probe, which triggers rolling circle amplification reaction. Under the action of DNA ligase, the padlock probe is further cyclized and a rolling circle amplification occurs under the action of DNA polymerase.'",['High School']

1809,"b'As energy resources get scarce, bioethanol production from lignocellulosic waste looks like a great alternative in terms of high energy yield and eco-friendliness. Due to their highly complex and rigid structure, lignocellulosic wastes need to be pretreated before they can be fermented. The process causes toxic byproducts such as furfural and 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural that inhibit the ethanol production and growth rate of bacteria, E. coli ethanologenic strain KO11. By integrating GSH and FucO genes into KO11 bacteria, we aim to enhance bioethanol production. Since furfural and HMF act as thiol-reactive electrophiles, cellular glutathione levels get depleted in their presence, leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Thus, overexpression of GSH increases cellular growth rates and lifespan. On the other hand, the expression of fucO results in the formation of NADH dependent furfural oxidoreductase which degrades furfural into furfuryl alcohol resulting in a higher rate of growth and ethanol fermentation.'",['High School']

We constructed a telomerase-activating gene expression system to induce cancer cell death. In this system, a vector ended with a telomerase-recognizable end can be elongated by telomerase, which will provide a telomeric repeat sequence that can be bound by a telomeric DNA-targeting dCas9-VP64-sgRNA. This binding will activate expression of an effector gene Cas9. The produced Cas9 protein can then be targeted to the telomeres of cancer cell chromosomes by a telomere-targeting sgRNA, which will produce the DNA damage and lead to cancer cell death. However, due to no telomerase activity, this system will not affect normal cells.'",['High School']

Both devices will self-induce DNA degradation if recombinant bacteria are accidentally leaked into environment. Moreover, with multiple thermal-sensitive devices and gas vesicles, we could perform noninvasive monitoring of the bacteria, drug release by heating tissue at the nidus, and initiation of DNA degradation by applying a higher temperature.

1830,"b'Phyllotreta striolata is one of the most destructive insects worldwide. However, the present insect control strategies have certain limitations, for example, chemical insecticide applications will cause dietary pollution and environmental destruction. Here, we aim to develop an RNAi-based approach for controlling P. striolata. This approach is to topically apply exogenous siRNAs/shRNAs onto vegetables, ingestion of the sprayed siRNAs or shRNAs by P. striolata will induce the RNAi mechanism in the insect and lead to its death. In our project, siRNAs/shRNAs were designed based on the mRNA sequences of their target genes. The effect of both siRNAs and shRNAs in mediating RNAi in P. striolata were examined. Experimental results show that both siRNAs and shRNA could successfully silence their target genes, which was demonstrated by the survival rate decrease after siRNA or shRNA treatment. Our project provides an environmentally friendly approach for insect control.'",['High School']
1831,"b'Although numerous strains of microalgae have already been identified as being useful for biotechnology purposes, to make commercial up-scaling of algal production cost effective, research into novel approaches to enhance microalgae growth, and their products is needed. Microalgae and bacteria have existed together from the early days of evolution. This co-evolution provides an interesting avenue for industrial biotechnology exploration. Synthetic biology presents us with an opportunity to rationally design and construct microbial communities with well-defined objectives. The co-cultivation of engineered bacteria and micro-algae provides the possibility for enhancing associations between these populations. We aim to engineer a strain of E.coli which will help increase the biomass of microalgae through nutrient-exchange-based mutualism. Our engineered bacterium was designed to express the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of Vibrioferrin, a type of siderophore. Our construct will allow for the increased bioavailability of iron for many species of microalgae once co-cultured.'",['High School']

Even small amounts of arsenic pose a threat to long-term community health, including cancer and developmental issues in children. The city and state have spent more than $62,000,000 over 18 years testing around 450 yards in the region, with efforts still underway. Our iGEM team seeks to change that paradigm by engineering an affordable and easy-to-use biosensor that utilizes chromoproteins made in the presence of bioavailable arsenic. Our biosensor is user-friendly by design and will not require hazardous chemical reagents.

1833,"b'Turning red after consuming alcohol may seem like a mere social inconvenience. Yet, this flushing response is caused by an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a carcinogenic intermediate of alcohol metabolism. Acetaldehyde is broken down into harmless acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). ALDH2 deficiency, the result of a point mutation in the ALDH2 gene, produces a much less efficient ALDH2 enzyme, leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde and the subsequent flushing response. While about 8% of the global population is ALDH2 deficient, in our home, Taiwan, approximately 47% of the population carries this genetic mutation--the highest percentage in the world! Studies show that ALDH2 deficiency greatly increases the risk of developing esophageal and head and neck cancer. Thus, our project aims to produce recombinant ALDH2 to decrease levels of acetaldehyde in the upper digestive tract region. We envision delivery of ALDH2 as a purified protein or in consumer-friendly probiotics.'",['High School']

Such fungal infections significantly reduce sustainability and food production in developing countries, where mycotoxin exposure from lack of advanced food storage are responsible for severe economic losses and 40% of diseases. Our team developed a modified enzyme chitinase capable of breaking down chitin cell walls. Specifically, Serratia Marcescens Chitinase works against multiple families of fungi. By GSTChiA Chitinase genes with a signal sequence from araC, we successfully generated an Escherichia coli line that secretes chitinase against Rhizoctoniasolani Solani, Alternaria raphani, and many other pathogenic fungi. Expression of GSTChiA was further quantified through analysis of chitin compounds.

1835,"b'With growing environmental concerns, industries are increasingly relying on biofuels. Biodiesel storage tanks are susceptible to water infiltration that often results in biofilm formation containing bacteria and fungi. Biofilms may clog pipes, degrade fuel, or corrode storage tanks. We set out to engineer a seek, aim, and destroy system for the remediation of microbial biofilms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, commonly found in fuel biofilms, releases the quorum sensing molecule C4-HSL. Our engineered E. coli cells express CheZ protein in response to a concentration gradient of C4-HSL to activate the flagella motors and propel the cells towards the biofilm. In addition, the engineered E. coli expresses chitinase on its surface and secretes cinnamaldehyde. Chitinase breaks down chitin in the fungal cell walls, increasing the ability of cinnamaldehyde to destroy the fungi. Cinnamaldehyde also eliminates bacteria, thus remediating the biofilm.

A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying RCC progression, including metastasis, is required to improve RCC treatment. LncRNAs have been shown to have crucial roles in carcinogenesis and metastasis. LncRNA IL7-AS is a newly discovered lncRNA, which has been suggested to be associated with innate immunity. We first examined the expression pattern of IL7-AS in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues via mining various available public data sets, which has suggested IL7-AS may play an important role in carcinomas, especially in renal cell carcinoma. Our project will clone the different splices of IL7-AS and investigate the role of IL7-AS in renal cell carcinoma. Our studies may reveal that IL7-AS is a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for renal cell carcinoma.'",['High School']

Nicotine, a major toxic component of tobacco, can cross biological membranes and the blood-brain barrier easily. During cigarette manufacturing, large quantities of tobacco waste with high concentrations of nicotine are produced, and the disposal of these wastes is a serious ecological problem. Microbial organisms play important roles in the tobacco manufacturing process by altering the content of nicotine. Some strains of Pseudomonas exhibits high nicotine-degrading activity, which has a gene cluster encoded enzymes involved in the catabolism of nicotine. In this project, we are aiming to explore a better way to nicotine detection and degradation. The Escherichia coli strains was constructed to easily detect the concentration of nicotine using synthetic biological methods. Meanwhile, over-expressing the key enzyme genes for nicotine bioremediation is also in progress.'",['High School']
1838,"b'The Opossum is an animal with outstanding resistance to toxins, snake venoms in particular. This anti-venom ability is gained through a single protein; the Lethal Toxin Neutralizing Factor (LTNF). We are attempting to produce an improved synthetic and cost-effective version of the active domain of the protein as a synthetic anti-venom for human use. VenomXL incorporates the power of the post-translational modification processes primarily methylation or acetylation on critical locations of the active polypeptide of the LTNF that improved target affinity. The synthetic polypeptide is then circularized, a process that comprises of adding cysteine amino acids to both ends of a polypeptide chain; triggering the formation of a disulphide bridge, ultimately leading to a circular structure. Circularized synthetic peptides are known for not only greater stability but also greater efficacy thereby improving its shelf life and lowering the required dosage for treatment, ultimately providing a more efficient bioproduct.'",['High School']
1839,"b'With an estimated 500 million patients worldwide, Diabetes mellitus (DM) presents a major threat to human health. Largely attributed to genetics and lifestyle choices, Type II DM reduces insulin responses to elevations in blood glucose. Though current treatments for pre-diagnosed DM patients largely include drug prescriptions and restrictive diets, we believe a supplement to ease dietary constraints would be beneficialparticularly within the Japanese community. For our project, we designed a construct that will express a wheat albumin (0.19), which acts as an -amylase inhibitor, thus hindering -amylases ability to break starches into glucose. Specific amino acid substitutions were made in 0.19 to improve inhibitory activity. Our proposed delivery mechanism is through miso, a staple Japanese bean paste. With this supplement, patients will not be completely restricted from the traditionally high-carb Japanese dietpresenting a potential strategy for reducing carbohydrate-based dietary restrictions experienced by many pre-diagnosed type II DM patients.'",['High School']

During this season, our team has designed a novel system to detect and degrade -lactams in order to provide a potential solution to antibiotic pollution. Mec system from Staphylococcus aureus and the -lactamase blaCMY-10 in Enterobacter aerogenes were designed as our antibiotics detective and degradative system respectively, which were adapted into E. coli. The results of antibiotics detection illustrated that it can be sensitive to low concentration of ampcilin. And the zone of inhibition test showed that blaCMY10 can effectively degrade ampcilin, cephalothin and cefoxitin which is consistent with what we expected. In our final applied design, we aim to create a combined device, it can be installed at wastewater treatment facilities and the drainage outlet at hospitals, farms and so on.'",['High School']

Furthermore, nickel is prevalent in everyday items, such as eyeglass frames, coins, or zippers. With nickel being so common, a proper nickel detection method is important for those with nickel allergies. To address such issues, we will engineer and characterize E. coli for nickel sensitivity using the rcn promoter. The 2011 Lyon Biosciences team previously used this part in a cobalt detecting project, and they noted its nickel detecting ability. However, the nickel aspect of the part has not been characterized in the iGEM competition. Therefore, we hope to contribute meaningful characterization data for the rcn promoter while engineering nickel sensitive E. coli.'",['High School']
1842,"b'Antibiotics save lives by killing pathogens, but often kill non-pathogenic gut bacteria as well. These bacteria digest food, help the immune system, synthesize vitamins, and produce neurotransmitters. Antibiotics decrease bacterial diversity by 25%, which can lead to a range of health issues and increase the risk of future infection. Microbiome diversity is regulated and encouraged by Mucus Associated Functional Factors (MAFFs), a protein produced by B. theta bacteria. Antibiotics kill B. theta, thereby reducing MAFF production and creating a cycle that prevents a healthy gut. By introducing the MAFF-producing gene onto a plasmid, inserting this into E. coli, and then transplanting the E. coli into the gut, a microbiome could be regrown. Our bacteria will have a short life expectancy because of our xylose-dependent antitoxin, which inhibits growth once the xylose is metabolized. The MAFFs produced by these regulated E. coli will promote the reestablishment of a healthy microbiome.'",['High School']

Our project is designed to solve both the detection and the remediation of heavy metal pollution in one system. Implementing the MerR and PbrR sensor proteins, as well as an amplifying module downstream involving TEV and CI434, the detection system can reliably output a zero-or-one signal on the presence of mercury and lead through GFP. We have also incorporated the curli and spytag-spycatcher mechanism in our remediation module. Such mechanism creates an interconnected biofilm of spycatcher sockets, on which metal-binding proteins can be attached to the surface of our engineered bacteria. We have applied this to maximize the surface area of reaction, which magnifies the remediation efficiency. Combined with our purification hardware, our product offers an affordable yet smart solution for heavy metal pollution.'",['High School']

Pesticide and antibiotic have disastrous long term effects in the form of ecological destruction and creation of antibiotic resistant soil bacteria. We improved upon the work of the 2017 TecCEM team, using a modification of their system to silence critical psyllid development genes using siRNA. We targeted arginine kinase and superoxide dismutase, and we explored the use of whole bacteria instead of purified siRNA to treat plants. We envision delivery via a trap that contains the RNase minus E.coli/siRNA-producing cassette. We hope to slow down the spread of CLas through the reduction of psyllid populations.'",['High School']

We utilize E. coli to synthesize laccase and todC1C2ABD, four enzymes that can convert hexadecylbenzene to urushiol, the other functional component of raw lacquer aside from laccase; in S. cerevisiae, we aim to produce carminic acid, the major red component of carmine. The laccase, urushiol, and carminic acid are mixed with several cost-effective ingredients, resulting in an artificial red-colored lacquer that can be easily applied in industrial and domestic contexts. This synthetic biological method avoids the potential danger due to unknown natural components and expands the potential of inheriting and further developing lacquerware culture.'",['High School']

1848,"b'Contamination of aquatic and terrestrial environments with crude oil is a global issue. Crude oil contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), compounds that are difficult to degrade and environmentally toxic. To combat these compounds, a novel methodology was designed for PAH and other hydrocarbon bioremediation from various catabolic pathways upstream of innocuous intermediates. Resulting intermediates are ultimately employed anaerobically to convert into dissolved hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen synthesis is also fueled by pathways that metabolize n-chained hydrocarbons. HORIZON 2.0 also utilizes pathways for the degradation of salicylate and phthalate, compounds that resulted from previous PAH degradation constructs but are unusable by E. coli. To modulate between the various conditions for degradation and synthesis, a positively regulated magnesium riboswitch and novel synthetic CRISPRi operators under riboswitch regulation were designed for use as synthetic operators. Ultimately, this project allows broad spectrum transformation of PAHs and other hydrocarbons within crude oil into usable energy.'",['High School']

This causes drastic declines in bee populations, disrupting wild ecosystems and global agriculture. In this study, a primary CCD culprit, imidacloprid, is detoxified via paratransgenesis. Using this technique, the midgut bacteria of the bee are engineered to express a cytochrome p450, rendering the bee resistant to the insecticide. By attaching the reporter phoA to the insecticide-resistance gene, CYP6AY1, found in Nilaparvata lugens, the expression of the protein can be monitored. The signal sequence pelB is used to secrete the protein into the bee gut, where it can metabolize the imidacloprid. Once this system successfully functions in-vitro, the transgenic bacteria can be introduced to the bee orally and monitored for significant effects. We hypothesize that this treatment will increase the survival rate of A. mellifera when exposed to imidacloprid.'",['High School']

Nine E. coli strains were engineered, each with unique mutations to alter the PETase activity and thermodynamic properties. Growth assays were conducted at different temperatures, with and without the presence of the PET substrate. Protein expression analysis of the mutants revealed a band for every strain at approximately 31 kDa, the expected size of PETase.

1851,"b'Fluoride, in appropriate quantities, is recognized as beneficial for protecting tooth enamel from decay. However, a significant problem arises when excess amounts of fluoride are present in drinking water. Consumption of water containing high amounts of fluoride can contribute to dental fluorosis, which manifests in children as hypomineralization of the enamel. The previous East Chapel Hill iGEM teams had attempted to develop a fluoride biosensor using previously characterized fluoride riboswitches. This system, known as the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase operon (CHOP), allows for the transcription of the antibiotic chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in high amounts of fluoride. Thus, when high amounts of fluoride are present, bacterial growth can be observed in the presence of chloramphenicol. In previous years, we encountered issues forming reliable conclusions from our results when using plating assays. This year, we aimed to develop a more throughput liquid media assay which has allowed for quantitative and more accurate characterization of CHOP.'",['High School']

These transformed cells will be implemented into a bio-assay designed to be used by anchovy fishermen on their boats to determine cadmium levels in the fish. This test will allow early detection, saving both time and money in the production line because they will be able to infer cadmium levels in the fish-meal before it is bagged.

Although PETase can biologically degrade PET, the rate of enzymatic reaction is not suitable for usage in plastic waste treatment. Therefore, creating mutants which have a higher PET degradation activity may represent an effective and a long term solution of pollution from PET. After structural studies of PETase and its mutants, we hypothesized a more hydrophobic surface and narrower substrate binding site could lead to an increase in activity due to a better substrate interaction with PET.

It prevents neurodegeneration by inactivating GABA, which transmits an excessive inhibitory signal. Moreover, this system is reversible so it is capable of resolving the problem induced by GABA deficiency. If this project is fully developed and applied, it can cure not only PD but also addiction, schizophrenia, and other neurodegenerative diseases.""",['High School']

We attached Cell-penetrating peptide(CPP) to the N-terminus of scFv(CPP-scFv(P5)) to design hyperstable scFv(P5) that can penetrate the cell membrane. CPP-scFV(P5) was expressed and purified using affinity and size-exclusion chromatography to check if CPP-scFV(P5) binds lysozyme, the target protein. Immunofluorescence(IF) showed CPP-scFv(P5) can penetrate the cell membrane. Through modeling, we grafted CDR regions of anti-Ras antibody to scFv(F8) to make hyperstable scFv that can recognize Ras. We performed homology modeling of engineered scFv using Modeller and showed our model is structurally similar to anti-Ras antibody. Our experiments demonstrate hyperstable scFv with CPP can go into the cell and function in reducing conditions. This opens opportunities for developing antibodies that target intracellular proteins.'",['High School']
1870,"b'Soil-transmitted helminthiasis infects 1.5 billion people globally. The prevalence and persistence of parasitic worm infections stem from poor sanitation infrastructure and a lack of affordable diagnostic tools. LABYRINTH, a helminth detection system, implements low-cost hardware devices, biosensor toehold switches, and software analysis to diagnose helminthiasis. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism for infectious helminths, LABYRINTH isolates and lyses helminth eggs using a frugal filter and homogenizer. Biosensor cells detect C. elegans by targeting the lin-4 gene with an RNA toehold switch. If transcribed, the toehold switch activates GFP expression, indicating the presence of helminth eggs in the sample. The FluoroCents app quantifies fluorescence and maps this data onto a cloud-based service, enabling health organizations to efficiently allocate targeted anthelmintic medications. LABYRINTH has the potential to improve the quality of life for over a billion people worldwide by illuminating the chronic nature of helminthiasis and increasing the affordability of diagnostics.'",['High School']

Additionally, current antibiotics can cause harm to the human microbiomes due to delayed or misdiagnosis. Therefore, alternative detection methods and antimicrobials should be investigated. We propose the use of a CRISPR-Cas13a system for rapid detection and specific targeting of pathogens. CRISPR-Cas13a can target and cleave a strain-specific RNA sequence. The cleaving of the target RNA sequence will initiate non-discriminant cleavage of surrounding non-target RNA. Our system will report the presence of a pathogen by a visible colour loss due to the collateral cleavage of fluorescent RNA Mango. Furthermore, our alternative antimicrobial will consist of an engineered phagemid that encodes for the CRISPR-Cas13a system, which when inserted into a chosen bacteriophage can then infect pathogenic bacterial cells in the human body; thereby destroying the targeted bacteria through collateral RNA cleavage.'",['High School']

On the one hand, although pigments can be extracted and purified easily from fruits or vegetables, the use of food for these purposes is not a sustainable practice. On the other hand, natural pigments are prone to oxidation, which severely affect color stability. Therefore, as a proof of concept, we propose a synthetic biology approach in which bacteria are genetically programmed to synthesize enzymes capable of catalyzing the transformation of color precursors into pigments. Oxidation of these pigments can then be prevented by either chemical or physical strategies. We explore both the use of a yeast cell-free system as a chemical anti-oxidant and the encapsulation of the resultant pigments to prevent their oxidation using physical barriers.'",['High School']

Therefore, we can use acetylcholinesterase to measure the concentration of Phosphate in water by detecting the level of PH. Our goal in this research is to produce acetylcholinesterase by bioengineering. We insert the ACHE gene in mouse into multi-clone vector pGEX-4T-1 with restrictive enzymes PluTI and BspQI, and then fuse it with E.coli.

HucR is a transcriptional factor that senses UA. We combined HucR with the amplifier, Rin-p80, so that the bacteria could sense the stimulation of uric acid and send signals to us. We also identified the gene downstream HucR operon as uricase gene smUOX-Flag, which degraded uric acid at high a concentration.

The lead bioremediation system includes two metal-binding proteins, a metallothionein and a synthetic phytochelatin expressed by surface-display system. For the future, we hope through our effort, we can finally establish a reliable, low cost method to solve the problem of lead pollution in serious contamination areas.'",['High School']
1907,"b'M-Phenylenediamine (MPD) is an important raw material of organic synthesis, but it is also a common chemical pollutant which causes toxicity to aquatic animals and humans. Until now, people do not have a cost effective and convenient way to degrade MPD. Here we use three starting microbial strains with adaptive evolution to degrade MPD. The first two strans are Escherichia coli MG1655 and the strain with laccase expression plasmid which is reported degrading polyphenols, and the other is an unknown strain isolated from contaminated sludge. Under the increasing supplement of MPD in their culture media, the adaptive evolution may happen during generations. Our results demonstrate the lasccase overexpression E. coli strans has the ability to degrade MPD. We also inditified the unknown strain is Bacillus aryabhattai B8W22, and it is able to degrade the analogues of MPD.

1908,"b'Microplastics from household waste are easily entered into our water system, which is one of the most difficult environmental pollutants to degrade. The newly developed biodegradation technology can effectively degrade highly polyester contaminants, such as PET plastics, which can be efficiently degraded using PETase. On the other hand, biosorption can effectively collect microplastic particles. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesize that genetically enhanced biofilms can promote PET microplastic degradation through the proximity effect of the enzyme and substrate, thus benefiting future environmental governance applications.'",['High School']
1909,"b'In 1/3 of the worlds oceans, the iron concentration limits phytoplankton growth. Iron is required for photosynthesis and is critical for the base of the marine food web. A better ability to capture iron could increase phytoplankton populations which would have benefits such as reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide by acting as a carbon sink. We decided to engineer Synechococcus (cyanobacteria) because it consumes high levels of CO2, has a high replication rate, and has been used by many previous iGEM teams. Our project will engineer cyanobacteria to transport iron into cells and reduce it to the bioavailable Fe(II) form. The increased iron utilization will increase photosynthesis and growth of phytoplankton. To prevent harmful phytoplankton blooms, a kill switch will also be added to the cells to prevent overgrowth of cells if iron concentration increased significantly. These modifications will stabilize the marine food chain and absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.'",['High School']
1910,"b'Acne vulgaris troubles teenagers and sometimes adults as it not only affects the skin but also self-confidence. Traditional treatment to acne vulgaris involving antibiotics may trigger drug resistance in acne pathogenic bacteria, especially Propionibacterium. acnes. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered excellent alternatives of antibiotics for their capability of providing effective, broad-spectrum defenses against infections and exhibiting relatively low potential to elicit resistance. However, AMP curing products nowadays are not abundant, and most AMPs are produced via chemosynthesis, a rather costly method incapable of yielding AMPs with great antimicrobial potency. Therefore, we aim to create an anti-acne product which consists of biosynthesized P. acnes killing AMPs, adhesive/cohesive proteins, and tyrosinase. The mixture which we named Acneutralizer forms a thin film when applied to acne-infected skin. This product may be brought to market, helping acne sufferers improve their conditions by easily killing P. acnes.'",['High School']
1911,"b'When baking at home, people always have their bread over-fermented due to the of experience and disturbance from other matters. However, fermentation is the most important process in baking. Therefore, we came up with the idea of modifying the genes in auxotroph baking yeast to stop fermentation at appropriate times. We designed a circuit based on toggle switch. Before we add the inducer galactose, the switch is kept at off state, where a protein that complements the auxotroph gets to express, after the galactose is added, the switch is turned on by accumulation of the previously repressed gene, the expression of the other gene is then shut down, along with the gene of the complimentary protein, leading to a drop in their concentrations and terminating fermentation over a certain period of time.'",['High School']
1912,"b'The inspiration for our project came from knowing nursing mothers faced lots of breastfeeding problems, including insufficiency of milk production and inconveniences of suckling. Realizing that there were significant differences between formula milk and breast milk, we came up with creating a breast milk substitute that better fits human nutritional needs. We learned that present formula milk lacks of important proteins like  casein,  casein, lactoferrin, and -lactalbumin. Thus, we paid our attention to these proteins and hoped we could produce them using synthetic biology methods. We chose yeasts as our engineering bacteria because they are welcoming for human bodies. We transfected CSN2, CSN3, LTF, and LALBA that are responsible for making the proteins that mentioned above into yeasts, and cultivated them. Finally, we got our targeted proteins and created a product. We hope following iGEMers can produce more materials like amylose to fix the disadvantages of formula milk.'",['High School']
1913,"b'Wild animals leathers have great values for the clothing and fashion industry. Some luxury products like crocodile bag even require leather from rare species. This profitable business drives poachers to illegally hunt and hurt those wild animals. The demands of leather put the wild animals in a dangerous place and the harms caused by poaching for species conservation is unthinkable. Therefore, we aimed to integrate bacterial cellulose and protein crosslinking to manufacture artificial leather for animal conservation. Specifically, we utilized G. xylinus to synthesize bacterial cellulose. Moreover, we engineered E. coli and P.

Acephate exposure causes severe environmental and human side effects as well as paralysis or death. In this study, we enriched samples of acephate-treated soil for 5 weeks to propagate the growth of acephate-degrading bacteria. 10g from each sample was diluted 10-fold. DNA was subsequently extracted from bacterial colonies using the genomic etNA extraction and the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Degradation was monitored with HPLC and LC-MS. Certain genes, such as OPD, were isolated and analyzed using bioinformatics tools including CDD. Amplified genes were inserted into base plasmid pMMB206 using restriction digest protocol into E. coli K12. BetI, a transcription factor-based kill-switch, was added to the plasmid.

Concentrations of cocaine as low as 30 ng/L have been shown by studies to have detrimental impacts upon their migration and breeding patterns. In addition to this, high drug concentrations have even been detected in drinking water in countries such as Brazil due to lack of effective filtration systems. We aim to solve this problem by using genetically modified E. coli bacteria immobilised in the primary sedimentation tanks of the sewers. We also designed a novel, hypoxia induced toxin-antitoxin kill switch which will destroy our bacteria in the presence of standard anaerobic processes in wastewater treatment plants and hence prevent our bacteria from spreading into the wider ecosystem.'",['High School']

It affects many pregnancies globally, and although most women survive preeclampsia, untreated it can lead to severe complications, and even death. Despite extensive research, there is, unfortunately, no reliable treatment for preeclampsia. The goal of this project is to produce an effective theoretical siRNA treatment, PreeclampsiRNA, using recombinant lentiviral vectors to carry and deliver shRNA to the trophoblast to inhibit the translation of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt1-14), an antiangiogenic pseudo-receptor that captures placental growth factor (PlGF) and prevents it from binding the proper receptor, which would signal for angiogenesis. We would test several different shRNA sequences to see which causes the most effective reduction of sFlt1-14. By degrading the mRNA of sFlt1-14 using siRNA, we aim to reduce the placental levels of this molecule (which is overproduced in preeclamptic patients, leading to hypertension) and thus alleviate symptoms.'",['High School']
1917,"b'T2DM is characterized by relative insulin deficiency caused by -cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Hepatic glucose metabolism is modulated by glucocorticoid, and the effect of glucocorticoid is usually mediated by glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Increasing of glucocorticoids has the side effect of aggravating blood glucose level, and the GR antagonists have been reported to improve blood glucose level. Therefore, it is important to establish a platform for screening GR antagonists. In our study, GR transactivation assay is established to verify the antagonistic effect of drugs on GR. Dexamethasone (Dex) as a GR agonist activates reporter gene expression efficiently, and mifepristone as a GR antagonist antagonizes Dex-induced reporter gene stimulation.

Replacing antibodies with aptamers - a type of oligonucleotide - in LFIAs (Lateral Flow ImmunoAssay), several drawbacks that antibodies present (low heat stability, heavy reliance on immunogenicity of target molecules, etc.) are eliminated. Simultaneously, we developed a sandwich assay involving both aptamers and antibodies, combining the benefits of using either ligand. scFvs (Single-Chained antibody Fragments) have simpler structures and can be made through regular protein synthesis procedures, while conventional processes involve the mammalian immune system. Applying ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) to our design, we immobilize purified scFv onto the ALFA pad, then coat our samples - amanitin - onto the scFvs. BSA-conjugated aptamers are then coated to the amanitin.

By designing a gRNA homologous to the target gene of interest, one can achieve targeted knockdown of the specific gene of interest. However, with current methodologies, one has to screen multiple gRNA sequences for efficient targeting while minimizing off-target effects. We present a prediction model for identifying the best gRNA sequence for efficient gene targeting in human cells. Starting with experimental data from knocking down specific genes using several gRNAs in iPS cells, we leverage machine learning to inform better selection of the gRNA. Our tool will be invaluable for designing gene targeting gRNAs and will reveal underlying biochemical principles governing CRISPR efficiency.'",['High School']

We mutate argA into argAfbr and knockout argR to enhance the conversion of ammonia into arginine, create several mutants of cysE gene to promote the conversion of hydrogen sulfide into cysteine, and construct a three-plasmids-system to produce myrcene. The result shows we significantly improved e.coli's ammonia production and cysteine synthesis; myrcene was produced successfully in relatively low production. For human practices, we did a series of activities (survey, expert visits, collaboration, exhibitions, lectures, etc) to improve our product design and promote the education of synthetics biology.""",['High School']

Liposomes with surface PEG GE11 modifications carrying MPC vectors will target NSCLC cells. Post transfection, targeted tumor cells will express MPCs, which enable the binding of iron. Iron-loaded MPCs will then respond to localized alternating magnetic fields and induce cell death. The active targeting ligand, tumor-specific promoter, and localized alternating magnetic fields provide triple targeting security.

1947,"b'High-density metals like lead and mercury, also known as heavy metals, have severely harmed the environment and our bodies. Every year heavy metal exposure results in millions of disabilities worldwide. Surprisedly, previous detecting methods for this urgent issue either require bulky instruments or professional technicians. Thus, it is imminent for us to devise a cheap, portable, accessible, accurate detection kit. We use DNAzyme, which can cleave ssDNA when combined with Zn2+, Mn2+, Pb2+. Cu2+. To maximize outputs, four amplification systems (HTDC, Toehold Switch, TO-DNA, and CRISPR-Cas12a) are also used. While we test these theories in lab, our human practice team interviews experts and discovers such a kit is not only needed for water detection but also for soil, which becomes the new focus of our project. We have achieved fluorescence and lateral flow detection of heavy metal ions which contribute to alleviating this severe environmental issue worldwide.'",['High School']
1948,"b'Current flame retardant materials are known to be hazardous to human body and our environment. To solve this problem, we here developed Eco-friendly and harmless flame retardant E. coli. While previous iGEM teams and research groups attempted to produce flame retardant proteins, the proteins they produced cannot retain on the surfaces of objects and can be washed away easily, precluding the application of these proteins. To address the problem, we engineered E. coli to produce flame retardant proteins (SR or casein) fused with surface adhering proteins (cellulose binding domain or mussel adhesive proteins). Thereby, we improved previous iGEM flame retardant systems, which contain only flame retardant proteins. We here proved the protein expression, fire retardancy and sustainability of our flame retardant systems, matching our previous modelling results. Additionally, we also engineered an easy-to-make vertical burning test, helping us and future iGEM teams to test flame retardants.'",['High School']
1949,"b'Traditionally, measuring the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 requires a live virus which creates serious biosafety concerns. We wanted to create a safe alternative, utilizing a general assay system, to identify the infectivity of different current and future strains of SARS-CoV-2, as it is critical for assessing outbreak control and immunity of potential vaccines. Infectivity of different strains can be measured by the binding affinity between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Spike protein (S protein) and its human ACE2 receptor, which is how the virus gains entry into human cells. Various genetic mutations in the S protein affect the RBD-ACE2 interaction, therefore contributing to different infectivities. We engineered a pseudovirus to recap this crucial interaction by expressing S proteins corresponding to the original and the predominant G614D SARS-CoV-2 strains and used a luciferase assay to quantitatively measure infectivity.'",['High School']
1950,"b'Various engineered bacteria showed useful functions. However, the storage of these bacteria usually requires -80 refrigerators, which substantially limited their transportation and usages in daily life. Therefore, we decided to utilize TDPs from tardigrades (water bears) to supply a new storage method. By introducing the TDPs as the protectants into bacteria during lyophilization (freeze-drying), we could produce dry powder that can be stored at room temperature without any equipment. The powder can be stored at room temperature for a long time, without any usage of professional equipment. This year, we confirmed that certain TDPs have the ability to maintain the survival rate of E. coli. We also optimized the method by regulating the expression level and combining different TDPs. In addition, we proved the modularity and studied the degradation of TDPs after freeze-drying. We hope the method would promote the practical application of engineered bacteria.'",['High School']

It has been accepted that serotonin deficiency is the major cause of depression and medications are made to improve this situation. Yet patients often feel pressure and refuse to take antidepressants due to social stigmas. Our project, Tea-HEE, focused on a novel way to prevent this problem. We engineered E. coli Nissle 1917 (an FDA approved probiotic) to be placed in patients intestine. It can be activated by PCA, a tea metabolite derived from tea intake, and to produce 5-HTP, the precursor of serotonin naturally present in intestines that has multiple advantages for serotonin synthesis. Therefore by ingesting tea, a common beverage, patients can get an ample supply of 5-HTP in their intestine and hence an ample supply of serotonin in their brain to fight depression toward a better quality of life without pressure.'",['High School']

However, arsenate accumulation poses a severe threat to the rice-consuming population, who are generally unaware of the threat and unable to deal with it. We decided to lower the arsenate accumulation of rice by identifying and modifying the genetic sequence related to the arsenate level. Specially, we adopted both the conventional method and the bioinformatic method to identify the related genetic sequence. By doing so, we intended to promote the fusion of bioinformatics and bioengineering. The assumption is that Ospt4 is responsible for the arsenate accumulation of many crop species, including rice. We planned to knock out the genetic sequence and perform contrast experiments to examine whether Ospt4 is related to arsenate accumulation.'",['High School']

Our main idea is to build a Histamine Sensor in bacteria or cell-free systems which can emit a fragrance when histamine level rises on the skin and nasal mucosa and also release rDAO, a histamine oxidase, to alleviate symptoms. This system is not limited as a drug to prevent allergies, but available for other applications such as clinical testing and detection of allergens in food. We hope that people susceptible to allergy can be greatly benefited from our product in the future.""",['High School']
1954,"b'Atrazine is a contaminant for natural resources, which is dangerous for both people and wildlife. To be specific, atrazine can lead to serious diseases like prostatic cancer and breast cancer. However, owing mainly to the superior efficacy and economy of atrazine, the current policy in most countries is to strengthen registration instead of explicitly restrict the use of it. Furthermore, all the atrazine detection equipment in the market today have major flaws - expensiveness, heaviness, and difficulties in application. Thus, atrazine will leak into farms, lakes, and ocean without an effective and economical solution.

About 70 kinds of chemical substances are widely used in fungicides, preservatives, insecticides, pesticides, food additives, plastic products, and so forth. In addition, harmful substances are also detected from rivers to the ocean in the world. Over 30 types of endocrine hormones were detected from the seeping water at the industrial waste disposal site. Since estrogen in the environment causes severe endocrine disorders, threatening the health of the fetus and children (obesity caused by cancer and metabolic disorders is also thought to be linked), we aim to create an estrogen sensor, namely ER Sensor, to detect the estrogen in the environment around us.'",['High School']

Complicated technologies have already been invented to test the purity of water, however, those procedures always cause huge amount of money and energy. We found that a certain gene activity in E.coli will be inhibited with the presence of phosphorus. As a result, combing with a fluorescent protein, the gene will show its reaction when encountering certain concentration of phosphorus. Using this strategy we will be able to conduct pre-test of water pollution before investing much money and energy on processing unpolluted water. And through editing the gene, we will be able to detect water sources' phosphorus concentration that will harm human health by an easy and inexpensive method. We expect our experiment to become the starting point of detecting water pollution through biological method.""",['High School']

We wanted to help relive patients with galactosemia, one of the saccharine diseases with the highest prevalence rate and detrimental influence. Our team came up with an innovative idea which is to engineer a probiotic with the function to decompose galactose into butyric acid, a useful short chain fatty acid. We engineered three different plasmids, each with its own capabilities that is essential for galactose breakdown. Using a competent E.Coli Nissle 1917cell, we transfer the plasmids into the cell, creating our final product. Eventually, the probiotics was successfully engineered in the laboratory.

Despite increasing attention to natural dyes, its production is limited and products are expensive. We propose using engineered bacteria to mass-produce natural, harmless hair dyes. We successfully synthesized melanin, indigo, dopaxanthin, and indoline-betacyanin and dyed hair into black, blue, and red. We used Vibrio natriegens to increase the rate of production. V. natriegens could produce melanin faster than E. coli. Furthermore, considering that synthetic dyes are composed of oxidants and pigment precursors, we envisage combining oxidases and pigment precursors to dye hair. We have expressed bacterial laccase and tested its activity. Next, we will try to optimize dyeing protocols and discuss the safety aspects of potential products. If successful, our products could bring dramatic changes to the market and introduce substantial social benefits.'",['High School']

We aim to engineer probiotics that can be consumed by patient, express the target gene into enzymes to degrade p-cresol, the precursor of pCS. Since p-cresol is produced from phenylalanine and tyrosine in diet, we created tyrosine inducer gene, which controls the expression of polyphenol oxidase (PPO)  enzyme that can degrade p-cresol. This system was tested with the Green Fluorescent Protein gene on the p15A linear plasmid. We extracted the pchC  pchF  pchA operon gene segment from Pseudomonas citronellolis and connected onto the p15A linear plasmid skeleton to assist PPO with degrading p-cresol under oxygen-deficient environment (intestine).

1960,"b'Locust plague is a harmful disaster, because gigantic locust swarms can eat crops and cause food crisis. However, the existing prevention measures are expensive and not environmentally friendly. Locust plague is mainly caused by the colonizing locusts, while the scattered locusts need to be initiated by serotonin and guaiacol to form colonized locusts. Therefore, we proposed a design to allow E. coli to express four enzymes to degrade serotonin and guaiacol in the intestines of the locusts. To enhance the degradation efficiency, we introduced a self-lysis system in E. coli to allow the enzymes release to the intestinal lumen of locust, which helps ultimately disturb the swarming behavior of locust and avoid the occurrence of locust plagues. For biosafety, we have also introduced a heat-induced suicide switch, which allows E. coli to commit suicide in response to the summer heat when the plagues are reduced.'",['High School']

Unfortunately, as we learned from browsing related articles, field research, and surveys, modern detection methods are all very costly and time-consuming. So, we aim to create a biological kit, made out of crRNA, Cas12a, ssDNA, that allows for efficient detection of L. monocytogenes. crRNA and Cas12a will form a complex, and when crRNA binds to the oligo sequences that model the DNA of L. monocytogenes, it will activate the Cas12a protein, thus causing Cas12a to cut the surrounding ssDNA which produces visible fluorescence. Ultimately, our kit is able to produce a fluorescence after 10 minutes of exposure to oligo sequences.'",['High School']

Light-inducible bacteria, along with devices that carry LED, are first implanted into patients intestine. A bracelet will detect tremors when it occurs and sends signals to doctors, who would administrate L-dopa and send the signal back into the device that is implanted in the intestine.

We designed a rapidly deployable locust attraction scheme, the core of which is to synthesis specific locust aggregation pheromone 4-Vinylanisole to attract locusts and prepare for further rapid and effective eradication in the attraction area. Furthermore, an engineered bacteria which can degrade phenylacetonitrile was successfully created, avoiding its interference to the trapping effect. Through synthesis of 4-Vinylanisole and degradation of Phenylacetonitrile, locusts are attracted together and the site-specific control of locust swarms is realized.

Taking into account the disability to degrade the raw starch of Y. lipolytica, we separately express heterologous alphaamylase and glucoamylase enzymes in it. The results showed that the strains expressing glucoamylase were able to grow on starch as the sole carbon source.

A growing number of studies highlights the role of miR-155 in breast cancer drug and radio resistance development. Moreover, studies indicated that lncRNAs could act as sponges to compete miRNAs, participating in various biological processes.

For example, bladder cancer has a recurrence of up to 24%-84% of patients within 5 years after surgical resection, and the overexpression of C-MYC protein is approximately related to 44%-69% of the cases. We investigated the urinary tract pathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) Lon protein and find it can effectively degrade C-MYC protein, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells.

1989,"b'Oxybenzone is a chemical compound found in sunscreens that serves as an active ingredient to block ultraviolet (UV) rays. Oxybenzone contributes to coral bleaching by accumulating in coral tissues and reducing sunlight availability for photosynthetic organisms due to its UV-absorbing properties. Through the genetic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, oxybenzone concentration levels in water bodies can be detected. The estrogenic properties of oxybenzone allow it to bind to a synthetic fusion protein containing a human estrogen receptor which will result in the expression of the LacZ gene. This causes the enzyme beta-galactosidase to be produced and breakdown its substrate. This produces an electrochemical signal which can be measured using the Field-Ready Electrochemical Detector (FRED) and analyzed to determine oxybenzone concentration. This will allow for greater understanding of the issue of coral bleaching, and provide a tool to assess the impact of further steps being taken to protect these aquatic ecosystems.'",['High School']

2002,"b'Lactams are family of cyclic amides widely used in the synthesis materials including nylon and piperidines used in drugs. Traditionally, lactams are synthesized through energy-intensive petrochemical methods. Here, we describe a method using Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 as a chassis for the production of -valerolactam. A feedback insensitive aspartate kinase (AK) is used to achieve overproduction of lysine. Lysine is then oxidized to -amino-valeramide by L-Lysine monooxygenase (DavB), which is further hydrolyzed to -aminovalerate (5-AVA) by 5-aminovaleramide amidohydrolase (DavA). The resulting 5-AVA is cyclized to form -valerolactam. A shuttle vector with the feedback insensitive AK, davB and davA is integrated to S.elongatus UTEX 2973 through the INTEGRATE system, a previously described CRISPR-transposon system.

This year, by constructing an integrated protein evolution machine, we made it automatic and efficient. A broad diversification was accomplished by a DNA mutagenesis module in the host bacteria, which enabled prototype protein sequence, carried by the budding-deficient M13 bacteriophage, to generate a library of candidate proteins. Subsequently, bacterial-two-hybrid system was used to give selection pressure on these candidates. Only the favorable candidate proteins can activate compensating gene transcription and rescue phage budding, thus enriching favorable protein sequence in the phage population. Moreover, an RNA thermometer, on the compensating gene mRNA, was applied in the phage amplification process to make it more controllable. Finally, by integrating all the diversification, selection and amplification process, our integrated directed evolution machine can make it an automatic and controllable process for high-affinity protein selection.'",['New Application']
2072,"b'A fundamental problem in utilizing genetically modified bacteria is their limited ability to survive under non-natural conditions, such as the harsh conditions in industrial reactors and the immune system in the human body. We report a Plug-and-Play system allowing the introduction of chemical anchors on cell membranes, subsequently used to attach a functional coating. The anchors consist of azidophenylalanine, which couples covalently with molecules containing the strained alkyne DBCO in a so-called ""click"" reaction. We obtained proof of concept that our developed Clickable Outer Membrane Proteins (COMP) enable this fast and effective click reaction. We apply it to create a safe clicked-on coating allowing E.coli to be used in the human body for healthcare purposes. Furthermore, microfluidic devices have been designed, ensuring increased control over the click reaction and single cell coating. We believe our Plug-and-Play system is a versatile tool providing numerous possibilities for engineering bacteria on outer membranes.'",['New Application']
2073,"b'The war on microbial pathogens is a complex issue, and will continue to be in the foreseeable future. Antibiotics target microbes once they have invaded their host, but this practice cannot continue forever due to bacterias ability to become resistant to the drugs administered. Here, we describe a novel use of recombinant biotechnology to generate Escherichia coli capable of both sensing and reporting the presence of pathogenic bacteria, by taking advantage of a pre-existing contact-dependent inhibition system. Coupling this contact-dependent system to gene control allows us to create a reporter bacterium that will glow on contact with pathogenic bacteria, exposing potential pathogens before they have a chance to infect their host. Dealing with post-infection situations will always be a necessity, but early detection and prevention will certainly lighten the load on an already strained scientific and medical community.'",['New Application']
2074,"b'When beginning research in synthetic biology, the go-to organism is the bacterium E. coli. Our research demonstrates the utility of a methanogenic archaeon, Methanococcus maripaludis, as an alternative platform. Our two primary focuses in this study are: 1) improving the genetic tools for synthetic biology available in archaea and 2) demonstrating the utility of archaea in synthetic biology through production of geraniol. Previously, a synthesized gene encoding geraniol synthase was expressed in M. maripaludis, and geraniol production was quantified as 0.2% of lipid dry weight using GC/MS. In order to optimize geraniol production, we are experimenting a combination of chemical, biological and computational approaches that include: an improved geraniol extraction procedure resulting in better recovery, a fluorescent protein monitor for protein expression and regulation, a synthetic ribosome-binding-site library enabling variable levels of expression, and a metabolic model of the lipid biosynthesis pathway subjected to flux balance analysis.'",['New Application']
2075,"b'We are aiming to build a system for organizing E. coli in a predetermined way, a MicrOrganizer. We are trying to create biobricks that gives E. coli surface identity, and at the same time binds one E. coli bacterium physically to another E. coli bacterium. This binding will also transfer a signal to the inside of the bacteria and induce gene expression. We want to do this by using the split enzyme principle of the LacZ gene. This gene codes for -galactosidase which can be split into two parts: -galactosidase  and -galactosidase . The functional enzyme consisting of one alpha and one beta part hydrolyses lactose into galactose and glucose. This process produces on some occasions allolactose which can be transported back into the bacteria and induces the Lac-operon, and thus gene expression. To express each enzyme part on the bacterial surface we will couple them to autotransporter proteins.'",['New Application']
2076,"b'The latest spread of emerging infectious diseases like Ebola have shown the need of a fast detection method to monitor outbreaks and take further actions. Here are biosensors an attractive tool to take the job. Cecilie, Henrik, Morten and Owik are competing for the University of Copenhagen in the iGEM competition 2014. With our idea of using an antibody-fluorophore agent as a biosensor we are able to combine the high affinity of an antibody with the simple detection method of a fluorophore. With this unique setup we are able to simplify the detection as well as reduce costs and time. Our project EASY is exploring the opportunity of new detection methods for various antigens as hormones or virus proteins.

2077,"b'In this project, our aim is to design and construct a colorful bio-imaging system----Once you project a picture on engineered C.cresentus, they present the same image accurately, and its even flourescent! We took advantage of the nature of Caulobacter crescents (C.crescents), which is the ability to attach to a diverse range of surface by developing holdfast, to design circuits in C.crescentus in which light of different wavelength and intensity could trigger expression of corresponding florescent proteins as well as the enhancement of holdfast. So that C.crescentus can locate themselves correctly and present image colorfully. We also found that allosteric RNA operating as riboswitch is a promising alternative to proteins for synthetic chemical circuits due to its many distinct advantages such as rapid response and specificity. So we designed logic gates base on RNA switches to replace previous passway to create a faster C.imager.'",['New Application']
2078,"b'Traditionally pathogens have been annihilated using pharmaceuticals, but today nanotechnology offers a new possibility with the use of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). We present a novel device that could make these processes possible: the BioNEMS Drill. This is a magnetic portion of chromatin. To construct the device we synthesized hydrophilic magnetite. We used it due to its bio-compatibility for medical applications and later functionalized them with amino groups, which can establish a peptide bond between nanoparticles and a protein. We used the HU histone-like protein, capable of coiling DNA around the nanoparticles. To get enough protein, we modified E. Coli to overexpress it. Since the core of the device is magnetic it can be controlled by applying an external magnetic field. Furthermore, the versatility of the DNA to be coated with various materials and its functionalization can selectively remove certain chemicals inside the human body such as cholesterol or toxic agents.'",['New Application']
2079,"b'Recently, interest has been growing in waste recovery of chemical elements due to depletion of some ores, especially lanthanide ones. Our goal therefore involved designing a bacterial system capable of detecting and binding lanthanides. We then proposed a method to extract these ions, hence making the recycling of these valuable metals (e.g. from wastewater) effective. Basing on Salmonella iron-binding system we modified lanthanide binding tags to adjust them to different ionic size. We also used a superfolder GFP to measure the concentration of collected ions. When an ion binds to LBT, a signalling pathway is activated, inducing fluorescence. Our project introduces an eco-friendly retrieval technology for industrially significant elements. We hope that extracted metals will be viable for applications in electronics, including medical devices. To propose possible applications in medicine we prepared a report about some fascinating challenges in that field, thus creating the model of Future Lantan Hospital.'",['New Application']
2080,"b'Intracellular bacterial symbionts are useful allies for a wide range of eukaryotes. Endosynbio aims to lay the groundwork to recreate this powerful relationship for therapeutic use. Endosymbionts endowed with the ability to enter, survive, and replicate stably within the mammalian cytoplasm could provide hosts with in vivo protein production. This technology would have the potential to treat monogenic disorders - in lieu of genome-level modifications - as well as a broad range of peptide-related conditions. This year, we optimised entry of three bacterial species (E. coli, Synechocystis PCC6803 and Lactococcus lactis) into mammalian cells and assayed them for intrinsic compatibility to the cytosolic environment. In the future, endosymbionts will be used as synthetic organelles, enabling a whole new field of synthetic biology - endosynbiology.'",['New Application']
2081,"b'Precise artificial pH control is a worldwide concern because fluctuation of pH can tremendously influence the cells performance. So BIT-CHINA designed an intelligent pH-Controller inside the cell. Our pH-Controller contains two sub-systems. One is resistance system, and the other is fine-regulation system. Resistance system can make bacteria survive in an expanded range of pH. Fine-regulation system is used to adjust the environmental pH by synthesis of acid or alkali. Several kinds of recombinase were applied in this sub-system to achieve various regulation effectiveness. The two sub-systems working together allows for lowered artificial pH regulation costs in industrial fermentation, meanwhile the two systems also can regulate the pH of soil, because the hosts with our pH-Controller will maintain high efficiency when the environmental pH is not optimal and they can adjust the environmental pH as we expect. Combined with the projects we did before, our project can achieve more functions.'",['New Application']
2082,"b'Biologically based manufacturing can produce numerous types of complex products. One of the biggest problems is the robustness of the system. Great progress has been made with industrial production techniques, but contaminations are still a considerable problem the industry faces. Insufficient control of contaminations in bioreactors could compromise entire batches, resulting in high expenses. Team Chalmers Gothenburg will solve the contamination problem once and for all using a novel strategy to detect and combat contaminations in yeast based bioreactors. The solution involves two genetic systems, one signaling and contamination detection system and one repair system for survival after contamination termination. These two systems are made from innovative uses of ESDSA repair, CRISPR technology and MAPK cascades. The two systems also set the foundation for a whole range of new applications, from DNA assembly to laboratory markers. More will be revealed in this study in scarlet.'",['New Application']
2083,"b""In our project, we practice the technology of optogenetic on C.elegans and use the light source assembled by ourselves to construct a movement controlling system and bulid an amusement park of C.elegans. We design parts to express channalrhodopsin in specific C.elegans' neurons with the help of special promoters and cre-loxp system. We not only use the traditional channalrhodopsin,chR2, but some novel ones which have never been tested in C.elegans such as Blink. Then we use computer controlling our DIY light source to regulate channelrhodopsins activity and control the behaviours of C.elegans such as moving forwards or twisting effectively. We also express GFP,YFP, mcherry in E.coli. By combining the colorful microorgasims and C.elegans, we construct some interesting scenes to form a C.elegans' fancy world. This technology will help in researches on neuron's function and interaction. It may also be used in mechanical controlling system and the theraphy of movement defect.""",['New Application']
2084,"b'Forensic science is key partner in the modern world of law and civil liberties. The field now requires new trustworthy, quantitative technologies that complement DNA-based evidence in court. Our project will tackle this urgent need by employing synthetic biology approaches to build The Synthetic Forensic Toolkit. Our discussions with law makers, law enforcers, and forensic scientists inspired three specific areas. First, the ability to pinpoint exactly when a fingerprint was made would have serious implications for delivering justice. We have designed a synthetic enzyme-based system to tackle this. Second, detection of different types of bodily fluids at a crime scene, while leaving DNA uncontaminated, would be of benefit. We therefore designed a cell-free synthetic spray to highlight traces of blood, semen, saliva, and nasal mucus on surfaces. Finally, the quantification of traces of stainless steel on bone. For this, a chromate sensor form a previous iGEM project has been adapted.'",['New Application']
2085,"b'Toehold switches are a novel type of RNA riboregulator that binds a specific trigger RNA sequence. Binding causes conformational changes, revealing an RBS and allowing the expression of a reporter. We aim to design a toehold collection with varying reporters including chromoproteins, fluorescent proteins and bioluminescent luciferase. Our project therefore set out to create a diagnostic test to detect a given RNA sequence in a safe, low-tech and cost-effective manner. The trigger-recognition region of the toehold can be altered to bind different specific RNA targets, changing the application. Our project is tailored towards detection of RNA from Mycobacterium Bovis. A problem prevalent in the southwest UK, it is the cause of bovine TB with current testing unable to distinguish between Mycobacterium strains. Expression of our toeholds will utilise S30 cell-free kits and reporter data will be collected using FACS/TECAN. This data will be used for simulation and model fitting.'",['New Application']
2086,"b'In last year, we succeeded in designing the sequence which synthesizes circular mRNA and long chain protein in Escherichia coli. In this year, we had 2 purposes in our study. One was an efficiency of the circularization. The efficiency was lower in our previous study. This was why the splicing was hard to happen because two sequences to act as ribozyme for splicing were far each other. So we incorporated complementary sequences around the ribozyme regions. We thought that the treatment brought two regions close and the efficiency of the circularization improved. The other was to synthesize useful proteins. In our previous study, synthesized long-chain proteins lose their function because the folding of the proteins was broken. So we incorporated linker sequences into circular mRNA to synthesize the functional long-chain protein.'",['New Application']
2087,"b'Our project is centered on using bioluminescence as a light source in Escherichia coli. After brainstorming with a designer, we decided to make toy nightlights for children. We believe this would be a good way to get the public talking about synthetic biology, and to ignite a passionate interest for science and synthetic biology in children. To make the nightlight more interactive, we decided that the children should care for the monster-styled toy during the day, so it will glow at night, protecting them from any bedtime monsters. To turn off the Aliivibrio fischeri bioluminescence lux operon during the day, we are using a UVA light sensor system from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, and an inverter based on TetR family repressors from Pseudomonas. We are refactoring the lux operon for optimal performance using BioBrick assembly and a ribosome binding site library for each gene in the operon.'",['New Application']
2088,"b' Many industrial and biological processes require a range of different enzymes. Our aim is to provide a powerful tool to combine these enzymatic processes. The Flexosome is a multi-enzymatic complex, which ensures higher efficiency and yield from enzymatic reactions. Our construct takes multiple dockerins from a variety of bacteria and connects exchangeable enzymes to a scaffoldin base through automatic assembly. The combination of the catalytic forces of enzymes, derived from different sources, onto one common molecular base creates a synergistic effect. This drives a cascade in which the product of one reaction acts as the substrate for the consecutive one. In the future the Flexosome could, for instance, be used to combine enzymes in washing detergents or even link enzymatic cascades for the production of biofuels. It can therefore be applied from industrial over pharmaceutical to environmental setups.'",['New Application']
2089,"b'Light-based bacterial protein expression systems have been well documented. Tabor et al. demonstrated a multichromatic protein expression system in E. coli through the combination of the CcaR-CcaS green-light sensitive construct derived from cyanobacteria and a previously characterized red-light sensitive system. This could be leveraged for the expression of multiple genes by exposing the bacteria to different wavelengths of light, i.e. red and green. We propose the application of this construct to recombinant protein expression. Using genetic cloning and recombinant protein techniques, E. coli is concurrently transformed with three plasmids: a chromophore, a red-light sensitive system, and a green-light sensitive system. Protein expression is induced through shining red light on the bacterial population. Following this, cell lysis is triggered by shining green light, which is mediated by a T4 Holin/Endolysin system. This releases the protein of interest into the cell media, allowing for straightforward collection and purification. This system would have important applications in both research and industry, allowing for the optimization and potential automation of heterologous bacterial protein production.'",['New Application']
2090,"b'Magnetosome, an organelle encapsulating magnetic iron crystal (magnetite), originates from magnetotactic bacteria. However, with the difficulty to maintain micro-aerobic condition under normal setting for optimal growth, we aim to produce magnetosome in a rapidly grown aerobe, Azotobacter vinelandii, which provides an intracellular anaerobic environment. Not limited in migrating biogenesis machinery to foreign organism, we also developed TWO new downstream applications: (1) Fusing recognition elements with transmembrane protein tightly bound on magnetite. Example includes metal-binding peptides for removing heavy metals from polluted water by biomagnets. (2) Controlling Azotobacter by external magnetic force as a component in microbial fuel cell (MFC). We designed a self-sufficient system by producing hydrogen with mutated nitrogenase, while releasing electron to anode and recycling protons for ATP production by membrane-bound hydrogenase. We expect an electricity production at 30 mA in 0.83 m2 electrode surface area, a 2-fold increase compared to a stainless-steel-mesh bio-cathode MFC.'",['New Application']
2091,"b'While the future of synthetic biology hinges upon overcoming biosafety concerns, the accidental escape of synthetic organisms due to unpredictable behaviours can pose a major threat to our environment. Hence, a tightly regulated switch is needed to induce suicide by the leaked organisms, ultimately leading to destruction of undesired genetic material. In our project we design and engineer two biological circuits based on the versatile CRISPR Cas systems as replaceable killing switches. To minimize basal expression, arabinose and tryptophan help repress the expression of Cas associated proteins, gRNA and crRNA. In order to achieve biosafety, destruction of essential genes will be activated when the synthetic organisms leave their specified working environment. We sought to investigate the regulation of the circuits and compare the killing efficiency of the two Cas systems using E. Coli BL21 DE3 as the chassis.'",['New Application']
2092,"b'Our project aims to produce self-assembling conductive nano-wires using a functional amyloid system synthesised by E.coli. We use the export machinery of the endogenous curli amyloid system of E.coli, normally responsible for biofilm formation, to produce functional extracellular amyloid nano-fibrils composed of the amyloid-forming domain of the yeast prion protein Sup35. Our engineered BioBrick plasmid will contain the amyloid-forming domain of Sup35, Sup35NM, linked to the curli signal sequence for extracellular amyloid protein export, and also to cytochrome b562 to allow for electron transport. Once exported, the Sup35NM monomers will polymerise to form the amyloid fibrils decorated with cytochrome b562. Exogenous addition of haem will allow cytochrome b562 on Sup35NM fibrils to fold into its active conformation, allowing electron transport along the length of the amyloid fibres. Our project has the potential to provide a source of both renewable nano-material and energy.'",['New Application']
2093,"b'Pattern formation is omnipresent in nature, nevertheless the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Attempting to explain this phenomenon, a genetic circuit that couples cell motility and chemotaxis in Escherichia coli was built. The transmembrane receptor dependent chemotactic signaling pathways in E. coli are well described. But so far, most of the pattern formation research focused on the Tar receptor together with its attractant aspartate. Here however, the attention goes to the function of another chemoreceptor, the Tsr receptor and its corresponding repellent - leucine. This novel approach, in combination with the controlled expression of the motility regulating protein CheZ, enables precise steering of the swimming behavior. All together, this system allows the formation of periodic circles and stripes of high-low cell densities. Based on theoretical analysis, the formation of spatial structures arising from the aggregation process of cells A and intermediate stripes of cells B is expected.'",['New Application']
2094,"b'Peanut allergy is the deadliest food allergy. We aim to help those suffering from peanut allergy by designing a portable and intuitive detector available to anyone. The detection system utilizes a protein complex which recognizes the peanut allergen Arah1. It is composed of our own constructed protein attached to an Arah1 specific antibody conjugated to FITC. The constructed protein consists of epitope 2 from Arah1 and RFP. Arah1 has higher affinity than epitope 2 towards the binding site. Therefore, the constructed protein will be replaced and leave the antibody, if Arah1 has contaminated the food sample. We can measure if the constructed protein is attached by using FRET, a mechanism utilized to determine if two different fluorofores are at a close distance, in our case FITC and RFP. The different wavelengths emitted is measured and processed by electrical components. We also have a side project, replacing RFP with a quencer.'",['New Application']
2095,"b'In the past year, paper-based transcription and translation, reconstituted from freeze-drying, have been adapted in a variety of ways and shown to be effective after a year of storage at room temperature. However, currently, this technology is severely limited in its applications because protein detection requires a different strategy for each individual protein. Aptapaper uses the targeting specificity of aptamers to create a modular protein detection system that can easily be adapted to any protein. A DNA aptamer is bound to a DNA trigger and becomes unbound in response to its protein of specificity. This frees the DNA trigger to turn on an RNA toehold switch, resulting in a 40 fold change in reporter protein expression, with more results to come. This system, when freeze-dried on paper, is cheap and portable, making it well suited to tackle the unmet needs for disease detection in remote areas.'",['New Application']
2096,"b'SDS-PAGE is a very popular technique used to separate proteins based on their size. Embedded proteins, invisible to the naked eye, are then visualized by staining. Among the various staining techniques, silver staining is easy to perform and highly sensitive. However, the outcome is a series of monochromatic protein bands. Previously, we observed that some proteins inherently produce different hues post-staining. We hypothesized that specific amino acid configurations yield coloured bands after reacting with silver staining reagents. To test our hypothesis, we created numerous amino acid motifs to elucidate the sequences that would generate specific colours following silver staining. Our findings will let us generate a molecular weight marker with the innate capacity of providing users colour-coded bands post-staining without the use of impregnating dyes.

Based on the cellulosome structure, we propose a method: cellulose as immobilization substrate, CBM(cellulose-binding module)as fixed labels, using three pairs of specific cohesion-dockerins to build scaffolding protein structure in order to improve the amount of enzyme immobilization, increase the catalytic efficiency of the immobilized enzyme and reduce the cost of purification enzyme. The project is not only a new attempt of immobilized enzyme technology, but also for building multi-immobilized enzyme complex to explore new avenues.'",['New Application']
2098,"b' The most cellular memories are limited to protein levels currently, which are transient, instantaneous and unapparent. To overcome these shortcuts, we design a system to achieve the storage of information by a transient stimulation but use a long-lasting response. The two processes are divided into separated bacterial strains to play as the Recorder and the Saver. The system is designed to be activated and deactivated via light- regulated fusion proteins, which then active protein synthesis to complete the process. The information storage would be accomplished by conjugation, which cannot be carried out in usual time because of the specific gene deletion. When the memory needs to be erased, the CRISPR-Cas9 system in the Saver would be activated. By design such a cellular memory technology, we make a bacterial memory storage device.

Some elytra have been measured to have a greater strength-to-weight ratio than concrete, and at sufficient density make for formidable armor.

2100,b'Transcriptional switches form an integral part of synthetic biology. In the absence of positive feedback loops these systems are unstable since they require the maintained presence of a regulator. DNA switches based on heritable genetic modifications can allow for a permanent change in gene expression even in the absence of the initial signal. The Cre-Lox recombinase system from the P1 bacteriophage has been successfully used in genetic manipulation to excise targeted DNA fragments. Our aim is to use the Cre-Lox recombinase system to trigger a heritable genetic switch that allows for irreversible ON/OFF programming as an alternative to positive feedback loops. We are testing different approaches relying on the inversion and excision of lox-flanked DNA parts. Our long term goal is to integrate this system with signals from quorum sensing and a logic gate to program conditional chemotaxis in motile E. coli.',['New Application']

Inverted components which based on recombinase system are introduced in our system. One inverted component is able to calculate a period of time, while several inverted components comprise of one time cycle. When we combine several time cycles together, a sequence with a timer's function has been successfully formed.

The system is characterized by three modules, aptamers as recognition elements, outer-membrane proteins as the scaffold and signaling components which can translate ligand binding into a measurable signal through heterodimerization. Aptamers can be clicked onto the outer membrane proteins post-translationally using SPAAC click-chemistry, making the system inherently modular.

We are addressing this problem by transplanting the circadian rhythm-generating KaiABC system from cyanobacteria into E. coli and optimizing its function by controlling protein stoichiometry and adding accessory proteins. Such a BioBrick would be important for any application in which gene expression needs to be regulated on a 24-hour schedule. For example, it is often important to release a drug at a specific time of the day. As a proof-of-concept application, we implemented this clock as a potential solution to jet lag and sleep disorders by engineering a strain of E. coli that facilitates the production of a melatonin precursor in the gut on a 24-hour cycle. Thus, our project demonstrates the application of a robust KaiABC-based clock in timed drug dosage, as well as introduces an oscillator BioBrick into the synthetic biology community.'",['New Application']
2108,"b'Alternative methods of plasmid maintenance and PCR amplification accelerate the construction of new biodesigns, reduce cost, and avoid environmental hazards. Plasmids are typically maintained in cells by encoding enzymes that hydrolyze or otherwise detoxify antibiotics added to the medium. However, this process carries an inherent risk for spreading antibiotic resistance to native bacterial populations through lateral gene transfer. The Hok-Sok toxin-antitoxin system, a natural internal maintenance cassette relying on internal mRNA silencing, presents an alternative to common antibiotic-based methods since it does not rely on exogenous drugs. We are also developing an integrated, microcontrolled thermocycler using common household components. Using nichrome wire and a motorized fan for air circulation, the programmable prototype is an inexpensive, versatile thermocycler or plate incubator.

In one system, the Auxin/IAA-Degron pathway is used in conjunction with beta-galactosidase to produce a visible signal in response to the plant hormone auxin. In the other system, aptazymes, a combination of RNA aptamers and ribozymes, are used to bind theophylline and allow fluorescent protein to be produced.

The use of AFPs as anti-biofilm factors is intriguing, however, only a single AFP has yet been shown to inhibit biofilms. We built a diverse library of AFPs and characterized both their antifreeze and biofilm-inhibiting properties in E. coli. Our results demonstrate novel biofilm-inhibiting properties for some AFPs and further characterize the freeze protection properties of many AFPs at low subzero temperatures. Our results will inform the design of novel synthetic AFPs optimized for use in E. coli, and provide a valuable new resource for the integration of AFPs into synthetic biology and biotechnology applications.'",['New Application']
2111,"b'Photocaging is a remarkable method of compound inhibition that can be reversed by exposure to light. Previously, it had been used for intracellular studies. We wish to apply this method to industrially needed proteins as well and call attention to its usefulness there. As an example we would like to render the use of high quantities of the chemical enzyme inhibitor boric acid unnecessary, which is classified as a substance of very high concern by the European Chemicals Agency. At the moment, boric acid is used for protease inhibition in washing detergents and dilution in the washing machine activates it again. Thus, tons of it are being processed every year. Photocaging could help circumvent this. A photocaged amino acid will be incorporated at a crucial position in the enzyme by genetic codon reassignment. Prior to the washing procedure the enzyme can be easily activated by exposure to a light source.'",['New Application']
2112,"b'Kombucha is a fermented tea drink composed of a community of several types of bacteria and yeast. This studys aim is to understand and manipulate this community to imbue kombucha with favorable properties for producers and consumers. One common problem producers face is ethanol overproduction by Lachancea fermentati, making the kombucha alcoholic. This study screens L. fermentati using YPD agar plates with bromothymol blue, which changes color with changes in acidity. The color change allows for low-ethanol producing colonies to be selected for and recapitulated into the microbial community. Another issue for some would-be consumers is the taste of kombucha. By codon-optimizing an Arabadopsis gene for bacteria, Gluconobacter and Gluconoacetobacter can be transformed to produce brazzein, a sweet-tasting protein, thus sweetening the kombucha. Furthermore, these chassis organisms will be transformed with a GFP gene and pH-activated promoter to create a time-lapse of the changes that kombuchas microbial community undergoes.'",['New Application']

Compared with the traditional methods like using antibiotics or auxotrophic bacteria, our project can be more intelligent and controllable. In response to the inhibitor protein which is used as the signal indicating the plasmid numbers, the killer system will be turned on or off.

A non-invasive sweat patch that provides real-time monitoring of blood ethanol levels would revolutionise how we control alcohol consumption. Our proposed prototype, AlcoPatch, is based on studies that demonstrate the correlation between sweat and blood ethanol concentrations. Our AlcoPatch utilizes Escherichia coli as a chassis to engineer two different devices which would generate visible colour changes according to sweat ethanol concentrations. The first is a cell-free mechanism that uses alcohol oxidase, derived from Pichia pastoris, to initiate redox chain reactions required for the colour conversion of indicator dyes. The second manipulates an ethanol-inducible gene-switch system, derived from Aspergillus nidulans, to regulate the expression of chromoproteins. To guide our experiments, we use an innovative ensemble modelling approach to account for the uncertainty in our parameters.

In this work, we aim to develop a light inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system in prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic cells, to precisely manipulate target gene activation upon the light induction. We fused two light-activated plant proteins, CRY2 or CIB1, to a transcriptional activator VP64 or the  catalytic domain deleted tCas9, generating CRY2-VP64 or CIB1-tCas9 chimeric constructs. In the presence of a specific gRNA guide, the tCas9 domain from CIB1-tCas9 binds to the promoter of a reporter gene. Once exposing to blue light, the CRY2 domain from CRY2-VP64 can form a protein complex with CIB1-tCas9, which in turn brings the VP64 domain to the chromatin and activates the reporter gene.

Coli biofilm to immobilize quantum dots and hydrogenase. Quantum dots transform photons into electrons, which is consumed by hydrogenase to produce hydrogen. To realize the platform, we add tags, Spy-catcher and His-tag to the CsgA subunit, and Spy-tag to hydrogenase. The Spy system creates binding between the biofilm and the enzyme, while the His-tag on the biofilm binds quantum dots. The tangled biofilm builds the proximity that the two parts need to interact.

We decide to take advantage of three characters of Sup35: assembling, thermal control and reversibility. The first circuit is based on Yeast Two-hybrid System. The aggregation of Sup35 results in the binding of AD and BD, then downstream gene GFP expresses. In the second circuit, we split sfGFP, a variant of GFP, into two fragments: sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11. sfGFP11 is linked to Sup35. sfGFP1-10 spontaneously binds to sfGFP11 to show green fluorescence, however, aggregation of Sup35 inhibits the binding, thus the fluorescence disappears.

To determine the sub-cellular localization of messenger RNA (mRNA) we fluorescently tagged a Cas13a that cannot cleave its target RNA (dCas13a). This was achieved by using four mutations, two in HEPN1 and two in the HEPN2 domains, which although ablating nuclease activity, still permitted dCAS13a to bind the target RNA sequence. In tandem we designed guide RNAs for targeting mRNA of four cytosolic proteins. Visualization of the dCAS13a was achieved by fusion with a GFP, and to enhance target detection, a nuclear localization sequence sequestered the dCas13a-GFP in the nucleus until needed in the cytosol, thus reducing background noise.

Though successful switches exist, most require specific molecular signaling mechanisms, limiting their use. We designed a temperature-controlled kill switch activated below 34C using the temperature-dependent repressor TlpA36. Bacteria are lysed by constitutively expressed holin and endolysin unless counteracted by antiholin, which is under the control of TlpA36 and therefore only expressed in a narrow temperature range.

Current HLB control methods include insecticides and antibiotics that present short-term solutions, that are not specific and may cause a negative impact in plants and the final product. The use of RNAi technology has been widely used in research of gene silencing. Team TEC CEM designed siRNAs targeting four different D. citri genes: Abnormal wing disc (Awd), Wingless (WNT), Superoxide dismutase 1 (CSD1) and Rac-like GTP-binding protein 1 (RacI) to prevent CLas infection and the spread of HLB. RNAi has been proposed as a control mechanism for D. citri, but has only been tested using long dsRNA, therefore we developed siRNAs to maximize the specificity, reducing off-targeting. To ensure effective delivery, siRNAs will be encapsulated using nanotechnology for their direct application to citrus plants.'",['New Application']

There is an increasing number of evidences indicating that gut flora can really influence our thinking, mood, behavior, and feelings. However, there exists difficulties in tracking intestinal bacteria in a living body. This year we achieve this goal by using a novel fluorescent system. Several important enteropathogens and probiotics are on our list, including facultative anaerobe and obligate anaerobe, like EHEC O157:H7, Bifidobacterium longum and so on. We construct different shuttle vectors to express this fluorescent system and successfully prove that it works well. Through the expression system, bacteria with fluorescence can be detected in a living body, making in vivo imaging come true.'",['New Application']
2151,"b'The spread of many diseases is related to mosquitoes, such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, which pose a threat to human health. And many pests also have a negative impact on agricultural production. Our project is focusing on addressing the growing number of pest-induced disasters and outbreaks by changing sexual orientation. We use Drosophila melanogaster as chassis organisms, and use the classic UAS/Gal4 system to regulate this character. Whats more, we also build models to simulate the effects. Compared to other traditional ways, this method is heritable and continuable, and causes less impact on the ecosystem. In addition, the gene will be activated in summer, when pests thrived. We hope that our project will provide a new way to solve the problems caused by pest.'",['New Application']
2152,"b'Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide. With our project, GUPPI, we hope to set the basics of a system that can encapsulate the cancerous tissue to prevent metastasis in an early stage. GUPPI utilizes Protein Protein Interactions and is inspired by the formation of membraneless organelles by multivalent interactions. A designed protein scaffold and its binding partner, both having sequential repeating units, will respond to an inducer and form a gel-like structure. We envision that later on, GUPPI can respond to extracellular conditions that will act as an inducer of the gelation to specifically target and encapsulate the desired tissue. The GUPPI system has some major advantages, such as the tunability of the proteins multivalency and the possible adaptation of interactions. Furthermore, a rule-base-model is developed to predict, verify and characterize the wet-lab experiments and act as an additional support.'",['New Application']
2153,"b'The existing methods to detect the presence of a specific RNA sequence in a sample are laborious and require both trained personnel and sophisticated lab equipment. Inevitably, these restrictions limit the development of diagnostic detection methods based on specific RNA sequences. Here, we aimed to overcome these limitations by using the CRISPR-Cas protein Cas13a. Once this recently characterized protein binds to its complementary target, it unspecifically cleaves all surrounding RNA. Utilizing this property we designed a system for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes in agricultural pathogens, aiming to combat the global rise of antibiotic resistance. We developed a procedure to extract biological samples and detect RNA sequences of interest by converting the collateral cleavage activity of Cas13a to a read-out visible to the naked eye. Through ongoing interaction with direct stakeholders, we made substantial progress towards making not only durable components but a cheap, safe and reliable detection method.'",['New Application']
2154,"b'Centromeric plasmids combine the stability of a chromosome and the flexibility of a plasmid to create the perfect tool for the biotechnical industry. Pichia pastoris, a strain of yeast often used in this field, lacks a centromeric plasmid, which limits the research that can be done with this species. The University of Chicago iGEM Team, GeneHackers, is conducting research to create a centromeric plasmid for Pichia pastoris. Such a plasmid that will be useful for a multitude of purposes, including bioengineering and industrial applications. We aim to find and incorporate the minimal sequence within the genome of Pichia pastoris that allows our modified version of the iGEM plasmid psB1C3 to behave as part of the yeasts chromosomes. The combination of DNA from both E. coli and Pichia pastoris will lead to the creation of a yeast centromeric plasmid that can act as a shuttle vector between the two organisms.'",['New Application']
2155,"b'Nowadays, exposition to harmful UV rays has led to an ever growing number of skin cancer cases, amongst other sun-related diseases. Our aim is to design a biobadge detecting excessive UV exposure and therefore warn us to seek sun protection should it become necessary. This badge would work as a capsule holding E. coli cells, changing colours as the UV intensity increases. Therefore, we investigated two approaches using photocaged tyrosine (o-nitrobenzyl tyrosine). In both cases, UV-rays will release the tyrosine and enhance a reporter signal. (1) Starting with a tyrosine auxotroph E. coli strain, a reporter RFP will be synthetized once tyrosine is liberated from its cage. (2) Using a photocaged peptide and a specific transcription factor called ComR, we also aim at UV-controlling the expression of the reporter gene. The capsule would also work as a safe and reliable containment, destroying the engineered microorganisms once the biobadge is discarded.'",['New Application']
2156,"b'Currently, the biofuel industry uses glucose as feedstock for E. coli. Methods to prevent contamination require expensive process sterilization or excess antibiotics dosage which become ineffective over time by promoting antibiotic resistance. In our project, we use a xenobiotic approach to engineer autotrophic cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, to produce the rare sugar D-tagatose in a five-step enzymatic pathway. After detecting tagatose via HPLC, we will seek to engineer a transporter for tagatose secretion, a mechanism that is currently not known. The cyanobacteria will be harnessed in conjunction with genetically engineered E. coli that can metabolize tagatose; by using a multifaceted approach, we could leverage xenobiotic technology in a unique way to create a novel production platform that uses tagatose as a nutrient source and an anti-contamination agent. Because our system utilizes photosynthetic cyanobacteria to cheaply produce the rare sugar carbon source, our co-culture system is both self-sustainable and cost-effective.'",['New Application']

2158,"b'Numerous critical issues have begun to emerge affecting digital password security. Companies are increasingly turning to physical strategies, involving biometric and digital keys, to secure client accounts. Synthetic biology offers significant unprecedented security opportunities through synthetically generated biometrics. Consequently, we have developed a randomly assorting, fluorescent bacterial key. Separate genes encoding three distinct fluorescent proteins are expressed using different promoters that are capable of inhibition by dCas9. Null and functional sgRNA DNA modules were endowed with identical sticky ends to compete with one another during ligation, generating an ON/OFF fluorescent state and variance for distinguishable keys. Each combination is modelled from lab data, illustrating discernibility. We have designed a safe, portable device for storage of E. coli, paired to a streamlined authentication procedure tailored to be immune to current hacking frameworks. This system is scalable to include any type of protein, synonymously expanding the number of combinations and improving security.'",['New Application']
2159,"b'Paratransgenesis can be defined as a set of strategies to eliminate a pathogen from vector populations through the usage of genetically modified symbionts, thus controlling vector-borne diseases. For our iGEM Project, we have focused on generating a versatile molecular toolkit for endogenous detection and elimination of mosquito-borne pathogens. We have selected Pantoea agglomerans, a ubiquitous bacterium which is enriched in the midgut microbiota of anophelines, as a novel chassis for targeting malarial parasites. Two coupled genetic circuits have been designed (i) for sensing malarial infection biomarkers in the blood ingested by mosquitoes and (ii) for subsequent production/secretion of anti-Plasmodium synthetic peptides. A third module, consisting in an endogenous bacterial killer-switch was designed to control the population dynamics of the genetically engineered symbiont. This is the first study combining the conceptual frameworks of both paratransgenesis and Synthetic Biology, bearing great potential for the generation of novel approaches for combating mosquito-borne diseases.'",['New Application']
2160,"b'Bio-manufacturing is a type of manufacturing that utilizes biological systems to produce commercially important biomaterials. However, it cant be scaled up and put into practice so easily mainly due to the unstable productivity. So, to make bio-manufacturing a more practical technology for synthesis, we build up a more stable and efficient synthesis platform based on bio-cathode. There are 3 systems in our project. To enable E.coli to transfer the extracellular electrons into the cytoplasm as NADH, we construct the Mtr CAB system, the first system we have. Mtr CAB, a protein complex located on the outer membrane, can transfer electrons from the outside of the membrane into the periplasm. The second system is a photoelectric system, generating high energy electrons with CdS nanoparticles as a light harvester. Lastly, we introduce an enzyme as an indicator to demonstrate our projects flexibility and efficiency.'",['New Application']
2161,"b'Advances in synthetic biology have lead to new, useful metabolic pathways that can be used to produce metabolites on a commercially-viable scale. However, management of these cultures is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and measuring levels of metabolites often involves prohibitively expensive analytics, such as HPLC. Our project aims to overcome these problems by providing a low-cost, automated turbidostat bioreactor that analyzes a yeast culture in real time and corrects inputs to maintain culture conditions. To test our system, we use the violacein metabolic pathway, regulated with inducible promoters, to yield four visually distinct pigments. An open-source Raspberry Pi computer collects color and opacity information about the culture, and software analyzes the color and gradually introduces the inducers to keep the cultures production stable. By combining biological, software, and hardware systems, our design can generate previously-unavailable visual data in certain biosynthesis processes, and has a wide range of applications in industrial fermentation.'",['New Application']

Trichoderma.atroviride is our selected guardian,we use it as our chassis, making it can respond to specified volatile organic compounds(VOC) and then synthesize new VOC to realize the communication between guardians just like QS in bacteria.We further build a hardware to detect the healthy condition of plants based on machine learning. We also express ferritin and TRPV1 proteins to try to make the guardians respond to medium waves emitted by the hardware when it estimates the plants are attacked, and then our guardians will protect the plants from phytopathogen,nematodes,or even herbivores.We use tobaccos and its nature enemy Phytopathora nicotianae to elaborate our works.'",['New Application']
2163,"b'Textile dyeing is one of the biggest polluters of natural waters. Many of the synthetic dyes used are non-biodegradable, toxic and large amounts of them end up in waters during the dyeing process. Natural dyes, although less toxic than synthetic ones, require mordants in order to bind to the fabric. Mordants often contain aluminum or other metals, which are harmful to the environment. We are addressing the problem by using two types of colorful fusion proteins. Chromoproteins are fused with binding domains to create colorful proteins which can bind cellulose or keratin based materials, such as cotton or wool, respectively. Spider silk is added to some of the proteins in order to make colored silk proteins that can be made into fibers, which would erase the need for the dyeing step from the textile value chain completely. Our experiments were focused on binding tests and silk fiber production.'",['New Application']
2164,"b'Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered as the main reason of human aging through damaging DNA, attacking membrane and inducing apoptosis. Now many antioxidants adding in food, cosmetic and some medical production claim they can clear oxidative damages. Although many methods of measuring antioxidants capability are precise in vitro, there is no standard method for living cell. Therefore our project is to construct a system which can determine the activity of antioxidants in vivo. We chose Saccharomyces. cerevisiae as host and accumulated ROS by overexpressing genes. After reacting with antioxidants, the remaining ROS could reflect the antioxidant activity which could be detected by a redox sensor, roGFP2-Orp1. Additionally, a feedback gene circuit was set to avoid the overproduction of ROS which injured our yeast. Compared with the traditional methods, our system requires a milder environment, damage-free and with higher biologically relevant which make our system more reliable.'",['New Application']

Utilizing light sensitive protein interaction domains termed magnets, we have developed a light-sensitive optogenetic variant of Flip recombinase that can be controlled in Escherichia coli with exquisite spatio-temporal precision.

2167,"b'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also called malignant hepatoma, is one of the deadliest cancers. Through the introduction of a double-stranded RNA to the targeted messenger RNA (mRNA), RNA interference (RNAi) leads to the specific cleavage of the mRNA and efficient silencing of gene expression. Since RNAi could be used to silence genes involved in the development and progression of carcinomas, it has promising therapeutic potential for their treatment. The gene therapy strategy we propose here: (1) utilize two cancer-specific promoters (one HCC-specific) to open an AND-gated system to target HCC, the selectivity supposed to be extremely high; (2) is dependent on and hence controllable by a low molecular weight compound; (3) has the flexibility to be adapted to target any mRNA and, if there are disease-specific promoters, other diseases.'",['New Application']

2169,"b'Cell-based biosensors allow to simply and selectively sense diverse chemical signals; yet their applications are limited by the minutes-to-hours timescale of gene transcription and translation. To generate a real-time output, we exploit the much faster changes in protein interaction and bacterial movement. Based on the E. coli Tar chemotaxis receptor, we developed two sensing systems: detecting DNA binding of a transcription factor via split luciferase complementation, and imaging the movement of bacteria at the single-cell level. The sensory domain of Tar can be modified to recognize different molecules, extending the applicability of the sensor. To show the advances brought by our system we built AROMA, an autonomous robot that is directly driven by the onboard biosensor. The robot detects the concentration of volatile compounds in air by imaging the bacterial response with a microscope built in-house.

2170,"b'Keratosis pilaris and Seborrheic keratosis are characterized by a buildup of keratin which are accompanied by redness and rashes. In severe cases, these skin conditions may be precancerous. Keratin is difficult to degrade due to the nature of its protein structures. However, complete degradation can be induced by the synergistic capacity of endo-acting, exo-acting, and oligopeptide-acting keratinases. We have engineered strains of E.coli to produce these keratinases and secrete them through the curli secretion pathway. We then encapsulated these modified bacteria in a hydrogel only permeable to the enzymes and essential nutrients for growth. Thus, weve created a prototype for a keratin-degrading patch to place on the afflicted area to mitigate the lesion, eliminating the need for conventional invasive treatments. The development of easily produced keratinases lends to future uses, such as management of agricultural waste and facilitated research in precancerous growths linked to excess of keratin.'",['New Application']
2171,"b'\tNature has provided a remarkable system to insert genes into functional centromeres of grass genomes. Specifically, centromeric retrotransposons (CR) have the unique ability to insert themselves into the centromere by targeting a yet unidentified docking agent. We plan to adapt this system to insert genes of interest into centromeres. Centromeres are advantageous transgene targets because they lack recombination, allowing the stacking of multiple traits. Retrotransposons, or jumping genes, self-replicate and package their genome into self-assembling virus-like particles (VLPs), then reinsert (or jump) themselves into a new chromosomal location. To measure the stability of VLPs for packaging molecular cargo, we cloned the full-length gene encoding the CR gag protein and successfully generated VLPs in vitro. We also tested the efficiency of different gene constructs in forming VLPs in vitro. Electron microscopy can confirm VLP assembly, however, we plan to develop a convenient fluorescent assay to assess VLP assembly.'",['New Application']
2172,"b'How does microbial community perpetuate or perish? Like human society, in nature, microorganisms not only compete but also cooperate with each other for a successful establishment of a microbial community.

Here, we use E. coli to form a microbial population composed of the ""cooperator"" and the ""cheater"". ""Cooperator"" which displays -glucosidase on the cell surface breaks down cellobiose into glucose. This enzymatic activity allows both ""cooperator"" and ""cheater"" to share glucose as an energy source (public goods). ""Cheater"" which expresses GFP is now able to proliferate within microbe population by glucose from cooperator.

2173,"b'Recombinant proteins have diverse and important therapeutic and industrial utility, at present their purification is costly, time and labour intensive. Our research simplifies this purification process by sequestering desired proteins into synthetic vesicles, allowing for bulk purification via an operationally simple centrifugation step. These synthetic vesicles have been engineered into the expression host E.Coli. As previously shown in plants and algae, vesicle formation occurs spontaneously in the presence of chlorophyll and the enzymes needed for its biosynthesis. Cells grown in the dark recruit phospholipids to form crystalline aggregates known as prolamellar bodies. Subsequent exposure of the cells to light results in the conversion of these aggregates to vesicles. By mimicking this natural process, our cells can be selectively induced to capture valuable recombinant products in easily isolable vesicles.

Given that A1-42 spontaneously aggregates into toxic plaques, we expect the dropout cultures to become enriched over time for A1-42 gene variants correlated with a reduced capacity for aggregation. We will use next generation sequencing data from our initial and resulting mutant sequences to develop a model to identify key regions of the A1-42 sequence crucial to plaque formation.

Tackle with large area soil dioxin contamination is hard, since the most efficient way to clean up is burning, which is eco-unfriendly and costly. Our project combines phytoremediation and engineered endophyte to clean dioxin-contaminated soil. We engineered an endophyte with membrane transporter, dehalogenase and laccase to intake and break down dioxin, and created biobricks compatible shuttle vector that can express in a well-researched endophyte, Burkholderia phytofirmans.

In our project, a PopQC system was developed as a plasmid based gene circuit in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 to continuously select high-performing cells in order to improve the yield of target metabolite, glutamate. In the presence of our PopQC system, high-producers stayed alive while low-producers were unable to survive.

While most whole-cell detection methods indicate the target molecules presence by activating a visible reporter, our system initiates transcription of a downstream gene. This allows us to activate gene expression in response to a specific signal, effectively turning any DNA sequence, small molecule, or protein into a potential transcription factor.

To achieve this, we will hijack the bacterial type-3-secretion system (T3SS) that injects signal-tagged proteins through cell membranes. By constructing a device with two chambers separated by a membrane we direct our T3SS-bearing bacteria to inject target-proteins through the membrane and into a collection chamber. This method will separate the pure recombinant protein from the producing organism, facilitating purification. We will establish proof-of-concept using membranes in the form of liposomes, lipid-bilayers, onion cells and egg yolk. Furthermore, the two-chambered device will be 3D-printed. Our project will be developed further by integrating feedback from experts in space exploration, pharmaceuticals and bio-safety.'",['New Application']

The purpose of the project is to use applied diagnostics to prevent overutilization of anthelmintics in horses by engineering a smart bacterium. These bacteria would be able to report the presence of specific nematode parasites in a quantitative manner, allowing deworming treatments to be individualized for each horse depending on the level of infection. This would minimize the risk of future anthelmintic resistance, helping to stem the impending problem. Using synthetic biology to solve problems in veterinary diagnostics has presented many unique challenges to our team.

2192,"b'Microorganisms exist in complex and diverse communities. This enables a variety of important interactions including co-metabolism and nutrient cycling. Yet, it can be difficult to culture species together in a laboratory setting. Mixed populations are difficult to maintain primarily due to competition: a difference in growth rates often results in one population outcompeting another. Our team aims to dynamically control E. coli growth by using optogenetics (light-induced gene expression) to regulate the production of MetE, an enzyme essential for bacterial growth. This kind of control could help us overcome a major barrier to maintaining co-cultures: competition between microorganisms. This would open several doors in biotech and research. For instance, metabolic engineering of microbial communities may improve the production of pharmaceuticals, biofuels, and other important materials. Moreover, controllable co-cultures would allow researchers to explore complex interactions between microbes and investigate questions that could not previously be answered due to co-culturing limitations.'",['New Application']

The core of the ABCD system is the specific binding of the aptamer and its target protein. After protein detection, we use outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) to treat the diseased cells. We designed a system that has realized the efficient, customizable production of OMVs, which serves to encapsulate specific siRNA for disease treatment.

2195,"b'Nowadays, aptamers binding to specific targets are synthesized via SELEX. While effective, SELEX requires specialized equipment, trillions of initial oligonucleotides, and considerable time and cost. Therefore, our team proposes a novel mechanism of aptamer development, MEDEA - Machine Enhanced Directed Evolution of Aptamers. Our project aims to create a platform for the evolution of optimised aptamers, in E. coli cells. The evolution of our aptamer sequence is achieved through the interaction of three modules: the aptamer module, the mutagenesis module and the selection module. The aptamer module contains the aptamer sequence connected to a ribozyme. When the aptamer binds to its target, the ribozyme is activated, cleaving a Small Transcription Activating RNA. The STAR enables the transcription of an antibiotic resistance gene, used for selection. Mutagenesis is performed by the EvolvR system. The first step in our revolutionary pipeline is a software to create highly specific initial aptamers.'",['New Application']

Most of these diseases have no treatment or effective prophylaxis, and vector control is the preferable mode of action. However, traditional methods using insecticides are not efficient and an environmental hazard, indicating the need for an effective and eco-friendly solution. In the FlyGEM project, we took advantage of the Bacillus thuringiensis israeliensis (Bti), a gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that produces insecticidal toxins and virulence factors that selectively target the larval mosquito stages. We genetically engineered a bacterium that expresses Bti toxin in the gut microbiome of adult mosquitoes. Mosquitoes fed by Bti-toxin expressing bacteria were not affected, however the bacteria are delivered to the eggs and the expressed Bti is toxic for the hatching and nearby larvae. Thus, our Trojan Mosquito can specifically target the larvae and reduce mosquito population to control mosquito-borne diseases.'",['New Application']
2197,"b'Engineering microbial cells to produce fine chemicals is a sustainable and environmental-friendly way. However, low yield from microbial production hinders its industrial application. Resources within microbial cells such as carbon-source from cell medium are utilized both for cell-growth and product-synthesis. Traditional ways to balance cell-growth and product-synthesis involve using inducers to initiate product-synthesis, which is time-consuming and expensive for large-scale production. To allocate resources for increased yield and decreased cell-medium cost, we have developed an intelligent system Achieved Transcription Management(ATM), which allocates intracellular transcriptional resources to growth-related genes in early stages of fermentation and switches them to product-related genes after a high cell density is achieved. Under guide of mathematical models, the proper cell density is responded by QS circuit expressing genes -factors and T7-RNA-polymerase.

CiC contains 3 key components: i) the fluorescence-labeled ssDNA aptamers for specifically targeting the receptors of CTCs and visualizing them; ii) once successfully targeting CTCs, the ssDNA aptamers will expose the sticky end further for triggering the adhesion of sticky-end pairing ssDNA; iii) the pairing ssDNA can induce rolling circle amplification, subsequent multi-primed chain amplification, making the formation of CiC around CTCs.

These landmines cause not only tens of thousands of human casualties each year, but also serious environmental pollution. To help deminers detect landmines in a fast and safe way, our team designed a bio-optical landmine detection device. We engineered an E. coli strain harboring a gene circuit to sense the dinitrotoluene (DNT), a typical chemical released by landmines. DNT can trigger the bioluminescence generation module in our engineered bacteria, and emitted optical signal can be captured and converted to digital output by the device, which is uploaded to an on-site computer. Through data processing, we will be able to create a probabilistic heat map of the landmines in a particular area.

2234,"b""Late spring cold (LSC) is a common climatic phenomenon in many areas of the world, which refers to the sudden appearance of continuous low temperature after the weather warms up in middle of spring. Every year, LSC causes huge agricultural and economic losses through freezing the bud of crops. Currently, spraying abscisic acid (ABA) is the main way to deal with LSC. However, chemically synthesized ABA usually contains by-products and toxic waste, while purified ABA is expensive. Therefore, we hope to give a new application to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, so that it can synthesize ABA before the onset of LSC, and develop a software to predict degree of LSC.

2235,"b""This year, ShanghaiTech_China developed an enhanced method of detecting antibiotics and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs), first applying Cas12a to this field. Antibiotic-resistance has become a global health concern. The antibiotic-abuse in clinical therapies and industries has led to antibiotics leakage and unexpected rapid spreading of ARGs, causing the emergence of drug-resistant microbes. In order to solve this problem, ShanghaiTech_China designed a new detection system -- CESAR (Cas12a-based Efficient Solution to Antibiotic-Resistance), to identify antibiotic-residue and ARGs. CESAR contains two devices with different purposes: (1) CESAR-I is a portable rapid-response device for on-site antibiotic-residue detection. By integrating the aptamer-sensing module, Cas12a-reporting module, and fluorescence-measuring module, it simplifies the process and lowers the cost of antibiotic-abuse surveillance. (2) CESAR-II is designed for doctors' detecting ARGs. Current techniques are either time-consuming or too expensive for hospitals in less-developed regions. CESAR-II is cost-effective and can help eliminate the medical disparity caused by unbalanced economic development.""",['New Application']
2236,"b'Small dairy farmers in upstate New York are struggling to survive in a factory-farming marketplace. To increase profits, some farmers are producing specialty products; one such product in the US is A2 milk. A2 milk differs from the more common A1 milk in the sequence of beta-casein, one of the main milk proteins. The gene that codes for the A1/A2 alleles of beta-casein differs by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). A2 milk is growing in popularity in the US due to purported health benefits. Our team aims to create a field-deployable genetic test to facilitate breeding of A2 herds. Our system utilizes a 5 Flap endonuclease (Flappase) and quenched-oligonucleotides that differentially bind to the A1/A2 alleles of beta-casein. When in the correct conformation, Flappase will cleave the oligonucleotides, dequenching the fluorescent tag. Dairy farmers using this system will be able to rapidly identify cows carrying the A2 allele for breeding.'",['New Application']

That is why we are developing a biosensor based on plant pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which are cell surface receptors of the plant immune system, that dimerize in the presence of microbes. We designed a system based on EFR, FLS2, CORE and their coreceptor BAK1, which recognize a broad spectrum of bacteria.

However, reliable measurements of these compounds are a major drawback for a better understanding of the connection between the gut microbiota and the brain. GutLux, our ingestible biosensor, tackles this by measuring the concentration of the metabolites in vivo, inside the gut. GutLux is comprised of two parts. The biological component responds to the concentration of metabolite by producing a light signal that can be measured quantitatively. The electronic component measures this signal and converts it to readable, wirelessly transmittable data. Our design focuses on compounds associated with mental health, but its use could be extended to other gut metabolites by adapting the biological component.

However, the total cost of dNTPs production is significant and they are often produced by complicated, unsustainable chemical processes, mainly feasible in centralized laboratories with expensive equipment. For this project, a high yield genetic circuit is designed in order to produce ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and thymidylate synthase (TSase), two enzymes necessary for the production of dNTPs. The produced dNTPs, along with thermostable Pfu DNA Polymerase, also included in the designed genetic circuit, allow for a low-cost PCR, with components not requiring cold storage.

Our plant indicates the presence of toxic chemicals by changing its color to red. For this, we introduce two new reporter systems called RUBY and ANTHOS, enabling the synthesis of the plant pigments betalains or anthocyanins, respectively. If the chemical is present, it is specifically bound by a receptor, which then activates a signaling cascade, resulting in the synthesis of the pigments.
