###################################### ##### ORIGINAL: On average across OECD countries, 13.1% of children live in relative income poverty, a figure that becomes even larger for children living in single‑parent (32.5%) and jobless (63.9%) households. Given that the likelihood of growing up in poverty significantly varies across household types and socio‑economic situations, anti-poverty policies need to span a wide range of policy domains. This chapter analyses different anti-poverty policies across OECD countries, including employment policies, social benefits, and increased service delivery. The chapter also covers the “first 1 000 days” strategy, an approach that seeks to provide tailored support and continuous assistance to pregnant women and families with infants throughout early childhood development. It then sheds a light on fully comprehensive anti-poverty strategies of two countries in particular, France and Ireland.##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM: average oecd countries children live relative income poverty figure larger children living single parent jobless households given likelihood growing poverty significantly varies household types socio economic situations anti poverty policies need span wide range policy domains this chapter analyses different anti poverty policies oecd countries including employment policies social benefits increased service delivery the chapter covers first days strategy approach seeks provide tailored support continuous assistance pregnant women families infants early childhood development sheds light fully comprehensive anti poverty strategies countries particular france ireland##### LEM_NO_STEM: average oecd country child live relative income poverty figure larger child living single parent jobless household given likelihood growing poverty significantly varies household type socio economic situation anti poverty policy need span wide range policy domain this chapter analysis different anti poverty policy oecd country including employment policy social benefit increased service delivery the chapter cover first day strategy approach seek provide tailored support continuous assistance pregnant woman family infant early childhood development shed light fully comprehensive anti poverty strategy country particular france ireland##### NO_LEM_STEM: averag oecd countri children live rel incom poverti figur larger children live singl parent jobless household given likelihood grow poverti significantli vari household type socio econom situat anti poverti polici need span wide rang polici domain thi chapter analys differ anti poverti polici oecd countri includ employ polici social benefit increas servic deliveri the chapter cover first day strategi approach seek provid tailor support continu assist pregnant women famili infant earli childhood develop shed light fulli comprehens anti poverti strategi countri particular franc ireland##### LEM_STEM: averag oecd countri child live rel incom poverti figur larger child live singl parent jobless household given likelihood grow poverti significantli vari household type socio econom situat anti poverti polici need span wide rang polici domain thi chapter analysi differ anti poverti polici oecd countri includ employ polici social benefit increas servic deliveri the chapter cover first day strategi approach seek provid tailor support continu assist pregnant woman famili infant earli childhood develop shed light fulli comprehens anti poverti strategi countri particular franc ireland###################################### ##### ORIGINAL: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic hit an extremely vulnerable social structure in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), resulting in a significant increase in poverty and inequalities and highlighting the urgency to overcome the social vulnerability trap. The crisis revealed that the current mechanisms for social protection in the region are insufficient due to widespread labour informality, which affects more than 50% of workers. In addition, the prevalence of gender gaps in the labour market and the over-representation of women in poorer households remain structural challenges. This chapter explores the need to move towards universal social protection systems, promote options for formalisation and reduce social coverage gaps, to protect those in the intersection of vulnerability factors, in particular the climate change-vulnerable population, women, migrants, youth and disadvantaged students. The chapter shows the linkage between climate change and inequality and how social protection systems can help promote a green recovery in the region while highlighting the need to improve the quality and inclusiveness of basic services, especially health care and education.##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM: the coronavirus covid pandemic hit extremely vulnerable social structure latin america caribbean lac resulting significant increase poverty inequalities highlighting urgency overcome social vulnerability trap the crisis revealed current mechanisms social protection region insufficient widespread labour informality affects workers addition prevalence gender gaps labour market representation women poorer households remain structural challenges this chapter explores need universal social protection systems promote options formalisation reduce social coverage gaps protect intersection vulnerability factors particular climate change vulnerable population women migrants youth disadvantaged students the chapter shows linkage climate change inequality social protection systems help promote green recovery region highlighting need improve quality inclusiveness basic services especially health care education##### LEM_NO_STEM: the coronavirus covid pandemic hit extremely vulnerable social structure latin america caribbean lac resulting significant increase poverty inequality highlighting urgency overcome social vulnerability trap the crisis revealed current mechanism social protection region insufficient widespread labour informality affect worker addition prevalence gender gap labour market representation woman poorer household remain structural challenge this chapter explores need universal social protection system promote option formalisation reduce social coverage gap protect intersection vulnerability factor particular climate change vulnerable population woman migrant youth disadvantaged student the chapter show linkage climate change inequality social protection system help promote green recovery region highlighting need improve quality inclusiveness basic service especially health care education##### NO_LEM_STEM: the coronaviru covid pandem hit extrem vulner social structur latin america caribbean lac result signific increas poverti inequ highlight urgenc overcom social vulner trap the crisi reveal current mechan social protect region insuffici widespread labour inform affect worker addit preval gender gap labour market represent women poorer household remain structur challeng thi chapter explor need univers social protect system promot option formalis reduc social coverag gap protect intersect vulner factor particular climat chang vulner popul women migrant youth disadvantag student the chapter show linkag climat chang inequ social protect system help promot green recoveri region highlight need improv qualiti inclus basic servic especi health care educ##### LEM_STEM: the coronaviru covid pandem hit extrem vulner social structur latin america caribbean lac result signific increas poverti inequ highlight urgenc overcom social vulner trap the crisi reveal current mechan social protect region insuffici widespread labour inform affect worker addit preval gender gap labour market represent woman poorer household remain structur challeng thi chapter explor need univers social protect system promot option formalis reduc social coverag gap protect intersect vulner factor particular climat chang vulner popul woman migrant youth disadvantag student the chapter show linkag climat chang inequ social protect system help promot green recoveri region highlight need improv qualiti inclus basic servic especi health care educ###################################### ##### ORIGINAL: Microfinance has grown rapidly as a tool to help entrepreneurs from under-represented and disadvantaged groups access start-up financing. The largest target client group of microfinance is women, followed by youth, seniors, the unemployed and immigrants. Estimates suggest that the global market is about EUR 124-137 billion and this is expected to more than double by 2027. However, the supply of microfinance has not been able to keep up with demand and annual unmet demand for microfinance is about EUR 14 billion. This chapter discusses how governments can address this gap. It also covers other debates in microfinance such as the extent to which digitalisation should be embraced and how microfinance can be used to support the green transition. The chapter provides policy advice that is illustrated with case study examples.##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM: microfinance grown rapidly tool help entrepreneurs represented disadvantaged groups access start financing the largest target client group microfinance women followed youth seniors unemployed immigrants estimates suggest global market eur billion expected double however supply microfinance able demand annual unmet demand microfinance eur billion this chapter discusses governments address gap covers debates microfinance extent digitalisation embraced microfinance support green transition the chapter provides policy advice illustrated case study examples##### LEM_NO_STEM: microfinance grown rapidly tool help entrepreneur represented disadvantaged group access start financing the largest target client group microfinance woman followed youth senior unemployed immigrant estimate suggest global market eur billion expected double however supply microfinance able demand annual unmet demand microfinance eur billion this chapter discus government address gap cover debate microfinance extent digitalisation embraced microfinance support green transition the chapter provides policy advice illustrated case study example##### NO_LEM_STEM: microfin grown rapidli tool help entrepreneur repres disadvantag group access start financ the largest target client group microfin women follow youth senior unemploy immigr estim suggest global market eur billion expect doubl howev suppli microfin abl demand annual unmet demand microfin eur billion thi chapter discuss govern address gap cover debat microfin extent digitalis embrac microfin support green transit the chapter provid polici advic illustr case studi exampl##### LEM_STEM: microfin grown rapidli tool help entrepreneur repres disadvantag group access start financ the largest target client group microfin woman follow youth senior unemploy immigr estim suggest global market eur billion expect doubl howev suppli microfin abl demand annual unmet demand microfin eur billion thi chapter discu govern address gap cover debat microfin extent digitalis embrac microfin support green transit the chapter provid polici advic illustr case studi exampl###################################### ##### ORIGINAL: COVID-19’s impact on households’ material conditions has been significant. Although government support ensured that average household income did not decrease as markedly as GDP in 2020, many households did nevertheless face financial difficulties. The pandemic led to the closure, both permanently and temporarily, of activities and businesses, and for many jobs teleworking is simply not an option. Despite unprecedented government action to support workers and employers, labour underutilisation rates nearly doubled, and there has been a steep reduction in hours worked. Overcrowded and poor-quality housing conditions increase vulnerability to COVID-19, while the lack of Internet access still prevents some people from working, studying or accessing services remotely. Housing cost overburden and sharp rises in rents and house prices have added to the difficulties faced by poorer households. These impacts have tended to hit vulnerable people and places the hardest, threatening to widen pre-existing inequalities.##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM: covid impact households material conditions significant although government support ensured average household income decrease markedly gdp households face financial difficulties the pandemic led closure permanently temporarily activities businesses jobs teleworking simply option despite unprecedented government action support workers employers labour rates nearly doubled steep reduction hours worked overcrowded poor quality housing conditions increase vulnerability covid lack internet access prevents people working studying accessing services remotely housing cost overburden sharp rises rents house prices added difficulties faced poorer households these impacts tended hit vulnerable people places hardest threatening widen pre existing inequalities##### LEM_NO_STEM: covid impact household material condition significant although government support ensured average household income decrease markedly gdp household face financial difficulty the pandemic led closure permanently temporarily activity business job teleworking simply option despite unprecedented government action support worker employer labour rate nearly doubled steep reduction hour worked overcrowded poor quality housing condition increase vulnerability covid lack internet access prevents people working studying accessing service remotely housing cost overburden sharp rise rent house price added difficulty faced poorer household these impact tended hit vulnerable people place hardest threatening widen pre existing inequality##### NO_LEM_STEM: covid impact household materi condit signific although govern support ensur averag household incom decreas markedli gdp household face financi difficulti the pandem led closur perman temporarili activ busi job telework simpli option despit unpreced govern action support worker employ labour rate nearli doubl steep reduct hour work overcrowd poor qualiti hous condit increas vulner covid lack internet access prevent peopl work studi access servic remot hous cost overburden sharp rise rent hous price ad difficulti face poorer household these impact tend hit vulner peopl place hardest threaten widen pre exist inequ##### LEM_STEM: covid impact household materi condit signific although govern support ensur averag household incom decreas markedli gdp household face financi difficulti the pandem led closur perman temporarili activ busi job telework simpli option despit unpreced govern action support worker employ labour rate nearli doubl steep reduct hour work overcrowd poor qualiti hous condit increas vulner covid lack internet access prevent peopl work studi access servic remot hous cost overburden sharp rise rent hous price ad difficulti face poorer household these impact tend hit vulner peopl place hardest threaten widen pre exist inequ###################################### ##### ORIGINAL: At their High-Level Meeting (HLM) in 2020, members of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) set out a number of commitments and aspirations to align development co-operation with the objectives of international agreements to fight climate change and protect the environment.

Since around 2014, household income and consumption have stagnated, while satisfaction with living standards began to fall in the region. While until 2019, employment levels were comparatively high in the region, recent data show that the COVID-19 crisis had a negative impact on employment and unemployment. Across Latin America as a whole, more than half of all workers are in informal employment and typically lack access to social programmes and protection against unfair dismissal. Regarding housing quality, on average for the focal countries with available data, only around half of households had access to sanitation services, and only 70% had access to clean drinking water.##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM: poverty extreme poverty income inequality declined considerably focal countries remained high since household income consumption stagnated satisfaction living standards began fall region while employment levels comparatively high region recent data covid crisis negative impact employment unemployment across latin america half workers informal employment typically lack access social programmes protection unfair dismissal regarding housing quality average focal countries available data half households access sanitation services access clean drinking water##### LEM_NO_STEM: poverty extreme poverty income inequality declined considerably focal country remained high since household income consumption stagnated satisfaction living standard began fall region while employment level comparatively high region recent data covid crisis negative impact employment unemployment across latin america half worker informal employment typically lack access social programme protection unfair dismissal regarding housing quality average focal country available data half household access sanitation service access clean drinking water##### NO_LEM_STEM: poverti extrem poverti incom inequ declin consider focal countri remain high sinc household incom consumpt stagnat satisfact live standard began fall region while employ level compar high region recent data covid crisi neg impact employ unemploy across latin america half worker inform employ typic lack access social programm protect unfair dismiss regard hous qualiti averag focal countri avail data half household access sanit servic access clean drink water##### LEM_STEM: poverti extrem poverti incom inequ declin consider focal countri remain high sinc household incom consumpt stagnat satisfact live standard began fall region while employ level compar high region recent data covid crisi neg impact employ unemploy across latin america half worker inform employ typic lack access social programm protect unfair dismiss regard hous qualiti averag focal countri avail data half household access sanit servic access clean drink water###################################### ##### ORIGINAL: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant deterioration in public finances, adding to pre-existing strains from long-term structural challenges including population ageing, climate change, rising inequality, digitalisation and automation. This report, originally prepared for G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors at the request of the Italian G20 Presidency, considers the challenges and opportunities of developing public fiscal policy strategies as countries seek to “build back better”. The report focuses in particular on how tax policy can be designed comprehensively so that fiscal systems can deliver a balance of equity, growth and sustainability, highlighting some of the key considerations that policymakers should take into account to ensure optimal tax policy design and the successful implementation of tax reform.##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM: the covid pandemic caused significant deterioration public finances adding pre existing strains long term structural challenges including population ageing climate change rising inequality digitalisation automation this report originally prepared finance ministers central bank governors request italian presidency considers challenges opportunities developing public fiscal policy strategies countries seek build better the report focuses particular tax policy designed comprehensively fiscal systems deliver balance equity growth sustainability highlighting key considerations policymakers account ensure optimal tax policy design successful implementation tax reform##### LEM_NO_STEM: the covid pandemic caused significant deterioration public finance adding pre existing strain long term structural challenge including population ageing climate change rising inequality digitalisation automation this report originally prepared finance minister central bank governor request italian presidency considers challenge opportunity developing public fiscal policy strategy country seek build better the report focus particular tax policy designed comprehensively fiscal system deliver balance equity growth sustainability highlighting key consideration policymakers account ensure optimal tax policy design successful implementation tax reform##### NO_LEM_STEM: the covid pandem caus signific deterior public financ ad pre exist strain long term structur challeng includ popul age climat chang rise inequ digitalis autom thi report origin prepar financ minist central bank governor request italian presid consid challeng opportun develop public fiscal polici strategi countri seek build better the report focus particular tax polici design comprehens fiscal system deliv balanc equiti growth sustain highlight key consider policymak account ensur optim tax polici design success implement tax reform##### LEM_STEM: the covid pandem caus signific deterior public financ ad pre exist strain long term structur challeng includ popul age climat chang rise inequ digitalis autom thi report origin prepar financ minist central bank governor request italian presid consid challeng opportun develop public fiscal polici strategi countri seek build better the report focu particular tax polici design comprehens fiscal system deliv balanc equiti growth sustain highlight key consider policymak account ensur optim tax polici design success implement tax reform###################################### ##### ORIGINAL: Canada’s vaccine rollout is bringing the prospect of an end to the COVID-19 crisis and a pick-up in output growth is expected. An ultra-low policy rate and other monetary measures continue to provide substantial support for the economy and fiscal support for households and businesses has been substantial. However, risks and uncertainties remain large, notably around how quickly restrictions can be reduced as vaccine rollout proceeds, and how rapidly households will unwind precautionary saving. The COVID-19 crisis has also brought to light shortfalls in welfare programmes. Building back with a sustainable economic recovery will involve challenges for Canada’s policy on greenhouse-gas reduction and will reinforce the need to tackle some longstanding issues in welfare programmes and in impediments to business productivity.This Survey’s in-depth examination of well-being finds that Canada has scope to make greater use of quantitative indicators in policymaking. This could help frame policy agendas and benchmark progress. Healthcare, childcare, affordable housing and support for Indigenous peoples are among the areas with room for improved policies that can lead to improvements in well-being.SPECIAL FEATURE: WELL-BEING##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM: canada vaccine rollout bringing prospect end covid crisis pick output growth expected ultra low policy rate monetary measures continue provide substantial support economy fiscal support households businesses substantial however risks uncertainties remain large notably quickly restrictions reduced vaccine rollout proceeds rapidly households unwind precautionary saving the covid crisis brought light shortfalls welfare programmes building sustainable economic recovery involve challenges canada policy greenhouse gas reduction reinforce need tackle longstanding issues welfare programmes impediments business productivity this survey depth examination finds canada scope greater use quantitative indicators policymaking this help frame policy agendas benchmark progress healthcare childcare affordable housing support indigenous peoples areas room improved policies lead improvements special feature well being##### LEM_NO_STEM: canada vaccine rollout bringing prospect end covid crisis pick output growth expected ultra low policy rate monetary measure continue provide substantial support economy fiscal support household business substantial however risk uncertainty remain large notably quickly restriction reduced vaccine rollout proceeds rapidly household unwind precautionary saving the covid crisis brought light shortfall welfare programme building sustainable economic recovery involve challenge canada policy greenhouse gas reduction reinforce need tackle longstanding issue welfare programme impediment business productivity this survey depth examination find canada scope greater use quantitative indicator policymaking this help frame policy agenda benchmark progress healthcare childcare affordable housing support indigenous people area room improved policy lead improvement special feature well being##### NO_LEM_STEM: canada vaccin rollout bring prospect end covid crisi pick output growth expect ultra low polici rate monetari measur continu provid substanti support economi fiscal support household busi substanti howev risk uncertainti remain larg notabl quickli restrict reduc vaccin rollout proce rapidli household unwind precautionari save the covid crisi brought light shortfal welfar programm build sustain econom recoveri involv challeng canada polici greenhous ga reduct reinforc need tackl longstand issu welfar programm impedi busi product thi survey depth examin find canada scope greater use quantit indic policymak thi help frame polici agenda benchmark progress healthcar childcar afford hous support indigen peopl area room improv polici lead improv special featur well be##### LEM_STEM: canada vaccin rollout bring prospect end covid crisi pick output growth expect ultra low polici rate monetari measur continu provid substanti support economi fiscal support household busi substanti howev risk uncertainti remain larg notabl quickli restrict reduc vaccin rollout proce rapidli household unwind precautionari save the covid crisi brought light shortfal welfar programm build sustain econom recoveri involv challeng canada polici greenhous ga reduct reinforc need tackl longstand issu welfar programm impedi busi product thi survey depth examin find canada scope greater use quantit indic policymak thi help frame polici agenda benchmark progress healthcar childcar afford hous support indigen peopl area room improv polici lead improv special featur well be###################################### ##### ORIGINAL: As the roll out of coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines begins, this policy brief asks how to ensure vaccines for all. In doing so, it examines the case for multilateral approaches to access and delivery, maps key challenges, and identifies priority actions for policy makers. The absence of a comprehensive approach to ensure vaccine access in developing countries threatens to prolong the pandemic, escalating inequalities and delaying the global economic recovery. While new collaborative efforts such as ACT Accelerator and its COVAX initiative are helping to bridge current gaps, these are not enough in circumstances where demand far outstrips supply. Based on the current trajectory, mass immunisation efforts for poorer countries could be delayed until 2024 or beyond, prolonging human and economic suffering for all countries. Policy actions to support equitable vaccine access in developing countries include: (i) supporting multilateral frameworks for equitable allocation of vaccines and for crisis response, resilience and prevention; (ii) highlighting the role of development finance; and, (iii) promoting context-driven solutions. ##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM: roll coronavirus covid vaccines begins policy brief asks ensure vaccines examines case multilateral approaches access delivery maps key challenges identifies priority actions policy makers the absence comprehensive approach ensure vaccine access developing countries threatens prolong pandemic escalating inequalities delaying global economic recovery while new collaborative efforts act accelerator covax initiative helping bridge current gaps circumstances demand far outstrips supply based current trajectory mass immunisation efforts poorer countries delayed prolonging human economic suffering countries policy actions support equitable vaccine access developing countries include supporting multilateral frameworks equitable allocation vaccines crisis response resilience prevention highlighting role development finance iii promoting context driven solutions##### LEM_NO_STEM: roll coronavirus covid vaccine begin policy brief asks ensure vaccine examines case multilateral approach access delivery map key challenge identifies priority action policy maker the absence comprehensive approach ensure vaccine access developing country threatens prolong pandemic escalating inequality delaying global economic recovery while new collaborative effort act accelerator covax initiative helping bridge current gap circumstance demand far outstrips supply based current trajectory mass immunisation effort poorer country delayed prolonging human economic suffering country policy action support equitable vaccine access developing country include supporting multilateral framework equitable allocation vaccine crisis response resilience prevention highlighting role development finance iii promoting context driven solution##### NO_LEM_STEM: roll coronaviru covid vaccin begin polici brief ask ensur vaccin examin case multilater approach access deliveri map key challeng identifi prioriti action polici maker the absenc comprehens approach ensur vaccin access develop countri threaten prolong pandem escal inequ delay global econom recoveri while new collabor effort act acceler covax initi help bridg current gap circumst demand far outstrip suppli base current trajectori mass immunis effort poorer countri delay prolong human econom suffer countri polici action support equit vaccin access develop countri includ support multilater framework equit alloc vaccin crisi respons resili prevent highlight role develop financ iii promot context driven solut##### LEM_STEM: roll coronaviru covid vaccin begin polici brief ask ensur vaccin examin case multilater approach access deliveri map key challeng identifi prioriti action polici maker the absenc comprehens approach ensur vaccin access develop countri threaten prolong pandem escal inequ delay global econom recoveri while new collabor effort act acceler covax initi help bridg current gap circumst demand far outstrip suppli base current trajectori mass immunis effort poorer countri delay prolong human econom suffer countri polici action support equit vaccin access develop countri includ support multilater framework equit alloc vaccin crisi respons resili prevent highlight role develop financ iii promot context driven solut###################################### ##### ORIGINAL: Reducing poverty remains an important challenge, and the COVID-19-crisis may further reinforce social vulnerabilities. Although it has declined lately, relative poverty remains high in international comparison and is distributed unevenly across population groups with the elderly, people with disabilities, lone parents, the low-educated and the unemployed being particularly affected. A comprehensive approach is required to ensure an effective transition out of poverty and social exclusion. Reforms should strengthen income protection by ensuring that cash benefits provide adequate and tailored support to those in need. An individual-based approach is also essential for the provision of social services to reduce deficits in important areas such as social housing and long-term care for the elderly. Equity in educational opportunity and outcomes could be strengthened further, starting at the early school years, as not all children benefit from early childhood education and care services. Progress in this domain is also crucial for striking a better work-family balance and improving work incentives. More and better quality jobs in the formal sector, especially for the low-skilled, are crucial for reducing poverty. Enlarged participation in life-long learning programmes can help re-skilling and up-skilling towards higher incomes. Increased spending on well-designed labour market activation policies is also important for tackling poverty effectively.##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM: reducing poverty remains important challenge covid crisis reinforce social vulnerabilities although declined lately relative poverty remains high international comparison distributed unevenly population groups elderly people disabilities lone parents low educated unemployed particularly affected comprehensive approach required ensure effective transition poverty social exclusion reforms strengthen income protection ensuring cash benefits provide adequate tailored support need individual based approach essential provision social services reduce deficits important areas social housing long term care elderly equity educational opportunity outcomes strengthened starting early school years children benefit early childhood education care services progress domain crucial striking better work family balance improving work incentives more better quality jobs formal sector especially low skilled crucial reducing poverty enlarged participation life long learning programmes help skilling skilling higher incomes increased spending designed labour market activation policies important tackling poverty effectively##### LEM_NO_STEM: reducing poverty remains important challenge covid crisis reinforce social vulnerability although declined lately relative poverty remains high international comparison distributed unevenly population group elderly people disability lone parent low educated unemployed particularly affected comprehensive approach required ensure effective transition poverty social exclusion reform strengthen income protection ensuring cash benefit provide adequate tailored support need individual based approach essential provision social service reduce deficit important area social housing long term care elderly equity educational opportunity outcome strengthened starting early school year child benefit early childhood education care service progress domain crucial striking better work family balance improving work incentive more better quality job formal sector especially low skilled crucial reducing poverty enlarged participation life long learning programme help skilling skilling higher income increased spending designed labour market activation policy important tackling poverty effectively##### NO_LEM_STEM: reduc poverti remain import challeng covid crisi reinforc social vulner although declin late rel poverti remain high intern comparison distribut unevenli popul group elderli peopl disabl lone parent low educ unemploy particularli affect comprehens approach requir ensur effect transit poverti social exclus reform strengthen incom protect ensur cash benefit provid adequ tailor support need individu base approach essenti provis social servic reduc deficit import area social hous long term care elderli equiti educ opportun outcom strengthen start earli school year children benefit earli childhood educ care servic progress domain crucial strike better work famili balanc improv work incent more better qualiti job formal sector especi low skill crucial reduc poverti enlarg particip life long learn programm help skill skill higher incom increas spend design labour market activ polici import tackl poverti effect##### LEM_STEM: reduc poverti remain import challeng covid crisi reinforc social vulner although declin late rel poverti remain high intern comparison distribut unevenli popul group elderli peopl disabl lone parent low educ unemploy particularli affect comprehens approach requir ensur effect transit poverti social exclus reform strengthen incom protect ensur cash benefit provid adequ tailor support need individu base approach essenti provis social servic reduc deficit import area social hous long term care elderli equiti educ opportun outcom strengthen start earli school year child benefit earli childhood educ care servic progress domain crucial strike better work famili balanc improv work incent more better qualiti job formal sector especi low skill crucial reduc poverti enlarg particip life long learn programm help skill skill higher incom increas spend design labour market activ polici import tackl poverti effect###################################### ##### ORIGINAL: This chapter is an infographics-style presentation of highlights from the digital publication Development Co-operation Profiles 2020. The first section highlights emerging trends and insights on development finance, followed by four sections with the profiles of official and philanthropic providers of aid, official development assistance, and development finance. These providers include members of the OECD and its Development Assistance Committee (DAC), other countries, and philanthropic foundations. The profiles give an overview of key data and policy priorities for development co-operation. Most DAC members have agreed to a target of providing 0.7% of their gross national income as official development assistance. EU member states that joined the EU before 2002 agreed to a collective target for the EU of 0.7% of GNI as ODA, whereas EU member states that joined after 2002 committed to increase their ODA to 0.33% of GNI.##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM: this chapter infographics style presentation highlights digital publication development operation profiles the section highlights emerging trends insights development finance followed sections profiles official philanthropic providers aid official development assistance development finance these providers include members oecd development assistance committee dac countries philanthropic foundations the profiles overview key data policy priorities development operation most dac members agreed target providing gross national income official development assistance member states joined agreed collective target gni oda member states joined committed increase oda gni##### LEM_NO_STEM: this chapter infographics style presentation highlight digital publication development operation profile the section highlight emerging trend insight development finance followed section profile official philanthropic provider aid official development assistance development finance these provider include member oecd development assistance committee dac country philanthropic foundation the profile overview key data policy priority development operation most dac member agreed target providing gross national income official development assistance member state joined agreed collective target gni oda member state joined committed increase oda gni##### NO_LEM_STEM: thi chapter infograph style present highlight digit public develop oper profil the section highlight emerg trend insight develop financ follow section profil offici philanthrop provid aid offici develop assist develop financ these provid includ member oecd develop assist committe dac countri philanthrop foundat the profil overview key data polici prioriti develop oper most dac member agre target provid gross nation incom offici develop assist member state join agre collect target gni oda member state join commit increas oda gni##### LEM_STEM: thi chapter infograph style present highlight digit public develop oper profil the section highlight emerg trend insight develop financ follow section profil offici philanthrop provid aid offici develop assist develop financ these provid includ member oecd develop assist committe dac countri philanthrop foundat the profil overview key data polici prioriti develop oper most dac member agre target provid gross nation incom offici develop assist member state join agre collect target gni oda member state join commit increas oda gni###################################### ##### ORIGINAL: Social protection systems use a range of entitlement criteria. First-tier support typically requires contributions or past employment in many countries, while safety net benefits are granted on the basis of need. In a context of volatile and uncertain labour markets, careful and continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of income support is a key input into an evidence-based policy process. This paper proposes a novel empirical method for monitoring the accessibility and levels of safety net benefits. It focusses on minimum-income benefits (MIB) and other non-contributory transfers and relies on data on the amounts of cash support that individuals in need receive in practice. Results show that accessibility and benefit levels differ enormously across countries – for instance, in 2015/16, more than four out of five low-income workless one-person households received MIB in Australia, France and the United Kingdom, compared to only one in five in Greece, Italy and Korea, three countries that have since sought to strengthen aspects of safety-net provisions. ##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM: social protection systems use range entitlement criteria first tier support typically requires contributions past employment countries safety net benefits granted basis need context volatile uncertain labour markets careful continuous monitoring effectiveness income support key input evidence based policy process this paper proposes novel empirical method monitoring accessibility levels safety net benefits focusses minimum income benefits mib non contributory transfers relies data amounts cash support individuals need receive practice results accessibility benefit levels differ enormously countries instance low income workless person households received mib australia france united kingdom compared greece italy korea countries sought strengthen aspects safety net provisions##### LEM_NO_STEM: social protection system use range entitlement criterion first tier support typically requires contribution past employment country safety net benefit granted basis need context volatile uncertain labour market careful continuous monitoring effectiveness income support key input evidence based policy process this paper proposes novel empirical method monitoring accessibility level safety net benefit focus minimum income benefit mib non contributory transfer relies data amount cash support individual need receive practice result accessibility benefit level differ enormously country instance low income workless person household received mib australia france united kingdom compared greece italy korea country sought strengthen aspect safety net provision##### NO_LEM_STEM: social protect system use rang entitl criteria first tier support typic requir contribut past employ countri safeti net benefit grant basi need context volatil uncertain labour market care continu monitor effect incom support key input evid base polici process thi paper propos novel empir method monitor access level safeti net benefit focuss minimum incom benefit mib non contributori transfer reli data amount cash support individu need receiv practic result access benefit level differ enorm countri instanc low incom workless person household receiv mib australia franc unit kingdom compar greec itali korea countri sought strengthen aspect safeti net provis##### LEM_STEM: social protect system use rang entitl criterion first tier support typic requir contribut past employ countri safeti net benefit grant basi need context volatil uncertain labour market care continu monitor effect incom support key input evid base polici process thi paper propos novel empir method monitor access level safeti net benefit focu minimum incom benefit mib non contributori transfer reli data amount cash support individu need receiv practic result access benefit level differ enorm countri instanc low incom workless person household receiv mib australia franc unit kingdom compar greec itali korea countri sought strengthen aspect safeti net provis###################################### ##### ORIGINAL: COVID-19 shaped and tested the course of development co-operation in 2020 and set the agenda for 2021 and beyond.

This case study examines the strengths and weaknesses of social systems in Africa and how these influenced the response of different countries. It notes that few countries have adequate social protection schemes, but some countries have limited the direct effects of the pandemic by relying on health emergency systems honed during the Ebola outbreak. Building stronger social systems, the authors argue, builds resilience.##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM: experience shows strong functioning adaptable adequately funded social systems essential cope negative impacts crises like covid this case study examines strengths weaknesses social systems africa influenced response different countries notes countries adequate social protection schemes countries limited direct effects pandemic relying health emergency systems honed ebola outbreak building stronger social systems authors argue builds resilience##### LEM_NO_STEM: experience show strong functioning adaptable adequately funded social system essential cope negative impact crisis like covid this case study examines strength weakness social system africa influenced response different country note country adequate social protection scheme country limited direct effect pandemic relying health emergency system honed ebola outbreak building stronger social system author argue build resilience##### NO_LEM_STEM: experi show strong function adapt adequ fund social system essenti cope neg impact crise like covid thi case studi examin strength weak social system africa influenc respons differ countri note countri adequ social protect scheme countri limit direct effect pandem reli health emerg system hone ebola outbreak build stronger social system author argu build resili##### LEM_STEM: experi show strong function adapt adequ fund social system essenti cope neg impact crisi like covid thi case studi examin strength weak social system africa influenc respons differ countri note countri adequ social protect scheme countri limit direct effect pandem reli health emerg system hone ebola outbreak build stronger social system author argu build resili###################################### ##### ORIGINAL: The least developed countries (LDCs) are the furthest from achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They are also likely to be hit the hardest by the COVID-19 crisis and badly need the additional private finance that blended finance can unlock. Yet evidence shows that too little private finance is mobilised for investment in LDCs. How can this be fixed?The Blended Finance in the Least Developed Countries 2020 report is the third edition and second joint UNCDF-OECD report. It builds on UNCDF research and transactional experience, OECD data and analysis on private finance mobilized by official development finance, and a series consultations with and contributions by blended finance experts, LDC governments, UN missions, donors, civil society and research institutions. The report provides an update on the deployment of blended finance in LDCs. It also analyses its potential role in helping those countries recover from the COVID-19 crisis, and provides an Action Agenda for unlocking capital for the achievement of the SDGs in LDCs, as called for in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM: the developed countries ldcs furthest achieving sustainable development goals sdgs they likely hit hardest covid crisis badly need additional private finance blended finance unlock yet evidence shows little private finance mobilised investment ldcs how fixed the blended finance least developed countries report edition second joint uncdf oecd report builds uncdf research transactional experience oecd data analysis private finance mobilized official development finance series consultations contributions blended finance experts ldc governments missions donors civil society research institutions the report provides update deployment blended finance ldcs analyses potential role helping countries recover covid crisis provides action agenda unlocking capital achievement sdgs ldcs called agenda sustainable development addis ababa action agenda##### LEM_NO_STEM: the developed country ldcs furthest achieving sustainable development goal sdgs they likely hit hardest covid crisis badly need additional private finance blended finance unlock yet evidence show little private finance mobilised investment ldcs how fixed the blended finance least developed country report edition second joint uncdf oecd report build uncdf research transactional experience oecd data analysis private finance mobilized official development finance series consultation contribution blended finance expert ldc government mission donor civil society research institution the report provides update deployment blended finance ldcs analysis potential role helping country recover covid crisis provides action agenda unlocking capital achievement sdgs ldcs called agenda sustainable development addis ababa action agenda##### NO_LEM_STEM: the develop countri ldc furthest achiev sustain develop goal sdg they like hit hardest covid crisi badli need addit privat financ blend financ unlock yet evid show littl privat financ mobilis invest ldc how fix the blend financ least develop countri report edit second joint uncdf oecd report build uncdf research transact experi oecd data analysi privat financ mobil offici develop financ seri consult contribut blend financ expert ldc govern mission donor civil societi research institut the report provid updat deploy blend financ ldc analys potenti role help countri recov covid crisi provid action agenda unlock capit achiev sdg ldc call agenda sustain develop addi ababa action agenda##### LEM_STEM: the develop countri ldc furthest achiev sustain develop goal sdg they like hit hardest covid crisi badli need addit privat financ blend financ unlock yet evid show littl privat financ mobilis invest ldc how fix the blend financ least develop countri report edit second joint uncdf oecd report build uncdf research transact experi oecd data analysi privat financ mobil offici develop financ seri consult contribut blend financ expert ldc govern mission donor civil societi research institut the report provid updat deploy blend financ ldc analysi potenti role help countri recov covid crisi provid action agenda unlock capit achiev sdg ldc call agenda sustain develop addi ababa action agenda###################################### ##### ORIGINAL: The Decade of Action for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) starts with a crisis: as the COVID‑19 pandemic unfolds, progress toward the goals is in danger of slowing – and even reversing with poverty expected to rise for the first time in more than twenty years. The crisis has increased inequalities, and not all countries can raise the funds necessary on domestic or international markets to effectively respond and recover. Financing for the sustainable development of developing countries risks collapsing, with all resources available under stress, domestic and external, public and private. Even before COVID-19, financing for the SDGs was not enough. Now, external financing to developing countries could drop by an estimated USD 700 billion in 2020. Revenues will fall further than gross domestic product (GDP) (OECD, 2020[1]). The scissor effect of SDG financing – increasing needs and declining resources – has been magnified (). The USD 2.5 trillion annual SDG financing gap in developing countries is predicted to increase due to global economic uncertainty and an estimated USD 1 trillion gap in COVID-19 emergency and response spending in developing countries compared to OECD countries. As a result, the annual SDG financing gap in developing countries could increase by USD 1.7 trillion, i.e. about +70% in 2020. It is estimated that in addition to the USD 2.5 trillion annual SDG financing gap, developing countries as a whole would require an additional USD 1 trillion in recovery spending to match recovery spending carried out by OECD countries over the same period. Compounding the gap in both recovery spending and SDG financing, the report further estimates a potential drop of USD 700 billion in external private finance in 2020. These figures provide an order of magnitude of the growing financing needs and limitations to access financing in developing countries The estimation of additional recovery spending in developing countries to reach a similar magnitude of recovery spending in OECD countries, calculated on the basis of the recession as forecast at the time of this report’s publication.##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM:

These arrangements are a significant component of public-sector remuneration in many developing countries and they can carry substantial risks, not only financial but also political and social. This study takes a long-term and systemic approach to civil service pensions, charting their evolution as part of a country’s social protection provision and with reference to public-sector remuneration as well as broader institutional developments. It demonstrates the short- and long-term costs of these arrangements against spending on other social protection interventions, notably poverty-targeted social assistance. Through a series of case studies, it examines the motivation behind countries’ decision to reform their civil service schemes, as well as the challenges they faced when undertaking these reforms and their overall impact. The study is intended to support countries planning to reform their civil service pension schemes by identifying key principles and specific policies they might consider in this process; it can also support governments not planning such reforms to better understand the financial dynamics of their civil service schemes.##### NO_LEM_NO_STEM: this study examines reforms civil service pension arrangements number developing countries africa asia latin america these arrangements significant component public sector remuneration developing countries carry substantial risks financial political social this study takes long term systemic approach civil service pensions charting evolution country social protection provision reference public sector remuneration broader institutional developments demonstrates short long term costs arrangements spending social protection interventions notably poverty targeted social assistance through series case studies examines motivation countries decision reform civil service schemes challenges faced undertaking reforms overall impact the study intended support countries planning reform civil service pension schemes identifying key principles specific policies consider process support governments planning reforms better understand financial dynamics civil service schemes##### LEM_NO_STEM: this study examines reform civil service pension arrangement number developing country africa asia latin america these arrangement significant component public sector remuneration developing country carry substantial risk financial political social this study take long term systemic approach civil service pension charting evolution country social protection provision reference public sector remuneration broader institutional development demonstrates short long term cost arrangement spending social protection intervention notably poverty targeted social assistance through series case study examines motivation country decision reform civil service scheme challenge faced undertaking reform overall impact the study intended support country planning reform civil service pension scheme identifying key principle specific policy consider process support government planning reform better understand financial dynamic civil service scheme##### NO_LEM_STEM: thi studi examin reform civil servic pension arrang number develop countri africa asia latin america these arrang signific compon public sector remuner develop countri carri substanti risk financi polit social thi studi take long term system approach civil servic pension chart evolut countri social protect provis refer public sector remuner broader institut develop demonstr short long term cost arrang spend social protect intervent notabl poverti target social assist through seri case studi examin motiv countri decis reform civil servic scheme challeng face undertak reform overal impact the studi intend support countri plan reform civil servic pension scheme identifi key principl specif polici consid process support govern plan reform better understand financi dynam civil servic scheme##### LEM_STEM: thi studi examin reform civil servic pension arrang number develop countri africa asia latin america these arrang signific compon public sector remuner develop countri carri substanti risk financi polit social thi studi take long term system approach civil servic pension chart evolut countri social protect provis refer public sector remuner broader institut develop demonstr short long term cost arrang spend social protect intervent notabl poverti target social assist through seri case studi examin motiv countri decis reform civil servic scheme challeng face undertak reform overal impact the studi intend support countri plan reform civil servic pension scheme identifi key principl specif polici consid process support govern plan reform better understand financi dynam civil servic scheme
