a newly developed dualfunction ph and pco sensor was evaluated in this study the sensors were placed in the femoral arteries of dogs anesthetized with SP comparisons were made between systemic arterial ph and pco measured using the sensor and those measured from blood samples drawn at min intervals over a h period using a bench instrument the mean ph of the bench instrument measurements was the mean difference of the sensor measurements from the bench instrument measurements for comparisons was ph sd the mean pco of the bench instrument measurements was mmhg the mean difference of the sensor measurements from those of the bench instrument for comparisons was mmhg sd the sensors performed equally well in the presence of metabolic or respiratory acidosis and alkalosis the dualfunction sensors evaluated in this T0 are useful for trend monitoring of ph and pco over at least a h period without recalibration with improvement in the consistency of sensor construction these sensors will be reliable in vivo sensing devices for blood ph and pco and thus valuable research and clinical instruments the effect of insulininduced hypoglycemia on the blood levels of catecholamines and renin activity has been studied in five patients with moderate hypertension before and after treatment for months with penbutolol pen mg twice daily penbutolol caused no NC in fasting blood glucose level insulin o iu per kg body weight iv reduced blood gl concentration by approximately per cent after min both before and during treatment with penbutolol hypoglycemia prior to medication was accompanied by a marked increase in the production of adrenaline and a minor increase of noradrenaline in all five patients during treatment the response of adrenaline to hypoglycemia was reduced in four patients and the data was inconclusive in one basal renin activity was rather low in three patients within the normal range in one and relatively high in one before penbutolol the hypoglycemiainduced increase in catecholamine production caused no change in plasma renin activity in the three patients with low basal levels whereas a marked increase was observed in the other two during medication plasma renin activity remained unchanged on induction of hypoglycemia regardless of the catecholamine response despite the marked increase in plasma adrenaline following insulininduced hypoglycemia no statistically significant increase in pulse rate was recorded
