the jumping apparatus of the flea which includes highly modified direct and indirect flight muscles is described attention is drawn to the various specializations of the exoskeleton which stiffen the thorax and also provide the click mechanism triggering takeoff a fingerlike invagination of tall cells within the cavity of the developing pleural arch of the pharate ad secretes the resilin pad this is illustrated with coloured photographs it is suggested that winglessness of a mecopteranlike ancestor preadapted fleas to a parasitic lifestyle and that a jumping mode of progression was a primitive feature of the whole order scattered throughout the siphonaptera today are species which have secondarily lost the pleural arch and with it the power to execute large jumps these are usually found among fleas parasitizing mammals inhabiting caves subterranean burrows and runs high aerial nests and snow or icebound habitats large pleural arches are associated with fleas infesting large mobile hosts pulmonary edema due to disorders in alveolocapillary permeability or lesional are differentiated from hemodynamic pulmonary edema by the fact that they arise in spite of normal pulmonary capillary pressure pcp a hemodynamic study was carried out in cases of lesional pe the pcp was normal whatever the date of the examination and the gravity of the pe pah was only found in the presence of frank hypoxemia and disappeared with the correction of the latter if there was no hemodynamic profile due to pe itself its etiology sometimes induced a hyperkinetic or hypovolemic syndrome finally it was apparent that pcp was significantly higher although normal at the initial stage than t3 hours of pe that an elevation in pcp of only a few mm hg by the perfusion of colloids aggravated the pe that despite the normal value for the pcp dehydration evidently improved hematosis thus this t0 confirms that numerous cases of pe can occur while the pcp remains normal it also confirms the noxious nature of too abundant perfusions in these cases and the effectiveness of dehydration
