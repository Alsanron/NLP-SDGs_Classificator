in order to throw light on the problems related to the magnitude and the possibility of maintaining pressor response in the case of bilateral carotid occlusion bco acute experiments were carried out on heparinized cats in chloraloseurethane narcosis and spontaneous respiration the perfusion pressure in a hind leg autoperfused with a RP with a constant flow and the arterial blood pressure were recorded electromanometrically a T0 was made of the changes taking place under the effect of bco in the normal animal in animals in a haemorrhagic state after pharmacological alphaadrenergic blockade haemorrhage after alphaadrenergic blockade retransfusion of blood alphaadrenergic blocking agent and after local application of papaverine it was established that some of the AF determining the haemodynamic state of the organism such as blood volume arterial pressure vascular resistance cardiac SO etc are of great significance for the realization of the pressor response to bco but the haemodynamic state of the animal before the occlusion and the interactions between the abovementioned AF are decisive for the form magnitude and maintenance of the pressor response in bco washed cells of salmonella enteritidis harvested from a defined medium during logarithmic growth were subjected to starvation in ph PB at c viability was measured by slide cultures and plate counts the survival of cell suspensions equivalent to to mg dry wtml was influenced by cryptic growth the rate of cryptic growth assessed by SP counts increased with cell density and could not be alleviated by starvation with dialysis dialysis of the starving SC did retard the onset of cryptic growth but did not eliminate it indicating that the L1 substrates for regrowth were relatively C1 cellular components in phosphate buffer homologous HK cells allowed for the doubling of one s enteritidis cell cryptic growth was not observed when cells were starved on the surface of membrane filters or in suspensions equivalent to mug dry wtml cellsml similar halflife survival times were calculated for both these populations but the shape of their survival curves differed significantly these differences were attributed to stress factors encountered during cell preparation and during starvation the halflife survival time of s enteritidis starved at mug dry wtml was h in phosphate buffer h in endomethylenetetrahydrophthalic acid buffer and h in trishydroxymethylaminomethane buffer
