seven healthy males were studied during cycle ergometer exercise at and of vo max on three occasions when nhc nahco or caco as a control substance were administered in gelatin capsules double blind and in randomized order plasma growth hormone hgh la and hydrogen ion concentration h were measured at frequent intervals ammonium chloride produced highest blood h and nahco the lowest these differences were maintained during exercise and in recovery plasma lactic acid concentrations were similar at rest at vo max and recovery la was highest with nahco and lowest with nhc exercise stimulated hgh secretion in all studies and the elevation was proportional to the intensity of the exercise nhc caused a vl elevation of hgh at rest and vo max at vo max plasma hgh was significantly elevated to similar concentrations in all studies and at vo max hgh was highest with nahco an infusion of sodium llactate producing plasma lactate concentrations of mmoll did not influence hgh secretion exercise is a physiological stimulus to hgh secretion and the mechanism is independent of blood h and lactate concentrations the kinetics of the action of local anesthetics upon firefly luciferin and luciferase systems is presented clinical concentrations of local anesthetics inhibited this atpinduced luminescence in a dosedependent manner from the effects of temperature and ph upon the inhibitory action of the local anesthetics it is concluded that hydrophobic ligandenzyme interaction is the predominant cause of the inhibition but hydrophilic interaction also contributes to the inhibition to a lesser degree a molecular theory of anesthesia is outlined which postulates that release of electrostricted water molecules from the hydrophilic parts of the enzyme due to the protein conformational changes induced by anesthetics is the cause of the decreased luminescence a similar mechanism is expected to occur at the cm which probably dehydrates the sodium channel and suppresses the conductance of this ion across the membrane these events lead to a volume expansion of the total system and the system becomes reactive to a pressure which reverses the anesthesia by shifting the equilibrium to the nonanesthetized original volume the pressure antagonism of anesthesia can be explained by this overall volume expansion and not by a mere swelling of the cell membrane
