fiftyeight human isolates of bacteroides melaninogenicus from a variety of clinical infections and the rest from normal flora were studied for pigment production and ultraviolet light fluorescence and by forty biochemical and other tests including endproduct analysis by gasliquid chromatography in a number of instances tests were repeated several times and the results were reproducible agar plate dilution susceptibility tests were also performed to antimicrobial agents these strains could be reliably placed into three groups corresponding to the three subspecies described based on seven characteristics these included acid production in peptoneyeastglucose medium production of nbutyric acid from peptoneyeastglucose medium esculin hydrolysis ST hydrolysis indole production effect on milk and lipase production production of hydrogen gas in peptoneyeastfructose medium may be another distinguishing characteristic in GA there was not much difference in the susceptibility of the three groups to the various antimicrobial agents tested two strains had a MICs of penicillin g of and uml respectively three strains did not produce a black pigment in spite of prolonged incubation on bloodcontaining media human adenylate cyclase atp pyrophosphatelyase cyclizing ec has been studied in S9 of fat cell membranes ghosts as reported earlier under ordinary CA conditions mm atp mm mg degrees c min incubation the enzyme was activated fold by epinephrine in the presence of the gtp analog guanylylimidodiphosphate gmppnhp cooper b et al j clin invest basal activity was highest during the first min of incubation then slowed and was linear for at least the next min EN added CT was often without effect but sometimes maintained the initial high rate of basal activity gmppnhp alone produced inhibition lag of basal enzyme early in the incubation periods augmentation of epinephrine effect by gmppnhp which also proceeded after a brief min lag period was noted over a wide range of ATP atp concentrations gtp inhibited basal levels of the enzyme by about gtp also allowed expression of an EN effect but only in the sense that the hormone abolished the inhibition by gtp occasionally a slight stimulatory effect on epinephrine action was seen with gtp at high mg concentration greater than mm or elevated temperatures greater than degrees c gmppnhp CT G1 the enzyme maximal activity of human fat cell adenylate cyclase was seen at mm mg mm atp ph and degrees c in the presence of m gmppnhp under these conditions addition of epinephrine did not further enhance activity human fat cell adenylate cyclase of adults was insensitive to acth and glucagon even in the presence of gmppnhp
