the kinetics and cellular characteristics of immunosuppression in cbap x cblf mice during graftversushost gvh reaction induced with SP cells from either parental strain have been investigated effects on pfc responses to thymusdependent chicken red blood cells and independent levan antigens have been compared the unresponsive state which developed in gvh mice was expressed to comparable extent by their spleen cells following transfer to irradiated recipients furthermore gvh spleen cells suppressed normal spleen cells in a mixed transfer system but this effect was lost CR by day whereas the original donors or their cells were still totally refractory after days this active suppressor effect was found to be mediated by t cells of perental origin based on cell fractionation analysis and selective deletion of donor or host cells by alloimmune attack the delayed transfer of gvh cells to irradiated repopulated recipients challenged with antigen indicated that suppressor t cells exert an antimitotic influence on antigenstimulated bcell proliferation supplementation of macrophagedepleted antithetatreated gvh spleen cells with purified normal TA demonstrated that b cells in gvh mice are normally reactive even when active suppression by t cells is no longer demonstrable the likelihood that this later phase of immunosuppression is attributable to another mechanism is discussed studied were bacteriologically a total of birds affected with acute mareks disease broilers growing layers and adult layers as well as healthy control birds of the same three categories a chemical analysis was performed of the red and white meat of of the diseased pullets and of the diseased AD layers as well as of of the affected broilers the investigation included the same numbers of the control birds extractions of the sampled meat were studied in terms of catalase number ph value and peroxydase activity it was found that enterobacteria in the viscera of the diseased birds were three to nine times more frequently encountered than in the same organs of the controls in two cases salmonella bacteria were also isolated from the affected chickens in three cases there were enterobacteria in the red musculature of these birds the meat of the diseased birds had higher water content higher catalase number and ph value with lower contents of proteins fats and mineral matter the only exception was the red meat of these birds which had higher content of crude protein as compared with the red meat of the normal birds
