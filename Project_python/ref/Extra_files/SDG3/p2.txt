the effect of somatic afferent c fiber stimulation on regional cbf blood flow rcbf and cerebral tissue available oxygen ao was studied in dogs under chloralose anesthesia mean arterial blood pressure arterial pco and ph were stabilized before and during the min stimulation of the sciatic sn v ms hz combined goldplatinum electrodes were chronically implanted into the vpl of the th ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and into the vwm tissue ao and rcbf of these regions were measured polarographically the latter by the hgas clearance technique blood flow changed from to ml g per min cvr cvr from to resistance units ru in the th from to ml g per min cvr from to ru in the hypothalamus and from to ml g per min cvr from to ru in the vwm during ipsilateral stimulation contralateral stimulation of the sciatic nerves caused a more moderate but likewise significant drop in rcbf and an increase in cvr except in the vwm parallel to these changes tissue ao decreased by in the thalamic and by in the thy area relative to the prestimulation level in acute and chronic experiments investigations were made concerning the effect of clozapine haloperidol sulpiride and carpipramine on mhpg hva and hiaa in rat brain and on motor activity of the animals the activity of the rats treated with clozapine and haloperidol was reduced on the first day after days of treatment this effected of clozapine was significantly diminished the mhpg level increased slightly on the first day of treatment with all four drugs this elevation was maintained after chronic treatment with carpipramine and sulpiride whereas clozapine and haloperidol decreased the mhpg content hiaa values did not show significant changes in acute experiments whereas in chronic ones there was an increase haloperidol and clozapine induced a strong increase of hva which decreased t3 days in those animals treated with haloperidol in comparison to haloperidol t3 clozapine application the percentage of hvaincrease was higher in the limbic system than in the nigrostriatum
