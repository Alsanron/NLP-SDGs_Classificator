oxygen utilization vo and lactate production by an isolated perfused canine hindlimb was evaluated at various hydrogen ion concentrations a membrane lung perfusion system was established such that blood flow and temperature could be fixed at normal levels oxygen nitrogen and carbon dioxide co gas flows to the membrane lung were independently regulated to provide a fixed arterial oxygen content cao by changing co flow the ph of the arterial blood was varied between and at min intervals the mean o delivery cao x blood flow was between ml omin and ml omin standard error of the mean in each dog however was less than ml omin vo was linearly related to the ph of the perfusing blood vo ph r oxygen consumption was inversely related to pco vo pco but the correlation was less good r lactate production was linearly related to the ph of the perfusing blood above a ph of lactate produced ph r at a ph below lactate was not produced oxygen consumption of skeletal muscle appears critically dependent on ecf ph a change in ph of alters vo almost exactly alkalosis is a potent stimulus to la production by skeletal muscle this t0 has investigated the relationship between duodenogastric reflux gastritis and certain ps months t3 three operations for uncomplicated duodenal ulcer the operations studied were proximal gastric vagotomy pgv cases tv and pyloroplasty tvp cases and tv and antrectomy tva cases duodenogastric reflux was assessed both by a radiological technique and by measuring the concentration of bilirubin in the gastric aspirate before and after operation incidence and severity of postoperative gastritis were determined by endoscopic biopsy ps were assessed by symptomatic score and visick grading there was a significant correlation between duodenal reflux and histological evidence of both severe sg and glandular atrophy p less than there was also a close association between the degree of reflux and the presence of severe heartburn epigastric pain and bile vomiting after operation the amount of reflux did not differ before t0 there was significantly less reflux following pgv than after either tvp p less than or tva p less than the results indicate that an operation which preserves an innervated and in antrum and pylorus will protect against postoperative duodenogastric reflux gastritis and symptoms
