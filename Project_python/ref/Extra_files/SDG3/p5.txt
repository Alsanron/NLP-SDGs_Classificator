the differences between the results of controlled clinical research and the experiences of the practitioners can be attributed to a certain extent to the artificiality of the setting in which controlled studies are performed the system developed in the wards of the department of psychopharmacology of the institute of psychiatry in prague is an attempt to overcome some of these difficulties certain similarities exist between this system called continuous controlled trial and silent trial proposed by ross et al the main characteristics of the system are all patients admitted to the ward are assigned to the trial without exception the trial goes on continuously without interruption for more than years except that the patients do not know the quality of drugs administered they do not realize any difference between this research setting and the usual routine treatment the advantages of this system are reduction of artificiality the possibility to perform early PCTs in controlled conditions and to shorten the usual threephase testing of a new drug the possibility to perform longterm longitudinal studies with individual patients admitted several times in doubleblind conditions  the effect of nadp on lightinduced steadystate redox changes of MB cytochromes was investigated in membrane fragements prepared from the bluegreen algae nostoc muscorum CS that had high rates of electron transport from water to nadp and from an artificial electron donor reduced dichlorophenolindophenol dciph to ndap the membrane fragments contained very little PC and had excellent optical properties for spectrophotometric assays with dciph as the electron donor nadp had no effect on the lightinduced redox changes of cytochromes with or without nadp or nm illumination resulted mainly in the oxidation of cytochrome f and of other components which may include a ctype cytochrome with an alpha peak at nm with nm illumination and water as the electron donor nadp had a pronounced effect on the redox state of cytochromes causing a shift toward oxidation of a component with a peak at nm possibly a ctype cytochrome cytochrome f and particularly cytochrome b cytochrome b appeared to be a component of the main noncyclic electron transport chain and was photooxidized at physiological temperatures by PS ii this photooxidation was apparent only in the presence of a terminal acceptor nadp for the electron flow from water
