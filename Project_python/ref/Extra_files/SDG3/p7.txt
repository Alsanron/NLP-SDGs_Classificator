volatiles of which nh is a major component were evolved from decomposing immature corn tissue cn and affected r solani in culture two ways they supplied additional nitrogen to the growth medium so that fungal mycelial growth increased and they raised atp ph from to which induced melanization of mycelium volatiles increased fungus growth and pigmentation within weeks of amendment addition to soil increases were concomitant with nh production from corn tissue more nh evolved from decomposing corn tissues of cn and than from those of cn and more growth and pigmentation occurred in flasks through which volatiles from decomposing corn cn were passed than in flasks through which volatiles from nonamended soil or decomposing corn cn were passed carbon dioxide from decomposing tissues did not affect growth or pigmentation twice as much nh evolved from corn tissue cn which decomposed in saturated soil than from tissue which decomposed in soil at of its waterholding capacity pigment production doubled under saturated conditions total body potassium has been estimated in hypertensive patients who were hypokalaemic as a result of longterm chlorthalidone treatment mean months while they were on chlorthalidone and weeks after this had been discontinued the mean difference amounted to only meq not significant in additional patients not previously treated with chlorthalidone serial total body potassium estimations revealed a mean potassium deficiency of meq t3 days and of meq t3 days these results suggest that the mechanism causing the initial potassium loss is partly reversed or compensated later on in patients with uncomplicated hypertension no significant potassium deficiency was detected during longterm treatment eighteen of our patients received meq potassium chloride supplements daily for weeks this caused a mean rise in sk from meql to meql not significant tb potassium did not nc at all we conclude that potassium chloride supplements are not an erp treatment of hypokalaemia in this condition correction of the extracellular ph by ammonium chloride in patients on chlorthalidone who demonstrated a slight metabolic alkalosis gave rise to a mean increase in plasma potassium from meql to meql not significant the hypokalaemia in ht on lt chlorthalidone treatment cannot be explained by either a potassium deficiency or the change in extracellular ph
