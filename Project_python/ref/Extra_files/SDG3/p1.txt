the addition of spermine or of spermidine to rat CL CA systems produced marked changes in a number of microsomal drug oxidations the hydroxylation of aniline and the ndemethylation of ethylmorphine were both enhanced with concentrations of mm spermine or of spermidine the results with putrescine on ethylmorphine metabolism were less dramatic and no effect could be observed with putrescine in studies with other drug substrates in contrast to the enhancing effects inhibition was observed when spermine or SD was added to pnitroanisole odemethylation CA mixtures and no effect was observed in assays for acetanilide hydroxylation the inhibiting and enhancing effects of the polyamines can be observed in assays containing liver S9 from both male and female rats and those from rats pretreated with phenobarbital or methylcholanthrene in all studies the alterations were kinetically noncompetitive the effects were shown to be independent of the nadphgenerating system and the cation requirements and were not mediated through an interaction with nadphcytochrome c reductase the possibility is considered that the enhancing and inhibiting effects may be related to the ability of these polycations to bind to microsomal membranes and cause alterations at different sites of substrate interaction the synergistic effects of four SU substitutes polysorbate and five artificial sweeteners were studied in vitro on growth pattern and acid production of seven glucosegrown streptococcus mutans strains representing the five serological groups after bratthall four distinct growth patterns during glucose fermentation were observed high rate of growth with low acid production moderate growth rate with moderate acid production moderate growth rate with high acid production and slow rate of growth with moderate acid production depending on the strain used the final od at nm ranged from to and the final ph of the medium varied between and while added sucrose substitutes with exceptions usually enhanced growth rate most artificial sweeteners suppressed or at higher concentrations even inhibited growth of s mutans addition of polysorbate to the medium always increased growth rate of s mutans significantly the presence of sucrose substitutes during glucose fermentation had no effect on final ph of the medium but addition of artificial sweeteners especially sodium saccharin elevated final ph up to units the observed physiological patterns and differences within the several strains of s mutans during glucose fermentation in vitro do not necessarily relate to the five serological groups of the species
