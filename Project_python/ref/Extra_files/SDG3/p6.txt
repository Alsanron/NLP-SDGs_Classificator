the relationship between respiratory insufficiency expressed by gas tensions in blood and bone marrow and haematologic adaptation has been studied in men with CB and persistent breathlessness for at least one year for the group as a whole and for various subgroups a linear correlation was demonstrated between arterial hypoxia and hb concentration haematocrit blood volume hb mass and erythrocyte volume respectively the increase in hb concentration compensated for the fall in arterial oxygen saturation only for one subgroup with a ph difference between arterial and venous blood larger than or equal to was no correlation found between the degree of hypoxia and hb concentration the haematologic parameters correlated significantly better with arterial oxygen tensions than with oxygen tensions in the bone marrow there was no indication that decreased oxygen supply to the bone marrow led to the increased erythrocyte and hb production in patients with arterial hypoxia caused by chronic bronchitis nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy has been used to T0 a fully AS e coli fluorotyrosine alkaline phosphatase the fluorotyrosine resonances provide sensitive probes of the conformational states of the protein they were used to follow the addition of zinc or cobalt to the apoprotein and the titration of the protein with inorganic phosphate or the inhibitor hydroxynitrobenzylphosphonate the results indicate that molecules of inorganic phosphate per dimer of alkaline phosphatase are required to CR a GA conformational NC in the protein involving perturbations to the environment of several tyrosines spectra of the cobalt enzyme indicate that on specific tyrosine per subunit may be near the metal site the f nmr results combined with the p nmr results in the accompanying paper lead directly to the conclusion that dissociation of noncovalently bound inorganic phosphate from the enzyme is the ratelimiting process in enzyme catalysis at high ph the local environment of the individual fluorotyrosines is also discussed
