in rat liver cells isolated by perfusion in the perfusion in the presence of MMP-8 the L1 portion of cytochrome p is present in the oxidized nonsubstratebound low spin state drug addition to a suspension of CL cells results in the rapid formation of the cytochrome p fesubstrate complex which in turn is followed by the appearance of other species with different spectral characteristics before steady state drug monooxygenation is achieved cytochrome plinked metabolism of various tested drugs and carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons by isolated rat liver cells is as fast or faster as with rat liver microsomes supplemented with a nadph generating system both experimental models respond similarily to phenobarbital or methylcholanthrene i.c.v. of the animals and to various of the wellknown inhibitors of drug metabolism except with liver cells isolated from fasted phenobarbitaltreated rats generation of cytosolic nadph seems sufficient to support optimal drug metabolism even in the absence of added substrates of intermediary metabolism in isolated CL cells oxidized drug metabolites undergo subsequent metabolic conversion most often to form the corresponding glucuronides and sulphates these are readily excreted whereas nonconjugated products eg free phenols tend to accumulate intracellularly cellular glucuronide formation is strongly inhibited by ethanolpresumably due to an unfavorable effect of the increased nadhnad ratio on the synthesis of uridinediphosphoglucuronic acid udpga in contrast low concentrations of ethanol have no or only a slight stimulatory effect on the cytochrome plinked step of drug metabolism and there are indications that the oxidation of low concentrations of ethanol is in fact stimulated by a facilitated reoxidation of cytosolic nadh occuring during drug monooxygenation
