boys and years with unilateral or bl undescended testes or anorchia were studied retention was severe canalicular or ia in and moderate in of the cases in unilateral retention the volume of the scrotal testis was usually normal throughout childhood whereas pubertal testicular growth was delayed in unilateral anorchia the scrotal testis showed compensatory hypertrophy in all age groups examined the mean volume of the undescended testes was abnormally small undescended testes were accompanied by abnormalities of the epididymis in of cases of the ductus deferens in and of the spermatic vessels in in anorchia such abnormalities were found regularly inguinal hernia accompanied of the undescended testes and was most frequent in severe cases patients aged years with unilateral undescended testis had t3 ba cytogenic investigations of patients revealed one case of klinefelters syndrome xxy gonadotrophin treatment was tried in patients and was succesful in surgical results were satisfactory in of the operated testes comparative studies of protein structure and function can be quite interesting by themselves and even more interesting when interpreted with respect to an animals physiology in the case of fish hemoglobins some success in the latter has been achieved but there are still many unsolved problems it appears that comparative physiology and biochemistry have entered an era where results from comparative studies can shed a great deal of light on biochemical mechanisms in ga the trout hemoglobin system is an example distinctive hemoglobins in this system are presently being used as high resolution probes of the ligandbinding mechanism characterization of the multiple structurally distinct subunits of the s limulus hemocyanin molecule may similarly aid in understanding its cf our studies suggest the possibility of using limulus hemocyanin and other hemocyanins as structural homologs and analogs of more complex macromolecular arrays the rapid development of molecular structural data from xray crystallographers combined with the vast data of comparative physiology and biochemistry makes this one of the most exciting areas in present day science
