amino acid concentrations were determined in plasma whole blood csf fluid and brain tissue of patients with grade or coma due to fulminant hepatic failure the concentration of of the amino acids determined were significantly increased in blood and the increases were greatest for the amino acids concerned with neurotransmitter metabolism there was no rho however between the plasma concentration of these amino acids and changes in the grade of hepatic coma the plasma concentrations of the branched chain amino acids were normal except in those patients who subsequently recovered in whom levels were slightly decreased phenylalanine tyrosine and methionine were among the out of amino acids which were significantly increased in cerebrospinal fluid and among the out of amino acids which were significantly increased in the bb the increase in tryptophan was associated with a significant elevation in brain hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration suggesting an increase in hydroxytryptamine turnover in hepatic coma bb to plasma ratios of most amino acids in hepatic coma patients were similar to control subjects suggesting that plasma concentration is the main factor controlling the cerebral concentration however for the branched chain amino acids csf fluid and brain concentrations were increased when plasma concentrations were normal suggesting an increase in bb uptake in adults of both sexes the influence on the basal and the maximal by means of pg stimulated gastric secretion of a single i.v. of mg to mgkg oxyfedrine or of two intramuscular i.v. of mg to mgkg or of mg to mgkg in each case isoproterenol consecutively administered at an interval of minutes was studied at a dose which evokes cardiovascular responses isoproterenol does not produce a significant nc of the sec rates of h c na k ca and mg or of the ionic composition of gastric juice both during basal and maximal acid output oxyfedrine shows only during maximal acid stimulation some effects on gastric secretion a significant rise of the concentration and sec rate of h and of the secretory rate of c and a significant decline of the concentration of na and of both the concentration and secretory rate of mg betaadrenergic receptors seem not to play any part in the regulation of the production of gastric juice possibly the action of oxyfedrine on the stimulated gm may be mediated by a stimulation of alphaadrenergic receptors or by inhibition of the activity of ampphosphodiesterase
