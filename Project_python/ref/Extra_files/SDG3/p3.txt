the cardiovascular effects of halothanenitrous oxide anesthesia and betareceptor blockade with either propranolol or practolol were studied in dogs in which severe myocardial infarction had been induced ten days earlier the hemodynamic responses to blood loss amounting to per cent of estimated blood volume and its subsequent replacement were studied before and after induction of betareceptor blockade in terms of cardiac so and aortic blood flow acceleration cardiac performance in the absence of betablockade was markedly impaired during steadystate anesthesia compared with corresponding values in normal dogs practolol mgkg administered during anesthesia induced no significant circulatory change other than a per cent decrease in heart rate and a per cent increase in strode volum propranolol mgkg caused a comparable reduction of heart rate but significantly reduced cardiac output per cent aortic blood flow acceleration per cent and peak lv sp per cent and increased systemic v1 resistance per cent the two drugs caused comparable shifts of the isoproterenol doseresponse curve during anesthesia graduated blood loss during anesthesia to a total of per cent of blood volume caused consistent circulatory changes decreased mean arterial pressure cardiac output peak lv power lv minute work that were essentially similar before and t3 betareceptor blockade with either propranolol or practolol the positive inotropic effect of calcium gluconate during hal anesthesia was significantly reduced following either propranolol or practolol but the hemodynamic responses to changes of systemic v1 resistance induced with acetylcholine or phenylephrine were not modified by betareceptor blockade
