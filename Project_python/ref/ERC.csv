The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented shock that reveals varying levels of resilience of increasingly interconnected food systems across the globe. We contribute to the ongoing debate about whether increased connectivity reduces or enhances resilience in the context of rural Pacific food systems, while examining how communities have adapted to the global shocks associated with the pandemic to ensure food security. We conducted 609 interviews across 199 coastal villages from May to October 2020 in Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu to understand community-level impacts and adaptations during the first 5–10 months of the COVID-19 crisis. We found that local food production practices and food sharing conferred resilience, and that imported foods could aid or inhibit resilience. Communities in countries more reliant on imports were almost twice as likely to report food insecurity compared to those least reliant. However, in places dealing with a concurrent cyclone, local food systems were impaired, and imported foods proved critical. Our findings suggest that policy in the Pacific should bolster sustainable local food production and practices. Pacific states should avoid becoming overly reliant on food imports, while having measures in place to support food security after disasters, supplementing locally produced and preserved foods with imported foods when necessary. Developing policies that promote resilient food systems can help prepare communities for future shocks, including those anticipated with climate change. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Coronavirus; Disaster; Food security; Resilience; Small-scale fisheries; Traditional knowledge and practices,

This paper examines trends in pastoralist livelihoods, perceptions and aspirations of pastoralists in a setting where a new communal property rights framework is in the early stages of implementation. The study was carried out in Dirre, a grazing unit of the Borana Zone in Ethiopia. It employed a mixed methods approach that included key informant interviews, focus group discussions, a workshop, a household survey and feedback sessions. The findings show that current livestock herd sizes make it difficult for pastoralists to rely only on livestock keeping, and have necessitated diversification. Crop production is increasingly becoming an alternative livelihood source, and most respondents reported wanting to expand their farms. Pastoralists also expect land certification to help secure land rights and enable better management of rangelands. However, there is also a widely held view that by providing security, certification will also make it easier for them to continue diversifying their livelihoods. This suggests that communal land certification is not likely to end the push to individualization of land and the transition to agropastoralism; it may even accelerate it. The strengthening of communal land rights can thus be used to guide this transition so that it represents a reorganization rather than a collapse of pastoralism. The focus of formalizing land rights for pastoralists should not be saving pastoralism or reversing the agropastoralist trend, but rather securing land rights to enhance the pastoralists’ capacity to make sound livelihood decisions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Agropastoralism; Land certification; Land rights; Livelihoods; Livestock; Pastoralism,certification; land rights; land tenure; livelihood; livestock; pastoralism; Borana; Ethiopia

A 12-month study was conducted from January to December 2020 on the effects of six grazing intensities sites (overgrazed (OG), heavily grazed (HG), moderately grazed (MG), moderately to lightly grazed (M-LG), lightly grazed (LG) and no grazing (NG)) on RS on. A camera trap was used to monitor the total number of animals at each site, indicating the grazing intensity. Weekly measurements of RS were taken using static greenhouse gas chambers along with simultaneous measurements of soil temperature (TS) and volumetric soil water content (WS) (depth of 5 cm). Mean RS at HG, MG, M-LG and LG sites was approximately 15–25% higher than at NG and OG sites (p &lt; 0.001). Mean WS increased with decrease in grazing especially in the dry season, while TS increased with increase in grazing. We observed bimodal temporal variation in RS and WS due to two wet seasons in the year. Thus, variation in RS across the study period followed the changes in WS rather than those in TS. Mean values of RS in the wet seasons were significantly higher (&gt; 45%) than those in the dry seasons, and WS accounted for 71% of the temporal variability in RS (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI, interpreted as a proxy for vegetation cover) explained 60% of the variance of RS, and WS and EVI together explained 75%. EVI showed a negative relationship (p &lt; 0.05) with animal intensity, indicating that more grazing reduced vegetation cover and, consequently, soil organic carbon and biomass. Soil bulk density was lower at less grazed sites. While RS variability was unaffected by total nitrogen content, pH, and texture, correspondence analysis demonstrated that the main factors influencing RS dynamics across the year under different grazing intensities were WS and vegetation cover. Our results contribute to closing the existing knowledge gap regarding the effects of grazing intensity on RS in East Africa savannas. Therefore, this information is of great importance in understanding carbon cycling in savanna grassland, as well as the identification of the potential consequences of increasing land pressure caused by rising livestock numbers, and will assist in the development of climate-smart livestock management in East Africa. © 2021 The Authors",Grassland management; Soil respiration; Soil temperature; Soil water content; Sub-Saharan Africa,carbon dioxide; greenhouse gas; land use; livestock; livestock farming; savanna; vegetation cover; wild population; Kenya; Varanidae

We explored the genetic control of three major organoleptic and ripening-related traits, namely pulp acidity (pH), firmness (PF) and dry matter content (DMC), over a 7-day ripening period and three production cycles in a banana segregating population genotyped by sequencing. Significant broad-sense heritabilities were estimated with 0.77, 0.46 and 0.81 values for pH, PF and DMC, respectively. QTL detection was first performed on the whole dataset to analyze their dynamics. In a second approach, per-cycle data were considered to evaluate the stability across production cycles. Finally, a meta-analysis was performed. Various QTLs were detected, as well as many QTL colocalizations, while 12 of these QTLs were more prominent as they were detected in several approaches and/or explained over 15.0% of the phenotypic variation. Candidate genes were proposed for 10 of these QTLs. The QTL with the largest contribution to pulp acidity (R2 = 19.3–50.6%) was located on LG1_7 on the genetic map of Pisang Madu, i.e. a parent that is closely related to Cavendish, the world's most cultivated dessert banana cultivar group. This QTL is located on a chromosome derived from a reciprocal translocation that does not recombine in Pisang Madu, which is a favorable context for molecular marker monitoring. These first results will provide a relevant basis for marker-assisted selection in banana improvement programs. © 2021",Dry matter content; Dynamic QTL; Musa; Organoleptic banana quality; Pulp acidity; Pulp firmness,breeding; detection method; food quality; genetic analysis; genotype; ripening

It evaluated different scenarios using ZPLAN+ software to maximize the genetic gain, discounted profit and to determine the optimum size of the base population for a community-based breeding program (CBBP) nucleus. The study analyzed the different combinations of objective traits in the index, assessed the effect of changing the breeding buck to doe ratio, evaluated the impact of improved kid survival, and determined the optimum size of the base population for a CBBP. A two-tier breeding program based on 577 does in the CBBP and 1,006 does in the surrounding base flocks was assumed, where selected CBBP bucks were disseminated to the base populations. Combining the weight of kids at six months (SMWT) and the lactation milk yield of dams (LMY) in the selection index resulted in a genetic gain doe−1 generation−1 of 0.13 kg, 0.58 kg, 0.02 and 0.004 for SMWT, LMY, the number of kids that survived to market age (NKS) and the number of kids born (NKB), respectively. This also generated a total discounted profit of US$5.76 doe−1 over 10 year investment period. This result was 30 percent higher than when LMY was evaluated separately and 225.7 percent higher than when SMWT was evaluated separately. The addition of NKB and NKS traits in the selection index did not significantly change the genetic progress and the profit. However, further optimization of the combined SMWT and LMY by improving mating ratio only, and a combined improvement in mating ratio and kid survival rate resulted in a substantial increase in profit to US$11.13 doe−1 and US$15.58 doe−1, respectively over 10 year investment period. The maximum discounted profit was attained when the base population size was 3,579 breeding does. This resulted in accumulated total profit of US$14,776 over the 10 year investment period. A two-tier dispersed CBBP with a unit size of about 577 does in the nucleus and 3,579 does in the base is recommended. In Borana goat community-breeding program, breeding buck need to be selected using an index combining at least own live weight and dam milk yield performance. Essential requirements for ensuring the sustainability of such programs are also discussed in the paper. © 2021 The Author(s)",Breeding objective; Economic benefit; Economic value; Genetic gain; Goat meat; Goat milk,animal experiment; article; body weight; breeding; buck (mammal); controlled study; Ethiopia; genetic gain; goat milk; human; investment; lactation; male; mating; milk yield; nonhuman; population size; profit; survival rate

Systematic empirical evidence on the effects of social globalisation on democracy is absent. This article intends to fill this gap. Social globalisation is disaggregated into interpersonal, information and cultural globalisation. I apply the generalised method of moments estimation and analyse democracies encompassing the periods 1970–1991 and 1991–2017. The results indicate that the democratic qualities affected by social globalisation are freedom of expression, equal access and protection, and the quality of elections. The moderating effect of a given country’s democracy stock has been confirmed across different estimations. However, and especially during the post–Cold War period, younger and older democracies benefit equally from the increased spread of information caused by globalisation with regard to equal access. Equally, both categories experience similar challenges with the rise of interpersonal globalisation in terms of the quality of elections. © The Author(s) 2021.",cultural globalisation; democratic qualities; generalised method of moments; information globalisation; interpersonal globalisation; time-series cross-sectional analysis,democracy; economic integration; election; globalization; post-Cold War; time series analysis

Autocratisation – the transition from a competitive political system to a regime dominated by a single political force – is a challenging effort for an incumbent and involves interventions in three ‘arenas’ to achieve (a) public legitimation, (b) institutional reforms increasing political repression and (c) mass-scale co-optation. Focusing on Slovakia and Belarus in the 1990s, where autocratisation efforts failed and succeeded respectively, the article finds that co-optation plays a catalytic role in helping the incumbent pass institutional reforms and escalate repression without risking de-legitimation. In Belarus, co-optation engulfed society and the economy whereas, in Slovakia, a socioeconomic environment with greater autonomy from government limited the scope for co-optation. The Slovak opposition was able to find the resources and supporters necessary to fight back against the incumbent. © The Author(s) 2021.",Belarus; clientelism; competitive authoritarianism; democratic backsliding; electoral authoritarianism; populism,

Supply shortfalls created an opportunity to develop the aquaculture sector in Zambia, which is now one of the largest producers of farmed fish (Tilapia spp.) on the continent. In its present form, the aquaculture sector exhibits a dichotomy. It comprises, on the one hand, a smallholder sector that mainly produces for and supplies within local markets, and on the other hand, a burgeoning larger-scale commercial sector consisting of a small number of pioneering lead firms who are (re)shaping how the value chain supplies domestic, mainly urban, markets. A notable challenge confronting the development of the aquaculture value chain in Zambia is ensuring that the larger-scale commercial sector can continue to grow and generate economic benefits for the country, while simultaneously safeguarding inclusive and sustainable growth of smallholder production systems. An in-depth, mixed-methods aquaculture value chain study was carried out in Zambia in 2017 that aimed at providing relevant stakeholders with pertinent information on the value chain's contribution to economic growth and its inclusiveness, as well as its social and environmental sustainability aspects. In this article, we present some key findings from the study to shed light on how the sustainability of smallholder production systems could be enhanced while preserving the growth trend of larger producers in an inclusive way. The study found that the value chain is contributing positively towards economic growth in the country. Smallholder farmers classified as “semi-subsistence” and “commercial” face several albeit somewhat different constraints to production, thus influencing their “sustainability” status. Semi-subsistence smallholders achieve positive (yet negligible) profit margins, and their production system is not environmentally sustainable and the value chain that supports them performs sub-optimally on several social markers. The “commercial” smallholder system is more economically viable and environmentally sustainable. The study juxtaposes these findings with those from the analysis of larger pond and cage-based systems to point to a set of key options Government, research, and development organisations could consider to support smallholder farmers and enhance the sustainability of the semi-subsistence smallholder production system in particular, without overlooking the whole system. © 2021 The Authors",Cages; Ponds; Smallholder; Tilapia; Value chain,aquaculture production; detection method; economic growth; smallholder; sustainability; Zambia; Tilapia

This is important to achieve value for money and adoption of selectively improved fish, and an essential foundation for effective contributions of genetic improvements to farming system. Data on fish trait preferences of smallholder farmers are rare; when these do exist, there is no information on whether the preferences of men and women are similar or not. The present work reports the first gender-disaggregated study of trait preferences of men and women from farming households for rohu carp (L. rohita) in Bangladesh (288 respondents) and India (270 respondents), addressing a major segment of aquaculture production in south Asia. The paper generates a nuanced, novel, and comparative understanding of the preferred characteristics through a survey of smallholder farmers that: 1) uses open-ended questions relating to producer and consumer perspectives; and, 2) applies a stated choice experiment using 1000minds software to address trade-offs in choices between traits for a subset of (58–38) respondents. General preferences derived from expressed likes or dislikes emphasized the importance of good taste, characteristics indicating freshness and safety such as aspects of appearance and color, as expected for a perishable product, and of value for money, including size of fish or relative flesh quantity. The overall pattern of preferences were similar for men and women, but there were differences in that men focused more on economic-related characteristics and women more on characteristics associated with nutritional value and food safety. When producers identified what to improve, they focused on larger size fish, reduced culture period, fry survival and disease resistance. When choosing between traits in pair-wise comparison exercises, ranking of traits was similar for both men and women in both Bangladesh and India. Significant differences were only observed between genders for the lower ranked traits in Bangladesh. Larger size fish as a charateristic ranked first in all groups, but there were marked differences between the importance of price and taste in the two countries. Methodologically, the study demonstrated that general preferences, do not automatically translate into characteristics for improvement by breeding programs, and the latter were not necessarily an accurate guide to the preferences expressed when specific tradeoffs were considered. These findings emphasize the need for well-designed and targeted surveys to be able to accurately define trait preferences, in particular to identify the relative values of heritable traits for practical application in breeding programs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",1000minds; Gender; L. rohita; Rohu; Selective breeding; Trait preferences,aquaculture production; cyprinid; farming system; household survey; selective breeding; smallholder; trade-off; Bangladesh; India

However, environmental dimensions have no specific reference across the SDG 16 targets and indicators. In achieving SDG 16—the realization of peace, justice, and strong institution, polycentric environmental governance involving multiple actors across scales deserves thoughtful consideration. This study illustrates the potential of a polycentric approach to environmental governance in achieving SDG 16, using case studies of forest, watershed, and transboundary bushland and seascape management in Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa, namely Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Kenya–Somalia cross-border. By highlighting four key elements of polycentric governance namely, political will, legal framework, support from higher-level governance and capacity building, the case studies demonstrate that polycentric governance play a significant role in achieving three environment-relevant SDG 16 targets, yet these targets are silent about environmental governance dimensions. Since many conflicts arise from the environment and natural resources sector, we suggest that (i) polycentric environmental governance be strongly pursued to achieve SDG 16, and (ii) SDG 16 includes indicators specifically directed on polycentric environment and natural resource governance. © 2022 by the authors.

Using the Netherlands and Japan as examples, we investigate the following questions: 1) How do governance cultures allow or restrict opportunities for the participatory exploration of futures using games? 2) How does, and can, the game sector in a given context support anticipatory gaming? 3) How do dominant societal relationships with games limit, and offer opportunities for, gaming for anticipatory governance? © 2021 The Authors",Anticipatory governance; Foresight; Futures; Games; Simulation,

This work aimed at profiling mineral content of okra in four refugee camps and settlements located in Ethiopia and Uganda and its contribution to adequate intake (AIs) or recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for young children and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). The study also evaluated the applicability of portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) as compared with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for mineral profiling of okra powder samples. The contents of minerals (mg kg−1) from the ICP-MS readings were in the following ranges: K (14,385–33,294), Ca (2610–14,090), P (3178–13,248), Mg (3896–7986), Cu (3.81–19.3), Fe (75.7–1243), Zn (33–141) and Mn (23.1–261). Regardless of geographic origin, at low-end consumption probability (17 g day−1 for young children and 68 g day−1 for PLW), okra could contribute ˂ 15% (2.7–12.9%) AI for macro-minerals (K and Ca). In addition, the contributions to RDA values for Fe and Zn, elements of known public health interest, ranged from 4.5 to 34.7% for young children. Interestingly, regression lines revealed strong agreement between ICP-MS and PXRF readings for Mn and Zn, with R2 values &gt; 0.91.

Conservation practices were dictated by farming system and agroecological conditions. The long-term mean length of dry period when multipliers must conserve seeds ranged between 103 and 131 days across sites. Seed multipliers faced high uncertainty of rainfall onset that varied from the end of February to mid-May. Estimated probabilities of moderate and severe droughts affecting seed conservation ranged from 36–75%, and 15–58%, respectively.

Groups included NemoFl controls and three NemobeKO groups: One untreated, and two treated with simvastatin or exercise. Social preference and nesting were impaired in NemobeKO mice and were not countered by treatments. Cerebrovascular function was compromised in NemobeKO groups regardless of treatment, with decreased changes in sensory-evoked cerebral blood flow and total hemoglobin levels, and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. NemobeKO mice had increased string vessel pathology, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuroinflammation, and reduced cortical somatostatin-containing interneurons. These alterations were reversed when endothelial function was recovered. Findings strongly suggest that damage to the cerebral endothelium can trigger pathologies associated with dementia and its functional integrity should be an effective target in future therapeutic efforts. © The Author(s) 2021.",Cerebral endothelium; NF-κB essential modulator; physical exercise; simvastatin; vascular cognitive impairment,acetylcholine; choline acetyltransferase; collagen type 4; galectin 3; glial fibrillary acidic protein; hemoglobin; hemosiderin; horseradish peroxidase; I kappa B kinase gamma; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; nitroprusside sodium; receptor type tyrosine protein phosphatase C; simvastatin; somatostatin; tamoxifen; vanilloid receptor 4; animal model; animal tissue; Article; astrocytosis; blood brain barrier; brain blood flow; brain capillary endothelial cell; brain function; cognitive defect; controlled study; dementia; diffusion tensor imaging; electrocorticography; electron spin resonance; endothelial dysfunction; exercise; female; fractional anisotropy; gene knockout; gene sequence; immunodetection; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; immunohistology; laser speckle contrast imaging; lifestyle modification; male; microglia; Morris water maze test; mouse; nervous system inflammation; nesting; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; protein expression; social preference; somatosensory evoked potential; spatial memory; vasodilatation; video microscopy

We analyze representation by considering the incongruence between candidates’ left–right positions and the average placement of their party voters. By combining candidate survey data with mass survey data on voters, we assess how ideological incongruence varies according to predictors measured at the levels of candidates, parties, and party systems. The results highlight a systematic association between a partisan style of representation and candidates’ proximity to voters, as well as the interactions between representational roles and factors such as the anti-establishment nature of parties and ideological polarization in the party system. © The Author(s) 2020.",candidates; congruence; Europe; left–right; political parties; representation,

Here we, the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis Bipolar Disorder workinggroup, study hippocampal subfield volumetry in BD. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans from 4,698 individuals (BD = 1,472, healthy controls [HC] = 3,226) from 23 sites worldwide were processed with FreeSurfer. We used linear mixed-effects models and mega-analysis to investigate differences in hippocampal subfield volumes between BD and HC, followed by analyses of clinical characteristics and medication use. BD showed significantly smaller volumes of the whole hippocampus (Cohen's d = −0.20), cornu ammonis (CA)1 (d = −0.18), CA2/3 (d = −0.11), CA4 (d = −0.19), molecular layer (d = −0.21), granule cell layer of dentate gyrus (d = −0.21), hippocampal tail (d = −0.10), subiculum (d = −0.15), presubiculum (d = −0.18), and hippocampal amygdala transition area (d = −0.17) compared to HC. Lithium users did not show volume differences compared to HC, while non-users did. Antipsychotics or antiepileptic use was associated with smaller volumes. In this largest study of hippocampal subfields in BD to date, we show widespread reductions in nine of 12 subfields studied. The associations were modulated by medication use and specifically the lack of differences between lithium users and HC supports a possible protective role of lithium in BD. © 2020 The Authors.

The first section traces the historical origins of the concept of the decentered state. Group theory and interorganizational theory drew attention to the role of diverse actors in policymaking. The study of policy networks explored these actors and their relationships. The concept of the hollow state arose to describe a state made up of proliferating networks. Finally, postfoundationalists amended these earlier ideas by insisting that the state should not be reified. There are, then, at least three different versions of the decentered state—the pluralist state, the hollow state, and the stateless state. The second section shows how the postfoundationalism of decentered theory transforms the earlier debates about network governance and pluralist democracy. The final section suggests that decentered theory privileges empirical studies of the stateless state and in particular of narratives, rationalities, and resistance. © The Author(s) 2020.",Decentered state; interpretive; postfoundationalism,

In non-cooperative environments (e.g., multi-tenant datacenter networks), coflow scheduling should be strategy-proof; otherwise, some tenants could unfairly acquire more resources by cheating the scheduler. As minimizing coflow completion time (CCT) must prioritize coflows based on some specific rules (e.g., shortest-coflow-first, smallest-effective-bottleneck-first), tenants can raise the priority of their coflows by lying about the coflow information. Thus, it is a common belief that optimizing coflow performance can inevitably violate strategy-proofness. In this paper, we argue that the average CCT can be reduced without violating strategy-proofness. Our key insight is that prioritization can inherently achieve better CCT even without those specific rules such as smallest-effective-bottleneck-first. We propose RICH, a coflow scheduler in non-cooperative environments. At its heart, RICH splits the time into multiple rounds. In each round, RICH ensures that the total data transmitted by each tenant can provide optimal isolation guarantee. Among different rounds, RICH prioritizes coflow transmission among tenants in a round-robin manner. In this way, all tenants are fairly prioritized, and tenants do not necessarily gain more bandwidth by cheating. Extensive simulations show that RICH outperforms other strategy-proof mechanisms by up to 39.3% in terms of average CCT. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Coflow scheduling; Data-intensive applications; Datacenter networks,Application performance; Co-flow; Coflow scheduling; Completion time; Cooperative environment; Data center networks; Data-intensive application; Non-cooperative; Strategy proofs; Strategy-proofness; Scheduling

Coupled with these, crop residue burning contributes significantly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and environmental pollution. So, to evaluate the GHG mitigation potential of various climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs), an on-farm research trial was conducted during 2014–2017 in Karnal, India. Six management scenarios (portfolios of practices), namely, Sc1—business as usual (BAU)/conventional tillage (CT) without residue, Sc2—CT with residue, Sc3—reduced tillage (RT) with residue + recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF), Sc4—RT/zero tillage (ZT) with residue + RDF, Sc5—ZT with residue + RDF + GreenSeeker + Tensiometer, and Sc6—Sc5 + nutrient-expert tool, were included. The global warming potential (GWP) of the RW system under CSAPs (Sc4, Sc5, and Sc6) and the improved BAU (Sc2 and Sc3) were 33–40% and 4–26% lower than BAU (7653 kg CO2 eq./ha/year), respectively. This reflects that CSAPs have the potential to mitigate GWP by ~387 metric tons (Mt) CO2 eq./year from the 13.5 Mha RW system of South Asia. Lower GWP under CSAPs resulted in 36–44% lower emission intensity (383 kg CO2 eq./Mg/year) compared to BAU (642 kg CO2 eq./Mg/year). Meanwhile, the N-factor productivity and eco-efficiency of the RW system under CSAPs were 32–57% and 70–105% higher than BAU, respectively, which reflects that CSAPs are more economically and environmentally sustainable than BAU. The wheat yield obtained under various CSAPs was 0.62 Mg/ha and 0.84 Mg/ha higher than BAU during normal and bad years (extreme weather events), respectively. Thus, it is evident that CSAPs can cope better with climatic extremes than BAU. Therefore, a portfolio of CSAPs should be promoted in RW belts for more adaptation and climate change mitigation. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we sequence the genomes of 41 fungal isolates representative of the A. thaliana root mycobiota for comparative analysis with other 79 plant-associated fungi. Our analyses indicate that root mycobiota members evolved from ancestors with diverse lifestyles and retain large repertoires of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) and effector-like small secreted proteins. We identify a set of 84 gene families associated with endophytism, including genes encoding PCWDEs acting on xylan (family GH10) and cellulose (family AA9). Transcripts encoding these enzymes are also part of a conserved transcriptional program activated by phylogenetically-distant mycobiota members upon host contact. Recolonization experiments with individual fungi indicate that strains with detrimental effects in mono-association with the host colonize roots more aggressively than those with beneficial activities, and dominate in natural root samples. Furthermore, we show that the pectin-degrading enzyme family PL1_7 links aggressiveness of endophytic colonization to plant health. © 2021, The Author(s).",,aggression; cellulose; colonization; endophyte; enzyme; fungus; health and disease; host

Public acceptance of EVs and their large-scale deployment raises requires a fully operational charging infrastructure. Charging infrastructure planning is an intricate process involving various activities, such as charging station placement, charging demand prediction, and charging scheduling. This planning process involves interactions between power distribution and the road network. The advent of machine learning has made data-driven approaches a viable means for solving charging infrastructure planning problems. Consequently, researchers have started using machine learning techniques to solve the aforementioned problems associated with charging infrastructure planning. This work aims to provide a comprehensive review of the machine learning applications used to solve charging infrastructure planning problems.

Such an approach is limited in the context of the many risks and other important risk attributes of farmers. Our analysis of the risk perceptions of farmers extends beyond production risks, severity of the risks, and their likelihoods. We first characterize agricultural risks and identify their main sources and consequences. We then analyze risk perceptions as a hierarchical construct using partial least squares path modelling. We determine the most important risks and risk attributes in the perceptions of farmers, and test for differences in the perceptions between men and women. Results show that severity and ability to prevent a risk are most important in forming risk perceptions. Second, probabilities (ability to prevent) tend to matter more to men (women) for some risks; lastly, low crop yields and fluctuating input prices have greater total effects on the overall risk perception. Our results provide an impetus for risk analysis in agriculture to consider risk attributes that cause affective reactions such as severity and perceived ability to prevent the risks, the need for input price stabilization, and redress of the rampart yield gaps in small-scale agriculture. © 2021 by the authors.

We therefore aimed to investigate factors associated with COVID-19 outcomes in patients with primary systemic vasculitis or polymyalgia rheumatica. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, adult patients (aged ≥18 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 12, 2020, and April 12, 2021, who had a history of primary systemic vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA]-associated vasculitis, giant cell arteritis, Behçet's syndrome, or other vasculitis) or polymyalgia rheumatica, and were reported to the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry were included. To assess COVID-19 outcomes in patients, we used an ordinal COVID-19 severity scale, defined as: (1) no hospitalisation; (2) hospitalisation without supplemental oxygen; (3) hospitalisation with any supplemental oxygen or ventilation; or (4) death. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs), adjusting for age, sex, time period, number of comorbidities, smoking status, obesity, glucocorticoid use, disease activity, region, and medication category. Analyses were also stratified by type of rheumatic disease. Findings: Of 1202 eligible patients identified in the registry, 733 (61·0%) were women and 469 (39·0%) were men, and their mean age was 63·8 years (SD 17·1). A total of 374 (31·1%) patients had polymyalgia rheumatica, 353 (29·4%) had ANCA-associated vasculitis, 183 (15·2%) had giant cell arteritis, 112 (9·3%) had Behçet's syndrome, and 180 (15·0%) had other vasculitis. Of 1020 (84·9%) patients with outcome data, 512 (50·2%) were not hospitalised, 114 (11·2%) were hospitalised and did not receive supplemental oxygen, 239 (23·4%) were hospitalised and received ventilation or supplemental oxygen, and 155 (15·2%) died. A higher odds of poor COVID-19 outcomes were observed in patients who were older (per each additional decade of life OR 1·44 [95% CI 1·31–1·57]), were male compared with female (1·38 [1·05–1·80]), had more comorbidities (per each additional comorbidity 1·39 [1·23–1·58]), were taking 10 mg/day or more of prednisolone compared with none (2·14 [1·50–3·04]), or had moderate, or high or severe disease activity compared with those who had disease remission or low disease activity (2·12 [1·49–3·02]). Risk factors varied among different disease subtypes. Interpretation: Among patients with primary systemic vasculitis and polymyalgia rheumatica, severe COVID-19 outcomes were associated with variable and largely unmodifiable risk factors, such as age, sex, and number of comorbidities, as well as treatments, including high-dose glucocorticoids. Our results could be used to inform mitigation strategies for patients with these diseases.

Complexity produces unexpected and counterintuitive effects, in particular, the phenomenon of policy regimes falling short of expectations while made by refined policies. This paper addresses this phenomenon by investigating the process of policy integration and its nonlinearities in the long run. We consider that the increase in the number of policies unexpectedly impacts the policy coherence within a policy regime. We argue that, depending on the degree of policy interactions, this impact varies in direction and intensity over time, which explains nonlinearities in integration. The impact turns negative when the regime is made of numerous policies, which favors non-coordinated policy interactions. Finally, the negative impact prevents further integration as stated by the Institutional Complexity Trap hypothesis and explains the contemporary paradoxical phenomenon of ineffective policy regimes made of refined policies. Empirically, we draw on a relational analysis of policies in the Swiss flood risk policy regime from 1848 to 2017. We study the co-evolution of the number of policies and of their de facto interlinkages, i.e., the co-regulations of a common issue. Findings support that the Institutional Complexity Trap is a structural and long-term dynamic punctuated by periods of policy learning and policy selection. We identify three main phases in the evolution of the regime: the start (1848–1874), the development (1874–1991), and the Institutional Complexity Trap (since 1991). © 2021, The Author(s).",Coherence; Flood risk management; Integration; Polycentric governance; Public policy; Transaction costs; Water,

However, it is not known whether there are differences in blood GFAP levels across the entire AD continuum and whether its performance is similar to that of CSF GFAP. Objective: To evaluate plasma GFAP levels throughout the entire AD continuum, from preclinical AD to AD dementia, compared with CSF GFAP. Design, Setting, and Participants: This observational, cross-sectional study collected data from July 29, 2014, to January 31, 2020, from 3 centers. The Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD) cohort (Montreal, Canada) included individuals in the entire AD continuum. Results were confirmed in the Alzheimer's and Families (ALFA+) study (Barcelona, Spain), which included individuals with preclinical AD, and the BioCogBank Paris Lariboisière cohort (Paris, France), which included individuals with symptomatic AD. Main Outcomes and Measures: Plasma and CSF GFAP levels measured with a Simoa assay were the main outcome. Other measurements included levels of CSF amyloid-ß 42/40 (Aß42/40), phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL), Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL40), and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) and levels of plasma p-tau181 and NfL. Results of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) were available in TRIAD and ALFA+, and results of tau PET were available in TRIAD. Results: A total of 300 TRIAD participants (177 women [59.0%]; mean [SD] age, 64.6 [17.6] years), 384 ALFA+ participants (234 women [60.9%]; mean [SD] age, 61.1 [4.7] years), and 187 BioCogBank Paris Lariboisière participants (116 women [62.0%]; mean [SD] age, 69.9 [9.2] years) were included. Plasma GFAP levels were significantly higher in individuals with preclinical AD in comparison with cognitively unimpaired (CU) Aß-negative individuals (TRIAD: Aß-negative mean [SD], 185.1 [93.5] pg/mL, Aß-positive mean [SD], 285.0 [142.6] pg/mL; ALFA+: Aß-negative mean [SD], 121.9 [42.4] pg/mL, Aß-positive mean [SD], 169.9 [78.5] pg/mL). Plasma GFAP levels were also higher among individuals in symptomatic stages of the AD continuum (TRIAD: CU Aß-positive mean [SD], 285.0 [142.6] pg/mL, mild cognitive impairment [MCI] Aß-positive mean [SD], 332.5 [153.6] pg/mL; AD mean [SD], 388.1 [152.8] pg/mL vs CU Aß-negative mean [SD], 185.1 [93.5] pg/mL; Paris: MCI Aß-positive, mean [SD], 368.6 [158.5] pg/mL; AD dementia, mean [SD], 376.4 [179.6] pg/mL vs CU Aß-negative mean [SD], 161.2 [67.1] pg/mL). Plasma GFAP magnitude changes were consistently higher than those of CSF GFAP. Plasma GFAP more accurately discriminated Aß-positive from Aß-negative individuals than CSF GFAP (area under the curve for plasma GFAP, 0.69-0.86; area under the curve for CSF GFAP, 0.59-0.76). Moreover, plasma GFAP levels were positively associated with tau pathology only among individuals with concomitant Aß pathology. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that plasma GFAP is a sensitive biomarker for detecting and tracking reactive astrogliosis and Aß pathology even among individuals in the early stages of AD.. © 2021 American Medical Association.

Localized regions with high activity, e.g., register files, ALUs, FPUs, and so on, experience higher temperatures than the average across the chip and are commonly referred to as hotspots. Hotspots affect functional correctness of the underlying circuitry and a noticeable increase in leakage power, which in turn generates heat in a self-reinforced cycle. Techniques that reduce the severity of or completely eliminate hotspots can maintain functional correctness along with improving performance of CMPs. Conventional dynamic thermal management targets the cores to reduce hotspots but often ignores caches, which are known for their high leakage power consumption. This article presents WaFFLe, an approach that targets the leakage power of the last-level cache (LLC) and hotspots occurring at the cores. WaFFLe turns off LLC-ways to reduce leakage power and to generate on-chip thermal buffers. In addition, fine-grained DVFS is applied during long LLC miss induced stalls to reduce core temperature. Our results show that WaFFLe reduces peak and average temperature of a 16-core based homogeneous tiled CMP with up to 8.4 Ö¯ C and 6.2 Ö¯ C, respectively, with an average performance degradation of only 2.5 %. We also show that WaFFLe outperforms a state-of-The-Art cache-based technique and a greedy DVFS policy. © 2021 Owner/Author.",cache coherence; Cache-way shutdown; chip-mutiprocessors; fine grained DVFS; hotspots; leakage power; thermal efficiency,Multiprocessing systems; Thermal management (electronics); Cache Coherence; Cache-way shutdown; Chip-mutiprocessor; Fine grained; Fine grained DVFS; Functional correctness; Hotspots; Leakage power; Multi-processors; Thermal-efficiency; Temperature control

However, less is known about these prices in low-income countries. Using unique food price data from 116 markets in Ethiopia, we find that real prices of all nutritionally-rich food groups increased significantly (between 21 and 74 percent) from 2005 to 2018. This contrasts with staple crops (grains, roots and tubers), whose price increased only slightly (6 percent), and with oils, fats and sugar (commodities of which high consumption is associated with obesity), whose prices decreased substantially (41–49 percent). Combining these price data with other disaggregated datasets and relying on zonal fixed effect models, we further find that the price increases of nutritious foods are mostly linked to price changes in commercial production clusters, increased demand in urban areas, and to international price rises and that the decreasing prices of cooking oil and sugar are not much linked to market factors, but more to centralized government distribution and price controls. Given the high influence of prices on food consumption in these settings, these findings are of high relevance for nutrition policies both in the country and beyond. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Ethiopia; Food prices; Nutrition,

GWAS was performed for twelve elements including B, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, and Zn and four agronomic traits including days to 50% flowering, grain yield, plant height and thousand grain weight. GWAS identified 128 loci associated with the grain elements and 57 associated with the agronomic traits. There were sixteen co-localization regions containing QTL for two or more traits. Fourteen grain element quantitative trait loci were stable across growing environments, which can be strong candidates to be used in marker-assisted selection to improve the concentrations of nutritive elements in rice grain. Potential candidate genes were revealed including OsNAS3 linked to the locus that controls the variation of Zn and Co concentrations. The effects of starch synthesis and grain filling on multiple grain elements were elucidated through the likely involvement of OsSUS1 and OsGSSB1 genes.

We use a political economy lens to explore the transformations taking place when climate policy meets specific forest frontiers in the Global South, where international, national and local institutions, interests, ideas, and information are at play. We argue that lasting and equitable outcomes will require a strong discursive shift within dominant institutions and among policy actors to redress policies that place responsibilities and burdens on local people in the Global South, while benefits from deforestation and maladaptation are taken elsewhere.

Therefore we measured N2O emissions from different quantities of dung patches during three observation periods (dry, wet and transition from dry to wet season) and different volumes of urine patches during wet and dry seasons. Dung patches did not stimulate soil N2O emissions in any of the three observation periods, while urine application stimulated soil N2O emissions during both seasons, with higher emissions observed during the wet season. The dung EFs (0.00–0.03%) and the urine EFs (0.04–0.40%) showed no detectable effects of dung quantity or urine volume. We further synthesized observations from other studies in wet and dry tropical regions, which indicated that the excreta N2O EFs were similar to the default values provided in the IPCC 2019 refinement (0.11% vs 0.07% for dung and 0.41% vs 0.32% for urine in dry climates, and 0.13% vs 0.13% for dung and 0.65% vs 0.77% for urine in wet climates). However, sub-Saharan African (SSA) studies had consistently lower EFs, possibly due to the lower urine-N: dung-N ratio in SSA compared with the other tropical regions, suggesting that the refinement may still overestimate excreta emissions in SSA. Moreover, considering the large variations in the summarized tropical excreta N2O EFs, from -0.01 to 1.77% for dung and 0.00 to 4.90% for urine, more studies under diverse conditions across tropical regions are recommended. © 2021",Cattle excreta; Dry/wet climate; IPCC refinement; Nitrous oxide; Tropics,nitrous oxide; pasture; seasonal variation; tropical environment; Sub-Saharan Africa

An 8-year study (2012–2013 to 2019–2020) was conducted to understand the shift in weed density and diversity under different CSA-based management practices called scenarios (Sc). These Sc involved: Sc1, conventional tillage (CT)-based rice–wheat system with flood irrigation (farmers’ practice); Sc2, CT-rice, zero tillage (ZT)-wheat–mungbean with flood irrigation (partial CA-based); Sc3, ZT rice–wheat–mungbean with flood irrigation (partial CSA-based rice); Sc4, ZT maize–wheat–mungbean with flood irrigation (partial CSA-based maize); Sc5, ZT rice–wheat–mungbean with subsurface drip irrigation (full CSA-based rice); and Sc6, ZT maize–wheat–mungbean with subsurface drip irrigation (full CSA-based maize). The most abundant weed species were P. minor &gt; A. arvensis &gt; M. indicus &gt; C. album and were favored by farmers’ practice. However, CSA-based management practices suppressed these species and favored S. nigrum and R. dentatus and the effect of CSAPs was more evident in the long-term. Maximum total weed density was observed for Sc1, while minimum value was recorded under full CSA-based maize systems, where seven weed-species vanished, and P. minor density declined to 0.33 instead of 25.93 plant m−2 after 8-years of continuous cultivation. Full CSA-based maize–wheat system could be a promising alternative for the conveniently managed rice–wheat system in weed suppression in north-west India. © 2021, The Author(s).",,agricultural worker; article; bakery product; climate; continuous culture; conventional tillage; human; India; maize; mung bean; no tillage; nonhuman; rice; Rumex dentatus; wheat

Manual methods executed by experts are considered the gold standard, but it is time consuming and the accuracy is dependent on radiologists’ experience. Automated methods are relatively fast and reproducible with potential to facilitate physician interpretation of images. However, these benefits are possible only after overcoming several challenges. The traditional methods that are formulated as a three-stage segmentation demonstrate promising results on normal CT data but perform poorly in the presence of pathological features and variations in image quality attributes. The implementation of deep learning methods that can demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods is dependent on the quantity, quality, cost and the time it takes to generate training data. Thus, efficient and clinically relevant automated segmentation method is desired for the diagnosis of respiratory diseases. Methods: We implement each of the three stages of traditional methods using deep learning methods trained on five different configurations of training data with ground truths obtained from the 3D Image Reconstruction for Comparison of Algorithm Database (3DIRCAD) and the Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILD) database. The data was augmented with the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC-IDRI) image collection and a realistic phantom. A convolutional neural network (CNN) at the preprocessing stage classifies the input into lung and none lung regions. The processing stage was implemented using a CNN-based U-net while the postprocessing stage utilize another U-net and CNN for contour refinement and filtering out false positives, respectively. Results: The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on 1230 and 1100 CT slices from the 3DIRCAD and ILD databases. We investigate the performance of the proposed method on five configurations of training data and three configurations of the segmentation system; three-stage segmentation and three-stage segmentation without a CNN classifier and contrast enhancement, respectively. The Dice-score recorded by the proposed method range from 0.76 to 0.95. Conclusion: The clinical relevance and segmentation accuracy of deep learning models can improve though deep learning-based three-stage segmentation, image quality evaluation and enhancement as well as augmenting the training data with large volume of cheap and quality training data. We propose a new and novel deep learning-based method of contour refinement. © 2021, The Author(s).",Computed tomography (CT); Deep learning network; Lung contour; Lung region; Three-stage segmentation,

However, lower travel costs may be offset by agro-dealer decisions on stocking and pricing, reflecting both travel time from wholesale markets as well as the level of competition in localized areas. This paper investigates the geographical distribution of agro-dealers and related patterns of local market competition on the availability and prices of maize seed and fertilizer. We use a unique census of agro-dealers in eight districts of Tanzania (n = 299) which maps distribution points for agricultural inputs in these areas. Results suggested that despite a high number of agro-dealers, almost 30% of farmers lived more than an hour travel time from at least one agro-dealer. Instead of wide geographical coverage, agro-dealers tended to be found in clusters, with strong variation in cluster sizes between different districts. Overall, more remote agro-dealers faced less competition, resulting in fewer stocked product choices and charging higher prices to customers, even after controlling for travel time from district headquarters. Remote farmers are disadvantaged in their uptake of new technologies and critical production inputs due to lack of competition among agro-dealers. Our results suggest that highly aggregated and/or simplified measures of market access fail to reflect important heterogeneity in the market access conditions faced by farmers; a better understanding of distribution networks and competition is needed. © 2021, The Author(s).",Agro-dealer; Market access; Remoteness; Rural development; Spatial analysis,agricultural market; agricultural technology; geographical distribution; maize; rural area; rural development; smallholder; spatial analysis; Tanzania

However, new varieties that are resistant to late blight often lack other traits that farmers and consumers prefer. Using participatory varietal selection, this study seeks to identify clones with high potential to become varieties with resistance to late blight but also feature a high marketable tuber yield and other preferred agronomic traits. During 2016–2017, 36 clones previously selected for high levels of resistance to late blight from population B developed by the International Potato Center, and three varieties used as controls (INIA 302 Amarilis moderately resistant, INIA303 Canchan and Yungay susceptible to late blight), were evaluated in five Peruvian locations. At harvest, five clones were selected based on (i) evaluations made by farmers through Participatory Varietal Selection, (ii) analysis of mixed models and Best Linear Unbiased Predictors for tuber yield, (iii) low glycoalkaloid content in tubers, and (iv) good organoleptic quality. These clones were evaluated again during 2017–2018 in four locations. Resistance to late blight and good marketable tuber yields were identified as the most important criteria for the selection of a new potato variety. The clones CIP308488.92, CIP308495.227 and CIP308478.59 were selected as promising clones having resistance to late blight and tuber yield superior to the local varieties, INIA-303 Canchan, Yungay, as well as good organoleptic quality and low glycoalkaloid content. These clones can be suggested for variety release in similar agroecological environments. © 2021, The Author(s).",Glycoalkaloids; Late blight; Organoleptic quality; Participatory varietal selection; Potato; Tuber yield,

In this study, we leverage well-established cognitive models coming from anthropology in order to characterise the personal network of collaborations between scientists, i.e., the network considered from the standpoint of each individual researcher (referred to as ego network), in terms of the cognitive investment they devote to the different collaborations. Building upon these models, we study the interplay between the structure of academic collaborations, academic performance, and academic mobility at different career stages. We take into account both purely academic mobility (i.e., the number of affiliation changes) and geographical mobility (i.e., physical relocations to different countries). For our investigation, we rely on a dataset comprising the geo-referenced publications of a group of 81,500 authors extracted from Scopus, one of the biggest repositories of academic knowledge. Our main finding is that there is a clear correlation between the structure of co-authorship ego networks and academic performance indices: the more one publishes and the higher their impact, the larger their collaboration network. However, we observe a capacity bound effect, whereby, beyond a certain point, higher performances become increasingly less correlated with large collaboration networks. We also find that international academic migrants are better at growing their networks than researchers that only migrate within the same country, but the latter seem to be better in exploiting their collaboration to achieve higher impact. High academic mobility does not appear to translate into better academic performance or larger collaboration networks. This shows a different finding with respect to related literature, where scientific productivity is seen as directly linked to mobility. Our results show that, when looking at impact of research, this is not necessarily the case. © 2021, The Author(s).",Academic mobility; Collaboration networks; Ego networks; H-index; Productivity; Science of science,

Here we show that cellular proteins, which form condensates at low salt concentrations, including FUS, TDP-43, Brd4, Sox2, and Annexin A11, can reenter a phase-separated regime at high salt concentrations. By bringing together experiments and simulations, we demonstrate that this reentrant phase transition in the high-salt regime is driven by hydrophobic and non-ionic interactions, and is mechanistically distinct from the low-salt regime, where condensates are additionally stabilized by electrostatic forces. Our work thus sheds light on the cooperation of hydrophobic and non-ionic interactions as general driving forces in the condensation process, with important implications for aberrant function, druggability, and material properties of biomolecular condensates. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"annexin a11; bromodomain containing protein 4; protein; RNA binding protein FUS; sodium chloride; TAR DNA binding protein; transcription factor Sox2; unclassified drug; annexin; BRD4 protein, human; cell cycle protein; DNA binding protein; protein; RNA binding protein FUS; SOX2 protein, human; TARDBP protein, human; transcription factor; transcription factor Sox; condensate; electrochemistry; experimental study; hydrophobicity; ionic composition; molecular analysis; protein; salinity; amino acid sequence; animal cell; Article; controlled study; Escherichia coli; fluorescence imaging; hydrophobicity; insect cell; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; phase separation; phase transition; protein protein interaction; protein stability; solubility; static electricity; animal; chemical phenomena; chemistry; human; molecular dynamics; phase transition; Sf9 cell line; Spodoptera; static electricity; Animals; Annexins; Cell Cycle Proteins; DNA-Binding Proteins; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Phase Transition; Proteins; RNA-Binding Protein FUS; Sf9 Cells; SOXB1 Transcription Factors; Spodoptera; Static Electricity; Transcription Factors"

This paper is a step in that direction and offers a comparative study of current state-of-the art path planning and collision avoidance algorithms for autonomous surface vehicles. Across 45 selected papers, we compare important performance properties of the proposed algorithms related to the vessel and the environment it is operating in. We also analyse how safety is incorporated, and what components constitute the objective function in these algorithms. Finally, we focus on comparing advantages and limitations of the 45 analysed papers.

Private certification, which has developed considerably in recent years, should help achieve this objective. Based on a literature review and 63 individual interviews with farmers, we identified four archetypes of cocoa production using the criteria of plantation size, degree of shade, and support from public or private extension services. We analyzed the average operating accounts of the four archetypes. Our findings show that the net profit rates obtained by small-scale certified producers are 14% (in the savannah zone) and 24% (in the forest zone). These rates are much higher than for the other two production models. Certification schemes provide technical and financial support, which has a positive influence on the practices of many small-scale producers and compensates for the lack of public services, which are now almost non-existent. A hybrid governance of the cocoa sector in Cameroon could clarify and improve the organization of the interactions between public regulation and private certification systems.

While landscape restoration has the potential to restore ecosystem function, understanding the drivers of degradation is critical for prioritizing and tracking interventions. We sampled 300-1000gm2 plots using the Land Degradation Surveillance Framework across Nyagatare and Kayonza districts in Rwanda to assess key soil and land health indicators, including soil organic carbon (SOC), erosion prevalence, vegetation structure and infiltration capacity, and their interactions. SOC content decreased with increasing sand content across both sites and sampling depths and was lowest in croplands and grasslands compared to shrublands and woodlands. Stable carbon isotope values (δ13C) ranged from -15.35g‰ to -21.34g‰, indicating a wide range of historic and current plant communities with both C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways. Field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) was modeled, with a median of 76gmmgh-1 in Kayonza and 62gmmgh-1 in Nyagatare, respectively. Topsoil OC had a positive effect on Kfs, whereas pH, sand, and erosion had negative effects. Soil erosion was highest in plots classified as woodland and shrubland. Maps of soil erosion and SOC at 30gm resolution were produced with high accuracy and showed strong variability across the study landscapes. These data demonstrate the importance of assessing multiple biophysical properties in order to assess land degradation, including the spatial patterns of soil and land health indicators across the landscape. By understanding the dynamics of land degradation and interactions between biophysical indicators, we can better prioritize interventions that result in multiple benefits as well as assess the impacts of restoration options. © Copyright:",,assessment method; information; landscape; restoration ecology; Rwanda

As a result, working to improve cassava production efficiency is the best option available. Cassava is increasingly being used as a food source as well as an industrial raw material in the production of economic goods. This study estimates cassava production efficiency and investigates the causes of inefficiency in southern Ethiopia. Cross-sectional data from 158 households were collected using a systematic questionnaire. The Cobb-Douglas (CDs) stochastic frontier production model was used to calculate production efficiency levels. The computed mean result showed technical efficiency (TE), allocative efficiency (AE), and economic efficiency (EE) levels of 74, 90, and 66%, respectively. This demonstrated that existing farm resources could increase average production efficiency by 26, 10, and 34%, respectively. The study found that land size, urea fertilizer application, and cassava planting cut all had a positive and significant effect on cassava production. It was discovered that TE was more important than AE as a source of benefit for EE. Inefficiency effects modeled using the two-limit Tobit model revealed that household head age, level of education, cassava variety, extension contact, rural credit, off-farm activities involvement to generate income, and farm size were the most important factors for improving TE, AE, and EE efficiencies. As a result, policymakers in government should consider these factors when addressing inefficiencies in cassava production. It is especially important to provide appropriate agricultural knowledge through short-term training, to provide farmers with access to formal education, to access improved cassava varieties, and to support agricultural extension services.

Characterizing this variation is an important step in improving the N use efficiency (NUE) of future cultivars while maximizing production (yield) potential. In this study, we compared the agronomic performance of 48 diverse wheat cultivars released between 1936 and 2016 at low and high N input levels in field conditions to assess the relationship between NUE and its components. Agronomic trait values were significantly lower in the low N treatment, and the cultivars tested showed a significant variation for all traits (apart from the N remobilization efficiency), indicating that response is genotype-dependent, although significant genotype × environment effects were also observed. Overall, we show a varietal improvement in NUE over time of 0.33 and 0.30% year–1 at low and high N, respectively, and propose that this is driven predominantly by varietal selection for increased yield. More complete understanding of the components of these improvements will inform future targeted breeding and selection strategies to support a reduction in fertilizer use while maintaining productivity.

Objective: To determine whether convalescent plasma would improve outcomes for critically ill adults with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: The ongoing Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial, Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP) enrolled and randomized 4763 adults with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 between March 9, 2020, and January 18, 2021, within at least 1 domain; 2011 critically ill adults were randomized to open-label interventions in the immunoglobulin domain at 129 sites in 4 countries. Follow-up ended on April 19, 2021. Interventions: The immunoglobulin domain randomized participants to receive 2 units of high-titer, ABO-compatible convalescent plasma (total volume of 550 mL ± 150 mL) within 48 hours of randomization (n = 1084) or no convalescent plasma (n = 916). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary ordinal end point was organ support-free days (days alive and free of intensive care unit-based organ support) up to day 21 (range, -1 to 21 days; patients who died were assigned -1 day). The primary analysis was an adjusted bayesian cumulative logistic model. Superiority was defined as the posterior probability of an odds ratio (OR) greater than 1 (threshold for trial conclusion of superiority >99%). Futility was defined as the posterior probability of an OR less than 1.2 (threshold for trial conclusion of futility >95%). An OR greater than 1 represented improved survival, more organ support-free days, or both. The prespecified secondary outcomes included in-hospital survival; 28-day survival; 90-day survival; respiratory support-free days; cardiovascular support-free days; progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation, or death; intensive care unit length of stay; hospital length of stay; World Health Organization ordinal scale score at day 14; venous thromboembolic events at 90 days; and serious adverse events. Results: Among the 2011 participants who were randomized (median age, 61 [IQR, 52 to 70] years and 645/1998 [32.3%] women), 1990 (99%) completed the trial. The convalescent plasma intervention was stopped after the prespecified criterion for futility was met. The median number of organ support-free days was 0 (IQR, -1 to 16) in the convalescent plasma group and 3 (IQR, -1 to 16) in the no convalescent plasma group. The in-hospital mortality rate was 37.3% (401/1075) for the convalescent plasma group and 38.4% (347/904) for the no convalescent plasma group and the median number of days alive and free of organ support was 14 (IQR, 3 to 18) and 14 (IQR, 7 to 18), respectively. The median-adjusted OR was 0.97 (95% credible interval, 0.83 to 1.15) and the posterior probability of futility (OR <1.2) was 99.4% for the convalescent plasma group compared with the no convalescent plasma group. The treatment effects were consistent across the primary outcome and the 11 secondary outcomes. Serious adverse events were reported in 3.0% (32/1075) of participants in the convalescent plasma group and in 1.3% (12/905) of participants in the no convalescent plasma group. Conclusions and Relevance: Among critically ill adults with confirmed COVID-19, treatment with 2 units of high-titer, ABO-compatible convalescent plasma had a low likelihood of providing improvement in the number of organ support-free days.

No quantified correlation exists between changes of forest structure due to anthropogenic disturbances and dynamics of land use and cover change occurring at broader spatial levels. This study examines the influence of multi-scale landscape structure factors (i.e. spatial composition, configuration and dynamic of land use/cover) on primary forest's aboveground biomass (AGB), spanning from low to highly degraded, in Paragominas municipality (Pará state). We used random forest models to identify the most important landscape predictors of degradation and clustering methods to analyze their distribution and interactions. We found that 58% of the variance of AGB could be explained by metrics reflecting land use practices and agricultural dynamics around primary forest patches and that their spatial patterns were not randomly distributed. Forest degradation is mainly driven by fragmentation effects resulting from old deforestation and colonization events linked with cropland expansion (e.g. soybean and maize) coupled with high accessibility to market. To a lesser extent, degradation is driven by recent and ongoing (1985-2015) deforestation and fragmentation in slash-and-burn agricultural areas, characterized by heterogeneous mosaics of pastures and fallow lands combined with high use of fire. Our findings highlight the potential of landscape-level framework and remotely sensed land cover data for a thorough understanding of the distribution of forest degradation across human-modified landscapes. Addressing these spatial determinants by looking at agricultural dynamics beyond forest cover is necessary to improve forest management which has major implications for biodiversity, carbon and other ecosystem services. © 2021 The Author(s).

The quality of pasta is mainly defined by the rheological properties of gluten, an elastic network in wheat endosperms formed of gliadins and glutenins. In this study, the allelic variation at five glutenin loci was analysed in 196 durum wheat genotypes. Two loci (Glu-A1 and Glu-B1), encoding for high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS), and three loci (Glu-B2, Glu-A3 and Glu-B3), encoding for low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS), were assessed by SDS-PAGE. The SDS-sedimentation test was used and the grain protein content was evaluated. A total of 32 glutenin subunits and 41 glutenin haplotypes were identified. Four novel alleles were detected. Fifteen haplotypes represented 85.7% of glutenin loci variability. Some haplotypes carrying the 7 + 15 and 7 + 22 banding patterns at Glu-B1 showed a high gluten strength similar to those that carried the 7 + 8 or 6 + 8 alleles. A decreasing trend in grain protein content was observed over the last 85 years. Allelic frequencies at the three main loci (Glu-B1, Glu-A3 and Glu-B3) changed over the 1915–2020 period. Gluten strength increased from 1970 to 2020 coinciding with the allelic changes observed. These results offer valuable information for glutenin haplotype-based selection for use in breeding programs. © 2021 by the authors.

We developed the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance Patient Experience Survey to assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with rheumatic disease worldwide. Methods: Survey questions were developed by key stakeholder groups and disseminated worldwide through social media, websites, and patient support organisations. Questions included demographics, rheumatic disease diagnosis, COVID-19 diagnosis, adoption of protective behaviours to mitigate COVID-19 exposure, medication access and changes, health-care access and communication with rheumatologists, and changes in employment or schooling. Adults age 18 years and older with inflammatory or autoimmune rheumatic diseases were eligible for inclusion. We included participants with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis. We excluded participants reporting only non-inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as fibromyalgia or osteoarthritis. Findings: 12 117 responses to the survey were received between April 3 and May 8, 2020, and of these, 10 407 respondents had included appropriate age data. We included complete responses from 9300 adults with rheumatic disease (mean age 46·1 years; 8375 [90·1%] women, 893 [9·6%] men, and 32 [0·3%] participants who identified as non-binary). 6273 (67·5%) of respondents identified as White, 1565 (16·8%) as Latin American, 198 (2·1%) as Black, 190 (2·0%) as Asian, and 42 (0·5%) as Native American or Aboriginal or First Nation. The most common rheumatic disease diagnoses included rheumatoid arthritis (3636 [39·1%] of 9300), systemic lupus erythematosus (2882 [31·0%]), and Sjögren's syndrome (1290 [13·9%]). Most respondents (6921 [82·0%] of 8441) continued their antirheumatic medications as prescribed. Almost all (9266 [99·7%] of 9297) respondents adopted protective behaviours to limit SARS-CoV-2 exposure. A change in employment status occurred in 2524 (27·1%) of 9300) of respondents, with a 13·6% decrease in the number in full-time employment (from 4066 to 3514). Interpretation: People with rheumatic disease maintained therapy and followed public health advice to mitigate the risks of COVID-19. Substantial employment status changes occurred, with potential implications for health-care access, medication affordability, mental health, and rheumatic disease activity.

Objective: To identify the genetic variants associated with juvenile ALS. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this multicenter family-based genetic study, trio whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify the disease-associated gene in a case series of unrelated patients diagnosed with juvenile ALS and severe growth retardation. The patients and their family members were enrolled at academic hospitals and a government research facility between March 1, 2016, and March 13, 2020, and were observed until October 1, 2020. Whole-exome sequencing was also performed in a series of patients with juvenile ALS. A total of 66 patients with juvenile ALS and 6258 adult patients with ALS participated in the study. Patients were selected for the study based on their diagnosis, and all eligible participants were enrolled in the study. None of the participants had a family history of neurological disorders, suggesting de novo variants as the underlying genetic mechanism. Main Outcomes and Measures: De novo variants present only in the index case and not in unaffected family members. Results: Trio whole-exome sequencing was performed in 3 patients diagnosed with juvenile ALS and their parents. An additional 63 patients with juvenile ALS and 6258 adult patients with ALS were subsequently screened for variants in the SPTLC1 gene. De novo variants in SPTLC1 (p.Ala20Ser in 2 patients and p.Ser331Tyr in 1 patient) were identified in 3 unrelated patients diagnosed with juvenile ALS and failure to thrive. A fourth variant (p.Leu39del) was identified in a patient with juvenile ALS where parental DNA was unavailable. Variants in this gene have been previously shown to be associated with autosomal-dominant hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy, type 1A, by disrupting an essential enzyme complex in the sphingolipid synthesis pathway. Conclusions and Relevance: These data broaden the phenotype associated with SPTLC1 and suggest that patients presenting with juvenile ALS should be screened for variants in this gene. © 2021 American Medical Association.

In the present paper, the derivative values of European and American options have been priced where we take into account counterparty risk. Whereas European and American options considering counterparty risk have already been priced under Black-Scholes dynamics in [2], here the novel contribution is the introduction of stochastic volatility resulting in a Heston stochastic volatility type partial differential equation to be solved. We derive the partial differential equation modeling the XVA when stochastic volatility is assumed. For both European and American options, a linear and a nonlinear problem have been deduced. In order to obtain a numerical solution, suitable and appropriate boundary conditions have been considered.

We report the nutrient content of two fish-based recipes—fish powder and fish chutney—that contain dried small fish available in local markets in Zambia. The contribution of a serving of each recipe to the recommended daily intakes of iron, zinc, calcium and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for pregnant/lactating women and children 6–24 months was calculated because these nutrients are commonly deficient in African diets. We found that one 10-g serving of fish powder provides 20% or more of the daily calcium recommendation and 37% or more of the daily DHA recommendation for both pregnant/lactating women and children. A 30-g serving of fish chutney provides over 40% of the daily calcium recommendation for pregnant women and over 50% for lactating women. Additionally, we investigated the nutrient density (nutrients per kilocalorie) of the fish powder and compared it with the nutrient density of a small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement plus (SQ-LNS-plus). SQ-LNS-plus is designed to enhance children's diets by providing micronutrients and DHA. Fish powder is similar to SQ-LNS-plus in iron and zinc density and even higher in calcium and DHA density. Consuming dried small fish as part of a daily meal can be a viable strategy for combatting nutrient deficiencies in the first 1000 days. © 2021 The Authors.

However, no studies have investigated soil greenhouse gas (GHGs: CO2, N2O and CH4) fluxes from these plantations and how they relate to other land cover types. We examined GHG fluxes (Fs) in a sisal chronosequence at Teita Sisal Estate in southern Kenya. The effects of stand age on Fs were examined using static GHG chambers and gas chromatography for a period of one year in seven stands: young stands aged 1–3 years, mature stands aged 7–8 years, and old stands aged 13–14 years. Adjacent bushland served as a control site representing the surrounding land use type. Mean CO₂ fluxes were highest in the oldest stand (56 ± 3 mg C m-2 h-1) and lowest in the 8-year old stand (38 ± 3 mg C m-2 h-1), which we attribute to difference in root respiration between the stand. All stands had 13–28% higher CO₂ fluxes than bushland (32 ± 3 mg C m-2 h-1). CO2 fluxes in the wet season were about 70% higher than dry season across all sites. They were influenced by soil water content (WS) and vegetation phenology. Mean N2O fluxes were very low (&lt;5 µg N m-2 h-1) in all sites due to low soil nitrogen (N) content. About 89% of CH4 fluxes were below the detection limit (LOD ± 0.02 mg C m-2 h-1). Our results imply that sisal plantations have higher soil CO2 emissions than the surrounding land use type, and the seasonal emissions were largely driven by WS and the vegetation status. Methane and nitrous oxide are of minor importance. Thus, soil GHG fluxes from sisal plantations are a minor contributor to agricultural GHG emissions in Kenya. © 2021 The Author(s)","Carbon dioxide (CO2); Land-use change, Static chamber; Methane (CH4); Nitrous oxide (N2O); Soil moisture; Sub-Saharan Africa",carbon flux; chronosequence; greenhouse gas; land cover; plantation; semiarid region; soil emission; Kenya; Agave sisalana

HarvestPlus, along with its global consortium partners, enhances Fe, Zn, and PVA in staple crops. The strategic and applied research by HarvestPlus is driven by product-based impact pathway that integrates crop breeding, nutrition research, impact assessment, advocacy, and communication to implement country-specific crop delivery plans. Targeted breeding has resulted in 393 biofortified crop varieties by the end of 2020, which have been released or are in testing in 63 countries, potentially benefitting more than 48 million people. Nevertheless, to reach more than a billion people by 2030, future breeding lines that are being distributed by Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) centers and submitted by National Agricultural Research System (NARS) to varietal release committees should be biofortified. It is envisaged that the mainstreaming of biofortification traits will be driven by high-throughput micronutrient phenotyping, genomic selection coupled with speed breeding for accelerating genetic gains. It is noteworthy that targeted breeding gradually leads to mainstreaming, as the latter capitalizes on the progress made in the former. Efficacy studies have revealed the nutritional significance of Fe, Zn, and PVA biofortified varieties over non-biofortified ones. Mainstreaming will ensure the integration of biofortified traits into competitive varieties and hybrids developed by private and public sectors. The mainstreaming strategy has just been initiated in select CGIAR centers, namely, International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), and International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT).

Despite its economic and cultural value, however, not to mention the ecological roles it plays as a dominant parkland species, shea remains semi-domesticated with virtually no history of systematic genetic improvement. In truth, shea’s extended juvenile period makes traditional breeding approaches untenable; but the opportunity for genome-assisted breeding is immense, provided the foundational resources are available. Here we report the development and public release of such resources. Using the FALCON-Phase workflow, 162.6 Gb of long-read PacBio sequence data were assembled into a 658.7 Mbp, chromosome-scale reference genome annotated with 38,505 coding genes. Whole genome duplication (WGD) analysis based on this gene space revealed clear signatures of two ancient WGD events in shea’s evolutionary past, one prior to the Astrid-Rosid divergence (116–126 Mya) and the other at the root of the order Ericales (65–90 Mya). In a first genome-wide look at the suite of fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis genes that likely govern stearin content, the primary determinant of shea butter quality, relatively high copy numbers of six key enzymes were found (KASI, KASIII, FATB, FAD2, FAD3, and FAX2), some likely originating in shea’s more recent WGD event. To help translate these findings into practical tools for characterization, selection, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), resequencing data from a shea diversity panel was used to develop a database of more than 3.5 million functionally annotated, physically anchored SNPs. Two smaller, more curated sets of suggested SNPs, one for GWAS (104,211 SNPs) and the other targeting FA biosynthesis genes (90 SNPs), are also presented. With these resources, the hope is to support national programs across the shea belt in the strategic, genome-enabled conservation and long-term improvement of the shea tree for SSA. © Copyright © 2021 Hale, Ma, Melo, Padi, Hendre, Kingan, Sullivan, Chen, Boffa, Muchugi, Danquah, Barnor, Jamnadass, Van de Peer and Van Deynze.",fatty acids; plant breeding; reference genome; shea tree; SNPs; Vitellaria paradoxa; whole genome duplication,

This paper proposes a framework to design a tunable terahertz perfect absorber based on fractal triangle-shaped graphene layers embedded into dielectric substrates with the potential for spectral narrowing and widening of the absorption response without the need for geometric manipulation. In this way, the absorption cross-section spectra of the suggested configurations are achieved over the absorption band. First, the defection impact on the single-layer fractal triangle-shaped graphene structure inserted in insulators of the absorber is evaluated. Then, a flexible tunability of the absorbance’s peak is indicated by controlling the Fermi energy. By stacking fractal graphene sheets as a double graphene layer configuration in both the same and cross-states positioning, it is demonstrated that the absorption characteristics can be switched at 6–8 THz with a stronger amplitude, and 16–18 THz with a lower intensity. The impact of changing the Fermi potentials of embedded graphene layers is yielded, resulting in a plasmonic resonance shift and a significant broadening of the absorption bandwidth of up to five folds. Following, the absorption spectra related to the fractal triangle-shaped structures consist of a multi-stage architecture characterized by a spectral response experiencing a multiband absorbance rate and an absorption intensity of over 8 × 106 nm2 in a five-stage perfect absorber. Ultimately, the variations of the absorbance parameter and plasmonic mode under rotating the graphene sheet are explored for single and double fractal triangle-shaped perfect configurations on the absorption band. The presented mechanism demonstrates the tunability of the absorption spectrum in terms of narrowing or broadening and switching the plasmonic resonance by configuring multi-stage structures that can employ a broad range of applications for sensory devices. © 2021 by the authors.

While the institutions and practices of democracy during normal times are well established, democratic standards during emergencies have yet to be conceptualized in the literature. This makes it difficult to systematically answer questions like - How do states' responses to Covid-19 violate democratic standards? Do such violations make states' responses more effective? Drawing on international treaties, norms, and academic scholarship, we propose a novel conceptualization of democratic standards for emergency measures. We then identify which government responses to Covid-19 qualify as a violation of democratic standards within the framework of illiberal and authoritarian practices, introducing a dataset covering 144 countries from March 2020 onward. In this article, we provide an overview of the extent to which states violated democratic standards in their response to Covid-19 during 2020. We find no relationship between violations of democratic standards and reported Covid-19 mortality. Illiberal and authoritarian practices in response to the Covid-19 pandemic do not correlate with better public health outcomes.

They are often the only form of agriculture that can be practiced due to unfavorable climate and soil fertility levels that prevent crop cultivation. Pastoralism can have negative impacts on the environment, including land degradation, greenhouse gas emissions and other gases to the atmosphere, soil erosion, water pollution and biodiversity loss. Here, we review the current knowledge on nitrogen (N) cycling, storage, and loss pathways, with an emphasis on identification of N emission hotspots. Our review reports a large uncertainty in the amount of N lost as ammonia from excreta and manure storage, as well as N losses via nitrate and DON leaching. We also found that another major N loss pathway (18%), soil N2 emissions, has not yet been measured. In order to summarize the available information, we use a virtual pastoral farm, with characteristics and management practices obtained from a real farm, Kapiti Research Station in Kenya. For outlining N flows at this virtual farm, we used published data, data from global studies, satellite imagery and geographic information system (GIS) tools. Our results show that N inputs in pastoral systems are dominated by atmospheric N deposition (˜80%), while inputs due to biological nitrogen fixation seems to play a smaller role. A major N loss pathway is nitrogen leaching (nitrate &gt; DON) from pastures (33%). Cattle enclosures (bomas), where animals are kept during night, represent N emissions hotspots, representing 16% of the total N losses from the system. N losses via ammonia volatilization and N2O were four and three orders of magnitude higher from bomas than from the pasture, respectively. Based on our results, we further identify future research requirements and highlight the urgent need for experimental data collection to quantify nitrogen losses from manure in animal congregation areas. Such information is needed to improve our understanding on N cycling in pastoral systems in semiarid regions and to provide practical recommendations for managers that can help with decision-making on management strategies in pastoral systems in semiarid savannas. © 2021 International Livestock Research Institute.

Here we first develop an analytical framework for assessing the Peruvian initiatives of conservation incentives. We then identify six ongoing interventions that have introduced incentives conditional upon compliance with voluntary environmental commitments. We collected information from secondary sources and conducted semi-structured interviews with thirty national- and local-level stakeholders. We scrutinized the extent to which such initiatives featured impact-oriented design and implementation elements, as typically recommended in the state-of-the-art literature on Payment for Environmental Services (PES) and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). We found only limited adoption of such recommendations, including spatial targeting, payment differentiation, enforced conditionality, and customized measures nurturing locally perceived equity and transparency. We argue, supported by a still incipient rigorous evidence from impact evaluations, that suboptimal design and implementation choices probably have influenced outcomes towards limiting the sought-for environmental and welfare impacts. We discuss three critical aspects for upscaling: overcoming financial and legal constraints, strategic involvement of non-government stakeholders, and more impact-oriented design of the interventions. © 2021 The Authors",Climate services; Deforestation; Environmental policy; Hydrological services; Payment for environmental services,analytical framework; climate change; deforestation; ecosystem service; environmental policy; incentive; nature conservation; stakeholder; Peru

Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multinomial logit model to understand the determinants of the level of adoption of adaptation strategies. The results showed that, irrespective of gender, majority of farmers perceived climate change as extended period of droughts, shortened duration of rains, increased frequency of strong winds and increased day and night temperatures. While climate change perception was similar between men and women, choice of adaptation strategies differed significantly in most instances. Women farmers were generally low adopters of crop and varieties-related strategies, soil and water conservation technics (contour farming, use of organic manure), etc., compare to men. Notably, being the household head, age and the availability of free labor were found to positively increased farmers’ probability of adopting many adaptation strategies. The study recommends improving women’s access and control of production resources (land, labor) as means to improving their adoption of adaptation strategies. © 2021, The Author(s).",Adaptation; Climate change; Gender; Mali; Perception,adaptive management; agricultural development; climate change; legume; probability; Cinzana; Mali; Mali; Segou; Segou

Dimuon pairs are measured in the fiducial region pT,μ > 4 GeV, |ημ| < 2.4, invariant mass mμμ > 10 GeV, and pT,μμ < 2 GeV. The primary background from single-dissociative processes is extracted from the data using a template fitting technique. Differential cross sections are presented as a function of mμμ, absolute pair rapidity (|yμμ|), scattering angle in the dimuon rest frame (|cos $μμ∗|), and the colliding photon energies. The total cross section of the UPC γγ → μ+μ- process in the fiducial volume is measured to be σfidμμ = 34.1±0.3(stat.)±0.7(syst.) μb. Generally good agreement is found with calculations from STARlight, which incorporate the leading-order Breit-Wheeler process with no final-state effects, albeit differences between the measurements and theoretical expectations are observed. In particular, the measured cross sections at larger |yμμ| are found to be about 10-20% larger in data than in the calculations, suggesting the presence of larger fluxes of photons in the initial state. Modification of the dimuon cross sections in the presence of forward and/or backward neutron production is also studied and is found to be associated with a harder incoming photon spectrum, consistent with expectations. © 2021 CERN.",,

Fear of predation restricts the development of prey and promotes inducible defense in prey communities for the survival. Motivated by this fact, we investigate the dynamics of a Leslie–Gower predator prey model with group defense in a fearful prey. We obtain conditions under which system possess unique global-in-time solutions and determine all the biological feasible states of the system. Local stability is analyzed by linearization technique and Lyapunov direct method has been applied for global stability analysis of steady states. We show the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation and its direction at the vicinity of coexisting equilibrium point for temporal model. We consider random movement in species and establish conditions for the stability of the system in the presence of diffusion. We derive conditions for existence of non-constant steady states and Turing instability at coexisting population state of diffusive system. Incorporating indirect prey taxis with the assumption that the predator moves toward the smell of prey rather than random movement gives rise to taxis-driven inhomogeneous Hopf bifurcation in predator–prey model. Numerical simulations are intended to demonstrate the role of biological as well as physical drivers on pattern formation that go beyond analytical conclusions. © 2021, The Author(s).",Fear response; Group defense; Indirect prey taxis; Pattern formation; Predator–prey model,Bioinformatics; Ecology; Hopf bifurcation; Network security; System stability; Equilibrium point; Global stability analysis; Global-in-time solution; Linearization technique; Lyapunov direct method; Predator-prey modeling; Temporal modeling; Turing instability; Predator prey systems

As rural households in developing countries largely depend on agriculture, climatic shocks have the potential to undermine food security. In this paper, we explore how crop resistance contribute to household resilience in extreme weather events. As case study, we used cassava and sweetpotato, two root and tuber crops (RTCs), in the context of super-typhoon Ompong that wreaked havoc in the northern parts of the Philippines in 2018. Primary data were collected from 423 households who were affected by the super-typhoon. Methodologically, we employed a multivariate probit model to jointly estimate various household disaster responses, and applied propensity score matching techniques to control for potential endogeneity. The findings suggest that RTCs can contribute to households' resilience capacity due to their resistance to climatic shocks being underground crops. In addition, RTCs appear to be important in influencing the households’ responses to typhoon. Our findings suggest that RTC cultivation reduces the need to resort to negative coping strategies, such as using household savings and requesting assistance from neighbors and friends, and that higher consumption of sweetpotato is linked to longer spells of reduced mobility. Furthermore, in the case of super-typhoon Ompong, affected households exploited the short production cycle of sweetpotato and cassava and planted them in the typhoon aftermath, a strategy that helped to gain faster access to food. Based on these findings some policy recommendations are proposed. © 2021 The Author(s)",Crop resilience; Disaster response; Food security; Philippines; Root and tuber crops,

While several connect inefficiency in the lab to specific constraints on decision-making (e.g. information asymmetries), few connect behavior in the lab to behavior and decision-making structures in the field. We study both efficiency and the decision-making process in semi-nomadic pastoralist households in Senegal with detailed survey data, vignettes, and public goods games. We find that inefficiency in a public goods game is correlated with larger gender gaps in milk production, an indicator of productive inefficiency at home. However, households that behave more efficiently in the lab report less collaborative decision-making at home. Our results suggest that lab games between spouses are measuring behavior meaningful to field outcomes, but that collaborative decision-making is not necessary to achieve efficiency. © 2021 The Author(s)",,

Methods: This retrospective observational study included a multicenter series of consecutive patients with SCC of the larynx diagnosed between 1 January 2009 and 31 July 2018, whose pretreatment blood tests were available and included the parameters necessary for the calculation of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the H-index. Their association with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was measured. Results: A total of 231 patients were eligible for the present analysis (median [range] age, 68 [37-96] years; 191 [82.7%] men). The median follow-up was 73 months. In multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, increasing age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.07 per year; 95% CI, 1.04-1.09), advanced pT stage (aHR = 1.71 95% CI: 1.07-2.71), and having close or positive surgical margins (aHR = 2.01; 95% CI: 1.21-3.33) were significantly associated with poor OS. Among blood parameters, a higher neutrophil count was a strong predictor of both worse DFS (aHR for recurrence/death = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.24-4.40) and OS (aHR for death = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.51-4.71). Among inflammatory blood indexes, while NLR was not significantly associated with DFS or OS, patients with H-index ≥8.37 showed a higher aHR for both recurrence/death (2.82; 95% CI: 1.65-4.79) and death (2.22; 95% CI: 1.26-3.89).

The COVID-19 pandemic represents a novels shock to livestock systems and may result in indirect effects on livestock emissions and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Due to the pandemic in 2020, extensive pastoralist livestock systems in Northern Kenya were subjected to restrictions on movement, increased costs of transportation, and closure of livestock markets. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on GHG emissions from livestock systems in Northern Kenya using proxy data and a three-part framework based on changes in 1) herd size, 2) feed availability, and 3) livestock movement. METHODS: We evaluated changes in GHG emissions from livestock systems in Northern Kenya due to the COVID-19 pandemic based on proxy data from crowd-sourced market data, household panel surveys, and remote sensing data on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Proxy data were obtained before the pandemic in 2019 and after the pandemic in 2020 to compare between years and evaluate the indirect effects of the pandemic and associated restrictions on livestock GHG emissions using the three-part framework. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall GHG emissions from livestock in Northern Kenya have decreased due to the pandemic and this was largely driven by reductions in herd size. This reduction in GHG emissions occurred despite an increase in GHG emissions from livestock associated with higher feed availability. Decreased livestock movement due to the pandemic contributed to reductions in GHG emissions from livestock, but such reductions were likely to be small due to limited need for livestock to travel longer distances under the prevailing conditions of high feed availability. SIGNIFICANCE: This research shows that assessments of changes in GHG emissions from livestock systems due to shock events can be conducted successfully based on proxy data and the three-part framework developed here. We found that shock events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may lead to unexpected results with respect to the direction and magnitude of changes in livestock emissions depending on contextual factors and environmental conditions. Thus, we call for more spatially explicit and continued data collection to assess and monitor the consequences of shock events on GHG emissions from livestock and related SDGs in Africa. © 2021",Climate change; Crowd-sourced data; Feed availability; Greenhouse gas emissions; Herd size; Panel survey data; Pastoralism,assessment method; COVID-19; environmental conditions; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; NDVI; pollutant source; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; Kenya; Sub-Saharan Africa; Varanidae

Building a new ship takes at months and is very expensive, and selecting a prospective shipyard demands the shipowners to have a wealth of experience and knowledge. We develop an improved fuzzy AHP (IFAHP) based game-theoretic model to analyze two competitive shipyards. This model allows us to conduct pairwise comparisons on risks of selecting competitive shipyards. A case study in which two shipyards offering prospective services to the shipowners is conducted with several rounds of expert consultations.

Our study evaluates the performance of three winter wheat cultivars and eight winter faba bean genotypes (experimental inbred lines) sown as replacement row intercrops with sole cropping comparisons. Detailed agronomic, physiological and soil-based measurements were taken over three consecutive autumn-sown seasons at two sites (a marginal versus a fertile soil) in central Germany. This study aimed to contribute to our understanding of key traits required to achieve highly complementary and well-performing intercrops. Faba bean plus wheat intercrops yielded higher than sole crop equivalents at both sites, but more so at the marginal site (34 % > 12 %). High intercrop yields were associated with high wheat component yields. Such stands included faba bean genotypes that exhibited low leaf area index (LAI) values and low plant height. Tall and large faba beans i.e. with high vegetative biomass led to excessive lodging, both as a sole crop and when intercropped. To some extent, this concealed effects of faba bean genotype trait variation that would have otherwise been visible had lodging not occurred. The expression of these traits was heavily influenced by variation in environmental conditions. At the less fertile site, even tall intercropped faba beans showed relatively lower vegetative biomass, which promoted intercropped wheat and led to superior overyielding values and relative yield total. While site-specific differences are key, German winter faba beans need further genetic improvement to refrain from superfluous biomass growth when water resources are plentiful. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Intercropping; Overyielding; Trait expression; Triticum aestivum; Vicia faba,biomass; crop yield; genetic analysis; genotype; intercropping; legume; water resource; wheat; yield response; Germany; Triticum aestivum; Vicia faba

We use optical satellite imagery to document five previously unexamined surge events of Sít' Kusá (Turner Glacier) in the St. Elias Mountains of Alaska from 1983 to 2013. Surge events had an average recurrence interval of ~5 years, making it the shortest known regular recurrence interval in the world. Surge events appear to initiate in the winter, with speeds reaching up to ~25 m d-1. The surges propagate down-glacier over ~2 years, resulting in maximum thinning of ~100 m in the reservoir zone and comparable thickening at the terminus. Collectively, the rapid recurrence interval, winter initiation and down-glacier propagation suggest Sít' Kusá's surges are driven by periodic changes in subglacial hydrology and glacier sliding. Elevation change observations from the northern tributary show a kinematic disconnect above and below an icefall located 23 km from the terminus. We suggest the kinematic disconnect inhibits drawdown from the accumulation zone above the icefall, which leads to a steady flux of ice into the reservoir zone, and contributes to the glacier's exceptionally short recurrence interval.

Methods: We analyzed data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from 2012 to 2016, excluding 2014. For Black, Hispanic, and low-income (<$35,000/year) adults 18-64 years of age, we estimated multivariable regression adjusted pre- (2012-2013) to post-ACA (2015-2016) percentage point changes in uninsurance for each U.S. state. We compared absolute and relative changes and the proportion remaining uninsured post-ACA across states. We also examined whether state-level variation in coverage gains was associated with changes in forgoing needed care due to cost. Results: The range in the percentage point reduction in uninsurance varied substantially across states: 19-fold for Black (0.9-17.4), 18-fold for Hispanic (1.2-21.5), and 23-fold for low-income (1.0-27.8) adults. State-level variation in changes in uninsurance relative to baseline uninsurance rates also varied substantially. In some states, more than one quarter of Black, one half of Hispanic, and approaching one half of low-income adults remained uninsured after full implementation of the ACA. Compared with states in the lowest quintile of change in coverage, states in the highest quintile experienced greater improvements in ability to see a physician. Conclusions: Performance on reducing uninsurance for Black, Hispanic, and low-income Americans under the ACA varied substantially among U.S. states with some making substantial progress and others making little.

We look at how urban proximity—measured as travel time—affects the decisions and productivity of milk farmers located in rural production zones serving fresh milk to the capital Addis Ababa. Using an instrumental variable approach, we find that with each additional hour of travel time, farmers’ milk productivity per cow is reduced, on average, by almost 1 L per day or by 26%. When trying to disentangle the underlying mechanisms (and controlling for transaction costs), we find that farmers’ inclusion in “modern” value chains and their access to commercial milk buyers and milk processing companies drive the urban proximity effect. As only a limited number of farmers have access to such value chains in developing countries, measures to make dairy value chains more inclusive to remote—often poorer—farmers can, therefore, have important benefits for them, for the performance of the dairy sector in Ethiopia, and for the process of agricultural transformation as a whole. © 2021 The Authors.

Of particular use would be well documented, reproducible methods based on openly accessible data and tools. Such methods should provide an accurate estimate of the state of conservation of diversity, identifying gaps in current conservation systems, while providing a benchmark against which to measure success, including determining when conservation goals have been met. Here we introduce GapAnalysis, an open source R package developed to support the assessment of the state of conservation of taxa, both ex situ (in genebanks, botanic gardens and other repositories) and in situ (in protected natural areas). The eco-geographic variation maintained in conservation repositories and that present within protected natural areas is compared with the full extent of eco-geographic variation predicted within species' native ranges. Eco-geographic conservation gaps are identified, and taxa are then prioritized for further action. The package enables users to quickly determine conservation status, gaps and priorities for as few as one to as many as thousands of taxa, for any wild flora or fauna for which occurrence data and species distribution models are available. To demonstrate the use of GapAnalysis, we provide case studies for wild plant taxa in the genera Capsicum L. and Cucurbita L, with an accompanying online R tutorial for three of the Cucurbita species. © 2021 The Authors.

In this letter, we propose a novel framework that considers these requirements simultaneously by integrating the notion of effective capacity (EC) into orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) cloud-radio access networks (C-RAN) where the users select the distributed radio remote heads (RRHs) based on their specific delay requirements to transmit over different subcarriers cooperatively. Consequently, an optimization problem is defined to maximize the EC under the average peak power constraint and the delay requirements. The problem is combinatorial and non-convex and an algorithm based on the duality and alternating optimization algorithms is proposed, which is efficiently computed with good accuracy. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate that the proposed solution has a near-optimal performance and there is a trade-off between delay and spectral efficiency. Moreover, the cooperation between RRHs can considerably improve the system throughput. © 1997-2012 IEEE.",CoMP; delay; Effective capacity; user-centric C-RAN,Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Frequency division multiple access; Optimization; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Radio access networks; Alternating optimizations; High spectral efficiency; Near-optimal performance; Orthogonal frequency division multiple access; Peak-power constraints; Spectral efficiencies; Ubiquitous communication; Wireless communication network; 5G mobile communication systems

It examines how far, and through what institutional mechanisms, these interactions are producing a joined-up transnational regime, based on a shared normative commitment to combat illegal logging and cooperative efforts to implement and enforce it. The paper argues that the experimentalist architecture of the EU FLEGT initiative has fostered productive, mutually reinforcing interactions both with public timber legality regulation in other consumer countries and with private certification schemes. But this emerging regime remains highly polyarchic, with broad scope for autonomous initiatives by NGOs and private service providers, along with national governments, international organizations, and multi-donor partnerships. Hence horizontal integration and coordination within it depend on a series of institutional mechanisms, some of which are distinctively experimentalist, while others can also be found in more conventional regimes. These mechanisms include cross-referencing and reciprocal endorsement of rules and standards; recursive learning through information pooling and peer review of implementation experience; public oversight and joint assessment of private certification and legality verification schemes; and the “penalty default” effect of public legality regulation in consumer countries, which have pushed both exporting countries and transnational firms to comply with the norms and procedures of the emerging transnational regime.

EVs are a clean mode of transportation with limited driving range. EVs need to be recharged at the charging stations after travelling certain distance to overcome driving range anxiety. Charging stations need to be placed at proper locations to overcome driving range anxiety. Placement of charging stations is an intricate problem involving convolution of transport and distribution network. This work aims to provide a comprehensive review of different planning models for charging station placement thereby providing classification of the models and highlighting characteristics of each model. © 2021 IEEE.,charging stations; electric vehicles; model; planning,Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Global warming; Internal combustion engines; Smart city; Charging station; Driving range; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Energy crisis; Environmental pollutions; Paradigm shifts; Planning models; Vehicle-to-grid

In this study, we documented the main pathways and contexts behind cocoa cultivation in two sites with different histories of cocoa cultivation. We combined official statistics, land-use trajectory, satellite imagery, and the Q-analysis to explore the discourses of country experts in Nicaragua and Peru. The Q-statements were based on an analysis of a set of legal, institutional, social, and technical guidelines that the cocoa cultivation/sector influences or is influenced by. Based on the responses of national experts to 31 statements we found four discourses linking cocoa cultivation and reforestation and deforestation in each country-case study. The enabling and limiting conditions driving tree cover change were a combination of landscape configuration, governance, management/commercialization models, and farmer's knowledge. Overall, between 60 and 64% of the variance was explained by four discourse factors in each country. In Nicaragua, the conditions associated with reforestation were the cocoa-agroforestry model promoted by local organizations/NGOs, the existence of incentives, degree of technical knowledge, access to safe market, and availability of improved genetic material. The circumstances associated with deforestation were the age of the farmers, fluctuation of cocoa beans prices, low productivity of cocoa plantations, and weak legal environmental frameworks. Whereas, in Peru, the main factors connecting cocoa cultivation to reforestation were access to market, degree of experimentation in cocoa, the economic weight of cocoa on family's income, certification processes, the existence of incentives, and the level of organization/association of cocoa farmers. The elements linking cocoa farming to deforestation were the influence of stakeholders in the cocoa value chain, weak legal environmental frameworks, fluctuation of cocoa prices, the existence of private investors, and insecure land tenure rights. This article demonstrated the utility of discourse analysis, through its application to two contrasting country case-studies, to elucidate the conditions that might minimize the deforestation footprint of cocoa cultivation and maximize its role as an agent for reforestation/restoration in the agricultural landscape of cocoa-growing areas in Latin America. © Copyright © 2021 Orozco-Aguilar, López-Sampson, Leandro-Muñoz, Robiglio, Reyes, Bordeaux, Sepúlveda and Somarriba.",cocoa farming; deforestation; landscape; reforestation; restoration; tree cover,

In these areas, remote sensing can represent an important detection and monitoring process to predict landslide occurrence in space and time, particularly satellite rainfall products that have improved in terms of accuracy and resolution in recent times. Surprisingly, only a few studies have investigated the capability and effectiveness of these products in landslide prediction in reducing the impact of this hazard on the population. We have performed a comparative study of ground- and satellite-based rainfall products for landslide prediction in India by using empirical rainfall thresholds derived from the analysis of historical landslide events. Specifically, we have tested Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and SM2RAIN-ASCAT satellite rainfall products, and their merging, at daily and hourly temporal resolution, and Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) daily rain gauge observations. A catalogue of 197 rainfall-induced landslides that occurred throughout India in the 13-year period between April 2007 and October 2019 has been used. Results indicate that satellite rainfall products outperform ground observations thanks to their better spatial (0.1 vs. 0.25) and temporal (hourly vs. daily) resolutions. The better performance is obtained through the merged GPM and SM2RAIN-ASCAT products, even though improvements in reproducing the daily rainfall (e.g. overestimation of the number of rainy days) are likely needed. These findings open a new avenue for using such satellite products in landslide early warning systems, particularly in poorly gauged areas. © Copyright:",,Developing countries; Forecasting; Hazards; Landslides; Rain gages; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soil moisture; Comparative studies; Early Warning System; Global precipitation measurements; Ground observations; Landslide prediction; Rainfall induced landslides; Satellite rainfalls; Temporal resolution; Rain; ASCAT; comparative study; early warning system; ground-based measurement; landslide; observational method; prediction; rainfall; remote sensing; satellite data; seismic hazard; India

Livestock keepers have also singled out poor animal health service delivery, which is largely the domain of the public sector, as the major constraint to improving animal health and productivity. In the current study, we describe the animal health service delivery system and compile from five questionnaire surveys involving 4,162 livestock keepers to characterize animal health service delivery in Ethiopia. The mapping of the animal health service delivery system along the livestock value chain clearly highlights the role of informal animal health services and variations of roles of the private sector. Also, the survey results clearly showed that livestock keepers' access to, use of and satisfaction with animal health services significantly varied across livestock production systems, geographic locations, socioeconomic strata, and service providers. Livestock keepers in crop-livestock and agropastoral systems had 5.5 (odds ratio = 5.453, P = 0.000) and 2.5 (odds ratio = 2.482, P = 0.000) times more access to services in reference to the pastoral system. In reference to private veterinary clinics, livestock keepers reported higher access to services provided by all the other service providers, particularly to services provided by extension agents, drug shops and CAHWs. Similarly, better access was reported by male than female (odds ratio = 1.098; P = 0.025) and wealthier than poorer (odds ratios = 1.40–1.79; P = 0.000) farmers and pastoralists. In general, low access to services was reported, 32.7, 25.2, and 19.3% of the respondents reporting access in crop-livestock, agropastoral and pastoral systems, respectively. Effective demand for services was evaluated through proxy variables, namely number of visits to service providers and health expenditures over a year. Highland farmers used the services more often than pastoralists (odds ratio = 2.86; P = 0.000), but pastoralists' expenses were significantly higher. Wealth (measured by livestock owned), gender and age also had significant effects on the use of services and expenditure on services. Satisfaction with services was evaluated based on four measures, namely availability (av), accessibility (ac), quality (qw), and timeliness (tm) of services. The average scores (out of 10) for av, ac, qw, and tm were 6.1, 5.9, 6.2, and 5.7, respectively. Principal component analysis was conducted to derive the latent variable “satisfaction” from the four measures, extracted only one factor, indicating the four variables are measuring the same construct (satisfaction). Regressing the latent variable satisfaction on the four measures gave significant (P = 0.000) b values of 0.22, 0.20, 0.13, and 0.14 for av, ac, qw, and tm, respectively, indicating strong relationships between the latent variable satisfaction and its measures. There was a significant dissatisfaction with the public sector, with average scores of 0.06 and 0.19 for the public and private service providers, respectively. It can be concluded that livestock keepers in remote regions of the country, pastoralists, women, poorer, and older livestock keepers have less access to services. Satisfaction with services is low to medium and the major concerns of livestock keepers appears to be availability and accessibility of services. Based on our findings, we recommend an integrated, multi-sectoral involvement to improve the veterinary service delivery through improved veterinary infrastructure, public-private partnership, and animal health information system across the various livestock production systems. © Copyright © 2021 Gizaw, Woldehanna, Anteneh, Ayledo, Awol, Gebreyohannes, Gebremedhin and Wieland.",Ethiopia; gender; health services; PCA; systems,age; agricultural worker; animal health; Article; crop; Ethiopia; female; gender; geography; health care cost; health care delivery; human; livestock; male; public-private partnership; satisfaction; veterinary clinic

The rapid spread of dengue could lead to a global pandemic, and so the geographical extent of this spread needs to be assessed and predicted. There are also reasons to suggest that transmission of dengue from non-human primates in tropical forest cycles is being underestimated. We investigate the fine-scale geographic changes in transmission risk since the late 20th century, and take into account for the first time the potential role that primate biogeography and sylvatic vectors play in increasing the disease transmission risk. We apply a biogeographic framework to the most recent global dataset of dengue cases. Temporally stratified models describing favorable areas for vector presence and for disease transmission are combined. Our models were validated for predictive capacity, and point to a significant broadening of vector presence in tropical and non-tropical areas globally. We show that dengue transmission is likely to spread to affected areas in China, Papua New Guinea, Australia, USA, Colombia, Venezuela, Madagascar, as well as to cities in Europe and Japan. These models also suggest that dengue transmission is likely to spread to regions where there are presently no or very few reports of occurrence. According to our results, sylvatic dengue cycles account for a small percentage of the global extent of the human case record, but could be increasing in relevance in Asia, Africa, and South America. The spatial distribution of factors favoring transmission risk in different regions of the world allows for distinct management strategies to be prepared. © 2021 Aliaga-Samanez et al.",,Aedes aegypti; Aedes albopictus; animal experiment; animal model; Aotus; Article; Australia; biogeography; Callicebus; Cebus; China; Colombia; dengue; disease model; disease transmission; Equus africanus; Europe; Haplorhini; mosquito; nonhuman; Saguinus; spider monkey; tropics; virus infection; Aedes; animal; dengue; Dengue virus; epidemic; geography; human; mosquito vector; physiology; primate; veterinary medicine; virology; Aedes; Animals; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Disease Outbreaks; Geography; Humans; Mosquito Vectors; Primates; Viral Zoonoses

The kinetics of stomatal conductance (gs) is hypothesized to be key to plant productivity and water use efficiency (WUE). Using step-changes in light intensity, we studied the diversity of light-induced gs kinetics in relation to stomatal anatomy in five banana genotypes (Musa spp.) and modeled the impact of both diffusional and biochemical limitations on photosynthesis (A). The dominant A limiting factor was the diffusional limitation associated with gs kinetics. All genotypes exhibited a strong limitation of A by gs, indicating a priority for water saving. Moreover, significant genotypic differences in gs kinetics and gs limitations of A were observed. For two contrasting genotypes, the impact of differential gs kinetics was further investigated under realistic diurnally fluctuating light conditions and at the whole-plant level. Genotype-specific stomatal kinetics observed at the leaf level was corroborated at whole-plant level by transpiration dynamics, validating that genotype-specific responses are still maintained despite differences in gs control at different locations in the leaf and across leaves. However, under diurnally fluctuating light conditions the impact of gs speediness on A and intrinsic (iWUE) depended on time of day. During the afternoon there was a setback in kinetics: absolute gs and gs responses to light were damped, strongly limiting A and impacting diurnal iWUE. We conclude the impact of differential gs kinetics depended on target light intensity, magnitude of change, gs prior to the change in light intensity, and particularly time of day. © The Author(s) 2021.",,

Data on seedling survival were collected at least six months after tree seedlings were planted. To understand how planting and management practices influence tree planting across the different socioeconomic and biophysical contexts, both household level and individual tree level data were collected. Household level data included socio-economic and biophysical characteristics of the households while tree specific data included when the tree seedling was planted, where it was planted, the management practices employed and whether surviving.

Methods for predictive health monitoring are typically developed for large-scale gas turbines and have often focused on single systems. In an effort to enable fleet-level health monitoring of micro gas turbines, this work presents a novel data-driven approach for predicting system degradation over time. The approach utilises operational data from real installations and is not dependent on data from a reference system. The problem was solved in two steps by: 1) estimating the degradation from time-dependent variables and 2) forecasting into the future using only running hours. Linear regression technique is employed both for the estimation and forecasting of degradation. The method was evaluated on five different systems and it is shown that the result is consistent (r>0.8) with an existing method that computes corrected values based on data from a reference system, and the forecasting had a similar performance as the estimation model using only running hours as an input. © 2021 The Authors",Fleet monitoring; Health monitoring; Machine learning; Micro gas turbine; Power generation; Predictive maintenance,

Analytical approaches for diffusion channel modeling are limited to simple and specific geometries and boundary conditions. Also, simulation- and experiment-driven methods are very time-consuming and computationally complex. In this paper, the channel model for DMCN employing the fundamental concentration Green's function (CGF) is characterized. A general homogeneous boundary condition framework is considered that includes any linear reaction systems at the boundaries in the environment. To obtain the CGF for a general DMCN including multiple transmitters, receivers, and other objects with arbitrary geometries and boundary conditions, a semi-analytical method (SAM) is proposed. The CGF linear integral equation (CLIE) is analytically derived. By employing the numerical method of moments, the problem of CGF derivation from CLIE is transformed into an inverse matrix problem. Moreover, a sequential SAM is proposed that converts the inversion problem of a large matrix into multiple smaller matrices reducing the computational complexity. Particle-based simulator confirms the results obtained from the proposed SAM. The convergence and run time for the proposed method are examined. Further, the error probability of a simple diffusion-based molecular communication system is analyzed and examined using the proposed method. © 1972-2012 IEEE.",channel models; Diffusion Processes; Green's second identity; method of moments; molecular communications,Boundary conditions; Complex networks; Diffusion; Integral equations; Matrix algebra; Method of moments; Numerical methods; Analytical approach; Arbitrary geometry; Error probabilities; Homogeneous boundary condition; Linear integral equations; Molecular communication; Multiple transmitters; Semianalytical methods; Inverse problems

The positive phase of the 2015–2016 El Niño Southern Oscillation resulted in unprecedented heat and low precipitation in the tropics with substantial impacts on the global carbon cycle. The role of African tropical forests is uncertain as their responses to short-term drought and temperature anomalies have yet to be determined using on-the-ground measurements. African tropical forests may be particularly sensitive because they exist in relatively dry conditions compared with Amazonian or Asian forests, or they may be more resistant because of an abundance of drought-adapted species. Here, we report responses of structurally intact old-growth lowland tropical forests inventoried within the African Tropical Rainforest Observatory Network (AfriTRON). We use 100 long-term inventory plots from six countries each measured at least twice prior to and once following the 2015–2016 El Niño event. These plots experienced the highest temperatures and driest conditions on record. The record temperature did not significantly reduce carbon gains from tree growth or significantly increase carbon losses from tree mortality, but the record drought did significantly decrease net carbon uptake. Overall, the long-term biomass increase of these forests was reduced due to the El Niño event, but these plots remained a live biomass carbon sink (0.51 ± 0.40 Mg C ha−1 y−1) despite extreme environmental conditions. Our analyses, while limited to African tropical forests, suggest they may be more resistant to climatic extremes than Amazonian and Asian forests. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

The proposed framework paves the way for the development of engineered EV-mediated communication networks and enables novel approaches, perspectives, tools, and metrics to reveal the principles and emergent properties of biological EV-mediat-ed signaling networks the understanding of which is still obscure. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",,Nanotechnology; Signaling; Biological information; Experimental techniques; Intercellular signaling; Mediated Communication; Molecular communication; Network frameworks; Signaling networks; Therapeutic Application; Cell signaling

One reason for this is the disruption of food marketing systems and subsequent changes in farm and consumer prices. Based on primary data in Ethiopia collected just before the start and a few months into the pandemic, we assess changes in farm and consumer prices of four major vegetables and the contribution of different segments of the rural-urban value chain in urban retail price formation. We find large, but heterogeneous, price changes for different vegetables with relatively larger changes seen at the farm level, compared to the consumer level, leading to winners and losers among local vegetable farmers due to pandemic-related trade disruptions. We further note that despite substantial hurdles in domestic trade reported by most value chain agents, increases in marketing—and especially transportation—costs have not been the major contributor to overall changes in retail prices. Marketing margins even declined for half of the vegetables studied. The relatively small changes in marketing margins overall indicate the resilience of these domestic value chains during the pandemic in Ethiopia. © 2021 The Authors.

Food system interventions and policies give rise to synergies and trade-offs that emerge over time due to the dynamic nature and interconnections of system elements. Analysis of an entire food system is necessary to identify synergies that bring simultaneous benefits and mitigate trade-offs, both short- and long-term. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to inform the sustainable transformation of food systems by identifying short- and long-term synergies and trade-offs in the climate-smart village (CSV) Lawra-Jirapa in northern Ghana under the current practices, technologies, policies, and trends of population growth, extreme events, and climate change impacts. METHODS: We develop a system dynamics model to simulate the food system in the CSV between 2011 and 2060. We apply the climate-smart agriculture (CSA) approach as a diagnostic tool to the CSV system to reveal the short- and long-term trade-offs and synergies between the CSA goals. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The simulation results reveal short-term progress towards the goal of increased productivity and income, with trade-offs in the goals of GHG removal, climate adaptation, and resilience. In the long term, post-2035, current agriculture practices, technologies, and policies inside and outside the CSV boundaries result in trade-offs across all three CSA goals, and progress made towards these goals is reversed. The CSV system behaviour, thus, exhibits a “better before worse” pattern. SIGNIFICANCE: The analysis demonstrates an approach, which considers simultaneously all three CSA goals, to identify synergies and mitigate trade-offs in an entire food system. The findings suggest that understanding the dynamics of food systems is a precursor to their sustainable transformation. This transformation will entail changes to the food system's goals and structure with equal attention to short- and long-term outcomes. © 2021 The Author(s)",Climate change; Food security; Smallholder agriculture; System dynamics modelling; Systems thinking; West Africa,adaptive management; agricultural production; alternative agriculture; climate change; trade-off; Ghana

However, these were derived for industrialized livestock farms and do not represent conditions of smallholder farms (small, low-producing livestock breeds, poor feed quality, feed scarcity). Here, we present the first measurements of CH4 and N2O emissions from cattle-manure heaps representing feeding practices typical for smallholder farms in the highlands of East Africa: 1) cattle fed below maintenance energy requirements to represent feed scarcity, and 2) cattle fed tropical forage grasses (Napier, Rhodes, Brachiaria). Sub-maintenance feeding reduced cumulative manure N2O emissions compared to cattle receiving sufficient feed but did not change EFN2O. Sub-maintenance feeding did not affect cumulative manure CH4 emissions or EFCH4. When cattle were fed tropical forage grasses, cumulative manure N2O emissions did not differ between diets, but manure EFN2O from Brachiaria and Rhodes diets were lower than the IPCC EFN2O for solid storage (1%, 2019 Refinement of IPCC Guidelines). Manure CH4 emissions were lower in the Rhodes grass diet than when feeding Napier or Brachiaria, and manure EFCH4 from all three grasses were lower than the IPCC default (4.4 g CH4 kg−1 VS, 2019 Refinement of IPCC Guidelines). Regression analysis revealed that manure N concentration and C:N were important drivers of N2O emissions, with low N concentrations and high C:N reducing N2O emissions. Our results show that IPCC EFs overestimate excreta GHG emissions, which calls for additional measurements to develop localized EFs for smallholder livestock systems in SSA. © 2021 The Author(s)",Brachiaria; Greenhouse gases; Napier; Rhodes; Solid storage; Sub-Saharan Africa,Agriculture; Feeding; Fertilizers; Maintenance; Manures; Regression analysis; Tropics; Brachiaria; Cattle manures; CH$-4$; Emission factors; Greenhouses gas; N$-2$/O; Napi; Rhode; Solid storage; Sub-saharan africa; Greenhouse gases; cattle; foraging behavior; grass; greenhouse gas; manure; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; smallholder; agricultural land; animal experiment; article; Brachiaria; cattle manure; controlled study; diet; feeding; forage; grass; greenhouse gas; Kenya; livestock; nonhuman; practice guideline; animal; bovine; Kenya; manure; plant breeding; Kenya; Brachiaria; Chloris gayana; Poaceae; methane; nitrous oxide; Animals; Cattle; Kenya; Manure; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Plant Breeding

Therefore, explaining the nature and variation in the relationship between them will advance our understanding of democratic governance. Existing research has primarily drawn attention to how exchange of resources shapes these relationships largely neglecting the role of contextual conditions. Our contribution is to examine whether parties’ structured interactions with different categories of interest groups vary systematically with the pattern of party competition at the level of policy dimensions. First, we argue that higher party fragmentation in a policy space makes organisational ties to interest groups more likely, due to fears of voter loss and splinter groups. Second, we expect higher polarisation between parties on a policy dimension to make ties to relevant groups less likely due to increased electoral costs. We find support for both expectations when analysing new data on 116 party units in 13 mature democracies along nine different policy dimensions. Our findings underline the value of considering the strategic context in which parties and interest groups interact to understand their relationship. The study sheds new light on parties and interest groups as intermediaries in democracy and contributes to a new research agenda connecting interest group research with studies of parties’ policy positions and responsiveness. © 2020 The Authors.

Development strategies focusing simultaneously on adaptive farming, productivity, and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-known as climate-smart agriculture (CSA) strategies-are key to responding to these challenges. For almost a decade, within the framework of Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), World Agroforestry (ICRAF), and its partners have been using Participatory Action Research (PAR) to fully engage key stakeholders in co-creating such CSA development strategies. This includes the testing of Agricultural Research for Development (AR4D) CSA scalability options. The multidisciplinary teams include the National Research and Extension Systems (NARES), national meteorological services (NMS), non-profit organizations (NGOs), and local radio programs, among others. The CCAFS-West Africa Program, World Agroforestry-West and Central Africa (ICRAF-WCA), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), University of Reading, and Centre Régional de Formation et d'Application en Agro-météorologie et Hydrologie Opérationnelle (AGRHYMET) provide technical backstopping to the national teams. Climate information (CI) was used as an entry point to inform the development of CSA technologies and practices within Climate-Smart Villages (CSV). This groundwork has led to a greater understanding of three critical factors for successful CSV implementation: (1) Building strong partnerships to co-design and develop agricultural systems that improve ecosystem and population resilience, (2) Key stakeholders (researchers, farmers, development agents, and students) capacity strengthening through vocational and academic training, and (3) Using CI for livelihood planning at all scales. These three factors support more effective identification and testing of agricultural technologies and practices addressing climate variability and change at plot, community, and landscape levels. This paper discusses the PAR-CSA methodology and parameters for evaluation, including biophysical and social change. Keys to success, including communication, knowledge sharing tools, and scalability are also discussed. Finally, future opportunities for improvement are presented, including knowledge product development, CSA policy and investment planning, capacity building, further engagement of the private sector, and additional research on existing practices and tools. © Copyright © 2021 Bayala, Ky-Dembele, Dayamba, Somda, Ouédraogo, Diakite, Chabi, Alhassane, Bationo, Buah, Sanogo, Tougiani, Traore, Zougmoré and Rosenstock.",adaptation; ecosystem; farming system; livelihood; mitigation; resilience,

However, what motivates vote-seeking politicians to pursue climate policies remains remarkably unclear, as the climate politics literature suggests that climate policies are usually not perceived as a vote winner. The present article revisits this issue and argues that a better understanding of the relationship between electoral competition and climate policy making requires taking into account differences both in party ideologies and in policy characteristics. Studying twenty-nine democracies between 1990 and 2016, the analysis finds that climate policy production overall tends to increase as the election approaches due to increases in “soft” policies, such as subsidies, research grants, and information instruments, and relatively stable production rates of “hard” policies like taxes and regulations over the electoral term. Regarding partisan politics, left governments are found to produce more hard, but not more soft, climate policies than center and right governments, especially before elections. This suggests that partisan and electoral incentives are important reference points in the fight against climate change. © 2021 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The GIFT strain of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was mostly farmed by small-scale farmers operating less than one ha of ponds and with lower assets than their non-GIFT counterparts. The GIFT strain had a faster growth rate (27% and 29% faster than that of non-GIFT tilapia in monoculture and polyculture, respectively). Although GIFT and non-GIFT farmers applied different stocking strategies with GIFT farmers growing much smaller fingerlings compared to non-GIFT farmers (7.3 g for GIFT and 9.1 g for non-GIFT, and 17.2 g for GIFT and 20.3 g for non-GIFT in monoculture and polyculture, respectively), yields were statistically different between both strains in monoculture and polyculture (8.1 tons/ha per cycle for GIFT and 6.2 tons/ha per cycle for non-GIFT in monoculture, and 9.3 tons/ha per cycle for GIFT and 7.8 tons/ha per cycle for non-GIFT in polyculture). In polyculture systems, overall polyculture yield was statistically different at the 10% level (12.7 and 10.2 tons/ha for GIFT and non-GIFT ponds). In terms of profitability performance, GIFT tilapia is more profitable and cost-effective than non-GIFT. Findings from this study highlight the importance of adopting culture of high-performance strains to close yield gaps and realize the potential benefits of the GIFT strain. © 2021 The Author(s)",Bangladesh; Genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT); Monoculture; Performance assessment; Polyculture,cichlid; genetic analysis; growth; monoculture; polyculture; profitability; yield response; Bangladesh; Oreochromis niloticus; Tilapia

Within this context, considerable attention has been given to climate-smart agricultural practices (CSA). This study was conducted to investigate the effects of integrating different CSA practices on crop production, soil fertility, and carbon sequestration after being practiced continuously for up to 10 years. The CSA practices include use of soil and water conservation (SWC) structures combined with biological measures, hedgerow planting, crop residue management, grazing management, crop rotation, and perennial crop-based agroforestry systems. The landscapes with CSA interventions were compared to farmers’ business-as-usual practices (i.e., control). Wheat (Triticum sp.) yield was quantified from 245 households. The results demonstrated that yield was 30–45% higher under CSA practices than the control (p < 0.05). The total carbon stored at a soil depth of 1 m was three-to seven-fold higher under CSA landscapes than the control. CSA interventions slightly increased the soil pH and exhibited 2.2–2.6 and 1.7–2.7 times more total nitrogen and plant-available phosphorus content, respectively, than the control. The time series Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) revealed higher soil moisture content under CSA. The findings illustrated the substantial opportunity of integrating CSA practices to build climate change resilience of resource-poor farmers through improving crop yield, reducing nutrient depletion, and mitigating GHG emissions through soil carbon sequestration. © 2021 by the authors.

However, face recognition applications demand high resolution face images for effective feature extraction and comparison. To meet the requirement of face recognition system despite the low resolution face captured, a number of works have been proposed to super-resolve the LR face images. Here, we propose a compact and computationally efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to increase the spatial resolution of an LR face image to obtain a High-Resolution (HR) face image with an upscaling factor of up to $\times 8$ by improving our previous approach. The newly proposed approach, which we refer to as E-ComSupResNet, is an enhanced architecture of our preliminary approach ComSupResNet with multiple enhancements. Contrary to other earlier works, the proposed architecture with a compact network focuses on extracting both low-frequency and high-frequency features along with a reconstruction module. With the introduction of Residual Block (ResBlock), a novel upscaling network is provided, to super-resolve the feature maps for the factor of $\times 2$ , a Global Residual Learning (GRL) and two newly customized loss functions imposing similarity in the new network architecture we obtain superior SR images compared to our earlier network and competing state-of-art approaches. The newly proposed architecture further has $approx$. $1.5~M$ number of parameters as compared to similar earlier work which has more than $57 ~M$ parameters. We further attempt to make the approach generalizable by learning the network in a cross-database setting and training the network on CASIA WebFace dataset while evaluating it both on CelebA and LFW datasets. Through empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the gain in high fidelity reconstruction in terms of Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM) and Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) measures despite the compactness of the model. As another new contribution, we conduct a series of experiments to measure the applicability of obtained SR images using the proposed network through conducting face recognition experiments using a commercial and open source Face Recognition System (FRS) with a clear gain in verification performance over the other existing techniques. © 2019 IEEE.",compact network; face recognition system; Face super-resolution; LPIPS loss,Arts computing; Convolutional neural networks; Face recognition; Image enhancement; Open systems; Security systems; Signal to noise ratio; Computationally efficient; Face recognition experiment; Face recognition systems; Peak signal to noise ratio; Proposed architectures; Stand-off distance (SoD); Structural similarity indices; Surveillance applications; Network architecture

Here we examine the factors that have fostered major dietary shifts across eight countries in the past 70 years. Guided by transition and food-regime theories, we draw on data from diverse disciplines, reviewing post-World War 2 shifts in consumption of three food commodities: farmed tilapia, milk and chicken. We show that large-scale shifts in commodity systems and diets have taken place when public-funded technological innovation is scaled-up by the private sector under supportive state and international policy regimes, highlighting pathways between commodity systems transformation and food-system transitions. Our analysis suggests that the desired sustainability transition will require public policy leadership and private-sector technological innovation alongside consumers who culturally value and can afford healthy, sustainable diets. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,

A direct probe of internal structure is pulsations, and some OB-type stars exhibit pressure modes (β Cep pulsators) or gravity modes (slowly pulsating B-type stars; SPBs); a few rare cases of hybrid β Cep/SPBs occupy a narrow instability strip in the H-R diagram. The most precise fundamental properties of stars are obtained from eclipsing binaries (EBs), and those in clusters with known ages and metallicities provide the most stringent constraints on theory. Here we report the discovery that HD 149834 in the ∼5 Myr cluster NGC 6193 is an EB comprising a hybrid β Cep/SPB pulsator and a highly irradiated low-mass companion. We determine the masses, radii, and temperatures of both stars; the ∼9.7 M o˙ primary resides in the instability strip where hybrid pulsations are theoretically predicted. The presence of both SPB and β Cep pulsations indicates that the system has a near-solar metallicity, and is in the second half of the main-sequence lifetime. The radius of the ∼1.2 M o˙ companion is consistent with theoretical pre-main-sequence isochrones at 5 Myr, but its temperature is much higher than expected, perhaps due to irradiation by the primary. The radius of the primary is larger than expected, unless its metallicity is super-solar. Finally, the light curve shows residual modulation consistent with the rotation of the primary, and Chandra observations reveal a flare, both of which suggest the presence of starspots and thus magnetism on the primary. © 2021.

Innovative service delivery alternatives, such as field schools, exist but are mostly implemented in isolationistic silos with little effort to integrate them for cost reduction and greater technical effectiveness. This article presents a proof-of-concept effort to develop an innovative, climate-resilient field school methodology, integrating the attributes of Farmers’ Field School, Climate Field School, Climate-Smart Agriculture and indigenous technical knowledge of weather indicators in one package to address the gaps, while sensitizing actors on implications for policy advocacy. Some 661 local facilitators, 32% of them women and 54% youth, were trained on the innovation across East Africa. The initiative has reached 36 agribusiness champions working with 237,250 smallholder farmers in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Initial results show that the innovation is strengthening adaptation behaviour of agribusiness champions, farmers and supply chain actors, and reducing training costs. Preliminary findings indicate that the process is rapidly shaping group adaptive thinking. The integrated approach offers lessons to transform extension and to improve food security and resilience. The approach bundles the costs of previously separate processes into the cost of one joint, simultaneous process, while also strengthening technical service delivery through bundled messaging. Experience from this initiative can be leveraged to develop scalable participatory extension and training models, especially scaling out through farmer-to-farmer replication and scaling up through farmer group networks. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we have identified the essential protein VCP/p97 (VCP, valosin-containing protein) as a novel regulator of autophagosome biogenesis, where VCP regulates autophagy induction in two ways, both dependent on Beclin-1. Utilizing small-molecule inhibitors of VCP ATPase activity, we show that VCP stabilizes Beclin-1 levels by promoting the deubiquitinase activity of ataxin-3 towards Beclin-1. VCP also regulates the assembly and activity of the Beclin-1-containing phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) complex I, thus regulating the production of PI(3)P, a key signaling lipid responsible for the recruitment of downstream autophagy factors. A decreased level of VCP, or inhibition of its ATPase activity, impairs starvation-induced production of PI(3)P and limits downstream recruitment of WIPI2, ATG16L and LC3, thereby decreasing autophagosome formation, illustrating an important role for VCP in early autophagy initiation.

Electric Vehicles (EV) are an environmentally friendly alternative to reduce the reliance on fossil fuel and pollution. For public acceptance of EVs, functionality and accessibility of charging stations is of paramount importance. Improper planning of EV charging stations, however, is a threat to the power grid stability. EV charging stations must be placed in the transport network in such a way that the safe limit of distribution network parameters is not violated. Thus, charging station placement problem is an intricate problem involving convolution of transport and distribution networks. A novel and simple approach of formulating the charging station placement problem is presented in this work. This approach takes into account integrated cost of charging station placement as well as penalties for violating grid constraints. For obtaining an optimal solution of this placement problem, two efficient evolutionary algorithms, such as Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO) and Teaching Learning Based Optimization algorithm (TLBO) are amalgamated together thereby extracting the best features of the both algorithms. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is tested by solving selected standard benchmark problems as well as charging station placement problem. The result of this hybrid algorithm is further compared with other algorithms used for this purpose. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Charging station; Cost; CSO; Distribution network; Hybrid algorithm; Optimization; TLBO; Transport network,Animals; Charging (batteries); Electric power system stability; Electric power transmission networks; Evolutionary algorithms; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Pollution; Swarm intelligence; Bench-mark problems; Electric vehicle charging; Environmentally friendly alternatives; Ev charging stations; Placement problems; Power grid stability; Teaching-learning-based optimizations; Transport networks; Learning algorithms; algorithm; cost analysis; demand analysis; electric vehicle; energy planning; fossil fuel; global warming; machine learning; numerical method; Gallus gallus

Methods: We examined levels of NGF pathway proteins (proNGF, neuroserpin, tissue plasminogen activator [tPA], and metalloproteases [MMP]) in matched cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/plasma samples from AD-symptomatic (DSAD) and AD-asymptomatic (aDS) individuals with DS, as well as controls (HC). Results: ProNGF and MMP-3 were elevated while tPA was decreased in plasma from individuals with DS. CSF from individuals with DS showed elevated proNGF, neuroserpin, MMP-3, and MMP-9. ProNGF and MMP-9 in CSF differentiated DSAD from aDS (area under the curve = 0.86, 0.87). NGF pathway markers associated with CSF amyloid beta and tau and differed by sex.

Experimental and epidemiological evidence indicates that circulating adipokines may be associated with the development of obesity-related cancers, but it is unclear if these associations are causal or confounded. We examined potential causal associations of specific adipokines (adiponectin, leptin, soluble leptin receptor [sOB-R] and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1]) with five obesity-related cancers (colorectal, pancreatic, renal cell carcinoma [RCC], ovarian and endometrial) using Mendelian randomization (MR) methods. We used summary-level data from large genetic consortia for 114 530 cancer cases and 245 284 controls. We constructed genetic instruments using 18 genetic variants for adiponectin, 2 for leptin and 4 for both sOB-R and PAI-1 (P value for inclusion&lt;5 × 10−8). Causal estimates were obtained using two-sample MR methods. In the inverse-variance weighted models, we found an inverse association between adiponectin and risk of colorectal cancer (odds ratio per 1 μg/mL increment in adiponectin concentration: 0.90 [95% confidence interval = 0.84-0.97]; P =.01); but, evidence of horizontal pleiotropy was detected and the association was not present when this was taken into consideration. No association was found for adiponectin and risks of pancreatic cancer, RCC, ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. Leptin, sOB-R and PAI-1 were also similarly unrelated to risk of obesity-related cancers. Despite the large sample size, our MR analyses do not support causal effects of circulating adiponectin, leptin, sOB-R and PAI-1 concentrations on the development of five obesity-related cancers. © 2020 The Authors.

While this could include many different types of interventions to reduce deforestation and degradation, a consensus has emerged that they should safeguard and “do no harm” to the forest-based livelihoods of local people. Many REDD+ projects have been designed to incentivize forest conservation and support local livelihoods by promoting sustainable use of the forest, hence increasing the revenues earned by local households from forest products. We examine two such projects in the Peruvian Amazon, using panel survey data from over 400 households gathered in 2011 and 2014. In the 3 years between surveys, we observed a severe decline in forest revenue. However, by using a BACI study design and matching, we show that this decrease was not caused by the REDD+ interventions. Thus, REDD+ “did no harm” to local people, at least in terms of forest revenues in the early phases of these two projects in the Peruvian Amazon. © Copyright © 2021 Solis, Cronkleton, Sills, Rodriguez-Ward and Duchelle.",average treatment effect on the treated; Brazil nut; carbon payments; difference-in-differences; Peruvian Amazon; quasi-experimental impact evaluation; REDD+; sustainable forest management,

Here we investigated N2O, CH4 and CO2 emissions from urine and dung patches on tropical pastures in Kenya, thereby disentangling interactive and pure water, dung or urine effects. GHG fluxes were monitored with automated chambers for 42–59 days covering three seasons (short rainy season, long rainy season, dry season) for six treatments (Control; +1 L water; +1 kg dung; 1 L urine; 1 L water +1 kg dung; 1 L urine +1 kg dung). Cumulative CO2 emissions did not differ among treatments in any of the seasons. Water or urine addition alone did not affect CH4 fluxes, but these were elevated in all dung-related treatments. Scaled up on the total area covered, dung patches halve the CH4 sink strength of tropical pastures during the dry season, while during the rainy season they may turn tropical pastures into a small CH4 source. For N2O, both dung and urine alone and in combination stimulated emissions. While the N2O emission factor (EFN2O) from dung being constant across seasons, the EFN2O for urine was greater during the short rainy season than during the dry season. Combined application of urine + dung was additive on EFN2O. While the mean dung EFN2O in our study (0.06%) was similar to the IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories EFN2O for dry climate (0.07%), the urine EFN2O we measured (0.03–0.25%) was lower than the IPCC value (0.32%). In addition, the IPCC Guidelines assume a urine-N: dung-N ratio of 0.66:0.34, which is higher than found for SSA (&lt;0.50:0.50). Consequently, IPCC Guidelines still overestimate N2O emissions from excreta patches in SSA. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Emission factor; Excreta; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Ratio dung - urine N; Seasonality,Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Drought; Gas emissions; Tropics; CO2 emissions; Emission factors; Greenhouse gas fluxes; Interactive effect; Sink strength; Temperate regions; Tropical regions; Urine patches; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; pasture; seasonality; soil pollution; tropical region; urine; air temperature; Article; Chloris gayana; concentration (parameter); controlled study; dry season; grass; greenhouse gas; humidity; Kenya; long rainy season; nonhuman; pastureland; Pennisetum; Pennisetum clandestinum; physical chemistry; precipitation; priority journal; rainy season; scale up; short rainy season; soil; soil acidity; topsoil; tropical pasture; chemistry; feces; season; Kenya; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; Carbon Dioxide; Feces; Greenhouse Gases; Kenya; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Seasons

This paper contributes to the literature on restoration practice and agricultural technology adoption, by shifting the focus onto the farm and considering the role of intrahousehold dynamics in the uptake of farmland restoration practices. We examine the intrahousehold decisions and gender relations surrounding the trial of two on-farm restoration practices: Tree planting and planting basins; with over 2,500 farmers in the eastern drylands of Kenya. Combining results from household surveys, interviews and focus group discussions, our findings reveal that decisions over the uptake of restoration practices, although usually initiated by women who attend agricultural workshops, are often discussed between husband and wife and that multiple social dimensions intersect to shape men's and women's interest in, contribution to, and benefit from different practices. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that these intrahousehold relations are, in turn, shaped by women's participation in innovation processes and broader societal changes, particularly the outmigration of rural men. Based on these insights, we offer recommendations for improving the dissemination and uptake of on-farm restoration practices in eastern Kenya and achieving more inclusive and gender-equitable outcomes. © 2021 University of Wisconsin Press.

Significant variation of the iron concentrations due to genotype (clone or variety), location and genotype × location interaction was found for potato and sweetpotato. However, for potato, the iron concentration levels were mostly attributed to genotype which account for 62.89% of the total variance whereas for sweetpotato the iron concentration levels were mostly attributed to location which account for 76.16% of the total variance. Acidic soils seem to favor the iron absorption by the potato and sweetpotato plant while alkaline soils seem to diminish iron absorption. The mean iron concentration of the potato clones and varieties was higher in Yanamachay and Paltamachay, localities with acidic soils and high organic matter content; and was lower in Tacsana, the locality with the highest pH in the soil, lowest percentage of organic matter and highest proportion of sand. The mean iron concentration of the sweetpotato clones was drastically lower in Huaral, the locality with alkaline soil, than in San Ramon and Pucallpa.

Data describing the safety of in-utero exposure to antihypertensive treatment is conflicting with many studies suffering from significant methodological issues. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked routinely collected healthcare records for 268 711 children born 2010-2014 in Scotland to assess outcomes following in-utero exposure to antihypertensive medication. RESULTS: We identified a cohort of 265 488 eligible mother-child pairs born over the study period; of which, 2433 were exposed in utero to antihypertensive medication, 4391 exposed to treated late-onset hypertension and 6066 exposed to untreated hypertension during pregnancy. In-utero antihypertensive exposure was associated with an increased risk of circulatory defects (aOR 2.29; 99% CI 1.14-4.59) compared with normal controls and the untreated hypertensive group. We report no increased odds of any developmental outcomes at 2.5 years of age following exposure to antihypertensive medication during pregnancy, untreated hypertension or late-onset hypertension. CONCLUSION: Although circulatory defects may be associated with antihypertensive medication exposure during pregnancy, the mechanisms underlying this process are unclear.

Both in western societies and Low Medium Income Countries (LMICs). However, the projected increases in the global population, means the production of nutritious food stuffs must increase dramatically. Building on existing genetic modification technologies a series of New Plant Breeding Technologies (NPBT) has recently emerged. These approaches include, Agro-infiltration, grafting, cis and intragenesis and gene editing technologies. How these new techniques should be regulated has fostered considerable debate. Concerns have also been raised, to ensure over-regulation does not arise, creating administrative and economic burden. In this article the existing landscape of genetically modified crops is reviewed and the potential of several New Plant Breeding Techniques (NPBT) described. Metabolomics is an omic technology that has developed in a concurrent manner with biotechnological advances in plant breeding. There is potentially further opportunities to advance our metabolomic technologies to characterise the outputs of New Plant Breeding Technologies, in a manner that is beneficial both from an academic, biosafety and industrial perspective. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH",Metabolomics; New plantbreedingtechniques; Sequence specificnuclease,"biotechnology; crop; genetics; legislation and jurisprudence; metabolomics; plant breeding; procedures; transgenic plant; Biotechnology; Crops, Agricultural; Metabolomics; Plant Breeding; Plants, Genetically Modified"

Biofortification is an evidence-based nutrition strategy that addresses some of the most common and preventable global micronutrient gaps and can help improve the health of millions of people. Since 2013, HarvestPlus and a consortium of collaborators have made impressive progress in the enrichment of staple crops with essential micronutrients through conventional plant breeding. Objective: To review and highlight lessons learned from multiple large-scale delivery strategies used by HarvestPlus to scale up biofortification across different country and crop contexts. Results: India has strong public and private sector pearl millet breeding programs and a robust commercial seed sector. To scale-up pearl millet, HarvestPlus established partnerships with public and private seed companies, which facilitated the rapid commercialization of products and engagement of farmers in delivery activities. In Nigeria, HarvestPlus stimulated the initial acceptance and popularization of vitamin A cassava using a host of creative approaches, including “crowding in” delivery partners, innovative promotional programs, and development of intermediate raw material for industry and novel food products. In Uganda, orange sweet potato (OSP) is a traditional subsistence crop. Due to this, and the lack of formal seed systems and markets, HarvestPlus established a network of partnerships with community-based nongovernmental organizations and vine multipliers to popularize and scale-up delivery of OSP. Conclusions: Impact of biofortification ultimately depends on the development of sustainable markets for biofortified seeds and products. Results illustrate the need for context-specific, innovative solutions to promote widespread adoption. © The Author(s) 2021.",biofortification; India; iron; Nigeria; Uganda; vitamin A,cassava; enrichment; innovation; millet; nongovernmental organization; private sector; retinol; trace element; India; Uganda; Citrus sinensis; Ipomoea batatas; Manihot esculenta; Pennisetum glaucum

Before starting clinical trials, preparatory studies for example of the MR-dependent electron stream effect (ESE) are necessary. Material and Methods: To prospectively investigate the ESE, data from 11 patients treated with partial breast irradiation (PBI) at the 1.5 T MRL were evaluated. A bolus was placed on the chin and in vivo dosimetry results were compared with the dose simulated by the treatment planning system (TPS). The same measurements were carried out for three patients treated at a conventional linac. Toxicity and cosmesis were evaluated. Results: Median doses measured and simulated on top/ underneath the bolus were 1.91 / 0.62 Gy and 2.82 / 0.63 Gy, respectively. Median differences between calculations and measurements were 0.8 Gy and 0.1 Gy. At the conventional linac, median measured doses on top/ underneath the bolus were 0.98 and 1.37 Gy. No acute toxicity exceeding grade 2 was recorded. Cosmesis was good or excellent and patient reported outcome measures were mostly scored as none or mild. Conclusion: The dose due to the ESE is low, correctly predicted by the TPS and effectively minimized by a bolus. © 2020",Cosmesis; Electron stream effect; MR linear accelerator; MRL; Partial breast irradiation; PROMs; Toxicity,acute toxicity; Article; breast radiotherapy; breast reconstruction; cancer mortality; cancer radiotherapy; clinical article; clinical target volume; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; dosimetry; erythema; fatigue; follow up; human; hyperpigmentation; in vivo dosimetry; intensity modulated radiation therapy; irradiation; lymph vessel metastasis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; patient-reported outcome; planning target volume; prospective study; questionnaire; radiation dose; seroma; simulation; stereotactic body radiation therapy; tumor volume; volumetric modulated arc therapy

An analysis of secondary crop production data indicated that addressing food policies could be valuable for orphan crop mainstreaming, but, as with literature review, did not provide clear guidance on the importance of different interventions. A survey of experts suggested that cross-disciplinary teams are important for developing mainstreaming strategies, but revealed no clear consensus on the importance of particular measures for specific orphan crops.

Biofortification addresses this issue through the breeding of staple crops that are micronutrient-dense and high yielding. One such crop is iron-biofortified beans. Ten iron-biofortified bean varieties were released between 2010 and 2012 in Rwanda, a country with high rates of bean production and consumption, to address iron deficiency. This study evaluates the effect of the most widely adopted of these varieties, RWR2245, on household yield, land cultivated under beans, bean consumption, purchases, and sales. Because the adoption decision could be endogenous, we use a control function approach to quantify the impacts of adoption. RWR2245 provides a yield gain of 20%-49% over traditional bush bean varieties. In our preferred model specification, we find that over a 12-month period, growing RWR2245 for at least one out of two annual growing seasons increases the length of time beans are consumed from own production by 0.64 months (19–20 days), reduces the length of time beans are purchased for consumption by 0.73 months (22–23 days), and increases the probability of selling beans by 12%. Adoption can thus improve household nutrition via two channels: primarily by increasing iron intake via substituting biofortified harvested beans for less nutrient-dense beans from the market, and additionally by increasing household income that can be spent on nutritious foods through the reduction in bean purchases and increased likelihood of selling beans. Moreover, the sale of iron-biofortified beans implies the availability of iron-dense food in markets, also benefiting households that purchase beans. These findings are promising for the continued adoption of iron-biofortified beans in Rwanda and elsewhere and provide evidence that biofortified crops are an effective investment for nutrition, food security, and poverty reduction. © 2020",Africa; Control function approach; Impact; Instrumental variables; Iron-biofortified beans; Rwanda,breeding; consumption behavior; econometrics; iron; legume; marketing; nutritive value; productivity; socioeconomic impact; Rwanda

According to one view, negative attitudes towards immigration undermine support for welfare redistribution, as those who hold anti-immigration attitudes are thought to view immigrants as undeserving yet disproportionately drawing upon the welfare state. According to a competing view, however, anti-immigration attitudes awaken a person’s own economic insecurities that in turn spur support for welfare protection and redistribution. This article argues and finds substantial evidence in European public opinion that both of these mechanisms can be at play and have implications that depend strongly on a country’s national-level context. In particular, it is found that anti-immigration attitudes yield lower support for redistribution mainly when a respondent’s country faces more immigration, when welfare-state protections are generous, and when migrants actually rely more than natives on the welfare state. © 2020 The Author(s).

Whereas European and American options considering counterparty risk have already been priced under Black-Scholes dynamics in [1], here the novel contribution is the introduction of stochastic volatility resulting in a Heston stochastic volatility type partial differential equation to be solved. We derive the partial differential equation modeling the XVA when stochastic volatility is assumed. For both European and American options, a linear and a nonlinear problem have been deduced. In order to obtain a numerical solution, suitable and appropriate boundary conditions have been considered. In addition, a method of characteristics for the time discretization combined with a finite element method in the spatial discretization has been implemented.

Of vital importance to the success of conflict interventions is a detailed understanding of how stakeholders react to management interventions as well as the influence of interacting social and political factors. Across Europe, goose populations have increased considerably, leading to widespread impacts on agriculture and significant conflicts between different stakeholder groups. We used a novel experimental game to understand farmer preferences regarding the design of goose conflict interventions in Scotland. We specifically examined how three alternative interventions (government financial support for scaring activities, subsidies and agglomeration payments that include bonus payments for adoption by neighbouring farms) affect farmer propensity to support goose conservation interests through reduced shooting and the provision of sacrificial crops. We also examined the links between within-game behaviour and real-life attributes and attitudes of farmers. We found that all three interventions were conducive to pro-conservation behaviour in the games. The effects of all three interventions were stronger among farmers who had higher trust towards other community members. Agglomeration payments led to increased provision of sacrificial crops among farmers with negative attitudes towards the current allocation of goose finances in Scotland. Farmers with more positive attitudes towards wildlife tourism were more likely to provide more sacrificial crops, and less likely to shoot in the games. Farmers' real-life traits had a statistically significant but marginal impact on the effectiveness of financial payments, such as the number of geese being shot on their own lands, remoteness and crop damage by geese. These game results provide evidence for the potential of innovative financial instruments in conflict management and their interactions with social factors such as community trust, equity attitude and real-life shooting levels. Our study highlights the importance of socio-political elements in fostering mutually beneficial outcomes in conservation conflicts in addition to addressing material losses to wildlife. We also show how games can help in addressing conservation conflicts in a wide range of settings.

This bright (V = 10.2) star hosts three small transiting planets identified in photometry from the NASA TESS mission: TOI-561 b (TOI-561.02, P = 0.44 days, Rp = 1.45 ± 0.11 R⊕), c (TOI-561.01, P = 10.8 days, Rp = 2.90 ± 0.13 R⊕), and d (TOI-561.03, P = 16.3 days, Rp = 2.32 ± 0.16 R⊕). The star is chemically ([Fe/ H] = -0.41 ± 0.05, [a/Fe]=+0.23 ± 0.05) and kinematically consistent with the galactic thick-disk population, making TOI-561 one of the oldest (10 ± 3 Gyr) and most metal-poor planetary systems discovered yet. We dynamically confirm planets b and c with radial velocities from the W. M. Keck Observatory High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. Planet b has a mass and density of 3.2 ± 0.8M⊕ and 5.5+2.0-1.6g cm-3, consistent with a rocky composition. Its lower-than-average density is consistent with an iron-poor composition, although an Earth-like iron-to-silicates ratio is not ruled out. Planet c is 7.0 ± 2.3M⊕ and 1.6 ± 0.6 g cm-3, consistent with an interior rocky core overlaid with a low-mass volatile envelope. Several attributes of the photometry for planet d (which we did not detect dynamically) complicate the analysis, but we vet the planet with high-contrast imaging, groundbased photometric follow-up, and radial velocities. TOI-561 b is the first rocky world around a galactic thick-disk star confirmed with radial velocities and one of the best rocky planets for thermal emission studies. © 2021.

This reduction in MER decreased N, increased fungal C but did not affect bacterial C concentrations in feces. In experiment 2, Holstein × Boran heifers were offered a poor-quality roughage diet without supplement, with sweet potato vine silage or with a urea-molasses block. These two supplements did not affect the fecal chemical composition or fungal C but increased bacterial C concentrations in feces.

However, their genetic resources are likely at threat because they are underutilized and under the radar of agricultural research. This paper aims to contribute to a conservation agenda for traditional African vegetables by examining the geographical diversity and conservation status of these species. Location: Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: 126 traditional annual and perennial African vegetables were selected for their food and nutrition potential. Food uses and species’ areas of origin were recorded from literature. Species’ presence records were collected from open-access databases of genebanks and herbaria. These records were used to determine geographical patterns of observed and modelled richness, to distinguish geographical clusters with different compositions of vegetables, to assess species’ ex situ and in situ conservation status and to prioritize countries for conservation actions. Results: Of the 126 species, 79 originated in sub-Saharan Africa. High levels of observed and modelled species richness were found in: (a) West Tropical Africa in Ghana, Togo and Benin; (b) West-Central Tropical Africa in South Cameroon; (c) Northeast and East Tropical Africa in Ethiopia and Tanzania; and (d) Southern Africa in Eswatini. South Sudan, Angola and DR Congo are potential areas of high species richness that require further exploration. In general, ex situ conservation status of the selected species was poor compared to their in situ conservation status. Main conclusions: Areas of high species richness in West Tropical Africa, South Cameroon and Ethiopia coincide with centres of crop domestication and cultural diversity. Hotspots of diversity in Tanzania and Eswatini are especially rich in wild vegetables. Addressing the conservation of vegetable diversity in West Tropical Africa and South Cameroon is of most urgent concern as vegetable genetic resources from these locations are least represented in ex situ collections. © 2020 The Authors.

To provide new insights into pre-Columbian crop movement, we applied spatial genetics to identify and compare dispersal routes of three American crops between Mesoamerica and the Andes, two important centres of pre-Columbian crop and cultural diversity. Our analysis included georeferenced simple-sequence repeats (SSR) marker datasets of 1852 genotypes of cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill.), a perennial fruit crop that became underutilised in the Americas after the European conquest, 770 genotypes of maize (Zea mays L.) and 476 genotypes of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Our findings show that humans brought cherimoya from Mesoamerica to present Peru through long-distance sea-trade routes across the Pacific Ocean at least 4700 yr bp, after more ancient dispersion of maize and other crops through the Mesoamerican isthmus over land and near-coastal waters. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of pre-Columbian crop movement between Mesoamerica and the Andes across the Pacific Ocean providing new insights into pre-Columbian crop exchange in the Americas. We propose that cherimoya represents a wider group of perennial fruit crops dispersed by humans via sea-trade routes between Mesoamerica and the Andes across the Pacific Ocean. © 2020 The Authors New Phytologist © 2020 New Phytologist Foundation",crop biogeography; domestication; fruit trees; neotropics; pre-Columbian America; spatial genetics,"agricultural diversification; data set; dispersal; dispersion; domestication; genotype; Holocene; land-sea interaction; legume; maize; Neotropic Ecozone; perennial plant; Andes; Mesoamerica; Pacific Ocean; Peru; Annona cherimola; Phaseolus vulgaris; Zea mays; microsatellite DNA; crop; domestication; genetics; Peru; Phaseolus; Crops, Agricultural; Domestication; Microsatellite Repeats; Peru; Phaseolus"

Dynamic phase manipulation of VCSELs within a compact system is highly desired for a large variety of applications. In this work, we incorporate the emerging microfluidic technologies into the conventional VCSELs through a monolithic integration approach, enabling dynamic phase control of lasing emissions with low power consumption and low thermal generation. As a proof of concept, a beam steering device is experimentally demonstrated by integrating microfluidic channel on a coherently coupled VCSELs array. Experimental results show that the deflection angles of the laser beam from the chip can be tuned from 0 to 2.41 under the injection of liquids with different refractive index into the microchannel. This work opens an entirely new solution to implement a compact laser system with real-Time wavefront controllability.

The data analysed were collected between 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36.1fb−1. Photons are required to have a transverse momentum pT&gt;175GeV. The Z→bb‾ decay is reconstructed using a jet with pT&gt;200GeV, found with the anti-kt R=1.0 jet algorithm, and groomed to remove soft and wide-angle radiation and to mitigate contributions from the underlying event and additional proton–proton collisions. Two different but related measurements are performed using two jet grooming definitions for reconstructing the Z→bb‾ decay: trimming and soft drop. These algorithms differ in their experimental and phenomenological implications regarding jet mass reconstruction and theoretical precision. To identify Z bosons, b-tagged R=0.2 track-jets matched to the groomed large-R calorimeter jet are used as a proxy for the b-quarks. The signal yield is determined from fits of the data-driven background templates to the different jet mass distributions for the two grooming methods. Integrated fiducial cross-sections and unfolded jet mass spectra for each grooming method are compared with leading-order theoretical predictions.

While the effects of obesity on the brain are of major interest in medicine, they remain markedly under-researched in psychiatry. Methods: We obtained body mass index (BMI) and magnetic resonance imaging-derived regional cortical thickness, surface area from 836 bipolar disorders (BD) and 1600 control individuals from 14 sites within the ENIGMA-BD Working Group. We identified regionally specific profiles of cortical thickness using K-means clustering and studied clinical characteristics associated with individual cortical profiles. Results: We detected two clusters based on similarities among participants in cortical thickness. The lower thickness cluster (46.8% of the sample) showed thinner cortex, especially in the frontal and temporal lobes and was associated with diagnosis of BD, higher BMI, and older age. BD individuals in the low thickness cluster were more likely to have the diagnosis of bipolar disorder I and less likely to be treated with lithium. In contrast, clustering based on similarities in the cortical surface area was unrelated to BD or BMI and only tracked age and sex. Conclusions: We provide evidence that both BD and obesity are associated with similar alterations in cortical thickness, but not surface area. The fact that obesity increased the chance of having low cortical thickness could explain differences in cortical measures among people with BD. The thinner cortex in individuals with higher BMI, which was additive and similar to the BD-associated alterations, may suggest that treating obesity could lower the extent of cortical thinning in BD. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Tree planting will make up a large share of the ambitious restoration commitments made by countries around the world, but careful planning is needed to select species and seed sources that are suitably adapted to present and future restoration site conditions and that meet the restoration objectives. Here we present a scalable and freely available online tool, Diversity for Restoration (D4R), to identify suitable tree species and seed sources for climate-resilient tropical forest landscape restoration. The D4R tool integrates (a) species habitat suitability maps under current and future climatic conditions; (b) analysis of functional trait data, local ecological knowledge and other species characteristics to score how well species match the restoration site conditions and restoration objectives; (c) optimization of species combinations and abundances considering functional trait diversity or phylogenetic diversity, to foster complementarity between species and to ensure ecosystem multifunctionality and stability; and (d) development of seed zone maps to guide sourcing of planting material adapted to present and predicted future environmental conditions. We outline the various elements behind the tool and discuss how it fits within the broader restoration planning process, including a review of other existing tools. Synthesis and applications. The Diversity for Restoration tool enables non-expert users to combine species traits, environmental data and climate change models to select tree species and seed sources that best match restoration site conditions and restoration objectives. Originally developed for the tropical dry forests of Colombia, the tool has now been expanded to the tropical dry forests of northwestern Peru–southern Ecuador and the countries of Burkina Faso and Cameroon, and further expansion is underway.

It is unclear whether such alterations progressively change over time, and how this is related to the number of mood episodes. To address this question, we analyzed a large and diverse international sample with longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical data to examine structural brain changes over time in BD. Methods: Longitudinal structural MRI and clinical data from the ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis) BD Working Group, including 307 patients with BD and 925 healthy control subjects, were collected from 14 sites worldwide. Male and female participants, aged 40 ± 17 years, underwent MRI at 2 time points. Cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volumes were estimated using FreeSurfer. Annualized change rates for each imaging phenotype were compared between patients with BD and healthy control subjects. Within patients, we related brain change rates to the number of mood episodes between time points and tested for effects of demographic and clinical variables. Results: Compared with healthy control subjects, patients with BD showed faster enlargement of ventricular volumes and slower thinning of the fusiform and parahippocampal cortex (0.18 < d < 0.22). More (hypo)manic episodes were associated with faster cortical thinning, primarily in the prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: In the hitherto largest longitudinal MRI study on BD, we did not detect accelerated cortical thinning but noted faster ventricular enlargements in BD. However, abnormal frontocortical thinning was observed in association with frequent manic episodes. Our study yields insights into disease progression in BD and highlights the importance of mania prevention in BD treatment. © 2021 Society of Biological Psychiatry",Bipolar disorder; ENIGMA; Longitudinal study; Neuroimaging; Neuroprogression; Psychiatry,

Powder recycling can significantly enhance the sustainability of the manufacturing process, reduce the cost and avoid producing metallic waste as a potential environmental hazard. The first step in reusing the recycled powders in the 3D printing process is to characterize the microstructure and surface quality of the powder for oxidation and impurity analysis. Here, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have been used for the morphology and surface composition analysis of the 316L powders within the Aconity 3D printer. A new powder collection strategy has been introduced to collect powders from different locations in the powder bed: from the top most and surface of the parts and powder bed after the print terminated, from between the printed parts at different heights. The XPS measurements revealed that oxidation is a common in all the powders compared to virgin powder and more oxidation was detected from the powders collected on the very top of the leftover powder and from surface of the bed. The size of the particles does not change much but larger particles remained at the topmost surface. This finding would help in designing a protocol for collecting the recycled powder from the powder bed and it is suggested to follow a a procedure of collecting powders from the different sections of the powder bed in order to avoid mixing the most and least affected particles. © ESAFORM 2021 - 24th Inter.

Fully automated immunoassay instruments with ready-to-use assay kits and calibrators has simplified their analysis and improved reproducibility of measurements. We evaluated the analytical performance of the fully automated immunoassay instrument LUMIPULSE G (Fujirebio) for measurement of the four core AD CSF biomarkers and determined cutpoints for AD diagnosis. Comparison of the LUMIPULSE G assays was performed with the established INNOTEST ELISAs (Fujirebio) for hTau Ag, pTau 181, β-amyloid 1-42, and with V-PLEX Plus Aβ Peptide Panel 1 (6E10) (Meso Scale Discovery) for Aβ 1-42/Aβ 1-40, as well as with a LC-MS reference method for Aβ 1-42. Intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility was evaluated for all assays. Clinical cutpoints for Aβ 1-42, tTau, and pTau was determined by analysis of three cohorts of clinically diagnosed patients, comprising 651 CSF samples. For the Aβ 1-42/Aβ 1-40 ratio, the cutpoint was determined by mixture model analysis of 2,782 CSF samples. The LUMIPULSE G assays showed strong correlation to all other immunoassays (r>0.93 for all assays). The repeatability (intra-laboratory) CVs ranged between 2.0 and 5.6%, with the highest variation observed for β-amyloid 1-40. The reproducibility (inter-laboratory) CVs ranged between 2.1 and 6.5%, with the highest variation observed for β-amyloid 1-42. The clinical cutpoints for AD were determined to be 409 ng/L for total tau, 50.2 ng/L for pTau 181, 526 ng/L for β-amyloid 1-42, and 0.072 for the Aβ 1-42/Aβ 1-40 ratio. Our results suggest that the LUMIPULSE G assays for the CSF AD biomarkers are fit for purpose in clinical laboratory practice.

The wide variability in clinical presentations, applied assessment tools, and treatments are poorly understood. Objectives: To map practices and knowledge base of movement disorder clinicians concerning clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment approaches in tic disorders. Methods: A 33-item survey was developed by the Tic Disorders and Tourette syndrome Study Group members of the Movement Disorder Society. The survey was distributed to the complete society membership and included responses from 346 members, 314 of whom reported treating tic disorders. Results: Approximately one third of survey respondents (35%) frequently evaluated patients with tics. The data revealed widespread use of existing guidelines (about 70%) and screening for comorbid disorders (>90%). The most common investigations used to rule out secondary causes of tics were imaging (92%), laboratory tests (66%) and neurophysiology (38%). Functional tics were the second most common tic etiology following primary tics. Only 27% of respondents reported confidence in knowledge about tic pathogenesis. Top rated interventions to treat tics were psychoeducation, cognitive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) and treatment for neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Antipsychotics were ranked as the most effective pharmacologic tic intervention. Conclusions: The majority of movement disorders specialists do not frequently encounter tics. There was sparse knowledge about tic pathophysiology.

Previous studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction is a key pathogenetic event in ALS. Interestingly, studies in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) post-mortem brain and animal models link alterations in mitochondrial function to interactions between hyperphosphorylated tau and dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), the GTPase involved in mitochondrial fission. Recent evidence suggest that tau may be involved in ALS pathogenesis, therefore, we sought to determine whether hyperphosphorylated tau may lead to mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction in ALS and whether reducing tau may provide a novel therapeutic approach. Our findings demonstrated that pTau-S396 is mis-localized to synapses in post-mortem motor cortex (mCTX) across ALS subtypes. Additionally, the treatment with ALS synaptoneurosomes (SNs), enriched in pTau-S396, increased oxidative stress, induced mitochondrial fragmentation, and altered mitochondrial connectivity without affecting cell survival in vitro. Furthermore, pTau-S396 interacted with DRP1, and similar to pTau-S396, DRP1 accumulated in SNs across ALS subtypes, suggesting increases in mitochondrial fragmentation in ALS. As previously reported, electron microscopy revealed a significant decrease in mitochondria density and length in ALS mCTX. Lastly, reducing tau levels with QC-01-175, a selective tau degrader, prevented ALS SNs-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and oxidative stress in vitro. Collectively, our findings suggest that increases in pTau-S396 may lead to mitochondrial fragmentation and oxidative stress in ALS and decreasing tau may provide a novel strategy to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction in ALS.

Based on stories prompted by four primary emotions, the most frequently encountered VOs were: concern for safety, nutrition and taste, and caring/respect. Rural people were more likely to express anthropocentric VOs. However, their stories did not necessarily associate negatively with caring/respect, suggesting that wildlife users may also be sensitive to biocentric values. Age, gender, and wealth were good predictors for biocentric VOs, with young women from the city more likely to express biocentric values. VOs and emotions related differently to specific wildlife species. Mutualism was not frequently elucidated in the stories.

However, important questions remain. How are territorial planning MSFs shaped by context and power? Can they represent communities' diversity, respect their ancestral rights, and bring real change? This article explores how context and power affect the capacities and challenges of territorial planning MSFs to include, represent, empower, and benefit communities. Examining actors' perceptions, we comparatively analyze two cases, in two Brazilian states with contrasting contexts. We conclude that territorial planning MSFs are highly political spaces influenced by complexities in context, power relations, and communities' diversity. They may include, represent, and empower communities and help recognize and conserve their territories, but not necessarily. Especially in difficult settings, communities face more challenges than other actors to be represented and participate at MSFs, and territorial planning may empower or “invisibilize” communities. Other mechanisms (e.g., social action) can be key for communities instead of, or in synergy with, MSFs. © 2020 The Authors.

However, it is still unclear what mechanism EA uses to help organizations achieve alignment. Related research is very scattered, making it difficult to accumulate relevant knowledge and experiences, and thus, the more successful EA application is hindered. To address this issue, the present research examines essential requirements of alignment and mechanisms with which underlying EA deliverable models impact organizations. By doing so, we proposed a conceptual framework explaining how EA modeling activities contribute to organizational alignment. We demonstrated the use of this framework with three use cases. The results show that EA could help organizations achieve alignment in quite different ways, and our proposed framework helped us examine and understand the mechanisms. We expect this research could establish an essential common understanding of how EA enables organizational alignment, thereby facilitating academia to move forward in this field. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Alignment; Enterprise Architecture, EA; Model Quality",Electronic commerce; Conceptual frameworks; Enterprise Architecture; Knowledge and experience; Alignment

Recognized as one of the cheapest sources of vitamin A (VA), OFSP holds promise as a food-based approach to combat VA deficiency, a significant public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa. Because the dominant white-fleshed varieties have no beta-carotene, research initiated in the mid-1990s set out to adapt, develop, and promote VA-rich OFSP as a more nutritious alternative to non-OFSP types. Multisectorial strategies that integrate agriculture with health or education sectors hold promise as effective strategies to ensure OFSP reaches and meets the needs of those populations at greatest risk of VA deficiency - pregnant and lactating women, infants, and children. In this article, we share experiences, findings, implementation challenges, and lessons learned from four integrated programs in Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Ethiopia that aimed to improve the nutrition and health of women and children with production and promotion of OFSP.

Objective: We sought to determine Movement Disorder Society (MDS) members' attitudes and access to palliative care. Methods: A quantitative and qualitative survey instrument was developed by the MDS Palliative Care Task Force and e-mailed to all members for completion. Descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis were triangulated. Results: Of 6442 members contacted, 652 completed the survey. Completed surveys indicating country of the respondent overwhelmingly represented middle- and high-income countries. Government-funded homecare was available to 54% of respondents based on patient need, 25% limited access, and 21% during hospitalization or an acute defined event. Eighty-nine percent worked in multidisciplinary teams. The majority endorsed trigger-based referrals to palliative care (75.5%), while 24.5% indicated any time after diagnosis was appropriate. Although 66% referred patients to palliative care, 34% did not refer patients. Barriers were identified by 68% of respondents, the most significant being available workforce, financial support for palliative care, and perceived knowledge of palliative care physicians specific to movement disorders. Of 499 respondents indicating their training in palliative care or desire to learn these skills, 55% indicated a desire to gain more skills. Conclusions: The majority of MDS member respondents endorsed a role for palliative care in movement disorders. Many members have palliative training or collaborate with palliative care physicians. Although significant barriers exist to access palliative care, the desire to gain more skills and education on palliative care is an opportunity for professional development within the MDS. © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",movement disorders; neuropalliative care; palliative care; Parkinson's disease,

Hence, we evaluated long-term (10 years) effect of conservation agriculture (CA) practices on soil quality improvement under six different cropping scenarios (Sc), i.e. Sc1-represented by transplanted puddled rice (TPR) followed by conventional tilled broadcasted wheat (CT-wheat) with residue removal, Sc2-TPR rice followed by zero tillage (ZT) wheat and ZT-mung bean with partial residue retention, Sc3-direct seeded rice (DSR) followed by ZT-wheat and ZT-mung bean with full residue retention, Sc4-DSR is replaced by ZT-maize followed by ZT-wheat and ZT-mung bean, Sc5 and Sc6 were – Sc3 integrated with sub surface drip irrigation (SDI) and Sc4 + SDI, respectively. Soil samples were collected from 0 to 5, 5–15 and 15–30 cm soil depth from each scenario after harvesting of wheat in 2019. Results showed that, reduction in bulk density (BD), soil penetration resistance (SPR) and enhancement of water holding capacity and infiltration were associated with CA based scenarios (Sc3–Sc6). Scenario 3 recorded lowest BD of 1.39 and 1.58 g cm−3 at 0–5 and 5–15 cm soil depth, respectively. CA based Sc6 recorded highest infiltration rate (1.48 cm hr−1) and lowest was associated with Sc1 (0.5 cm hr−1). The enrichment of soil organic carbon (SOC) content, stock, available nitrogen and potassium was mainly confined to upper surface soil layer (0–5 cm). The SOC content and stock in CA based scenarios (average of Sc3 to Sc6) was 41–57 and 69–94% higher than Sc1 at 0–5 cm soil layer. Available nitrogen was increased by 23–50 and 64–98% and available potassium increased by 13–28 and 42–71% in 0–5 and 5–15 cm soil depth, respectively in CA based scenarios over Sc1. Similarly, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dehydrogenase (DHA) activity in top soil layer under CA based scenarios was increased by 177–195 and 67–107% over Sc1, respectively. The maximum SQI was registered with Sc6 (0.91) followed by Sc4 (0.89) and least was recorded in Sc1 (0.65) at 0–5 cm soil depth. Maize-wheat based cropping system recorded higher SQI over rice–wheat based cropping system. Sustainable yield index was strongly related with key soil quality indicators and also positively correlated with SQI. Thus our study suggests that CA based maize-wheat-mung bean cropping system should be recommended for better soil quality and yield sustainability in North West India. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Conservation agriculture; Crop yield; Residue retention; Soil quality index; Zero tillage,Crops; Infiltration; Irrigation; Organic carbon; Potassium; Soil conservation; Soils; Conservation agricultures; Crop yield; Cropping systems; Mungbeans; Residue retention; Soil depth; Soil quality index; Soils qualities; Wheat tillage; Zero tillage; Nitrogen; agricultural intensification; agricultural soil; agriculture; cereal; conservation management; crop yield; cropping practice; legume; long-term change; maize; rice; soil quality; sustainability; wheat; Gangetic Plain; Vigna radiata var. radiata

The luxury to learn irrespective of geographical and temporal restrictions makes it an attractive resource. At the start of 2020, the global pandemic enforced social distance practice worldwide, changing the work environment dynamics, leaving options like online trading, work from home, and online education. Online learning environments gained particular attention in the educational sector, where users could access the online learning resources to fulfil their academic requirements during the lockdown. From massively available content such as MOOC, learners are overwhelmed with the available choices. In this scenario, recommender systems (RS) come to the rescue to help the learner make appropriate choices for completing the enrolled course. There is tremendous scope and a multitude of opportunities available for researchers to focus on this domain. An exhaustive analysis is required to spotlight the opportunities in this realm.

A pair of Low-Resolution (LR) and High-Resolution (HR) images are typically used in the CNN models to train them to super-resolve LR images in a fully supervised manner. Owing to non-availability of true LR-HR pairs, the LR images are generally synthesized from HR data by applying synthetic degradation such as bicubic downsampling. Such networks under-perform when used on real-world data where degradation is different from the synthetically generated LR image. As obtaining true LR-HR pair is a tedious and resource (time and effort) consuming task, we propose a new approach and architecture to super-resolve the real-world LR images in an unsupervised manner by using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework with Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). Along with a new network architecture, we also introduce a novel loss metric based on no-reference quality scores of SR images to improve the perceptual fidelity of the SR images.

Data for each case was collected following a common protocol. Among the characteristics that emerged from our study as important were socio-political and biophysical characteristics of the wider landscape within which the community’s rangeland territory is located and the extent to which that territory is circumscribed by some combination of other land uses and land tenure types, major political boundaries, and physical landscape features. The analysis of these cases suggests that where pastoralist communities coexist in large, open rangeland landscapes, rather than a narrowly community-based approach, natural resource management interventions need to be explicitly multi-level and horizontally flexible. © 2021 The Author(s).

Missense mutations (e.g., R47H) of TREM2 increase risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The soluble ectodomain of wild-type TREM2 (sTREM2) has been shown to protect against AD in vivo, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We show that Aβ oligomers bind to cellular TREM2, inducing shedding of the sTREM2 domain. Wild-type sTREM2 bound to Aβ oligomers (measured by single-molecule imaging, dot blots, and Bio-Layer Interferometry) inhibited Aβ oligomerization and disaggregated preformed Aβ oligomers and proto-fibrils (measured by transmission electron microscopy, dot blots, and size-exclusion chromatography). Wild-type sTREM2 also inhibited Aβ fibrillization (measured by imaging and thioflavin T fluorescence) and blocked Aβ-induced neurotoxicity (measured by permeabilization of artificial membranes and by loss of neurons in primary neuronal-glial cocultures). In contrast, the R47H AD-risk variant of sTREM2 is less able to bind and disaggregate oligomeric Aβ but rather promotes Aβ protofibril formation and neurotoxicity. Thus, in addition to inducing an immune response, wild-type TREM2 may protect against amyloid pathology by the Aβ-induced release of sTREM2, which blocks Aβ aggregation and neurotoxicity. In contrast, R47H sTREM2 promotes Aβ aggregation into protofibril that may be toxic to neurons. These findings may explain how wild-type sTREM2 apparently protects against AD in vivo and why a single copy of the R47H variant gene is associated with increased AD risk. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

Yet, the emotional distress caused by these changes and the factors responsible for place-based attachment, especially in the Global South, have received scant attention to date. Drawing on the theories of ‘solastalgia’—sadness caused by environmental change and the ensuing emotions it evokes—and place-based attachment, this article analysed the embodied experiences of climatic and environmental changes on rural households in KwaMaye, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Primary data was obtained qualitatively. Findings indicate that environmental and climatic changes, which have manifested in the form of increased soil infertility, soil erosion, mole and termite infestations and increased drought conditions, have undermined farmers’ ability to produce food and engage in livestock production effectively. These circumstances evoked frustrations, increased anxiety, sadness, reduced self-value and self-worth as well as helplessness. Nonetheless, place-based attachment is underpinned by kinship bonds and ancestral heritage. These issues have been discussed within the wider theoretical debates revolving around solastalgia and place-based attachment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Environmental and climatic changes; Place-based attachment; Solastalgia; South Africa,Earth sciences; Planning; Climatic changes; Drought conditions; Embodied experience; Environmental change; Kwazulu-Natal; Livestock production; Rural households; South Africa; Agriculture

Yet, the effects of obesity on brain structure in BD are under-researched. We obtained MRI-derived brain subcortical volumes and body mass index (BMI) from 1134 BD and 1601 control individuals from 17 independent research sites within the ENIGMA-BD Working Group. We jointly modeled the effects of BD and BMI on subcortical volumes using mixed-effects modeling and tested for mediation of group differences by obesity using nonparametric bootstrapping. All models controlled for age, sex, hemisphere, total intracranial volume, and data collection site. Relative to controls, individuals with BD had significantly higher BMI, larger lateral ventricular volume, and smaller volumes of amygdala, hippocampus, pallidum, caudate, and thalamus. BMI was positively associated with ventricular and amygdala and negatively with pallidal volumes. When analyzed jointly, both BD and BMI remained associated with volumes of lateral ventricles and amygdala. Adjusting for BMI decreased the BD vs control differences in ventricular volume. Specifically, 18.41% of the association between BD and ventricular volume was mediated by BMI (Z = 2.73, p = 0.006). BMI was associated with similar regional brain volumes as BD, including lateral ventricles, amygdala, and pallidum. Higher BMI may in part account for larger ventricles, one of the most replicated findings in BD. Comorbidity with obesity could explain why neurostructural alterations are more pronounced in some individuals with BD. Future prospective brain imaging studies should investigate whether obesity could be a modifiable risk factor for neuroprogression. © 2021, The Author(s).",,

Methods: We used GWAS summary statistics of 15 different types of cancers and two-sample Mendelian randomization to study the causal relationship with PD. Results: There was no evidence to support a causal relationship between the studied cancers and PD. We also performed reverse analyses between PD and cancers with available full summary statistics (melanoma, breast, prostate, endometrial and keratinocyte cancers) and did not find evidence of causal relationship. Conclusion: We found no evidence to support a causal relationship between cancers and PD and the previously reported associations could be a result of genetic pleiotropy, shared biology or biases. © 2021 - IOS Press.

In this learning, the Low-Resolution (LR) images are prepared by applying known degradation such as bicubic downsampling to the High-Resolution (HR) images. Unfortunately, bicubic down-sampling eliminates the natural image characteristics such as sensor noise, degradation due to built-in hardware, etc., and generates smooth images and hence generated images are different from the real-world data. When deep learning model is trained using such artificially generated LR-HR pairs, they often are prone to generate better SR results for real-world images. To circumvent this problem, we propose an SR framework that can train in an unsupervised manner using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It contains mainly couple of networks called SR network and degradation network which work on an unpaired data of LR-HR images. The SR network learns to eliminate noise present in the LR image and super-resolve it. While, degradation network performs inverse of SR network (i.e. down-sampling and adding degradation from real-world images). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by conducting extensive experiments on NTIRE-2020 Real-world SR challenge dataset where it demonstrates the superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative assessments. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Convolutional Neural Network; Deep learning; Generative Adversarial Network; Image restoration; No-reference quality assessment; Single Image Super-Resolution; Unsupervised learning,Inverse problems; Optical resolving power; Signal sampling; Adversarial networks; Built-in-hardware; High resolution image; Low resolution images; Quantitative and qualitative assessments; State of the art; State-of-the-art methods; Training process; Deep learning

Preprocessing algorithms designed to address these challenges increase resources, computational cost and introduce extraneous features, thereby reducing the efficacy of the diagnostic system. We propose a new approach to accurately segment skin lesions without the need for preprocessing steps to eliminate these confounding factors. The proposed method begins by thresholding with a correction factor in a color channel image with optimal discrimination between the target object and background. Next, the output of the preliminary segmentation undergoes angular displacement. Finally, we iterate, a number of times, the set difference between the binarized image and its rotated version, to simultaneously detect lesion borders and eliminate occlusions and clutters.

However, there are some indications that optical phenomena can occur in the neuronal cells based on biochemical processes in intra-or extracellular reactions. Also, external optical signals can be used to manipulate engineered neural cells for performing key functions. Motivated by these, this paper establishes a framework on photon transmission inside nerve fiber using optical properties of the nerve tissues to study photonic signaling. We use the same framework to analyze and propose mitigation using nanoparticles for demyelinated nerve channels- a potential cause for certain brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Our study assumes photons are available. The proposed framework for photonic signaling across nerve fibers uses an analytical model of a nerve fiber's segment that consists of physical factors, including size, Ranvier node presence, and interconnected segments. The demyelination effect on the nerve channel is evaluated by numerical electromagnetic computations. On this basis, photonic transmittance of a defected nerve segment is calculated, while demyelination takes place in different locations, lengths, and depths across the nerve segment. To repair the demyelination and enhance the transmittance of the demyelinated axon, we have performed analysis on nanoparticles such as silicon and silica quantum dots, gold nanoparticles, and gold/silica core-shell nanoparticles. Our computational models show that nanoparticles' presence improves the optical properties of nerve configuration that indicate photons can be transmitted in the axonal routes of demyelinated channels. © 2013 IEEE.",Axon channel; core-shell nanoparticle; demyelinated axon; nanorod; photonic transmission; quantum dot; transmittance,Cell signaling; Cells; Core shell nanoparticles; Fibers; Gold nanoparticles; Nanoparticles; Photons; Semiconductor quantum dots; Silica; Biochemical process; Cellular connectivity; Computational model; Electromagnetic computation; External optical signals; Optical phenomena; Photon transmission; Photonic transmission; Optical properties

We demonstrate how self-concordance of the loss allows to characterize the critical sample size sufficient to guarantee a chi-square type in-probability bound for the excess risk. Specifically, we consider two classes of losses: (i) self-concordant losses in the classical sense of Nesterov and Nemirovski, i.e., whose third derivative is uniformly bounded with the 3/2 power of the second derivative; (ii) pseudo self-concordant losses, for which the power is removed. These classes contain losses corresponding to several generalized linear models, including the logistic loss and pseudo-Huber losses. Our basic result under minimal assumptions bounds the critical sample size by O(d · deff), where d the parameter dimension and deff the effective dimension that accounts for model misspecification. In contrast to the exist-ing results, we only impose local assumptions that concern the population risk minimizer θ∗. Namely, we assume that the calibrated predictors, i.e., predictors scaled by the square root of the second derivative of the loss, is subgaussian at θ∗. Besides, for type-ii losses we require boundedness of certain measure of curvature of the population risk at θ∗. Our improved result bounds the critical sample size from above as O(max{deff,dlog d}) under slightly stronger assumptions. Namely, the local assumptions must hold in the neighborhood of θ∗ given by the Dikin ellipsoid of the population risk. Interestingly, we find that, for logistic regression with Gaussian design, there is no actual restriction of conditions: the subgaussian parameter and curvature measure remain near-constant over the Dikin ellipsoid. Finally, we extend some of these results to ℓ1-penalized estimators in high dimensions. © 2021, Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

The classical problem of pricing European and American financial options, based on the corresponding PDE formulations, is studied here. Instead of using numerical techniques based on finite element or difference methods, we address the problem using ANNs in the context of unsupervised learning. As a result, the ANN learns the option values for all possible underlying stock values at future time points, based on the minimization of a suitable loss function. For the European option, we solve the linear Black–Scholes equation, whereas for the American option we solve the linear complementarity problem formulation. Two-asset exotic option values are also computed, since ANNs enable the accurate valuation of high-dimensional options. The resulting errors of the ANN approach are assessed by comparing to the analytic option values or to numerical reference solutions (for American options, computed by finite elements). In the short note, previously published, a brief introduction to this work was given, where some ideas to price vanilla options by ANNs were presented, and only European options were addressed. In the current work, the methodology is introduced in much more detail. © 2020 by the authors.

These methods substantially improved the diagnoses of automatic brain tumor and leukemia/blood cancer detection and can assist the hematologist and doctors by providing a second opinion. This review provides an in-depth analysis of available TML and DL techniques for MIA with a significant focus on leukocytes classification in blood smear images and other medical imaging domains, i.e., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT images, X-ray, and ultrasounds. The proposed review's main impact is to find the most suitable TML and DL techniques in MIA, especially for leukocyte classification in blood smear images. The advanced DL techniques, particularly the evolving convolutional neural networks-based models in the MIA domain, are deeply investigated in this review article. The related literature study reveals that mainstream TML methods are vastly applied to microscopic blood smear images for white blood cells (WBC) analysis. They provide valuable information to medical specialists and help diagnose various hematic diseases such as AIDS and blood cancer (Leukaemia).

Mathematical modeling of the blood vessel as a molecular transport channel can be used for the characterization of the underlying processes and higher-level functions in the circulatory system. Besides, the mathematical model can be utilized for designing and realizing nano-scale molecular communication systems for healthcare applications including drug delivery systems. In this paper, a continuous-time Markov chain framework is proposed to simply model active transport mechanisms e.g. transcytosis, across the single-layered endothelial cells building the inner vessel wall. Correspondingly, a general homogeneous boundary condition over the vessel wall is introduced. Coupled with the derived boundary condition, the flow-induced diffusion problem in an ideal vessel structure with a cylindrical shape is accurately formulated which takes into account variation in all three dimensions. The corresponding concentration Green's function is analytically derived in terms of a convergent infinite series. Particle-based simulation results confirm the proposed analysis. Also, the effects of system parameters on the concentration Green's function are examined. © 2002-2011 IEEE.",boundary condition; drug delivery; flow-induced diffusion; Molecular communication,Blood; Boundary conditions; Continuous time systems; Drug delivery; Endothelial cells; Functions; Markov chains; Nanotechnology; Walls (structural partitions); Continuous time Markov chain; Drug delivery system; Health care application; Homogeneous boundary condition; Mathematical analysis; Molecular communication; Particle-based simulation; Transport mechanism; Blood vessels

While both climatic and non-climatic drivers interact across scales to influence vulnerability, traditionally, this inter-connectedness has received little attention in vulnerability assessments in the region. This study adopted the vulnerability patterns framework, operationalized using the Multidimensional Livelihood Vulnerability approach to include both climatic and non-climatic stressors to analyze differential household vulnerability in SARs of Mali. Findings showed that while drought was the most mentioned climate-related stressor, households were also exposed to a diversity of environmental and socio-economic stressors, including food scarcity, livestock disease, labour unavailability, crop damage, and erratic rainfall patterns. The typology revealed three vulnerability archetypes differentiated by adaptive capacity and sensitivity. Availability of productive household members, household resource endowments, livelihood diversification and social networks were the main discriminant factors of household adaptive capacity, while challenges relating to food and water security make households more sensitive to stressors. The analysis highlighted the heterogeneity in household vulnerability patterns within and across communities. Failing to account for this heterogeneity in adaptation planning might result in a mismatch between adaptation needs and interventions, and potentially in maladaptation. © 2020 The Author(s).

Given a list of cities and the distances between any city to another, the objective of the problem is to find the optimal permutation (tour) in the sense of minimum traveled distance when visiting each city only once before returning to the starting city. Because many real-world problems can be modeled to fit this formulation, the traveling salesman problem has applications in challenges related to planning, routing, scheduling, manufacturing, logistics, and other domains. Moreover, the traveling salesman problem serves as a benchmark problem for optimization methods and algorithms, including the genetic algorithm. In this paper, we examine various implementations of the genetic algorithm for solving two examples of the traveling salesman problem. Specifically, we compare commonly employed methods of partially mapped crossover and order crossover with an alternative encoding scheme that allows for single-point, multipoint, and uniform crossovers. In addition, we examine several mutation methods, including Twors mutation, center inverse mutation, reverse sequence mutation, and partial shuffle mutation. We empirically compare the implementations in terms of the chosen crossover and mutation methods to solve two benchmark variations of the traveling salesperson problem. The experimental results show that the genetic algorithm with order crossover and the center inverse mutation method provides the best solution for the two test cases. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Crossover; Genetic algorithm; Inversion sequence; Mutation; Permutations; TSP,Combinatorial optimization; Computation theory; Computer vision; Genetic algorithms; Intelligent computing; Inverse problems; Operations research; Algorithm for solving; Bench-mark problems; Combinatorial optimization problems; Crossover and mutation; Optimization method; Optimization theory; Real-world problem; Traveling salesperson problem; Traveling salesman problem

In the present study we compare the expression of key metabolic proteins, including the insulin receptor (CD220), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and fatty acid translocase (CD36), on peripheral blood mononuclear cell subtypes from patients across the neuropsychiatric spectrum, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and autism spectrum conditions (n = 25/condition), relative to typical controls (n = 100). This revealed alterations in the expression of these proteins that were specific to schizophrenia. Further characterization of metabolic alterations in an extended cohort of first-onset antipsychotic drug-naïve schizophrenia patients (n = 58) and controls (n = 63) revealed that the relationship between insulin receptor expression in monocytes and physiological insulin sensitivity was disrupted in schizophrenia and that altered expression of the insulin receptor was associated with whole genome polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia. Finally, longitudinal follow-up of the schizophrenia patients over the course of antipsychotic drug treatment revealed that peripheral metabolic markers predicted changes in psychopathology and the principal side effect of weight gain at clinically relevant time points. These findings suggest that peripheral blood cells can provide an accessible surrogate model for metabolic alterations in schizophrenia and have the potential to stratify subgroups of patients with different clinical outcomes or a greater risk of developing metabolic complications following antipsychotic therapy. © 2020 The Authors",Antipsychotic treatment; Cell surface marker; Flow cytometry; Homeostasis model assessment; Insulin sensitivity; Metabolic syndrome; Neuropsychiatric conditions; Peripheral blood mononuclear cell; Polygenic risk score; Response prediction; Weight gain,"insulin receptor; neuroleptic agent; Article; autism; bipolar disorder; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell viability; controlled study; disease severity; exploratory research; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; immunophenotyping; major clinical study; major depression; mental disease assessment; metabolic syndrome X; monocyte; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; positron emission tomography; priority journal; Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms; Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms; schizophrenia; whole genome sequencing; metabolic syndrome X; mononuclear cell; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; schizophrenia; Antipsychotic Agents; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Metabolic Syndrome; Schizophrenia"

We analyze self-reported PHL from different value chain agents – farmers, wholesale traders, processors, and retailers – based on unique large-scale data sets for two major commercial commodities, the storable staple teff and the perishable liquid milk. Aggregate PHL over all segments of the value chain (farmer to retailer) in the most prevalent marketing channel for teff and milk amount to between 2.2 and 3.3 percent and 2.1 and 4.3 percent of total produced quantities, respectively. Estimates of PHL from this research are found to be lower than is commonly assumed. We complement these findings with primary data from urban food retailers for more than 4,000 commodities. We find that the emerging modern retail sector in Ethiopia is characterized on average by half the level of PHL than is observed in the traditional retail sector. This is likely due to more stringent quality requirements in procurement systems, to sales of more packaged – and therefore better protected – commodities, and to better refrigeration, storage, and sales facilities. The further expected expansion of modern retail in these settings should therefore likely lead to a lowering of PHL in food value chains, at least at the retail level. © 2020",Ethiopia; Post-harvest losses; Rural-urban value chains; Sub-Saharan Africa,marketing; milk production; research work; retailing; rural-urban comparison; urban economy; Ethiopia

Businesses are accordingly challenged to become more inclusive. What this involves in practice is anything but clear, however. This partly stems from weak and inconsistent conceptualizations of ‘inclusive businesses’ and their business models. Because development actors and academics generally offer conflicting and value-laden interpretations of these concepts, an unambiguous and theoretically grounded perspective on business inclusivity is sorely lacking. This article attempts to move the needle on extant inclusive business discourse by delineating, conceptually, what it means to be(come) an inclusive business. By drawing on the rich literature on inclusive growth, sustainable business models, social enterprise and hybrid organizations, it offers revised definitions of inclusive businesses and inclusive business models. The article argues, amongst others, that inclusive businesses necessarily prioritize value creation over value capture and should be judged based on the net value they create for ‘income-constrained’ groups. It furthermore proposes how the boundaries of entrepreneurial responsibility can be delimited, with implications for how sustainable business models more generally should be designed. © 2020 The Author",Inclusive business; Inclusive growth; Social enterprise; Sustainable business models; Sustainable development,Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Business models; Conceptual foundations; Global economies; Low incomes; Social enterprise; Sustainable business; Value captures; Value creation; Sustainable development

Methods We evaluated expansions frequency in the entire cohort (n = 1,396; behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia [bvFTD] [n = 800], primary progressive aphasia [PPA] [n = 495], and FTLD-motor neuron disease [MND] [n = 101]). We then focused on the bvFTD and PPA cases and tested for association between expansion status, syndromes, genetic ancestry, and AAO applying statistical tests comprising Fisher exact tests, analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc tests, and logistic and nonlinear mixed-effects model regressions. Results We found C9orf72 pathogenic expansions in 4% of all cases (56/1,396). Expansion carriers differently distributed across syndromes: 12/101 FTLD-MND (11.9%), 40/800 bvFTD (5%), and 4/495 PPA (0.8%). While addressing population substructure through principal components analysis (PCA), we defined 2 patients groups with Central/Northern (n = 873) and Southern European (n = 523) ancestry. The proportion of expansion carriers was significantly higher in bvFTD compared to PPA (5% vs 0.8% [p = 2.17 × 10−5; odds ratio (OR) 6.4; confidence interval (CI) 2.31-24.99]), as well as in individuals with Central/Northern European compared to Southern European ancestry (4.4% vs 1.8% [p = 1.1 × 10−2; OR 2.5; CI 1.17-5.99]). Pathogenic expansions and Central/Northern European ancestry independently and inversely correlated with AAO. Our prediction model (based on expansions status, genetic ancestry, and AAO) predicted a diagnosis of bvFTD with 64% accuracy. Conclusions Our results indicate correlation between pathogenic C9orf72 expansions, AAO, PCA-based Central/Northern European ancestry, and a diagnosis of bvFTD, implying complex genetic risk architectures differently underpinning the behavioral and language variant syndromes. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The input of Nsymb reduces the energy costs of producing fertilizer and provides a supply of nitrogen (N) for plants that is more synchronous to plant demand than occasional fertilizer applications. Legumes have been promoted as a potential N2O mitigation strategy for grasslands, but evidence to support their efficacy is limited, partly due to the difficulty in conducting experiments across the large range of potential combinations of legume proportions and fertilizer N inputs. These experimental constraints can be overcome by biogeochemical models that can vary legume-fertilizer combinations and subsequently aid the design of targeted experiments. Using two variants each of two biogeochemical models (APSIM and DayCent), we tested the N2O mitigation potential and productivity of full factorial combinations of legume proportions and fertilizer rates for five temperate grassland sites across the globe. Both models showed that replacing fertilizer with legumes reduced N2O emissions without reducing productivity across a broad range of legume-fertilizer combinations. Although the models were consistent with the relative changes of N2O emissions compared to the baseline scenario (200 kg N ha−1 yr−1; no legumes), they predicted different levels of absolute N2O emissions and thus also of absolute N2O emission reductions; both were greater in DayCent than in APSIM. We recommend confirming these results with experimental studies assessing the effect of clover proportions in the range 30–50% and ≤150 kg N ha−1 yr−1 input as these were identified as best-bet climate smart agricultural practices. ©2020.

Further, the metabolic alterations mediating the effects of adiposity on CRC are not fully understood. Methods: We examined sex- and site-specific associations of adiposity with CRC risk and whether adiposity-associated metabolites explain the associations of adiposity with CRC. Genetic variants from genome-wide association studies of body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR, unadjusted for BMI; N = 806,810), and 123 metabolites from targeted nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics (N = 24,925), were used as instruments. Sex-combined and sex-specific Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted for BMI and WHR with CRC risk (58,221 cases and 67,694 controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium, Colorectal Cancer Transdisciplinary Study, and Colon Cancer Family Registry). Sex-combined MR was conducted for BMI and WHR with metabolites, for metabolites with CRC, and for BMI and WHR with CRC adjusted for metabolite classes in multivariable models. Results: In sex-specific MR analyses, higher BMI (per 4.2 kg/m2) was associated with 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08, 1.38) times higher CRC odds among men (inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) model); among women, higher BMI (per 5.2 kg/m2) was associated with 1.09 (95% CI = 0.97, 1.22) times higher CRC odds. WHR (per 0.07 higher) was more strongly associated with CRC risk among women (IVW OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.08, 1.43) than men (IVW OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.81, 1.36). BMI or WHR was associated with 104/123 metabolites at false discovery rate-corrected P ≤ 0.05; several metabolites were associated with CRC, but not in directions that were consistent with the mediation of positive adiposity-CRC relations. In multivariable MR analyses, associations of BMI and WHR with CRC were not attenuated following adjustment for representative metabolite classes, e.g., the univariable IVW OR for BMI with CRC was 1.12 (95% CI = 1.00, 1.26), and this became 1.11 (95% CI = 0.99, 1.26) when adjusting for cholesterol in low-density lipoprotein particles. Conclusions: Our results suggest that higher BMI more greatly raises CRC risk among men, whereas higher WHR more greatly raises CRC risk among women. Adiposity was associated with numerous metabolic alterations, but none of these explained associations between adiposity and CRC. More detailed metabolomic measures are likely needed to clarify the mechanistic pathways. © 2020, The Author(s).",Body mass index; CCFR; Colorectal cancer; CORECT; Epidemiology; GECCO; Mendelian randomization; Metabolism; NMR; Waist-to-hip ratio,"cholesterol; low density lipoprotein; adult; Article; body mass; cancer risk; case control study; colorectal cancer; controlled study; female; gender; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; human; major clinical study; male; metabolite; metabolomics; nuclear magnetic resonance; obesity; waist hip ratio; colorectal tumor; complication; Europe; genetic predisposition; genetics; Mendelian randomization analysis; metabolism; metabolome; middle aged; obesity; risk factor; sex factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adiposity; Adult; Body Mass Index; Case-Control Studies; Colorectal Neoplasms; Europe; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Metabolome; Middle Aged; Obesity; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Waist-Hip Ratio"

Despite this, drylands are characterized by low tree survival especially for tree species preferred by local communities. We conducted a study in arid and semi-arid areas of Kenya and Ethiopia with 1773 households to assess how different tree planting and management practices influence seedling survival. Using on-farm planned comparisons, farmers experimented and compared tree survival under different planting and management practices as well as under varying socioeconomic and biophysical contexts in the two countries. Seedling survival was monitored at least six months after planting. Results show that watering, manure application, seedling protection by fencing and planting in a small hole (30 cm diameter and 45 cm depth) had a significant effect on tree seedling survival in Kenya, while in Ethiopia, mulching, watering and planting niche were significant to tree survival. Household socioeconomics and farms’ biophysical characteristics such as farm size, education level of the household head, land tenure, age of the household head had significant effects on seedling survival in both Ethiopia and Kenya while presence of soil erosion on the farm had a significant effect in Kenya. Soil quality ranking was positively correlated with tree survival in Ethiopia, regardless of species assessed. Current findings have confirmed effects of context specific variables some involving intrahousehold socioeconomic status such education level of the household head, and farm size that influence survival. © 2020 by the authors.

This study compared two methods—voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and region of interest (ROI) analyses—to identify significant gray matter changes of patients with bipolar disorder type I (BP I). Results: The VBM findings suggested gray matter reductions in the left precentral gyrus and right precuneus of the patients compared to healthy subjects (α = 0.0005, uncorrected). However, no regions reached the level of significance in ROI analysis using the three atlases, i.e., hammers, lpba40, and neuromorphometrics atlases (α = 0.0005). Conclusion: It can be concluded that VBM analysis seems to be more sensitive to partial changes in this study.

Here, we use a horizon scanning approach to identify five large-scale trends that are likely to have substantial medium- and long-term effects on forests and forest livelihoods: forest megadisturbances; changing rural demographics; the rise of the middle-class in low- and middle-income countries; increased availability, access and use of digital technologies; and large-scale infrastructure development. These trends represent human and environmental processes that are exceptionally large in geographical extent and magnitude, and difficult to reverse. They are creating new agricultural and urban frontiers, changing existing rural landscapes and practices, opening spaces for novel conservation priorities and facilitating an unprecedented development of monitoring and evaluation platforms that can be used by local communities, civil society organizations, governments and international donors. Understanding these larger-scale dynamics is key to support not only the critical role of forests in meeting livelihood aspirations locally, but also a range of other sustainability challenges more globally. We argue that a better understanding of these trends and the identification of levers for change requires that the research community not only continue to build on case studies that have dominated research efforts so far, but place a greater emphasis on causality and causal mechanisms, and generate a deeper understanding of how local, national and international geographical scales interact. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",,adult; climate change; employment; environmental protection; female; forecasting; forest; forestry; human; international cooperation; male; middle aged; occupation; Adult; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Employment; Female; Forecasting; Forestry; Forests; Humans; Internationality; Male; Middle Aged; Occupations

Since its domestication in the inner Niger delta ca. 2500 years BP, African rice has colonized a variety of ecologically and climatically diverse regions. However, little is known about the genetic basis of quantitative traits and adaptive variation of agricultural interest for this species. Results: Using a reference set of 163 fully re-sequenced accessions, we report the results of a Genome Wide Association Study carried out for African rice. We investigated a diverse panel of traits, including flowering date, panicle architecture and resistance to Rice yellow mottle virus. For this, we devised a pipeline using complementary statistical association methods. First, using flowering time as a target trait, we found several association peaks, one of which co-localised with a well described gene in the Asian rice flowering pathway, OsGi, and identified new genomic regions that would deserve more study. Then we applied our pipeline to panicle- and resistance-related traits, highlighting some interesting genomic regions and candidate genes. Lastly, using a high-resolution climate database, we performed an association analysis based on climatic variables, searching for genomic regions that might be involved in adaptation to climatic variations. Conclusion: Our results collectively provide insights into the extent to which adaptive variation is governed by sequence diversity within the O. glaberrima genome, paving the way for in-depth studies of the genetic basis of traits of interest that might be useful to the rice breeding community. © 2020, The Author(s).",African rice; Climate variation; Flowering time; Genome wide association study; Panicle architecture; RYMV,

Early REDD+ programs and local/subnational projects used various interventions (i.e. enabling measures, disincentives and incentives), implemented by government, the commercial and non-commercial private sector, but are currently understudied vis-à-vis their effectiveness to address site-specific drivers of deforestation and forest degradation (DD). We assess how well REDD+ interventions addressed DD at five project sites in Peru (1), Brazil (1), Vietnam (1) and Indonesia (2). Our study design includes an integrated assessment of remotely sensed, spatially modelled, and locally reported drivers. First, we observe follow-up land use from high resolution imagery as proxy for direct deforestation drivers. Second, spatial Random Forest modelling of DD drivers allows for influence quantification of topographic, climatic and proximity variables at each site. Third, we report direct and indirect DD drivers from pre-intervention surveys and semi-structured interviews with five REDD+ implementers, 40 villages and 1200 households. Data gathered included perceived changes in forest cover and quality, and their causes. We found general agreement between observed, modelled and reported local DD drivers, yet some were inadequately addressed by interventions. Intra-site differences in drivers underscores the importance of analysing micro-level DD drivers. Our interdisciplinary approach reveals the complexities of local direct and indirect DD drivers, and the complementarity of remotely sensed, spatially modelled and locally reported methods for driver identification. A better understanding of the alignment between DD drivers and REDD+ interventions is vital for practitioners and policy makers to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency, equity and co-benefits of REDD+ at the local level. © 2020 The Authors",Data complementarity; Forest degradation; Interventions; Land use; Random Forest model; REDD+; Remote sensing,article; Brazil; climate change; deforestation; follow up; household; human; human experiment; imagery; Indonesia; land use; Peru; physician; random forest; remote sensing; semi structured interview; Viet Nam

The number of interventions for antimicrobial resistance is increasing but current research has major limitations in terms of efforts, methods, scope, quality, and reporting. Moving the agenda forwards requires an improved understanding of the diversity of interventions, their feasibility and cost–benefit, the implementation factors that shape and underpin their effectiveness, and the ways in which individual interventions might interact synergistically or antagonistically to influence actions against antimicrobial resistance in different contexts. Within the efforts to strengthen the global governance of antimicrobial resistance, we advocate for the creation of an international One Health platform for online learning. The platform will synthesise the evidence for actions on antimicrobial resistance into a fully accessible database; generate new scientific insights into the design, implementation, evaluation, and reporting of the broad range of interventions relevant to addressing antimicrobial resistance; and ultimately contribute to the goal of building societal resilience to this central challenge of the 21st century. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"antibiotic resistance; cost benefit analysis; e-learning; feasibility study; One Health; review; animal; human; antiinfective agent; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Humans; One Health"

The pessimistic school asserts that modernization undermines the structural conditions for high levels of trust. The optimistic account argues that it delivers economic security and human empowerment and thereby enhances trust. Adapting these contrasting theories to the specific case of China, this article puts them to the test with survey data from the World Values Survey. Exploiting the condition of highly uneven levels of regional development, combined with common political institutions and a shared cultural heritage, the study conducts a multi-level analysis of survey data from over 1900 individuals and a wide range of regional statistics from 61 county-level units. While trust in family members and particular trust beyond the family are unaffected by levels of regional modernization, we find robust evidence to suggest that regional modernization is associated with substantially higher levels of general trust. The results further suggests that higher general trust in more developed regions does not lead to an enhanced conversion of particular into general trust. This indicates that general trust is nurtured through the contextual effect of residing in more modern social environments. Overall, these findings provide substantial support for modernization optimists and lend themselves to a reinterpretation of a widely discussed “trust crisis” in China, which to date is often interpreted according to the pessimistic view of modernization. © 2020, The Author(s).",Asia; China; General trust; Modernization; Particular trust; Social capital; Trust,modernization; regional development; social capital; socioeconomic conditions; uneven development; China

Earlier methods used some scoring techniques to detect changes in correlation patterns of a gene pair in two conditions. However, modeling differential coexpression by means of finding differences in the dependence structure of the gene pair has hitherto not been carried out. We exploit a copula-based framework to model differential coexpression between gene pairs in two different conditions. The Copula is used to model the dependency between expression profiles of a gene pair. For a gene pair, the distance between two joint distributions produced by copula is served as differential coexpression. We used five pan-cancer TCGA RNA-Seq data to evaluate the model that outperforms the existing state of the art. Moreover, the proposed model can detect a mild change in the coexpression pattern across two conditions. For noisy expression data, the proposed method performs well because of the popular scale-invariant property of copula. In addition, we have identified differentially coexpressed modules by applying hierarchical clustering on the distance matrix. The identified modules are analyzed through Gene Ontology terms and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"algorithm; biology; cluster analysis; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; gene regulatory network; genetics; human; neoplasm; procedures; sequence analysis; system analysis; Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Neoplasms; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Systems Analysis"

We build a simple model describing a consumer/predator which, besides random dispersion, searches for food by moving toward the gradient of some chemical released by prey. This mechanism is referred as indirect prey-taxis. The predator's rate of consumption is assumed to drop due to interference among predators when too many of them encounter on some aggregate of prey. The latter is assumed to have a negligible motility with its density governed by an ODE. The interference among consumers is modeled by a modification of the Beddington's de Angelis functional response.

In this work, we address relay selection problem for wireless powered communication networks, where the relays harvest energy from the source radio frequency signals. A single source–destination pair is considered without a direct link. The connecting relay nodes are equipped with storage batteries of infinite size. We assume that the channel state information (CSI) on the source–relay link is available at the relay nodes. Depending on the availability of the CSI on the relay–destination link at the relay node, we propose two relay selection schemes and evaluate their outage probability. Availability of the CSI at the relay node on the relay–destination link considerably improves the performance due to additional flexibility in the relay selection mechanism. Due to absence of CSI throughout the network at the time of transmission path selection, the analysis of the problem is not tractable. Therefore, we relax our assumptions on availability of CSI and closed-form expressions of the outage probability as a function of the amount of the available harvested energy are derived for both CSI availability cases. Finally, we numerically quantify the performance for the proposed schemes and compare the outage probability for fixed and equal number of wireless powered forwarding relays. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Outage probability; Relay selection; RF energy harvesting; SWIPT; Wireless powered communication networks,Electric power supplies to apparatus; Energy harvesting; Fading (radio); Fading channels; Probability; Additional flexibilities; Closed-form expression; Information reliability; Outage probability; Radiofrequency signals; Relay selection; RF energy harvesting; SWIPT; Channel state information

This paper contributes to this debate by analyzing the effect of the electoral incentive structure on the substantive representation of women. Drawing on the Competing Principals Theory, it is expected that female legislators more frequently act on behalf of women if their re-election does not depend on the representation of local interests in electoral districts. The empirical analysis uses the German mixed electoral system and analyzes the representation of women’s issues in oral and written parliamentary questions tabled in the German Bundestag between 2005 and 2013. The results of a hurdle regression model show that female MPs are more likely to concentrate on the representation of women’s interests if their re-election is secured and if they do not have to fight for additional local votes from their district. © 2019 University of Utah.",electoral systems; gender; parliamentary questions; substantive representation; women’s interests,

We propose that embedding drug-loaded hyaluronic acid (HA) microneedles in supermacroporous collagen type-I (Col-I) cryogel plugs may enhance the hydration and provide prolonged release of drug for ocular diseases. In this study, we have fabricated Col-I cryogel and HA-microneedles embedded Col-I cryogel at sub-zero temperature using 4S-arm Star-PEG as a crosslinker. The fabricated novel Col-I cryogels have shown supermacroporous morphology with solvent uptake capacity of nearly 90% due to large pore volume and high interconnectivity. These features of the cryogel enable the release the drug in a controlled and sustained manner. The fabricated cryogels have demonstrated nearly 50% degradation in simulated tear fluid within 15 days of duration. Moreover, the microneedles incorporated cryogels have shown prolonged release of required therapeutic concentration of drug that may satisfy the present dire need for antibacterial drug delivery in eyes.

It was originally based on combining practitioner communication skills with participatory methods to facilitate the involvement of animal caretakers and owners (embracing their knowledge, experience, and motivations) in the identification and assessment of animal disease problems, including in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of disease control programs, policies, and strategies. With the importance of understanding social perceptions and drivers receiving increasing recognition by epidemiologists, PE tools are being adapted for an increasingly wide range of settings and endeavors. More recently, PE tools have been adapted for use in food and nutrition security programs, One Health activities, wildlife disease surveillance and as part of mixed-methods research across a range of socio-economic settings. This review describes the evolution of PE (in relation to veterinary epidemiology and briefly in relation to public health epidemiology), the underpinning philosophy and principles essential to its effective application and the importance of gender-sensitive approaches and data triangulation, including conventional confirmatory testing. The article also provides illustrative examples highlighting the diversity of approaches and applications of PE, hallmarks of successful PE initiatives and the lessons we can learn when these are missing. Finally, we look forward, describing the particular utility of PE for dealing with emerging infectious diseases, gaining attention of field-level cross-sector officials who can escalate concerns to a higher level and for continuing to raise the voices of those less-heard (such as women, minority groups, and remote communities with limited exposure to formal education) in defining the problems and planning activities that will likely impact directly on their well-being and livelihoods. © Copyright © 2020 Alders, Ali, Ameri, Bagnol, Cooper, Gozali, Hidayat, Rukambile, Wong and Catley.",emerging infectious disease; medical anthropology; One Health; participatory disease surveillance; participatory impact assessment,animal disease; animal health; antibiotic resistance; avian influenza; community; epidemiology; evolution; experience; food; food safety; health service; history; household; human; Indonesia; malnutrition; methodology; One Health; Pakistan; Review; South Sudan; Tanzania; Timor-Leste; Uganda; Viet Nam

Gluten is composed by gliadins and glutenins. The glutenins can be further divided into high and low-molecular-weight glutenins (HMWGs and LMWGs, respectively) and are encoded by Glu-1 and Glu-3 loci. The variability of these genes is associated with differences in quality. Because of this, the identification of novel glutenin alleles is still an important target. In this study, 57 haplotypes or glutenin combinations were registered among a set of 158 Iranian landraces and five novel HMWGs alleles were identified. The landraces were also characterized for several quality traits, including gluten quality, which allowed to associate the different glutenin alleles with low or high quality. Other quality traits examined were iron, zinc, and phytate contents, which are intimately related with the nutritional quality. Important variation for these components was found as well as for the phytate:iron/zinc molar ratios (related to the potential bioavailability of these important micronutrients). The landraces identified in the present study (some of them combining high gluten quality with low phytate:zinc values) could be a useful resource for breeders who aim to improve the wheat end-use quality and especially the content of zinc and its relative bioavailability. © 2020 by the authors.

We propose a centralized graph kernel least mean squares (GKLMS) approach for identifying the nonlinear graph filters. The principles of coherence-check and random Fourier features (RFF) are used to reduce the dictionary size. Additionally, we leverage the graph structure to derive the graph diffusion KLMS (GDKLMS). The proposed GDKLMS requires only single-hop communication during successive time instants, making it viable for real-time network-based applications. In the distributed implementation, usage of RFF avoids the requirement of a centralized pre-trained dictionary in the case of coherence-check. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated in modeling a nonlinear graph filter via numerical examples. The results show that centralized and distributed implementations effectively model the nonlinear graph filters, whereas the random-feature-based solutions are shown to outperform coherence-check based solutions. © 2020 IEEE.",,Graph structures; Diffusion kernel; Distributed implementation; Fourier features; Graph kernels; Random features; Real time network; Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces; Single-hop communications; Graph algorithms

Biocontrol products must be developed, and their efficacy demonstrated before widespread use. Efficacy of two aflatoxin biocontrol products, Aflasafe GH01 and Aflasafe GH02, were evaluated in 800 maize and groundnut farmers’ fields during 2015 and 2016 in the Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Northern, Upper East, and Upper West regions of Ghana. Both products were developed after an extensive examination of fungi associated with maize and groundnut in Ghana. Each product contains as active ingredient fungi four Aspergillus flavus isolates belonging to atoxigenic African Aspergillus Vegetative Compatibility Groups (AAVs) widely distributed across Ghana. An untreated field was maintained for each treated field to determine product efficacy. Proportions of atoxigenic AAVs composing each product were assessed in soils before product application, and soils and grains at harvest. Significant (P < 0.05) displacement of toxigenic fungi occurred in both crops during both years, in all five regions. Biocontrol-treated crops consistently had significantly (P < 0.05) less aflatoxins (range = 76% to 100% less; average = 99% less) than untreated crops. Results indicate that both biocontrol products are highly efficient, cost-effective, environmentally safe tools for aflatoxin mitigation. Most crops from treated fields could have been sold in both local and international food and feed premium markets.

Most studies fail to distinguish between these two; thus, we know little about which effects dominate and their long-term welfare implications. This study uses a random distribution of discount coupons and drought events that trigger payouts as exogenous variations in order to identify both the ex ante risk-management and ex post payout effects of index-based livestock insurance in a pastoral-dominant society of northern Kenya, where the literature has detected asset-based poverty traps, represented by bifurcated herd-size dynamics. We find that, first, both risk-management and payout effects help reduce the probability of distress sales of livestock. Second, payout effects also reduce the slaughter of livestock. Finally, while payout effects remain robust for the sub-sample of poorer households below the poverty-trap threshold, statistically significant risk-management effects on reduced livestock sales disappear for them. Overall, our results suggest that insurance payouts can help the poor escape poverty traps, while the impact of behavioural changes accompanied by insurance purchases is more subtle in our settings. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,economic policy; financial policy; income distribution; insurance system; literature review; policy making; poverty alleviation; Kenya

The 6TiSCH architecture integrates the high reliability and low-energy consumption of IEEE 802.15.4e Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) with IPv6. IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH defines only the communication between nodes through a schedule but it does not specify how the resources are allocated for communication between the nodes in 6TiSCH networks. We propose a distributed algorithm for bandwidth allocation, called Local Voting, that adapts the schedule to the network conditions. The algorithm tries to equalize the link load (defined as the ratio of the queue length plus the new packet arrivals, over the number of allocated cells) through cell reallocation by calculating the number of cells to be added or released by 6top. Simulation results show that equalizing the load throughout 6TiSCH network provides better fairness in terms of load, reduces the queue sizes and packets reach the root faster compared to representative algorithms from the literature.

However, they are also a major source of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Several agronomic strategies have been proposed to improve water-use efficiency and reduce GHG emissions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of water-saving irrigation (alternate wetting and drying (AWD) vs. soil water potential (SWP)), contrasting land establishment (puddling vs. reduced tillage) and fertiliser application methods (broadcast vs. liquid fertilisation) on water-use efficiency, GHG emissions and rice yield. The experiment was laid out in a randomised complete block design with eight treatments (all combinations of the three factors) and four replicates. AWD combined with broadcasting fertilisation was superior to SWP in terms of maintaining yield. However, seasonal nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were significantly reduced by 64% and 66% in the Broadcast-SWP and Liquid fertiliser-SWP treatments, respectively, compared to corresponding treatments in AWD. The SWP also significantly reduced seasonal methane (CH4) emissions by 34 and 30% in the broadcast and liquid fertilisation treatments, respectively. Area-scaled GWPs were reduced by 48% and 54% in Broadcast-SWP and Liquid fertiliser-SWP treatments respectively compared to the corresponding treatments in AWD. Compared to AWD, the broadcast and liquid fertilisation in SWP irrigation treatments reduced yield-scaled GWPs by 46% and 37%, respectively. In terms of suitability, based on yield-scaled GWPs, the treatments can be ordered as follows: Broadcast-SWP &lt; Broadcast-AWD = Liquid fertiliser-SWP &lt; Liquid fertiliser-AWD. Growing-season water use was 15% lower in the SWP treatments compared with the water-saving AWD. Reduced tillage reduced additional water use during land preparation. The conclusions of this study are that improved water management and timely coordination of N fertiliser with crop demand can reduce water use, N loss via N2O emissions, and CH4 emissions. © 2020",Alternate wetting and drying; Fertigation; Global warming potential; Liquid fertilisation; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Reduced tillage; Soil water potential scheduling; Yield,Efficiency; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Irrigation; Liquid methane; Liquids; Nitrogen oxides; Soil moisture; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Application strategies; Irrigation treatments; Irrigation water use; Rice production systems; Soil water potential; Water use efficiency; Water-saving irrigation; WETTING AND DRYING; Greenhouse gases; methane; carbon emission; crop production; crop yield; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; irrigation; rice; soil water potential; tillage; water management; water use; air pollution control; Article; controlled study; crop production; fertigation; fertilizer application; grain yield; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; irrigation (agriculture); nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; plant water use; priority journal; rice; soil water potential; tillage; water conservation

As recommended by the FAIR principles, data, labels, and metadata must use controlled vocabularies and ontologies that are popular in the knowledge domain and commonly used by the community. Despite the existence of robust ontologies in the Life Sciences, there is currently no comprehensive full set of ontologies recommended for data annotation across agricultural research disciplines. In this paper, we discuss the added value of the Ontologies Community of Practice (CoP) of the CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture for harnessing relevant expertise in ontology development and identifying innovative solutions that support quality data annotation. The Ontologies CoP stimulates knowledge sharing among stakeholders, such as researchers, data managers, domain experts, experts in ontology design, and platform development teams. Digital technology use in agriculture and agrifood systems research accelerates the production of multidisciplinary data, which spans genetics, environment, agroecology, biology, and socio-economics. Quality labeling of data secures its online findability, reusability, interoperability, and reliable interpretation, through controlled vocabularies organized into meaningful and computer-readable knowledge domains called ontologies. There is currently no full set of recommended ontologies for agricultural research, so data scientists, data managers, and database developers struggle to find validated terminology. The Ontologies Community of Practice of the CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture harnesses international expertise in knowledge representation and ontology development to produce missing ontologies, identifies best practices, and guides data labeling by teams managing multidisciplinary information platforms to release the FAIR data underpinning the evidence of research impact. The deployment of digital technology in Agriculture and Food Science accelerates the production of large quantities of multidisciplinary data. The Ontologies Community of Practice (CoP) of the CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture harnesses the international ontology expertise that can guide teams managing multidisciplinary agricultural information platforms to increase the data interoperability and reusability.

The country has considerably decreased deforestation since 2004, but Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) is arguably under question, both as a concept and as a tool to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as deforestation levels have increased over the last five years. This article investigates how different policy actors have perceived REDD+ over time, how they have engaged in REDD+ efforts over the past decade, and how REDD+ implementation in Brazil should move forward accordingly. We analyzed qualitative data from semi-structured interviews and actors’ “stances”, i.e., their positions—with regards to key issues connected to REDD+ governance and its challenges—over three different time periods (Phase 1: 2010–2011, Phase 2: 2015–2016, and Phase 3: 2019), so as to identify the practical implications of these diverse interpretations. We argue that the way actors perceive REDD+ is intimately related to the way they interpret and assign meanings towards it and, in consequence, the way they coordinate REDD+-related practices and efforts. We focus on the link between perceptions and efforts so as to comprehend the relevance that different interpretations have to both the concept and implementation of REDD+ in Brazil. Our analysis concentrates on the potential to improve the coordination and integration of REDD+ implementation and diverse actors’ efforts with regards to REDD+ activities. Results suggest that actors’ perceptions of REDD+ generated a plurality of meanings, highlighting a range of dialectical and ontological interactions that have, in turn, resulted in multiple REDD+ interpretations. Findings highlight that different actors have the same interests when it comes to their organizational efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, suggesting that there is room for a better coordination of efforts towards this end, as well as increased collaboration. © 2020 by the authors.

Variants in the PRNP gene that encodes prion protein are strong risk factors for sCJD but, although the condition has similar heritability to other neurodegenerative disorders, no other genetic risk loci have been confirmed. We aimed to discover new genetic risk factors for sCJD, and their causal mechanisms. Methods: We did a genome-wide association study of sCJD in European ancestry populations (patients diagnosed with probable or definite sCJD identified at national CJD referral centres) with a two-stage study design using genotyping arrays and exome sequencing. Conditional, transcriptional, and histological analyses of implicated genes and proteins in brain tissues, and tests of the effects of risk variants on clinical phenotypes, were done using deep longitudinal clinical cohort data. Control data from healthy individuals were obtained from publicly available datasets matched for country. Findings: Samples from 5208 cases were obtained between 1990 and 2014. We found 41 genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and independently replicated findings at three loci associated with sCJD risk; within PRNP (rs1799990; additive model odds ratio [OR] 1·23 [95% CI 1·17–1·30], p=2·68 × 10−15; heterozygous model p=1·01 × 10−135), STX6 (rs3747957; OR 1·16 [1·10–1·22], p=9·74 × 10−9), and GAL3ST1 (rs2267161; OR 1·18 [1·12–1·25], p=8·60 × 10−10). Follow-up analyses showed that associations at PRNP and GAL3ST1 are likely to be caused by common variants that alter the protein sequence, whereas risk variants in STX6 are associated with increased expression of the major transcripts in disease-relevant brain regions. Interpretation: We present, to our knowledge, the first evidence of statistically robust genetic associations in sporadic human prion disease that implicate intracellular trafficking and sphingolipid metabolism as molecular causal mechanisms. Risk SNPs in STX6 are shared with progressive supranuclear palsy, a neurodegenerative disease associated with misfolding of protein tau, indicating that sCJD might share the same causal mechanisms as prion-like disorders.

Existing research focuses either on policymakers' preferences or their opportunities offered by the institutional structures in which policymakers operate. As these two strands of literature barely refer to each other, in this article we develop an integrated theoretical model of blame-shifting in multilevel governance systems and assess it empirically. In line with the first strand, we assume that policymakers have a preference for shifting blame onto actors on a different level from themselves. In line with the second, we suppose that opportunities for doing so depend on institutional responsibility for policymaking and policy implementation. We check the plausibility of our integrated model by examining policymakers' blame attributions in three cases where European Union migration policies have been contested: border control, asylum, and welfare entitlements. We find that our integrated model does better in explaining blame-shifting in these cases than the isolated models. © 2019 The Authors. Governance published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,

In this opinion piece we give a concise overview of the most recent developments in measuring key indicators and metrics for the three pillars of CSA (food security, adaptation, and mitigation) and give our opinion on how we think this would allow for improvements in the current state of assessing CSA in a smallholder farming context. Our assessment shows that all tools reviewed here have a biophysical lens while looking at productivity, and largely ignore potential social (e.g., food security, gender) and economic (poverty) aspects of the sustainability of intensified production. Mitigation was also analyzed in all approaches but few tools go beyond greenhouse gas emissions to analyse environmental sustainability (for example water quality, soil health, ecosystem services) more generically. Climate change adaptation was the CSA pillar with the weakest representation within the approaches reviewed here. Based on an overview of recent advantages in work focusing on CSA our key recommendations are (i) to make better use of recent advances in indicator development for sustainability assessments, including work on quantification of water and land footprints in relation to farm management; (ii) to use household level analyses to quantify pathways from productivity toward food security and improved nutrition as well as descripting drivers of adoption of adaptation options; and (iii) to use recent advances in system specific quantification of greenhouse gas emissions through both LMIC focused modeling and empirical work. © Copyright © 2020 van Wijk, Merbold, Hammond and Butterbach-Bahl.",adaptation; assessment; climate smart agriculture (CSA); food security; mitigation,

Here we go beyond identification of coral dissolution induced by ocean acidification and identify a mechanism that will lead to a loss of habitat in cold-water coral reef habitats on an ecosystem-scale. To quantify this, we present in situ and year-long laboratory evidence detailing the type of habitat shift that can be expected (in situ evidence), the mechanisms underlying this (in situ and laboratory evidence), and the timescale within which the process begins (laboratory evidence). Through application of engineering principals, we detail how increased porosity in structurally critical sections of coral framework will lead to crumbling of load-bearing material, and a potential collapse and loss of complexity of the larger habitat. Importantly, in situ evidence highlights that cold-water corals can survive beneath the aragonite saturation horizon, but in a fundamentally different way to what is currently considered a biogenic cold-water coral reef, with a loss of the majority of reef habitat. The shift from a habitat with high 3-dimensional complexity provided by both live and dead coral framework, to a habitat restricted primarily to live coral colonies with lower 3-dimensional complexity represents the main threat to cold-water coral reefs of the future and the biodiversity they support. Ocean acidification can cause ecosystem-scale habitat loss for the majority of cold-water coral reefs. © Copyright © 2020 Hennige, Wolfram, Wickes, Murray, Roberts, Kamenos, Schofield, Groetsch, Spiesz, Aubin-Tam and Etnoyer.",coral; deep-sea coral; dissolution; habitat loss and degradation; Lophelia pertusa; ocean acidification,

However, only a minority of voters believe that politicians try to keep their promises, and many voters struggle to recall the fulfillment or breaking of salient campaign pledges accurately. I argue that this disparity between the public perception and empirical evidence is influenced by the information voters receive throughout the electoral cycle. I expect that the media extensively inform readers about political promises. In addition, I posit that news outlets focus more on broken than on fulfilled promises and that the focus on broken promises has increased over time. I find strong support for these expectations based on a new text corpus of over 430,000 statements on political commitments published between 1979 and 2017 in 22 newspapers during 33 electoral cycles in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Newspapers inform voters regularly about announced, broken, and fulfilled promises. Yet, across the four countries, newspapers report at least twice as much on broken than on fulfilled promises. Moreover, this negativity bias in reports on political promises has increased substantively. The results have implications for studying campaign promises, negative information in mass media, and the linkages between voters and parties. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",campaign pledges; mass media; negativity bias; political communication; quantitative text analysis,

In this regard, BIM endeavors to enable real-time monitoring conditions of buildings. This paper is focused on the indoor positioning system (IPS) as a key enabling technology for IoT applications, which uses smart and non-smart mobile devices (object tags and beacons) with the aim of positioning and objects tracking that lead to a smart approach in the field of facility management (FM). Hence, we have surveyed the joint use of IPS and BIM in FM based on the concept of enterprise BIM (EBIM). EBIM forms the basis for the future strategic real estate management using virtual models and open standards. As a result, we gained the ability to collect positioning data continuously, save them in a BIM database, and present them on two-dimensional (2D) maps. This is a part of an ongoing study that aims to use data collection effectively for FM as an organizational function in large and complex buildings. Hence, for this purpose, we have considered St. Olavs Hospital, one of the biggest healthcare centers in Norway, as a case study. The effectiveness of data collection by IoT devices installed in buildings and how the combination of BIM and IoT technology can support a holistic view of the status of the buildings, which subsequently can enhance data usage efficiency and FM development, will be demonstrated. © 2020 by the authors.

Policy makers must balance the positive health effects of strong distancing measures, such as lockdowns, against their economic costs, especially the burdens imposed on low income and food insecure households. The distancing measures deployed by South Africa impose large economic costs and have negative implications for the factor distribution of income. Labor with low education levels are much more strongly affected than labor with secondary or tertiary education. As a result, households with low levels of educational attainment and high dependence on labor income would experience an enormous real income shock that would clearly jeopardize the food security of these households. However, in South Africa, total incomes for low income households are significantly insulated by government transfer payments. From public health, income distribution and food security perspectives, the remarkably rapid and severe shocks imposed because of Covid-19 illustrate the value of having in place transfer policies that support vulnerable households in the event of ‘black swan’ type shocks. © 2020 The Authors",Covid-19 impacts; Food security; Income distribution; SAM multiplier Model,

To overcome this hurdle, the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium combines neuroimaging data from many institutions worldwide. However, this introduces heterogeneity due to different scanning devices and sequences. ENIGMA projects commonly address this heterogeneity with random-effects meta-analysis or mixed-effects mega-analysis. Here we tested whether the batch adjustment method, ComBat, can further reduce site-related heterogeneity and thus increase statistical power. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses, mixed-effects mega-analyses and ComBat mega-analyses to compare cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volumes between 2897 individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 3141 healthy controls from 33 sites. Specifically, we compared the imaging data between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls, covarying for age and sex. The use of ComBat substantially increased the statistical significance of the findings as compared to random-effects meta-analyses. The findings were more similar when comparing ComBat with mixed-effects mega-analysis, although ComBat still slightly increased the statistical significance. ComBat also showed increased statistical power when we repeated the analyses with fewer sites. Results were nearly identical when we applied the ComBat harmonization separately for cortical thickness, cortical surface area and subcortical volumes. Therefore, we recommend applying the ComBat function to attenuate potential effects of site in ENIGMA projects and other multi-site structural imaging work. We provide easy-to-use functions in R that work even if imaging data are partially missing in some brain regions, and they can be trained with one data set and then applied to another (a requirement for some analyses such as machine learning). © 2020 The Author(s)",Brain; Cortical thickness; Gray matter; Mega-analysis; Neuroimaging; Schizophrenia; Volume,"adult; age; Article; brain cortex; brain region; brain size; ComBat batch adjustment method; controlled study; cortical surface area; cortical thickness (brain); data analysis; female; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; meta analysis (topic); neuroanatomy; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; randomization; schizophrenia; sex; statistical analysis; statistical significance; subcortex; surface area; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; image processing; middle aged; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; schizophrenia; young adult; Adult; Algorithms; Cerebral Cortex; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Schizophrenia; Young Adult"

Cropping systems that preserve or promote biological pest control agents are more desirable. Data collected from a long-term trial at the Monze Farmer Training Centre (MFTC) from 2009 to 2012 was used to compare effects of different Conservation Agriculture (CA) systems with conventional practices (CP) on arthropod species diversity and populations with specific emphasis on beneficial and detrimental aerial arthropods. Up to 13 arthropod orders comprising of 40 species were identified in the cropping systems and their population density differed in years and cropping systems. Higher diversity was observed in CA systems in all years based on the Shannon-Weiner indices ranging from 0.4 to 2. However, a CP system with no rotations (CP-M) showed comparable results in the year with low rainfall. Community evenness increased in the same year with a value of 0.46. More beneficial and detrimental arthropods were recorded in a CA system with a three-year rotation of maize, cotton and sunnhemp reaching up to 9533 individuals ha−1. The CP-M recorded the highest increase in detrimental arthropods from 2009 to 2012. A canonical correspondence analysis did not show a clear-cut association of both CA and CP systems with either beneficial or detrimental arthropods. However, associations were more driven by seasonal effects. Reduced soil disturbance, crop residue retention and crop diversity in CA systems preferentially attracted beneficial arthropods while preserving existing favourable arthropods. Conventional tillage systems often disturbed arthropod habitats, disrupted their life cycles leading to lower biological activity. Increased biodiversity from CA systems may therefore support biological control. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Arthropods; Biological pest control; Diversification; Integrated pest management; No-tillage; Pest-predator relationship,

The data were collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2018 with integrated luminosities of 0.5nb−1 and 1.4nb−1, respectively. The kinematic selection for heavy-flavor muons requires transverse momentum 4&lt;pT&lt;30GeV and pseudorapidity |η|&lt;2.0. The dominant sources of muons in this pT range are semi-leptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons. These heavy-flavor muons are separated from light-hadron decay muons and punch-through hadrons using the momentum imbalance between the measurements in the tracking detector and in the muon spectrometers. Azimuthal anisotropies, quantified by flow coefficients, are measured via the event-plane method for inclusive heavy-flavor muons as a function of the muon pT and in intervals of Pb+Pb collision centrality. Heavy-flavor muons are separated into contributions from charm and bottom hadron decays using the muon transverse impact parameter with respect to the event primary vertex. Non-zero elliptic (v2) and triangular (v3) flow coefficients are extracted for charm and bottom muons, with the charm muon coefficients larger than those for bottom muons for all Pb+Pb collision centralities. The results indicate substantial modification to the charm and bottom quark angular distributions through interactions in the quark-gluon plasma produced in these Pb+Pb collisions, with smaller modifications for the bottom quarks as expected theoretically due to their larger mass. © 2020 The Author(s)",,

Through a survey, we obtain a household level data from goat producers in designated climate-smart and non-climate-smart villages of the Lawra and Jirapa districts in Upper West region of Ghana. Data are analysed using a multivariate probit model to assess how perceptions and other factors influence coping and adaptation strategy choices. Seven main coping/adaptation strategies are used by goat farmers to deal with weather variability and climate change. Our econometric results show that goat farmers’ perceptions and being located in a climate-smart village, as well as market and extension information influence the choice of coping and adaptation strategies towards climate change. The results suggest that perceptions of weather variability and climate change have significant positive influence on all adaptation strategies, and that these adaptation strategies are complementary to each other as evidenced by their high inter-correlations. The fact that farmers located in climate-smart villages are more likely to adopt strategies that enable them to cope with and adapt to weather variability and climate change signals the need for project implementers to extend the number of villages benefiting from the climate-smart village concept. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",climate change adaptation; Climate-smart village; goat producers; Lawra and Jirapa districts; multivariate probit,adaptive management; climate change; coping strategy; detection method; perception; strategic approach; village; Ghana; Lawra; Upper West Region; Capra hircus

Efficient defragmentation approaches are indispensable to reduce spectrum fragmentation in survivable EONs, where both full 1 + 1 protected and quasi 1 + 1 protected services exist. The full 1 + 1 protected service offers full reliability without causing any traffic disturbance, where the backup path is not allowed to be reallocated, i.e., 1 + 1 path protection is always maintained. Whereas, the quasi 1 + 1 protected service compromises the reliability if any failure occurs on a primary path while its corresponding backup path is being reallocated. When full 1 + 1 protected and quasi 1 + 1 lightpaths are mixed in EONs, the network operators need to consider them to achieve thorough defragmentation carefully. This paper presents and investigates defragmentation based on route partitioning intending to reduce the spectrum fragmentation and blocking probability in 1 + 1 protected EONs, where both full 1 + 1 protected and quasi 1 + 1 protected services exist. A defragmentation scheme that focuses on minimizing the retuning interference on the full 1 + 1 protected lightpaths is introduced; the retuning interference occurs when a full 1 + 1 protected lightpath cannot be retuned to fill in a gap left by an expired lightpath due to the interference of another lightpath that prevents it from being moved further. We define a route partitioning optimization problem to minimize the interference on full 1 + 1 lightpaths in 1 + 1 protected EONs considering both full 1 + 1 protected and quasi 1 + 1 protected lightpaths. We formulate the problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. The decision version of route partitioning problem in 1 + 1 protected EONs is proved as an NP-complete problem. We develop a heuristic algorithm for the case where the ILP is not tractable. We provide an online defragmentation algorithm for dynamic traffic. The effectiveness of the introduced defragmentation scheme with route partitioning is demonstrated through a simulation study. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Defragmentation; Elastic optical networks; Full 1 + 1 protection; Quasi 1 + 1 protection; Route partition,Blocking probability; Computational complexity; Fiber optic networks; Heuristic algorithms; De-fragmentation; Decision version; Elastic optical networks; Integer Linear Programming; Network operator; Optimization problems; Partitioning problem; Simulation studies; Integer programming

In particular, these models do not consider the change in skewness of the distribution as the aperture size increases, and often positively skewed distributions (right tailed) are used to model scenarios where the true statistics are negatively skewed (left tailed).

The elevated CO2 concentrations altered shoot and root length, nodulation (number of nodules), total chlorophyll content and nitrogen balance index, significantly. RNA-Seq from 12 tissues representing vegetative and reproductive growth stages of both cultivars under ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations identified 18,644 differentially expressed genes including 9,687 transcription factors (TF).

Restrictions to the movement of people and goods have impaired access to markets, services and food. Unlike other concurrent crises, rather than threatening the material hardware of food systems, COVID-19 has so far affected the ‘software’ of food systems, highlighting again that connectivity is at the heart of these systems. Drops in demand, the loss of markets and employment and growing concerns about international cooperation are indications of possible deeper disruptions to come. Amidst this uncertainty, strategies to safeguard food and nutrition security of the world’s poor need to prioritize diversification of production and markets. Nutritious, biofortified crops such as potato, sweetpotato, but also wheat, maize and beans among others, can play a more significant role to provide key micronutrients (vitamin A, iron, zinc) at large scale. Strong local market chains, robust smallholder production systems and increasing commercial utilization make these crops powerful vehicles for securing nutrition when markets and mobility look uncertain. We posit that the evolving impacts of COVID-19 provide an opportunity to focus agricultural innovations, including the development and delivery of biofortified crops, on new and more specifically defined ‘jobs to be done’ throughout the food system.

After testing the accuracy of the dynamically downscaled climate datasets for simulating the historical daily maximum temperature (Tmax) and relative humidity (RH) in West Africa for 50 meteorological stations, we used the dataset for calculating the temperature-humidity index (THI), i.e., an index indicating heat stress for dairy cattle on a daily scale. Calculations were made for the historical period (1981–2010) using the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset, and for two future periods (2021–2050 and 2071–2100) using climate predictions of the GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, and MPI-ESM-MR Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under the RCP4.5 emission scenario. Here, we show that during the period from 1981 to 2010 for > 1/5 of the region of West Africa, the frequency of severe/danger heat events per year, i.e., events that result in significant decreases in productive and reproductive performances, increased from 11 to 29–38 days (significant at 95% confidence level). Most obvious changes were observed for the eastern and southeastern parts. Under future climate conditions periods with severe/danger heat stress events will increase further as compared with the historical period by 5–22% depending on the GCM used. Moreover, the average length of periods with severe/danger heat stress is expected to increase from ~ 3 days in the historical period to ~ 4–7 days by 2021–2050 and even to up to 10 days by 2071–2100. Based on the average results of three GCMs, by 2071–2100, around 22% of dairy cattle population currently living in this area is expected to experience around 70 days more of severe/danger heat stress (compare with the historical period), especially in the southern half of West Africa. The result is alarming, as it shows that dairy production systems in West Africa are jeopardized at large scale by climate change and that depending on the GCM used, milk production might decrease by 200–400 kg/year by 2071–2100 in around 1, 7, or 11%.

This research evaluates a simple, hand-held decision support tool (HH-DST) consisting of a disk with three concentric circles, two of which represent factors that drive late blight epidemics and the third providing a spray recommendation. Three disks of different colors have been designed for potato varieties of varying levels of host resistance. The HH-DST was compared with locally used fungicide spray regimes in three trials in Peru, and in six trials in Ecuador, where the tool had been slightly modified. In two additional trials in Peru, the HH-DST was compared with local practices, calendar spraying and two other DSS. The HH-DST and local spray regimes both gave relatively good disease control in all cases, however, the HH-DST was more effective with highly susceptible cultivars both in Ecuador and Peru. The HH-DST also had equal or lower number of sprays per season and had a lower environmental impact, based on the environmental impact quotient (EIQ), than did the local practices. Results were similar in trials comparing different DSS, where all approaches, including the HH-DST, adequately controlled disease, and the HH-DST was among the lowest for both number of sprays per season and environmental impact.

This threat is intensified by the open field burning of crop residues that not only squander an indirect renewable source of energy but also impair the soil and environment quality. The crop residues can be used as organic manure by retaining the residues as mulch in the field. After a long term (5-yrs) study, it was concluded that crop residues biomass contributed maximum (∼79%) in total input energy (1,68,556 MJ ha−1) in conservation agriculture (CA) based systems, however fertilizer application (non-renewable energy source) contributed maximum (∼50%) to the total energy (40,636 MJ ha−1) in conventional tillage (CT) based maize-wheat cropping system.CA based maize systems recorded higher input energy and energy intensiveness by 23 and 57% respectively, and recorded almost 44% lower energy use efficiency and energy productivity compared to CT based maize systems.

This calls for a better understanding of the different forest cover states and cost-efficient techniques to quantify the impact of degradation on forest structure. Canopy texture analyses based on Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) optical imagery provide proxies to assess forest structures but the mechanisms linking them with degradation have rarely been investigated. To address this gap, we used a lightweight Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to map 739 ha of degraded forests and acquire both canopy VHSR images and height model. Thirty-three years of degradation history from Landsat archives allowed us to sample 40 plots in undisturbed, logged, over-logged and burned and regrowth forests in tropical forested landscapes (Paragominas, Pará, Brazil). Fourier (FOTO) and lacunarity textures were used to assess forest canopy structure and to build a typology linking degradation history and current states. Texture metrics capture canopy grain, heterogeneity and openness gradients and correlate with forest structure variability (R2 = 0.58). Similar structures share common degradation history and can be discriminated on the basis of canopy texture alone (accuracy = 55%). Over-logging causes a lowering in forest height, which brings homogeneous textures and of finer grain.

However, the performance of these systems can become significantly degraded due to turbulence-induced signal fluctuations. These fluctuations can be minimized by enlarging the receiving aperture, thereby averaging the fluctuations. There is extensive interest in developing probability density functions (PDFs) describing these intensity fluctuations so as to accurately predict system performance. This work examines several PDF models that have been suggested to represent fluctuations by comparing them to simulations of realistic propagation scenarios of a collimated Gaussian beam with centroid wander. Unlike with an infinite plane or spherical wave, the empirical PDF shape in these simulations changed significantly with increased aperture, going from a positively skewed to a negatively skewed distribution; therefore, the PDF model that describes it also must change. This change in skew can have serious consequences on the metrics of an optical communication system, e.g., number of fades and bit-error rate. In this work, we examine the evolution of the empirical PDF with aperture size and the fit of potential PDF models under various strengths of turbulence.We show that the change in skew with increasing aperture size occurred for all strengths of turbulence and that the currently usedPDFmodels do not adequately characterize this for realistically sized apertures where beam wander is present. © 2020 Optical Society of.",,Bit error rate; Gaussian beams; Optical communication; Turbulence; Aperture sizes; Intensity fluctuations; Optical wavelength; Positively skewed; Probability density functions (PDFs); Receiving aperture; Skewed distribution; Spherical waves; Probability density function; article; human; probability; simulation

In this emerging field, dispute settlement is less institutionalised and conflicts take place at a foundational level. Internet governance features two competing spheres of authority characterised by fundamentally diverging social purposes: A more consolidated liberal sphere emphasises a limited role of the state, private and multistakeholder governance and freedom of speech. A sovereigntist challenger sphere emphasises state control, intergovernmentalism and push against the preponderance of Western institutions and private actors. We trace the activation and evolution of conflict between these spheres with regard to norms and institutions in four instances: the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT-12), the fifth session of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) and the Budapest Convention of the Council of Europe. We observe intense norm collisions, and strategic attempts at competitive regime creation and regime shifting towards intergovernmental structures by the sovereigntist sphere. Despite these aggressive attempts at creating new institutions and norms, the existing internet governance order is still in place. Hence, authority conflicts in global internet governance do not necessarily lead to fragmentation. ©",contested multilateralism; internet governance; norm collisions; sovereignty,

Therefore, this study quantified soil GHG emissions using static chambers for two maize cropping seasons (one full year) of four different soil amendments in the central highlands of Kenya. The four treatments were (i) animal manure, (ii) inorganic fertilizer, (iii) combined animal manure and inorganic fertilizer, and (iv) a no-N control (no amendment) laid out in a randomized complete block design. Cumulative annual soil fluxes (February 2017 to February 2018) ranged from −1.03 ± 0.19 kg CH4-C ha−1 yr−1 from the manure inorganic fertilizer treatment to −0.09 ± 0.03 kg CH4-C ha−1 yr−1 from the manure treatment, 1,391 ± 74 kg CO2-C ha−1 yr−1 from the control treatment to 3,574 ± 113 kg CO2-C ha−1 yr−1 from the manure treatment, and 0.13 ± 0.08 to 1.22 ± 0.12 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1 in the control and manure treatments, respectively. Animal manure amendment produced the highest cumulative CO2 emissions (P &lt; 0.001), N2O emissions (P &lt; 0.001), and maize yields (P = 0.002) but the lowest N2O yield-scaled emission (YSE) (0.5 g N2O–N kg−1 grain yield). Manure combined with inorganic fertilizer had the highest cumulative CH4 uptake (P &lt; 0.001) and N2O YSE (2.2 g N2O–N kg−1 grain yield).

In response, multiple regional climate mitigation initiatives have emerged. In Peru, indigenous networks have created their own Indigenous Amazonian REDD (RIA), an initiative aiming to strengthen property rights for native peoples. At roughly the same time, the Peruvian government launched the National Forest Conservation Program (PNCB), a conditional payment scheme aiming to encourage sustainable forest management. However, these initiatives must still overcome fragmented institutional governance of forests at the regional scale and continued challenges related to indigenous tenure security. This article examines how indigenous federations and the Peruvian government are attempting to implement these initiatives in the Amazonian region of Madre de Dios to examine how challenges play out in practice. These cases illustrate the institutional gaps between national policies, regional capacities, and local needs and expectations. However, it also demonstrates how an innovative institutional partnership at the subnational scale may be overcoming some of these challenges. © 2020 The Authors.

Major challenges such as overpopulation, competition for resources poses a threat to the food security of the planet. In order to tackle the ever-increasing complex problems in agricultural production systems, advancements in smart farming and precision agriculture offers important tools to address agricultural sustainability challenges. Data analytics hold the key to ensure future food security, food safety, and ecological sustainability. Disruptive information and communication technologies such as machine learning, big data analytics, cloud computing, and blockchain can address several problems such as productivity and yield improvement, water conservation, ensuring soil and plant health, and enhance environmental stewardship. The current study presents a systematic review of machine learning (ML) applications in agricultural supply chains (ASCs). Ninety three research papers were reviewed based on the applications of different ML algorithms in different phases of the ASCs. The study highlights how ASCs can benefit from ML techniques and lead to ASC sustainability. Based on the study findings an ML applications framework for sustainable ASC is proposed. The framework identifies the role of ML algorithms in providing real-time analytic insights for pro-active data-driven decision-making in the ASCs and provides the researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with guidelines on the successful management of ASCs for improved agricultural productivity and sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Agricultural supply chain; Machine learning; Smart farming; Sustainability; Systematic literature review,Agriculture; Data Analytics; Decision making; Environmental technology; Food supply; Learning systems; Machine learning; Productivity; Soil conservation; Supply chains; Water conservation; Agricultural production system; Agricultural supply chains; Agricultural sustainability; Ecological sustainability; Environmental stewardship; Information and Communication Technologies; Smart farming; Systematic literature review; Sustainable development

This test uses the Optimal Observable method and is carried out using 36.1fb−1 of s=13TeV proton–proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Contributions from CP-violating interactions between the Higgs boson and electroweak gauge bosons are described by an effective field theory, in which the parameter d˜ governs the strength of CP violation. No sign of CP violation is observed in the distributions of the Optimal Observable, and d˜ is constrained to the interval [−0.090, 0.035] at the 68% confidence level (CL), compared to an expected interval of d˜∈[−0.035,0.033] based upon the Standard Model prediction.

This prevents them to recognize objects in different conditions such as poor illumination or severe weather (e.g., under fog or smoke). The technological advancement in thermographic imaging enables the visualization of objects beyond visible range which enables it's use in many applications such as military, medical, agriculture, etc. However, due to the hardware constraints, the thermal cameras are limited with poor spatial resolution when compared to similar visible range RGB cameras. In this paper, we propose a Super-Resolution (SR) of thermal images using a deep neural network architecture which we refer to as TherISuRNet. We use progressive upscaling strategy with asymmetrical residual learning in the network which is computationally efficient for different upscaling factors such as ×2, ×3 and ×4. The proposed architecture consists of different modules for low and high-frequency feature extraction along with upsampling blocks. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture in TherISuRNet is verified by evaluating it with different datasets.

The deep learning models trained with such synthetic dataset generalize poorly on the real-world or natural data where the degradation characteristics cannot be fully modelled. As an implication, the super-resolved images obtained for real LR images do not produce optimal Super-Resolution (SR) images. We propose a new SR approach to mitigate such an issue using unsupervised learning in Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework - USISResNet. In an attempt to provide high quality SR image for perceptual inspection, we also introduce a new loss function based on the Mean Opinion Score (MOS).

Neglected and underutilized species (NUS) are one important ally in pursuing resilience in both production and food systems because of their promising traits in terms of nutrition, adaptation to local agroecosystems, and economic potential for local populations. Focusing on fonio, a gluten-free traditional cereal, and Bambara groundnut, a protein-rich leguminous crop, we investigate issues in their production, commercialization, and consumption in southern Mali. The aim was to assess needs and opportunities for improving their value chains and increasing their use and societal benefits. Using a Rapid Market Appraisal method, we surveyed traders, producers, processors, and consumers of target crops in 2017 and 2018. Our findings indicate that while both crops are consumed and praised by local populations, critical bottlenecks inhibit their wider socioeconomic potential. Lack of access to inputs and equipment and presence of sand in the commercialized product are important issues for fonio, whereas the Bambara groundnut value chain suffers from poor processing facilities and lack of market promotion.

However, studies investigating manure decomposition are scarce; especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods: In this study, we measured decomposition of three types of animal manure (cattle, sheep, goat) over &gt;1 year using litter bags at four climatically different sites across Kenya. Results Manure dry matter, total C, total N and ammonium concentrations decreased exponentially, with the most rapid decrease occurring during the first few weeks following application, followed by slower changes during the following 2–3 months. Rates of N mineralization were lower than those for C mineralization, resulting in decreasing C/N ratios over time. Generally, cattle manure decomposed faster than sheep or goat manure despite having a higher initial C/N ratio and lower N concentration, with decomposition rates for dry matter ranging from 0.200 to 0.989 k year−1. Cellulose decomposed first, while lignin concentrations increased among all manure types and at all sites. Conclusions: We found that total manure decomposition rates were positively correlated with cumulative precipitation and aridity index, but negatively correlated with mean temperature.

It has tapped populist sentiment that reflects little confidence in the key decision-making centers in American society. Higher education has not escaped this attack. Indeed, criticism of the academy has gone well beyond the debated policies of affirmative action and political correctness to the very status of expert knowledge itself, questioning what is legitimate knowledge. Claims of “false data” and “alternative facts” parade in the public arena without the benefit of reasoned scholarship that might separate fact from fiction. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the attack on science, particularly scientific research focusing on environmental issues and climate change. Nonetheless, a small number of academicians—supposed arbiters of truth—advocate for Trump. How does one explain this apparent anomaly? Why would scholars support a president and populist movement that attack the very foundations of their professional life: knowledge and expertise? I have identified 103 such professors who offer their public support of Trump through blogs, essays, op-ed pieces, public lectures, tweets, YouTube videos, and even a couple of trade books. These are public intellectuals who intervene beyond the classroom and laboratory to promote a political agenda that is supportive of Trump. They are public advocates for Trump: academic Trumpists. Who are these individuals? Where do they teach? What do they teach? What kinds of connections external to the academy do they cultivate? How do they justify their support of Trump? This article offers some answers to these questions.

Whether the challenges come from the political left or right, democracy needs consistent and quality participation by all of its citizens. As a significant part of the citizenry fails to fight for democracy, factual evidence, and the rights of all of the people, I argue that political scientists must re-examine what we are doing inside and outside of the classroom to foster students’ and communities’ growth in political knowledge, democratic skills, and democratic values and habits.

In some sites, different (N) fertilizer levels were superimposed to test their effects on maize grain yield and leaf chlorophyll content under different maize residue biomass levels. The different residue levels had no significant effect on maize yield in most growing seasons. Maize residue cover increased grain yield in eight out of 39 site-years across the sites used. However, in some sites, maize yield decreased with increases in residue level in cropping seasons that had average to above average rainfall. At a few sites maize yield increased with increase in residue level. Seasonal rainfall pattern influenced the effect of different residue levels on grain yield at most sites. Nitrogen fertilizer increased maize yield regardless of the residue level applied.

Cellular networks have become massive generators of data, and in the forthcoming years, this data is expected to increase drastically. Big data-based intelligence and analytics can improve network operational efficiency and user service quality. This work proposes to exploit massive handover and paging data from cellular networks to minimize singling due to user mobility. In this paper, we offer a new holistic tracking area lists (TAL) management methodology, considering group user mobility behavior and paging characteristics. Firstly, a series of graphs showing the evolution of user mobility and traffic is built from handover and paging statistics in the network management system (NMS). Then, the TAL allocation problem is formulated as a classical graph partitioning problem, which is then solved by detecting overlapping communities algorithm based on game theory. Results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the location management singling overhead and improve the TAL configuration efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Cellular networks; Graph partitioning; Location management; Overlapping community; Tracking area list,Behavioral research; Cost reduction; Efficiency; Game theory; Graph algorithms; Location; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless networks; Cellular network; Graph Partitioning; Location management; Overlapping communities; Tracking area lists; Graph theory

Concentrations of plasma p-tau181 were compared with established CSF and PET biomarkers and longitudinal measurements using Spearman correlation, area under the curve (AUC), and linear regression analyses. Findings: We studied 37 individuals in the discovery cohort, 226 in the first validation cohort (TRIAD), 763 in the second validation cohort (BioFINDER-2), and 105 in the primary care cohort (n=1131 individuals). In all cohorts, plasma p-tau181 showed gradual increases along the Alzheimer's disease continuum, from the lowest concentrations in amyloid β-negative young adults and cognitively unimpaired older adults, through higher concentrations in the amyloid β-positive cognitively unimpaired older adults and MCI groups, to the highest concentrations in the amyloid β-positive MCI and Alzheimer's disease groups (p<0·001, Alzheimer's disease vs all other groups). Plasma p-tau181 distinguished Alzheimer's disease dementia from amyloid β-negative young adults (AUC=99·40%) and cognitively unimpaired older adults (AUC=90·21–98·24% across cohorts), as well as other neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal dementia (AUC=82·76–100% across cohorts), vascular dementia (AUC=92·13%), progressive supranuclear palsy or corticobasal syndrome (AUC=88·47%), and Parkinson's disease or multiple systems atrophy (AUC=81·90%). Plasma p-tau181 was associated with PET-measured cerebral tau (AUC=83·08–93·11% across cohorts) and amyloid β (AUC=76·14–88·09% across cohorts) pathologies, and 1-year cognitive decline (p=0·0015) and hippocampal atrophy (p=0·015). In the primary care cohort, plasma p-tau181 discriminated Alzheimer's disease from young adults (AUC=100%) and cognitively unimpaired older adults (AUC=84·44%), but not from MCI (AUC=55·00%). Interpretation: Blood p-tau181 can predict tau and amyloid β pathologies, differentiate Alzheimer's disease from other neurodegenerative disorders, and identify Alzheimer's disease across the clinical continuum. Blood p-tau181 could be used as a simple, accessible, and scalable test for screening and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

The development of climate-resilient spring wheat cultivars able to maintain grain yield and quality is essential to food security and economic returns. We tested 54 CIMMYT spring bread wheat genotypes, developed and/or released over a span of 50 years, in the field for two years under optimum sowing dates, as well as using two delayed sowing dates to expose crops to medium and severe heat-stress conditions. The grain yield and yield components were severely affected as the heat-stress increased. Two contrasting groups of 10 lines each were identified to determine the effect of heat-stress on bread-making quality. The first set included entries that produced high yields in optimal conditions and maintained higher yields under heat-stress (superior-yielding lines), while the second set included genotypes that did not perform well in the environment with high temperature (inferior-yielding lines). We identified genotypes exhibiting bread-making quality stability, as well as the quality traits that had higher correlation with the loaf volume in the environment without stress and under heat-stress. Of all the quality traits tested, dough extensibility (AlvL) and grain protein content had a significant influence in heat-stress adaptation. Most of the lines from the superior-yielding group were also able to maintain and even improve quality characteristics under heat-stress and therefore, could be used as parents in breeding to develop high-yielding and stable quality wheat varieties. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Bread wheat; Grain quality; Grain yield; Heat stress,

Objective: To examine the demographic (age, sex, and educational level), genetic (APOE-ϵ4 status), and neuroimaging (white matter hyperintensities and cortical thickness) factors associated with interindividual differences in brain and cognitive resilience to tau positron emission tomography (PET) load and to changes in global cognition over time. Design, Setting, an Participants: In this cross-sectional, longitudinal study, tau PET was performed from June 1, 2014, to November 30, 2017, and global cognition monitored for a mean [SD] interval of 2.0 [1.8] years at 3 dementia centers in South Korea, Sweden, and the United States. The study included amyloid-β-positive participants with mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia. Data analysis was performed from October 26, 2018, to December 11, 2019. Exposures: Standard dementia screening, cognitive testing, brain magnetic resonance imaging, amyloid-β PET and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and flortaucipir (tau) labeled with fluor-18 (18F) PET. Main Outcomes and Measures: Separate linear regression models were performed between whole cortex [18F]flortaucipir uptake and cortical thickness, and standardized residuals were used to obtain a measure of brain resilience. The same procedure was performed for whole cortex [18F]flortaucipir uptake vs Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as a measure of cognitive resilience. Bivariate and multivariable linear regression models were conducted with age, sex, educational level, APOE-ϵ4 status, white matter hyperintensity volumes, and cortical thickness as independent variables and brain and cognitive resilience measures as dependent variables. Linear mixed models were performed to examine whether changes in MMSE scores over time differed as a function of a combined brain and cognitive resilience variable. Results: A total of 260 participants (145 [55.8%] female; mean [SD] age, 69.2 [9.5] years; mean [SD] MMSE score, 21.9 [5.5]) were included in the study. In multivariable models, women (standardized β = -0.15, P =.02) and young patients (standardized β = -0.20, P =.006) had greater brain resilience to pathological tau. Higher educational level (standardized β = 0.23, P &lt;.001) and global cortical thickness (standardized β = 0.23, P &lt;.001) were associated with greater cognitive resilience to pathological tau. Linear mixed models indicated a significant interaction of brain resilience × cognitive resilience × time on MMSE (β [SE] = -0.235 [0.111], P =.03), with steepest slopes for individuals with both low brain and cognitive resilience. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study suggest that women and young patients with AD have relative preservation of brain structure when exposed to neocortical pathological tau. Interindividual differences in resilience to pathological tau may be important to disease progression because participants with both low brain and cognitive resilience had the most rapid cognitive decline over time. © 2020 American Medical Association.

Estimates of crop losses due to FAW are essential in order to compare the impact of these losses with the cost of controlling FAW and advise appropriate technology dissemination and policy. In this study, therefore, crop losses due to FAW in 2017 and 2018 were estimated in all the maize production areas of Kenya. Data were collected during June and July 2018 through 121 group discussions with 1439 farmers, separately with men (697) and women (742), in communities that were randomly selected to represent the major maize growing areas. The results showed that most participants (82%) could correctly identify the FAW from pictures. By 2016, FAW was observed by more than half of the communities (53%), with most of the other half first observing FAW in 2017. The proportion of farmers affected by FAW substantially increased, from the long rains of 2017 (63%) to the long rains of 2018 (83%), and in all zones except for the high tropics and moist mid-altitudes. However, the percentage of loss experienced by affected farmers decreased slightly, from 54% in 2017 to 42% in 2018. In 2017, the low- and medium-potential maize-production areas were the most affected, with losses of >50%, with high-potential areas facing losses of about 30%, resulting in a total loss of 37% for the whole country. In the main 2018 season, losses in the low- and medium-potential areas were less – about 20%, but the high-potential areas were now more affected, leading to a total estimate of 33%. We conclude that FAW has suddenly become a major pest in Kenya, causing losses of about a third of the annual maize production, estimated at about 1 million tonnes. © 2019 The Author(s)",Community survey; Fall armyworm; Focus group discussions; Loss; Maize,Spodoptera frugiperda; Zea mays

However, existing works suffer from two major limitations: (i) it is not easy to set the conditions on query attributes; (ii) the queries support only a single type of attributes. To make up for these deficiencies, in this paper, we study a novel attributed community search called vertex-centric attributed community (VAC) search. Given an attributed graph and a query vertex set, the VAC search returns the community which is densely connected (ensured by the k-truss model) and has the best attribute score. We show that the problem is NP-hard. To answer the VAC search, we develop both exact and approximate algorithms. Specifically, we develop two exact algorithms. One searches the community in a depth-first manner and the other is in a best-first manner. We also propose a set of heuristic strategies to prune the unqualified search space by exploiting the structure and attribute properties. In addition, to further improve the search efficiency, we propose a 2-approximation algorithm. Comprehensive experimental studies on various realworld attributed graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the efficiency of the developed algorithms. © 2020 IEEE.",,Efficiency; Graph structures; Approximate algorithms; Attributed graphs; Depth first; Exact algorithms; Heuristic strategy; Search efficiency; Search spaces; Truss model; Graph algorithms

However, despite the importance of these components, limited data are available on their content and composition, especially in durum wheat. In this study, 82 durum wheat landraces from Iran and Mexico were analyzed for arabinoxylan, iron, zinc, phytate and phenolic acids content. In general, wide variation was identified among landraces for these traits. Specifically, values ranging from 1.4 to 2.7% and 0.3–1.0% were detected for total and water-extractable arabinoxylans, respectively, in flour. In the case of micronutrients varied from 32.7 to 46.1 mg/kg (iron) and from 46.7 to 83.9 mg/kg (zinc) in grain. Phytate, a major component limiting micronutrient bioavailability, varied from 0.7 to 1.1% in whole-meal flour and the resulting phytate:iron and phytate:zinc molar ratios were 13.7–26.6 and 11.6–21.9, respectively, with more than 70% of the landraces exhibiting a relatively high Zn bioavailability. Seven phenolic acids were identified, with a variation in total phenolic acid concentration ranging from 279 μg/g to 845 μg/g in whole-meal flour. Overall, these results indicate that the landraces analyzed here could serve as useful genetic resources for the improvement of wheat nutritional quality in breeding programs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Arabinoxylans; Durum wheat; Micronutrients; Phenolic compounds; Phytic acid,Biochemistry; Iron; Molar ratio; Nutrients; Nutrition; Organic acids; Trace elements; Zinc; Arabinoxylans; Durum wheats; Micronutrients; Phenolic compounds; Phytic acids; Grain (agricultural product)

In addition to providing an affordable energy source for residents in the continent's growing urban centers, the charcoal value chain offers a critical income source for millions of people. Despite recent studies suggesting that women are taking on an increasing role in charcoal value chains, data and analysis on the role of women and the influence of gendered power relations in the often male-coded charcoal value chain have remained limited. This literature review interrogates the gender dynamics of participation and benefits across charcoal value chains in Sub-Saharan Africa. We find significant support for women's participation throughout value chains, thereby contrasting conventional views of charcoal as a male activity. However, while dynamics change between different contexts, women's participation tends to be significantly higher in retail, while women tend to constitute a minority in other parts of the value chain – often joining the sector in the absence of alternative livelihood opportunities. The review also finds that gender differences exist across various nodes in terms of the scope, nature and outcomes of participation. While significant regional differences exist, our study finds that participation and outcomes tend to generally be influenced by gender differences and inequalities in: 1) access to and control over productive resources and income; 2) social and political capital, and; 3) gender roles and responsibilities. Importantly, other axes of social differentiation, such as generation, marital status, wealth and social class, often intersect with gender relations in influencing outcomes. In addition to structuring the extent, nature and outcomes of women and men's participation, we argue that gender roles and relations may significantly influence the efficiency and sustainability of the charcoal value chain. Based on our findings, we call for placing gender at the core – rather than periphery – of charcoal value chain studies, and propose a conceptual framework for incorporating gender analysis in future value chain studies in the charcoal sector. © 2019 The Authors",Africa; Charcoal; Gender; Value chain; Women; Woodfuel,Access control; Behavioral research; Wood fuels; Africa; Alternative livelihoods; Conceptual frameworks; Gender; Gender differences; Regional differences; Value chains; Women; Charcoal

As an example we consider the ground state of the toric code model in a magnetic field exhibiting Z2 topological order. The optimization is done by an efficient energy minimization approach based on a summation of tensor environments to compute the gradient. We show that the optimized tensors, when brought into the right gauge, are approximately Z2 symmetric, and they can be fully symmetrized a posteriori to generate a stable topologically ordered state, yielding the correct topological entanglement entropy and modular S and U matrices.

Patients also received a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. All patients and 2 groups of age-matched healthy controls underwent an MRI scan with 3D T1-weighted sequences. Connected speech measures and the other cognitive features were compared between patient groups. MRI variables, in terms of gray matter volume, were compared between each patient group and the corresponding controls.ResultsCompared to nfvPPA-E, nfvPPA-I had fewer years of education and shorter reported disease duration. The 2 groups showed similar regional atrophy compatible with clinical diagnosis. Patients did not differ in nonlanguage domains, comprising executive scores. Connected speech sample analysis showed that nfvPPA-E had significantly more distortions than nfvPPA-I, while nfvPPA-I showed reduced scores in some measures of syntactic complexity. On language measures, Italian speakers performed more poorly on syntactic comprehension.ConclusionsnfvPPA-E showed greater motor speech impairment than nfvPPA-I despite higher level of education and comparable disease severity and atrophy changes. The data also suggest greater grammatical impairment in nfvPPA-I.

Data from the 2015 LHC run corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.49 nb-1 are used for the analysis. The Z boson yield, normalised by the total number of minimum-bias events and the mean nuclear thickness function, is measured as a function of dilepton rapidity and event centrality. The measurements in Pb+Pb collisions are compared with similar measurements made in proton-proton collisions at the same centre-of-mass energy. The nuclear modification factor is found to be consistent with unity for all centrality intervals. The results are compared with theoretical predictions obtained at next-to-leading order using nucleon and nuclear parton distribution functions. The normalised Z boson yields in Pb+Pb collisions lie 1-3σ above the predictions.

Climate-driven vegetation models typically predict that this tropical forest ‘carbon sink’ will continue for decades4,5. Here we assess trends in the carbon sink using 244 structurally intact African tropical forests spanning 11 countries, compare them with 321 published plots from Amazonia and investigate the underlying drivers of the trends. The carbon sink in live aboveground biomass in intact African tropical forests has been stable for the three decades to 2015, at 0.66 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year (95 per cent confidence interval 0.53–0.79), in contrast to the long-term decline in Amazonian forests6. Therefore the carbon sink responses of Earth’s two largest expanses of tropical forest have diverged. The difference is largely driven by carbon losses from tree mortality, with no detectable multi-decadal trend in Africa and a long-term increase in Amazonia. Both continents show increasing tree growth, consistent with the expected net effect of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and air temperature7–9. Despite the past stability of the African carbon sink, our most intensively monitored plots suggest a post-2010 increase in carbon losses, delayed compared to Amazonia, indicating asynchronous carbon sink saturation on the two continents. A statistical model including carbon dioxide, temperature, drought and forest dynamics accounts for the observed trends and indicates a long-term future decline in the African sink, whereas the Amazonian sink continues to weaken rapidly. Overall, the uptake of carbon into Earth’s intact tropical forests peaked in the 1990s. Given that the global terrestrial carbon sink is increasing in size, independent observations indicating greater recent carbon uptake into the Northern Hemisphere landmass10 reinforce our conclusion that the intact tropical forest carbon sink has already peaked. This saturation and ongoing decline of the tropical forest carbon sink has consequences for policies intended to stabilize Earth’s climate. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon dioxide; aboveground biomass; air-soil interaction; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; drought; forest dynamics; Northern Hemisphere; tropical forest; Africa; Amazonas (Brazil); Article; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; comparative study; drought; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; environmental temperature; forest dynamics; land biome; priority journal; trend study; tropical rain forest; Africa; atmosphere; biomass; Brazil; carbon sequestration; chemistry; forest; history; metabolism; temperature; theoretical model; tree; tropic climate; Africa; Amazonia; Africa; Atmosphere; Biomass; Brazil; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Droughts; Forests; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Models, Theoretical; Temperature; Trees; Tropical Climate"

It is often assumed that CCTs enjoy political support in the population precisely because they impose conditions on beneficiaries. This article employs survey experiments in Brazil and Turkey to determine whether, and in what contexts, making government transfers conditional on behaviour of beneficiaries increases political support for the programmes. Results show that conditional transfers are only marginally more popular than similar unconditional transfers in nationally representative samples, but that this difference is substantially larger among the better-off and among those primed to think of themselves as different from beneficiaries. These findings imply that conditionalities per se are not as strong a determinant of support for transfers as the literature suggests, but that they can still be helpful in building support for transfers among subsets of the population that are least likely to support them. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,developing world; poverty alleviation; state role; Brazil; Turkey

For this, an efficient clustered multitask diffusion affine projection algorithm (APA) is proposed that enjoys both intra-cluster and inter-cluster cooperation via diffusion. It is, however, shown that while collaboration in principle is a useful step to enhance the performance of a network, uncontrolled mode of inter-cluster collaboration can at times be detrimental to its convergence performance, especially near steady-state. To overcome this, a controlled form of inter-cluster collaboration is proposed by means of a control variable which helps in maintaining the collaboration in right direction. The proposed controlled multitask strategy attains improved performance in terms of both transient and steady-state mean square deviation (MSD) vis-a-vis existing algorithms, as also confirmed by simulation studies. We carry out a detailed performance analysis of the proposed algorithm, obtain stability bounds for its convergence in both mean and mean-square senses, and derive expressions for the network level MSD. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme performs consistently well even in the absence of cluster information. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",adaptive diffusion networks; affine projection algorithm; block maximum norm; distributed adaptive estimation; Multitask network,Diffusion; Sensor networks; Adaptive diffusions; Affine projection algorithms; Block maxima; Convergence performance; Distributed adaptive estimations; Mean-square deviation; Multiple parameters; Performance analysis; Clustering algorithms

RESULTS We found associations between PALB2 PVs and risk of female breast cancer (RR, 7.18; 95% CI, 5.82 to 8.85; P = 6.5 × 10-76), ovarian cancer (RR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.40 to 6.04; P = 4.1 × 10-3), pancreatic cancer (RR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.24 to 4.50; P = 8.7 × 10-3), and male breast cancer (RR, 7.34; 95% CI, 1.28 to 42.18; P = 2.6 3 1022). There was no evidence for increased risks of prostate or colorectal cancer. The breast cancer RRs declined with age (P for trend = 2.0 × 10-3). After adjusting for family ascertainment, breast cancer risk estimates on the basis of multiple case families were similar to the estimates from families ascertained through population-based studies (P for difference = .41). On the basis of the combined data, the estimated risks to age 80 years were 53% (95% CI, 44% to 63%) for female breast cancer, 5% (95% CI, 2% to 10%) for ovarian cancer, 2%-3% (95% CI females, 1% to 4%; 95% CI males, 2% to 5%) for pancreatic cancer, and 1% (95% CI, 0.2% to 5%) for male breast cancer. CONCLUSION These results confirm PALB2 as a major breast cancer susceptibility gene and establish substantial associations between germline PALB2 PVs and ovarian, pancreatic, and male breast cancers. These findings will facilitate incorporation of PALB2 into risk prediction models and optimize the clinical cancer risk management of PALB2 PV carriers. © 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,"partner and localizer of BRCA2; PALB2 protein, human; partner and localizer of BRCA2; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer family; cancer risk; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; family history; female; germline mutation; human; knowledge; major clinical study; male; male breast cancer; ovary cancer; pancreas cancer; priority journal; prostate cancer; retrospective study; risk factor; segregation analysis; age; breast tumor; genetic predisposition; genetics; international cooperation; middle aged; neoplasm; ovary tumor; pancreas tumor; risk; very elderly; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Breast Neoplasms, Male; Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group N Protein; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Germ-Line Mutation; Humans; Internationality; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Ovarian Neoplasms; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Risk"

In this paper, the focus is on pore formation in recycled powder particles of stainless steel 316L during the selective laser melting process. We have introduced the concept of optimizing the powder bed's printing area in order to see the extent of the affected powders during the 3D-printing process. X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) is used to characterize the pores inside the particles. The results from image processing of the tomography (rendered in 3D format) indicate a broader pore size distribution and a higher pore density in recycled powders compared to their virgin counterparts. To elucidate on this, the Electron Dispersion spectroscopy (EDX) analysis and Synchrotron-based Hard X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (HAXPES) were performed to reveal the chemical composition distribution across the pore area and bulk of the recycled powder particles. Higher concentrations of Fe, Cr, and Ni were recorded on the interior wall of the pore in recycled particles and higher Mn, S and Si concentrations were recorded in the outer layer around the pore area and on the surface of the recycled particle. The pore formation in recycled powder is attributed to out-diffusion of Mn, S and Si to the outer surface as a result of the incident laser heat during the AM process due to higher electron affinity of such metallic elements to oxygenation. HAXPES analysis shows a higher MnO concentration around the pore area which impedes the in-diffusion of other elements into the bulk and thereby helps to creates a void. The inside wall of the pore area (dendrites), has a higher concentration of Fe and Cr oxide. We believe the higher pore density in recycled powders is due, at least in part to composition redistribution, promoted by laser heat during the AM process. Nanoindentation analyses on both virgin and recycled powder particles shows a lower hardness and higher effective modulus in the recycled powder particles attributed to the higher porosity in recycled powders. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Pore formation; Recycling; Tomography,3D printers; Additives; Chemical analysis; Chromium compounds; Computerized tomography; Electron affinity; Energy utilization; Iron oxides; Manganese oxide; Particle size analysis; Pore size; Powders; Selective laser melting; Silicon; Tomography; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; X rays; 3-D printing; 3D printing process; Chemical composition distributions; Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Nanoindentation analysis; Pore formation; Stainless steel 316L; X-ray computed tomography; Recycling

We consider social performance compliance to be pertinent to farm-level equity, and the relative compliance of small versus large farms to be pertinent to landscape-level equity. Certification’s management requirements are often deemed disproportionately burdensome for small, resource-poor producers, and hence a barrier to landscape-level equity. There is a lack of research examining how management criteria impact the ability of different sized farms to meet certification’s social performance requirements. We analysed 435 certification audits, covering all Brazilian coffee farms that sought Rainforest Alliance certification from 2006 to 2014 inclusive: 80 individual farms and 23 groups of farms. In principle, undergoing group certification permits smallholders to benefit from economies of scale. Our analysis revealed a statistically significant, positive correlation between compliance with procedural (managing sustainability plans) and social performance criteria. This correlation was stronger for groups than individual farms. Group farms’ compliance was statistically equivalent to that of individual farms, suggesting that group certification is achieving its intended purpose of socio-economic levelling of certified farmers. Over time, certified farms’ average compliances improved. Our findings suggest that management requirements play an important role in improving smallholders’ overall social sustainability performance and that group certification may help resource-poor smallholders achieve those requirements. Further work is required to understand causal mechanisms underlying the relationships we present. © 2018, The Author(s).",Brazil; Certification; Coffee; Compliance; Equity; Rainforest Alliance; Social,certification; coffee; compliance; equity; smallholder; social policy; socioeconomic conditions; standard (regulation); sustainability; Brazil

Web services tend to compress their traffic for less data transmission, which is a great challenge for regular expression matching to achieve wire-speed processing. In this paper, we propose Twins, an efficient regular expression matching method over compressed traffic, which leverages the returned states encoding in the compression to skip repeated scanning. We also present an evaluation model to elaborate the factors that influence the performance of compressed traffic matching methods. Our evaluations demonstrate that Twins could skip ~ 90% compression data and can achieve 1.2 Gbps throughput with a single CPU core. It gains 2.2–3.0 times performance boost than the state-of-the-art works. With a parallel implementation using multiple CPU cores, the throughput could be up to 10 Gbps. © 2019",Compressed traffic matching; Deep packet inspection; Pattern matching; Regular expression matching,Web services; Compressed traffic matching; Critical component; Deep packet inspection; Evaluation modeling; Matching methods; Parallel implementations; Regular-expression matching; Wire-speed processing; Pattern matching

Drawing lessons from these project experiences may thus help improve the design of jurisdictional programs, which is the focus of REDD+ implementation in the Paris Agreement. Here we first scrutinize how REDD+ was historically conceptualized, the most prominent model being that of a multitier payments for environmental services (PES) scheme of “passing on” carbon mitigation responsibilities and credits across scales, from international buyers to forestland owners. Then we analyze two REDD+ project databases, ID-RECCO and GCS-REDD, using principal component and regression analysis. Among 226 conservation-oriented REDD+ projects, only 88 had planned conditional incentives to landowners—the key feature of PES. Intentions to apply PES rose after 2007, and correlate strongly with efforts to seek certification, including as a benefit-sharing strategy, and with carbon sales. Zooming closer into a portfolio of 23 local REDD+ projects that were actually implemented on the ground, we found project implementers reported conditional incentives as potentially being both the most promising and effective intervention. Likewise, treated households identified conditional incentives as comparatively effective in changing their land-use plans, while also providing above-average welfare returns. Still, these conditional incentives remained underutilized in implementation, with only one-third of the treatment intensity compared to non-conditional incentives. Project implementers cited insecure land tenure and uncertain REDD+ financial flows as key impediments to using conditional incentives. The original vision of a multitier PES model for REDD+ thus ran into both supply and demand side problems, jointly explaining the discrepancy between REDD+ theory and practice. Since jurisdictional approaches to REDD+ so far also receive only hesitant and slow climate financing flows, coming mostly in non-conditional form, and operate under forest-frontier governance with similar tenure restrictions, jurisdictions would seem well-advised to plan for conditional landowner incentives only in scenarios where the preconditions for PES are met. Implementers of jurisidictional approaches may also want to avoid conceptualizing their new model too narrowly and prescriptively, as was arguably the case with the conceptualization of REDD+ as a multitier PES scheme. © Copyright © 2020 Wunder, Duchelle, Sassi, Sills, Simonet and Sunderlin.",carbon markets; certification; climate change mitigation; deforestation; payments for environmental services,

Discussions on multilevel governance, polycentricity, and nested approaches to governance surround the central question, ever more pertinent considering global environmental change, of who holds the mandate over forests. Different levels of government, as well as private and civil society actors (companies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), indigenous peoples, and local communities), compete over the rights of ownership, administration, and management of forest landscapes—decisions with a crucial impact on land use, land use change and the future of forests. Understanding the relations among different levels of governance, and government specifically, is essential to understand how carbon forestry has engaged with decentralization and the role of subnational governments (SNGs) in developing practical land use solutions. We draw on current trends in the forestry decentralization literature to ask: (i) has carbon forestry opened new opportunities for SNGs to support the sustainable governance of forest landscapes? (ii) have meaningful powers been assigned to SNGs in support of democratic processes of decision-making over forest landscapes? and (iii) is carbon forestry influencing the relationships between levels of government in a way that challenges unequal power relations? By examining carbon forestry projects and forestry decentralization processes across five countries (Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Tanzania and Vietnam) with carbon forestry initiatives, we demonstrate how the role of SNGs is circumscribed by existing forestry decentralization trends. Decentralization initiatives in recent decades have provided SNGs with new mandates to manage forests, but new attributions do not always imply meaningful powers. The implementation of carbon forestry projects is molded by pre-existing power relations that shape the impacts of forestry decentralization on livelihoods and forest ecosystems. We find that carbon forestry, with both centralizing and decentralizing tendencies, operates within the spaces left by existing power dynamics that mold the way transfers of power are put into practice. Jurisdictional approaches will need to negotiate with this context to be able to push forward sustainable pathways. © Copyright © 2020 Libert-Amico and Larson.",carbon forestry; decentralization; forestry; governance; land use change,

Candidate leptons are required to form a vertex, within the inner tracking volume of ATLAS, displaced from the primary pp interaction region. No lepton pairs with an invariant mass greater than 12 GeV are observed, consistent with the background expectations derived from data. The detection efficiencies for generic resonances with lifetimes (cτ) of 100–1000 mm decaying into a dilepton pair with masses between 0.1–1.0 TeV are presented as a function of pT and decay radius of the resonances to allow the extraction of upper limits on the cross sections for theoretical models. The result is also interpreted in a supersymmetric model in which the lightest neutralino, produced via squark–antisquark production, decays into ℓ+ℓ′−ν (ℓ,ℓ′=e, μ) with a finite lifetime due to the presence of R-parity violating couplings. Cross-section limits are presented for specific squark and neutralino masses. For a 700 GeV squark, neutralinos with masses of 50–500 GeV and mean proper lifetimes corresponding to cτ values between 1 mm to 6 m are excluded.

In this study, we provide insights on information obtained from satellite surface soil moisture observations (as compared to modeled soil moisture and observed ground precipitation) on water stress and its impact on crop production variability in India. The analysis involved generating a Standardized Soil Moisture Index using (1) satellite soil moisture observations from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative and (2) the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 soil moisture data set as well as producing a Standardized Precipitation Index using ground-based rainfall observations from the Indian Meteorological Department.

Results show that soil moisture is an important limiting factor for crop production. As such, it is more suitable for representing agricultural drought than precipitation during drought conditions, as it correlates more closely with reduced crop yields. Additionally, using the satellite-based Standardized Soil Moisture Index seemed to explain crop yield reductions better than when we applied the model-based Standardized Soil Moisture Index from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2, particularly for irrigated crops (i.e., wheat).

In global environmental programs and projects aimed at supporting sustainable land use in developing countries, learning is often promoted but without explicit learning goals. The focus may be on capacity building and community participation, and on testing policy tools, rather than on collaborative social learning. In this study, we looked behind the rhetoric of learning in the Kalimantan Forests and Climate Partnership (KFCP), a large demonstration project for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) in Indonesia. The novelty of such mechanisms, linked to international forest carbon outcomes, means that learning lessons provides a rationale for REDD+ pilot activities. We used a qualitative approach to examine the nature and type of learning that occurred in the KFCP. While the stated project aims were to support policy experimentation and apply learning, the project design was highly technical, and project decision-making did not explicitly encourage joint problem solving. Despite the project's shortcomings, we identified that learning did occur by the end of the project in ways that were different to the initial goals. Our findings suggest that flexibility and openness in project design and implementation can enable different local actors to define shared learning agendas in ways that are meaningful for them. Designing and implementing environmental projects, and learning goals within them, should attend to the needs and aspirations of those who will have to live with their long-term consequences. Learning should be integrated into international environmental programs and projects at all levels, including for policy and funding bodies, rather than focusing on local capacity building and similar project ‘benefits’. Interviewees’ eagerness to learn suggests that building approaches to social learning into program design has the potential to yield opportunities for learning beyond REDD+ to other forms of policy experimentation and governance innovations. © 2019 The Authors",Environmental governance; Experimentation; Indonesia; Land use change; Learning; REDD+,capacity building; deforestation; environmental degradation; experimental study; governance approach; land use change; local participation; machine learning; Borneo; Indonesia; Kalimantan

We examined the neurobiological characteristics and clinical progression of these atrophy-defined subtypes. Methods: The four subtypes were replicated using a clustering method on MRI data in 260 amyloid-β-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia, and we subsequently tested whether the subtypes differed on [18F]flortaucipir (tau) positron emission tomography, white matter hyperintensity burden, and rate of global cognitive decline. Results: Voxel-wise and region-of-interest analyses revealed the greatest neocortical tau load in hippocampal-sparing (frontoparietal-predominant) and typical (temporal-predominant) patients, while limbic-predominant patients showed particularly high entorhinal tau. Typical patients with AD had the most pronounced white matter hyperintensity load, and hippocampal-sparing patients showed the most rapid global cognitive decline. Discussion: Our data suggest that structural MRI can be used to identify biologically and clinically meaningful subtypes of AD. © 2019 The Authors.

The rising number of persons with dementia and lack of any effective treatment highlight the urgency to better understand these modifiable risk factors. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether higher levels of sedentary behaviour are associated with reduced global cognitive functioning and slower cognitive decline in older persons without dementia. Methods: We used five population cohorts from Greece, Australia, USA, Japan, and Singapore (HELIAD, PATH, SALSA, SGS, and SLAS2) from the Cohort Studies of Memory in an International Consortium. In a coordinated analysis, we assessed the relationship between sedentary behaviour and global cognitive function with the use of linear mixed growth model analysis (mean follow-up range of 2.0–8.1 years). Results: Baseline datasets combined 10,450 older adults without dementia with a mean age range between cohorts of 66.7–75.1 years. After adjusting for multiple covariates, no cross-sectional association between sedentary behaviour and cognition was found in four studies. One association was detected where more sedentary behaviour was cross-sectionally linked to higher cognition levels (SLAS2, B = 0.118 (0.075; 0.160), P < 0.001). Longitudinally, there were no associations between baseline sedentary behaviour and cognitive decline (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Overall, these results do not suggest an association between total sedentary time and lower global cognition in older persons without dementia at baseline or over time. We hypothesize that specific types of sedentary behaviour may differentially influence cognition which should be investigated further. For now, it is, however, too early to establish undifferentiated sedentary time as a potential effective target for minimizing cognitive decline in older adults without dementia. © 2019, The Author(s).",,aged; cognition; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; dementia; female; human; male; pathophysiology; questionnaire; Aged; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cohort Studies; Dementia; Female; Humans; Male; Sedentary Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires

However, current debates around the potential disintegration of the European Union show that expulsion, as a theoretical and political possibility, deserves a more careful analysis. The article sets out to consider a route toward theorizing expulsion in systematic and realist terms.

We analyzed variants in 60 genes implicated in DLB, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and atypical parkinsonian or dementia disorders, in order to determine their frequency in DLB. We focused on variants that have previously been reported as pathogenic, and also describe variants reported as pathogenic which remain of unknown clinical significance, as well as variants associated with strong risk. Rare missense variants of unknown significance were found in APP, CHCHD2, DCTN1, GRN, MAPT, NOTCH3, SQSTM1, TBK1 and TIA1. Additionally, we identified a pathogenic GRN p.Arg493*mutation, potentially adding to the diversity of phenotypes associated with this mutation. The rarity of previously reported pathogenic mutations in this cohort suggests that the genetic overlap of other neurodegenerative diseases with DLB is not substantial.

For the former, unfair airtime allocation among the users will undermine their willingness to participate in MSNs. For the latter, a group head is required to connect other users. These two problems have to be properly addressed to enable real implementation and adoption of MSNs. To this aim, we propose a joint head selection and airtime allocation scheme for data dissemination within the group using Nash bargaining theory. Specifically, we consider two cases in terms of user preference on the data to be disseminated: a homogeneous case and a heterogeneous case. For each case, a Nash bargaining solution (NBS) based optimization problem is proposed. The existence of optimal solutions to the optimization problems is proved, which guarantees Pareto optimality and proportional fairness. Next, an algorithm that allows distributed implementation is introduced. Finally, numerical results are presented to evaluate the performance, validate intuitions and derive insights of the proposed scheme. © 2019",Airtime allocation; Data dissemination; Fairness; Game theory; Mobile social networks; Nash bargaining,Game theory; Group theory; Pareto principle; Social sciences computing; Airtime allocation; Data dissemination; Fairness; Mobile social networks; Nash bargaining; Social networking (online)

The combination is performed using six analyses searching for Higgs boson pairs decaying into the bb¯bb¯, bb¯W+W−, bb¯τ+τ−, W+W−W+W−, bb¯γγ and W+W−γγ final states. Results are presented for non-resonant and resonant Higgs boson pair production modes. No statistically significant excess in data above the Standard Model predictions is found. The combined observed (expected) limit at 95% confidence level on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section is 6.9 (10) times the predicted Standard Model cross-section. Limits are also set on the ratio (κλ) of the Higgs boson self-coupling to its Standard Model value. This ratio is constrained at 95% confidence level in observation (expectation) to −5.0&lt;κλ&lt;12.0 (−5.8&lt;κλ&lt;12.0). In addition, limits are set on the production of narrow scalar resonances and spin-2 Kaluza–Klein Randall–Sundrum gravitons.

Events with a photon, an electron or muon, a b-tagged jet, and missing transverse momentum are selected. A neural network based on kinematic variables differentiates between events from signal and background processes. The data are consistent with the background-only hypothesis, and limits are set on the strength of the tqγ coupling in an effective field theory.

I consider the cultural dimension of such a transformation. Cultural meanings not only provide the building blocks of individuals’ life stories, but collectively construct social reality, powerfully shaping how people think and act. Any glass ceiling to societal transformation is partly cultural, and can be reproduced by a society’s ‘political grammar,’ which constrains what can be perceived and politically advanced. Contesting these limits is vital for making glass ceilings visible and opening up new transformative potentials. Consequently, overcoming the glass ceiling of the environmental state must be understood as a cultural transformation: a process of ‘meaning-making’ that re-orientates people’s fundamental norms and outlooks. This adds nuance to the debate around democracy and sustainability; it is not democracy in general, but only a particularly vibrant and critical deliberative sphere that can provide the necessary political foundation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",culture; deliberative democracy; glass ceiling; meaning-making; social transformation; Sustainability,cultural change; democracy; political geography; sustainability

Though it grew in membership and outreach after 2011, it has failed to develop into a key actor for the increasingly mobilised unemployed, who do not join or build formal organisations. The latter reject co-operation because they perceive the UDC to be weak and ‘politicized’. The article examines this assessment using interviews and focus groups conducted during extensive fieldwork and Facebook posts made by the unemployed union. An analysis of UDC’s internal dynamics and of the precautions it takes to remain autonomous from societal and political actors only partially supports this accusation. Instead, fragmentation is better explained by state responses that reward isolated protesters with limited demands rather than negotiating with actors in organisations to reach sustainable solutions. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Shortly thereafter, transgenic plants were regenerated from zygotic embryo-derived cells following their subjection to micro-projectile acceleration and Agrobacterium-mediated transfection treatments. The high efficiency of transfer deoxyribonucleic acid (T-DNA) integration in seed embryo-derived cells of rice has allowed the transfer of genes of agronomical relevance and the generation of large collections of insertion lines and has provided a key contribution to deciphering the function of more than 2000 rice genes. The high efficiency of T-DNA integration in seed embryo-derived cells of rice also permitted the first implementation of gene targeting and knock-in (KI) events, relying on the albeit very low natural frequency of homology-directed repair (HDR) in the rice genome. In the late 2000s, the advent of site-directed nucleases (SDNs) that induce either single or double-strand breaks at a high frequency and their rapid application to rice permitted routine targeted mutagenesis, which can be multiplexed to simultaneously alter several targets or create deletions, and base and gene editing (e.g. correction of amino acids). Currently, the challenge remains to attain a high frequency of KI and replacement of long stretches of DNA for protein domain or coding sequence swapping. We present herein a historical perspective of the advances that have been readily implemented to determine the function of rice genes and to manipulate traits of agronomical relevance. Two main bottlenecks remain to be alleviated in rice genomic engineering: the low frequency of HDR and the genotype dependence of gene transfer efficiency. Alleviation of these bottlenecks is needed to reach the potential of intra- and interspecific gene replacement and SDN-mediated multiplex editing of alleles in elite materials, which will assist in the breeding and deployment of rice cultivars embedded in sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Functional genomics; Gene editing; Genetic engineering; Rice,

Thus, the real time clinical decision support systems detecting anomalies and deviations in MAP enable early interventions and prevent serious complications. The stateof- the-art decision support systems are based on a three-phase method that applies offline training, transfer learning, and retraining at the bedside. Their applicability in critical care units is challenging with delay and inaccuracy. In this article, we propose a real time clinical decision support system forecasting the MAP status at the bedside using a new machine learning structure. The proposed system works in real time at the bedside without requiring the offline phase for training using large datasets. It thereby enables timely interventions and improved healthcare services. The proposed machine learning structure includes two stages. Stage I applies online learning using hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) to enable real time stream processing and provides unsupervised predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time it is applied to medical signals. Stage II is a long short-term memory (LSTM) classifier that forecasts the status of the patient's MAP ahead of time based on Stage I stream predictions. We perform a thorough performance evaluation of the proposed system and compare it with the state-of-the-art systems employing logistic regression (LR). The comparison shows the proposed system outperforms LR in terms of the classification accuracy, recall, precision, and area under the receiver operation curve (AUROC). © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

This paper proposes the combination of learning-based clustering trees with local mode filtering for the segmentation of the optic disc region in retinal images. The algorithm identifies candidate optic disc region by extracting and pooling low-level features at different clustering resolutions from the filtered region-of-interest in two color channels. Thereafter, we use learned geometric properties such as area, eccentricity and solidity to extract high-level features for the identification of connected components, which most likely belong to the optic disc region. The final stage pools and fully connects these connected components into a single segmented region.

The choice of a color space in most contributions on skin lesion segmentation for melanoma detection are based on qualitative rather than quantitative approaches. User experience and theoretical properties of the color space are the two major factors influencing the choice of the color space. For this reason, it may be difficult to optimize segmentation accuracy. This paper evaluates the discrimination power of 5 color spaces and 16 color channels for two unsupervised approaches and a deep learning approach on the segmentation of skin lesion in dermatoscopy images. 600 dermatoscopy images with different levels of cluttering and occluding objects from two different databases were utilized. This study suggests that no single color space or color channel is most suitable in real-world scenarios. Therefore, this study can be regarded as a general framework to select a single or combination of color channels that will enhance the segmentation accuracy of images with different level of scene complexities and illumination variations. © Proceedings of the 14th IADIS International Conference Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2020, CGVCVIP 2020 and Proceedings of the 5th IADIS International Conference Big Data Analytics, Data Mining and Computational Intelligence 2020, BigDaCI 2020 and Proceedings of the 9th IADIS International Conference Theory and Practice in Modern Computing 2020, TPMC 2020 - Part of the 14th Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, MCCSIS 2020.

Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to 1600 emergency physicians in 75 hospitals which were selected randomly from China between January and July 2018. Results: 92.1% respondents fulfilled the survey. The predictive value of brain stem reflex, motor response and myoclonus was confirmed by 63.5%, 44.6% and 31.7% respondents, respectively. Only 30.7% knew that GWR value < 1.1 indicated poor prognosis and only 8.1% know the most commonly used SSEP N20. Status epilepticus, burst suppression and suppression were considered to predict poor outcome by only 35.0%, 27.4% and 20.9% respondents, respectively. Only 46.7% knew NSE and only 24.7% knew S-100. Only a few respondents knew that neurological prognostication should be performed later than 72 hours from CA either in TTM or non-TTM patients. In practice, the most commonly used method was clinical examination (85.4%). Only 67.9% had used brain CT for prognosis and 18.4% for MRI. NSE (39.6%) was a little more widely used than S-100β (18.0%). However, SSEP (4.4%) and EEG (11.4%) were occasionally performed. Conclusions: Neurological prognostication in CA survivors had not been well understood and performed by emergency physicians in China. They were more likely to use clinical examination rather than objective tools, especially SSEP and EEG, which also illustrated that multimodal approach was not well performed in practice. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,China; coma; epidemiology; heart arrest; human; prognosis; survivor; China; Coma; Heart Arrest; Humans; Prognosis; Survivors

Its case is a high-profile Human Rights Council initiative: the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP s). These UNGP s have successfully presented meanings as fixed while actually stretching those meanings' boundaries. They reconceptualize what it means to “respect” and “protect” human rights. This is surprising given that the principles were framed as a conservative exercise at clarification, and under-noticed due to the legal rather than conceptual focus of the existing critical literature. To respect human rights, according to the UNGP s, agents need to take costly positive action. Furthermore, protect obligations come before respect. These are significant innovations. On the other hand, two missed opportunities of the UNGP s are their thin harm-based foundation for respect obligations, and their state centrism about who has duties to protect. © 2020 Brill Academic Publishers.

We analyse the merger rate per galaxy of binary neutron stars (BNSs), black hole-neutron star binaries (BHNSs), and binary black holes (BBHs) from redshift zero up to six. The binary merger rate per galaxy strongly correlates with the stellar mass of the host galaxy at any redshift considered here. This correlation is significantly steeper for BNSs than for both BHNSs and BBHs. Moreover, we find that the merger rate per galaxy depends also on host galaxy's star formation rate (SFR) and metallicity. We derive a robust fitting formula that relates the merger rate per galaxy with galaxy's SFR, stellar mass, and metallicity at different redshifts. The typical masses of the host galaxies increase significantly as redshift decreases, as a consequence of the interplay between delay time distribution of compact binaries and cosmic assembly of galaxies. Finally, we study the evolution of the merger rate density with redshift. At low redshift (z ≤ 0.1) early-type galaxies give a larger contribution to the merger rate density than late-type galaxies.

Objective: To determine whether hydrocortisone improves outcome for patients with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: An ongoing adaptive platform trial testing multiple interventions within multiple therapeutic domains, for example, antiviral agents, corticosteroids, or immunoglobulin. Between March 9 and June 17, 2020, 614 adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and randomized within at least 1 domain following admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory or cardiovascular organ support at 121 sites in 8 countries. Of these, 403 were randomized to open-label interventions within the corticosteroid domain. The domain was halted after results from another trial were released. Follow-up ended August 12, 2020. Interventions: The corticosteroid domain randomized participants to a fixed 7-day course of intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg or 100 mg every 6 hours) (n = 143), a shock-dependent course (50 mg every 6 hours when shock was clinically evident) (n = 152), or no hydrocortisone (n = 108). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was organ support-free days (days alive and free of ICU-based respiratory or cardiovascular support) within 21 days, where patients who died were assigned -1 day. The primary analysis was a bayesian cumulative logistic model that included all patients enrolled with severe COVID-19, adjusting for age, sex, site, region, time, assignment to interventions within other domains, and domain and intervention eligibility. Superiority was defined as the posterior probability of an odds ratio greater than 1 (threshold for trial conclusion of superiority >99%). Results: After excluding 19 participants who withdrew consent, there were 384 patients (mean age, 60 years; 29% female) randomized to the fixed-dose (n = 137), shock-dependent (n = 146), and no (n = 101) hydrocortisone groups; 379 (99%) completed the study and were included in the analysis. The mean age for the 3 groups ranged between 59.5 and 60.4 years; most patients were male (range, 70.6%-71.5%); mean body mass index ranged between 29.7 and 30.9; and patients receiving mechanical ventilation ranged between 50.0% and 63.5%. For the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively, the median organ support-free days were 0 (IQR, -1 to 15), 0 (IQR, -1 to 13), and 0 (-1 to 11) days (composed of 30%, 26%, and 33% mortality rates and 11.5, 9.5, and 6 median organ support-free days among survivors). The median adjusted odds ratio and bayesian probability of superiority were 1.43 (95% credible interval, 0.91-2.27) and 93% for fixed-dose hydrocortisone, respectively, and were 1.22 (95% credible interval, 0.76-1.94) and 80% for shock-dependent hydrocortisone compared with no hydrocortisone. Serious adverse events were reported in 4 (3%), 5 (3%), and 1 (1%) patients in the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with severe COVID-19, treatment with a 7-day fixed-dose course of hydrocortisone or shock-dependent dosing of hydrocortisone, compared with no hydrocortisone, resulted in 93% and 80% probabilities of superiority with regard to the odds of improvement in organ support-free days within 21 days. However, the trial was stopped early and no treatment strategy met prespecified criteria for statistical superiority, precluding definitive conclusions.

Nitrogen, mostly in its reactive form as fertilizer or synthetic N, governs the food production, and reconciles the productivity with economic and environmental considerations. However, N flows in the production system involves a large N leaking to the environment resulting in abysmally low nitrogen use efficiencies and environmental adversity. Agricultural system with sub-optimal N application is characterized with low crop productivity, spiraling into the vicious cycle of poverty, malnutrition and poor economy, a case most common in the sub-Saharan Africa. These essentially relate to SDG 1 (no-poverty), 2 (zero-hunger), 3 (good health and well-being), 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 15 (life on land). Excess or imbalanced fertilizer N in most of China and parts of India led to serious environmental hazards, degradation of land and economic loss. Balancing the amount of N input in these regions will contribute in achieving the SDG 13 (climate action). Meeting some of the SDGs (5, gender equality; 6, clean water and sanitation; 10: reduced inequalities; etc.) requires optimum N application, which will also ensure “responsible consumption and production” (SDG 12). The quest for an appropriate N management needs accounting for the N surplus in a production system, and evolving strategies for increasing the nitrogen use efficiency. Much effort has been made to this effect with varying success. Cutting-edge technological options are although available on the horizon, the success lies in improved awareness among the policy makers, stakeholders and farmers, and better research to quantify the linkage between N management and the SDGs, taking collectively. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Cereal; Nitrogen balance; Nitrogen surplus; Nitrogen use efficiency; Reactive nitrogen; Sustainable development goals,

Although some studies have been performed to study the applications of EA in public sectors, governments, and cities, most of such studies are scattered and there is no strong research stream. As a result, it is difficult to effectively accumulate relevant knowledge and experiences. In this research, we attempt to explore research streams and trends by analyzing why existing studies were conducted, what outcomes were produced, and what methods were used in these studies. Starting from these three questions, a thematic framework was developed, and a literature synthesis was presented. The result shows the complexity of this area, the importance of balancing technical factors and non-technical factors, the challenges brought by non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of EA frameworks, few studies have been found in which government or city relevant requirements were addressed in a general way.

While the importance of applying such technologies has been widely recognized, they might not have been effectively discussed in the early design phase. As a widely applied planning and architecting tool, traditional Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (EAF) are not always able to meet requirements of urban development in an expected way. This might be alleviated by applying a smart city-oriented EAF which supports discussion of modern techniques in the early design phase. In the EU smart city project +CityxChange, an EAF was proposed to address such issues. In this article, we focus on an initial evaluation of the EAF proposed in the +CityxChange project according to the Design Science Research (DSR) method. We discuss how the EAF has enhanced the widely used EAF (i.e., The Open Group Architecture Framework, TOGAF for short) by extending its layer-based Enterprise Architecture (EA).

As a first step towards a self-paced color-based BCI, we assessed if a machine learning algorithm can learn to distinguish between primary color exposure and idle state. In this paper, we record and analyze the EEG signals from 18 subjects for assessing the feasibility of distinguishing between color exposure and idle states. Specifically, we compare separately the performances obtained in the classification of two different types of idle states (one relaxation-related and another attention-related) and color exposure. We characterize the signals using two different ways based on discrete wavelet transform and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), respectively. We trained and tested two different classifiers, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest. The outcomes provide experimental evidence that a machine learning algorithm can distinguish between the two classes (exposure to primary colors and idle states), regardless of the kind of idle state analyzed. The more consistent outcomes were obtained using EMD-based features with accuracies of 92.3% and 91.6% (considering a break and an attention-related task as the idle states). Also, when we discard the epochs’ onset the performances were 91.8% and 94.6%, respectively. Copyright © 2020 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

The general consensus is that there have been negative impacts on the environment and positive impacts on local economies. However, since rubber prices dropped after 2011, the economic benefit to the local people is challenged and the impact on the local people and communities remains unclear. Using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, this longitudinal study investigates how the drop in rubber prices has affected a local community and the local people in Manlin, Xishuangbanna, China. It investigates local coping strategies and the importance of alternative income sources and shows how differentiated access to alternative lands creates increased economic inequality within the village when prices fluctuate. Three general coping strategies were identified amongst local rubber farmers: doing business as usual, changing rubber management practices, and stopping- or decreasing tapping frequency. Differences in coping strategies are linked to factors including access to alternative income sources and rubber perceptions. Moreover, households with access to tea land were found to have experienced negligible impacts of decreasing rubber prices as income from tea has increased more than income from rubber has decreased, leading to increasing intra-village economic inequality. We conclude that while this is a clear case of how income diversification is important for reducing livelihood vulnerability, it also shows that the large focus on rubber farming has created benefits in terms of improved infrastructure and connectivity that has helped expand the market for tea as well. © 2020 by the authors.",China; Coping strategies; Land use; Livelihoods; Price drop; Rubber; Tea; Xishuangbanna,

These tasks can only be efficiently performed by a machine learning based algorithm. We address the same issue in this paper by proposing a deep learning based technique for predicting the relevant tags for a movie and segmenting the movie with respect to the predicted tags. We construct a tag vocabulary and create the corresponding dataset in order to train a deep learning model. Subsequently, we propose an efficient shot detection algorithm to find the key frames in the movie. The extracted key frames are analyzed by the deep learning model to predict the top three tags for each frame. The tags are then assigned weighted scores and are filtered to generate a compact set of most relevant tags. This process also generates a corpus which is further used to segment a movie based on a selected tag. We present a rigorous analysis of the segmentation quality with respect to the number of tags selected for the segmentation. Our detailed experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique is not only efficacious in predicting the most relevant tags for a movie, but also in segmenting the movie with respect to the selected tags with a high accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.",deep learning; movie segmentation; Tags prediction; transfer learning,Classification (of information); Forecasting; Image segmentation; Machine learning; Motion pictures; Compact sets; High-accuracy; Learning models; Movie segmentation; Rigorous analysis; Segmentation quality; Shot detection algorithms; Transfer learning; Deep learning

While a number of studies have investigated the effects of excreta on soil N2O fluxes in developed economies and in China, observations in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are scarce. Moreover, the effects of soil properties (e.g. pH or texture) on N2O emissions from excreta patches have hardly been studied. In this study we investigated the importance of soil properties on N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from cattle excreta (dung, urine, and manure [dung + urine]) for five typical tropical soils in Kenya. For this, intact soil cores were translocated from Western Kenya (Nandi county) to Nairobi, where N2O and CO2 fluxes were measured over four individual periods (two during dry seasons and two during wet seasons). Fluxes were measured for between 25 and 73 days following surface application of excreta, depending on how quickly emissions returned to baseline. Both dung and manure applications led to increased CO2 and N2O fluxes during both dry and wet seasons. On average, the N2O emission factor (EF) for manure was higher than for dung. The EFs during the wet season were higher for both the dung (0.12%) and urine (0.50%) compared to the dry season EFs (0.01% and 0.07% for dung and urine respectively). Soil type had no measurable effect on N2O and CO2 emissions for either dung or manure application. In contrast, soil clay content was negatively (P &lt; 0.05) and pH positively (P &lt; 0.05) correlated with N2O emissions after urine application. Assuming an excreta-N ratio of dung to urine of 66:34, as evidenced in earlier studies for SSA, and averaging across all treatments and soils, we calculated a cattle excreta N2O EF of 0.14%, which is one magnitude lower than the IPCC default N2O EF of 2%.

Deforestation may alter the natural circulation of viruses and change the composition, abundance, behaviour and possibly viral exposure of reservoir species. This in turn might increase contact between infected animals and humans. Fruit bats of the family Pteropodidae have been suspected as reservoirs of the Ebola virus. At present, the only evidence associating fruit bats with EVD is the presence of seropositive individuals in eight species and polymerase chain reaction-positive individuals in three of these. Our study investigates whether human activities can increase African fruit bat geographical ranges and whether this influence overlaps geographically with EVD outbreaks that, in turn, are favoured by deforestation. We use species observation records for the 20 fruit bat species found in favourable areas for the Ebola virus to determine factors affecting the bats' range inside the predicted Ebola virus area. We do this by employing a hypothetico-deductive approach based on favourability modelling. We show that the range of some fruit bat species is linked to human activities within the favourable areas for the Ebola virus. More specifically, the areas where human activities favour the presence of five fruit bat species overlap with the areas where EVD outbreaks in humans were themselves favoured by deforestation. These five species are as follows: Eidolon helvum, Epomops franqueti, Megaloglossus woermanni, Micropteropus pusillus and Rousettus aegyptiacus. Of these five, all but Megaloglossus woermanni have recorded seropositive individuals. For the remaining 15 bat species, we found no biogeographical support for the hypothesis that positive human influence on fruit bats could be associated with EVD outbreaks in deforested areas within the tropical forest biome in West and Central Africa. Our work is a useful first step allowing further investigation of the networks and pathways that may lead to an EVD outbreak.

However, its contribution to gender empowerment in diverse farming households is not documented. This study creates a Gender Empowerment Index for climate-smart villages (GEI-CSV) based on four major measurable indicators—political, economic, agricultural, and social. The gender gap was derived by mapping difference in empowerment levels across selected CSVs and non-CSVs. These indicators can be used as a vital tool to understand the process of gender empowerment that can trigger the entry points to achieve gender equality, which is also an important aspect in the adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices (CSAPs). The study measures empowerment at the inter-household and intra-household level across CSVs and non-CSVs from the individual household survey with both female and male members of the same household. This paper provides evidence demonstrating how gender empowerment differs in CSVs and non-CSVs from selected climate-smart villages (community-based approach) in two contrasting ecologies and socio-economic settings of India. The study documents the existing gender gap in CSVs and non-CSVs across India’s western (Haryana) and eastern (Bihar) Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). Irrespective of CSVs and non-CSVs, considerable differences in outlook and gender gap were observed between Bihar and Haryana. Both women and men in Bihar are less empowered than they are in Haryana. High empowerment level in CSVs than non-CSVs shows that the concept of CSVs has brought a change towards knowledge and capacity enhancement of both women and men farmers promoting gender equality in farming households with a varying scope of interventions made and required for scaling CSAPs across the diversity of farming households. © 2018, The Author(s).",,Agriculture; Ecology; Surveys; Capacity enhancement; Community based approach; Gender equality; Household level; Household surveys; Indo-Gangetic Plains; Smart agricultures; Socio-economics; Rural areas

However, the gender classifiers proposed by earlier studies for social media content so far, highly rely on the language used by the users for writing the content. It implies that the prediction model trained on one language (say English) will likely fail in identifying the gender of users with other languages (for example, Spanish). The study conducted in this paper aims to identify the features from user content on an OSN, which will assist in devising a Language-Independent Gender Classifier (LIGC). The experiments are performed on the Facebook networking site. The site provides the users with the list of various personal attributes that they may or may not reveal to other users on the network. The presented work collects such information of the Facebook users and carries out rigorous feature analysis to know whether this information varies between men and women on Facebook. Furthermore, several machine learning algorithms including Random Forest, SVM, Naïve Bayes, and kNN have been employed to determine the potential of the proposed feature set. Random forest approach achieves the highest value (70%) of performance metric, AUROC (Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic).

Objective: We evaluated the additional impact of the distribution of cash and/or LNS on mean height-for-age z scores (HAZ; primary outcome), stunting (HAZ < -2), and on intermediate outcomes along the program impact pathways. Methods: In a cluster-randomized controlled trial using a 2 × 2 factorial design, 76 CHCs were randomly assigned to deliver either SNACK, SNACK + Cash, SNACK + LNS, or SNACK + Cash + LNS. Cross-sectional surveys among 12- to 42-mo-old children and their mothers were conducted at baseline (2013, n = 5046) and at endline (2016, n = 5098). Results: Factorial analysis showed no interaction between cash and LNS treatments for HAZ, but found an antagonistic interaction for stunting (OR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.31; P = 0.03). There were no impacts of the cash, LNS, or cash + LNS treatments, compared with the SNACK alone, on either HAZ or stunting (treatment × time interaction). There were significant impacts of the LNS and cash + LNS treatments on attendance at ≥1 growth monitoring (GM) session (OR: 3.95; 95% CI: 1.69, 9.24; OR: 3.90; 95% CI: 1.73, 8.81, respectively) and half the expected sessions (OR: 4.72; 95% CI: 1.47, 15.17; OR: 5.25; 95% CI: 1.82, 15.11, respectively), mothers' knowledge on importance of GM (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.16, 3.39; OR: 3.12; 95% CI: 1.60, 6.09, respectively), and, only for the LNS group, appropriate timing for complementary feeding (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.41).

A workshop hosted by HarvestPlus was held in April 2019 in New Delhi to discuss ways to increase the scale, reach and impact of naturally nutritious (biofortified) foods in India by working in partnership with the food industry. This paper summarizes the output of that 2-day workshop. HarvestPlus has conducted research into the barriers for scale-up and co-created solutions to overcoming those barriers through partnership with the food industry. During this workshop, it emerged that there is significant demand from the food industry who see value in biofortification to both their business and the health of their customers and the country. Small working groups explored specific opportunities around supply chains, food products and composition, and consumers & markets. Several common themes emerged from the deliberations. All three groups identified lack of awareness as a major barrier to scale. More data on the health and nutrition impacts, as well as consumer and market research, is critically needed to build the food industry's understanding of biofortified foods. Ensuring supply chain integrity, meeting manufacturing product standards, and developing strategic messaging for consumers were also mentioned repeatedly. Ending hidden hunger and managing a profitable food business can be done simultaneously and sustainably. By addressing the barriers to embedding biofortification into the food system, HarvestPlus aims to increase the access that families and communities have to nutritious seeds and foods.

If not significantly different from the feedstock, the recycled powder can be reused many times without a detrimental impact on the mechanical properties of the final printed parts, which reduces the metallic powder waste and printing time. A detailed characterization and comparison of the feedstock and recycled powders is essential in order to understand the number of times a powder can be recycled. The recycled powders were sampled after 10 times reuse in the Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) process in the 3D printer. In this paper, we have performed a detailed characterization on morphology, microstructure, and the surface and bulk composition of virgin feedstock and recycled stainless steel 316 L powders (over 10 times reused), and correlated these measurements to topography, nanoindentation and hardness tests. We have also performed rarely reported synchrotron surface characterization of both powder sets in order to measure the level of oxidation of the individual metallic elements present in the virgin and recycled steel powder and the way such chemical composition changes following use in the manufacturing process. The results show more satellite and bonded particles in the recycled powder although the particle size is not broadly impacted. The atomic force microscopy results showed a smaller roughness on recycled powders measured on surfaces without satellites which might be due to less surface dendrites on recycled powder surface. Finally, a higher hardness was measured for the recycled powder resulted from the manufacturing process on grains and chemical composition. The results suggest no significant changes on the mechanical properties of the printed parts depending for a certain number of reusing cycles. © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.",3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Metallic powder; Powder recycling; Stainless steel 316l,3D printers; Additives; Feedstocks; Hardness; Industrial research; Particle size; Powders; Recycling; Topography; 3-D printing; Additive manufacturing process; Chemical compositions; Manufacturing process; Metallic powder; Stainless steel 316; Stainless steel 316L; Surface characterization; Austenitic stainless steel

The main source of crustal S on Mars is the volcanic exhalation of SO2 and H2S gases. Volcanic ash, expelled along with gases, may be a sink for up to 30% of the exhaled S gas species. We analyze the elemental composition of the Martian shallow sub-surface using the Mars Odyssey Gamma Ray Spectrometer to find areas that are simultaneously enriched in constituents of major volcanic gases such as S, Cl, and H2O. A large sedimentary deposit of likely pyroclastic origin called the Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF) is located within this region of possibly extensive alteration by volcanic gases. Based on reasonable terrestrial analog estimates that the MFF scavenged, at maximum, 30% of the exhaled S gas species, we find that a significant amount of S (&gt;1017 kg) would have been delivered to the atmosphere over the time it took for the MFF to be deposited on Mars. The mass of the S emitted from the MFF-forming event(s) is up to 8 orders of magnitude higher than the mass of S emitted from the largest Quaternary volcanic eruption on Earth. Thus, volcanic degassing from the MFF forming events could have significantly affected surface geological processes, climate evolution, and habitability of Mars. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Atmosphere; Dust; Geochemistry; Mars; Pyroclastic; Sulfur,Chemical analysis; Dust; Earth atmosphere; Gamma ray spectrometers; Gamma rays; Gases; Geochemistry; Remote sensing; Sulfur; Elemental compositions; Mars; Medusae fossae formations; Mineralogical analysis; Orders of magnitude; Pyroclastic; Remote sensing data; Sedimentary deposits; Volcanoes

Its dynamics are dependent on various socio-economic factors that make the overall picture particularly complex. While several theories have been proposed to account for the establishment of criminal behaviour, from a modelling perspective organised crime and terrorist networks received much less attention. In particular, the dynamics of recruitment into such organisations deserve specific considerations, as recruitment is the mechanism that makes crime and terror proliferate. We propose a framework able to model such processes in both organised crime and terrorist networks from an evolutionary game theoretical perspective. By means of a stylised model, we are able to study a variety of different circumstances and factors influencing the growth or decline of criminal organisations and terrorist networks, and observe the convoluted interplay between agents that decide to get associated to illicit groups, criminals that prefer to act on their own, and the rest of the civil society. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"article; crime; criminal behavior; human; organization; rest; terrorism; theoretical study; crime; criminal behavior; game; theoretical model; Crime; Criminal Behavior; Game Theory; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Terrorism"

Existing social movement research suggests a characteristic common to activists who are most likely to facilitate and take part in cross-border activism: mobile histories of their own. Using the case of queer mobilisation, we bring into focus the mechanisms connecting migration and the proliferation of social movement organisations that champion queer causes transnationally (tSMOs). Migration contributes to new and unique continental ties between multi-national queer organisations. We argue that these ties change the landscape of queer activism in Europe by forming the bonds of solidarity across borders that lead to transnational queer mobilisation. This is largely because migrants’ identities are rooted in multiple spaces and thus trigger solidarity around a multi-faceted understanding of sexual plurality, putting new issues and contexts on the agenda for queer activism. We utilise a mixed-methods approach to show a strong relationship between migrant inflows and queer tSMOs, based on an original dataset spanning twenty-six European OECD countries and on qualitative interviews with migrant activists. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",LGBTQ politics; migrant networks; Queer migration; social movement organisations; transnational activism,cross-border relations; gender issue; migration; social movement; social network; social organization; Europe

However, intensification is dependent upon the availability and suitability of natural resources to sustain growth in production. Here, land and water footprints of milk production in three contrasting agro-ecological zones ranging from humid to semi-arid across nine counties of Kenya are quantified. Water and land use footprints across three potential intensification pathways are also outlined and evaluated against the baseline scenario, the currently prevailing practices or the S1 Futures scenario, treated as the benchmark. Intensification pathways focusing on improving livestock breeds, feed provisioning and milk output per cow and distinguished by contrasting management practices perform differentially across the three agro-ecological zones. Total water and land footprints increase for all scenarios relative to the baseline scenario. In particular, all the breed improvement scenarios, have much larger total water footprints than the baseline scenario. Improvement in breed to pure bred cattle across all production systems has the largest total water footprint across all the production systems. Across all the scenarios, the largest reduction in water footprint of milk production (75%) occurs with improvement in breed and feeding practices from two scenarios in the lowlands. Milk production by the cross-bred cattle is most efficient in the lowlands system whereas milk production by the pure breed Ayrshire is most land use efficient in the midlands system. Across the three agroecological zones, improving breeds, feed provisioning and milk production per cow may achieve production intensification but concurrently exacerbates resource limitation. Consequently, the heterogeneity inherent in resource availability across dairy production zones should be considered when developing strategies for increasing dairy production. © 2019 The Authors",Intensification scenarios; Land use; Milk; Smallholder farmers; Water scarcity,adaptive management; agricultural intensification; agroecology; dairy farming; economic growth; ecozone; food security; integrated approach; land management; livestock; management practice; milk production; resource availability; resource use; semiarid region; smallholder; Bos

The proposed interval observer evaluates the set of values for the state, which are compatible with the nominal fault-free and icing-free operation and can be designed in such a way that some information about the nature of the unknown inputs affecting the system can be obtained, thus allowing the diagnosis to be performed. The proposed strategy has several advantages. First, the LPV paradigm allows taking into account operating point variations. Second, the noise rejection properties are enhanced by the presence of the integral term. Third, the interval estimation property guarantees the absence of false alarms. Linear matrix inequality–based conditions for the analysis/design of these observers are provided in order to guarantee the interval estimation of the state and the boundedness of the estimation. The developed theory is supported by simulation results, obtained with the uncertain model of a Zagi Flying Wing UAV, which illustrate the strong appeal of the methodology for identifying correctly unexpected changes in the system dynamics due to actuator faults or icing. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",fault diagnosis; icing diagnosis; interval observers; linear parameter varying (LPV) systems; unknown input observers (UIOs); unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),Actuators; Antennas; Failure analysis; Linear matrix inequalities; Uncertainty analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Interval estimation; Interval observers; Linear parameter varying; Linear parameter varying systems; Operating points; Robust fault diagnosis; Uncertain modeling; Unknown input observer; Fault detection

Several neuroparadigms (motor imagery, SSVEPs, P300, SCP among others) have been explored to control a BCI, but passive color exposure is one of the most novels. However, the analysis of the potential of this task for being used in a self-paced BCI has not been studied enough. In this paper, the first step towards a self-paced color-exposure-based BCI is presented. This is done by the analysis of the differences between the interest activities (RGB colors) and idle state. Specifically, we extract EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition)-based features from the EEG signals and then these are classified using 4 classifiers (SVM, random forest, Naive Bayes and KNN). We then present an analysis of the performances for these two classes (RGB colors vs idle state) obtained for seven subjects, highlighting SVM's average performance (93.27% for all of them). Also, the differences between the two classes (color exposure and idle state) suggest that they do not depend on a specific subject. Last, we provide experimental evidence that there is no a specific color that could be distinguished better regardless idle state, reaching average accuracies of 85.01%, 85.56%, and 86.91% for red, green and blue vs idle state, respectively. © 2019 IEEE.",Classification; Color exposure recognition; EMD; Idle state; Random forest; SVM,"Classification (of information); Color; Computer control systems; Decision trees; Random forests; Signal processing; Support vector machines; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Experimental evidence; Healthy people; Idle state; Motor imagery; Naive bayes; Red , green and blues; Self-Paced-BCI; Brain computer interface"

Solutions in each of these categories are explained, implemented and compared using different trajectory database sizes. Compared to state-of-the-art survey papers, the contribution of this paper is in providing a deep analysis of all kinds of trajectory outlier detection methods.

The congruence/novelty index corresponds to our qualitative case knowledge, and the SBC approach leads to meaningful volatility scores.

However, the efficacy and safety of AACD-CPR still remained controversy. This analysis was designed to comprehensively compare AACD versus SCC-CPR in patients with cardiac arrest. Methods: We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI up to April 22, 2019. Mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR) with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to compare outcomes of the groups. Our primary outcomes were restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and short-term survival. Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. All statistical analyses were performed using standard statistical procedures provided in Review Manager 5.2 and Stata 12.0. Results: A total of seventeen studies (N = 1647 patients) were identified for the present analysis. Compared with standard CPR, AACD-CPR was superior in restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and short-term survival, with pooled RRs of 1.38 (95% CI 1.23–1.55; P &lt; 0.00001) and RRs of 2.05 (95% CI 1.69–2.50; P &lt; 0.00001) respectively. In addition, significant superiority of AACD-CPR was found in incidence of fracture, long-term survival, pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2), coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) and adverse events. No significant difference was observed in incidence of vomiting. Conclusions: Generally, in this combined analysis we found a statistically significant improvement in survival and ROSC with the use of AACD-CPR as compared with the use of standard CPR. There was also significant improvement in incidence of fracture, long-term survival, PETCO2 and CPP with AACD-CPR in comparison with standard CPR; results were not statistically different between the groups regarding to vomiting rate and adverse events. The standardized, diversified and individualized methods of clinical operation of AACD-CPR need exploration and expectingly serve as a guideline for clinical application of AACD-CPR in the future. © 2019",Active abdominal compression-decompression; Cardiac arrests; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation; Survival,active abdominal compression decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation; adverse event; adverse outcome; Chinese Biomedical database; clinical outcome; CNKI database; Cochrane Library; comparative effectiveness; coronary artery blood flow; data extraction; Embase; emergency treatment; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; fracture; heart arrest; human; incidence; intensive care; long term survival; Medline; meta analysis; patient safety; priority journal; quality control; randomized controlled trial (topic); resuscitation; return of spontaneous circulation; Review; short term survival; systematic review; vomiting; WanFang Database; Web of Science; abdomen; adverse event; aged; contraindication; female; heart arrest; lower body negative pressure; male; middle aged; odds ratio; pressure; procedures; resuscitation; thorax; treatment outcome; Abdomen; Aged; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Contraindications; Female; Heart Arrest; Humans; Lower Body Negative Pressure; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Pressure; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Resuscitation; Thorax; Treatment Outcome

Countries with limited forest monitoring capabilities in the tropics and subtropics rely on IPCC 2006 default ∆AGB rates, which are values per ecological zone, per continent. Similarly, research into forest biomass change at a large scale also makes use of these rates. IPCC 2006 default rates come from a handful of studies, provide no uncertainty indications and do not distinguish between older secondary forests and old-growth forests. As part of the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, we incorporate ∆AGB data available from 2006 onwards, comprising 176 chronosequences in secondary forests and 536 permanent plots in old-growth and managed/logged forests located in 42 countries in Africa, North and South America and Asia. We generated ∆AGB rate estimates for younger secondary forests (≤20 years), older secondary forests ('20 years and up to 100 years) and old-growth forests, and accounted for uncertainties in our estimates. In tropical rainforests, for which data availability was the highest, our ∆AGB rate estimates ranged from 3.4 (Asia) to 7.6 (Africa) Mg ha−1 year−1 in younger secondary forests, from 2.3 (North and South America) to 3.5 (Africa) Mg ha−1 year−1 in older secondary forests, and 0.7 (Asia) to 1.3 (Africa) Mg ha−1 year−1 in old-growth forests. We provide a rigorous and traceable refinement of the IPCC 2006 default rates in tropical and subtropical ecological zones, and identify which areas require more research on ∆AGB. In this respect, this study should be considered as an important step towards quantifying the role of tropical and subtropical forests as carbon sinks with higher accuracy; our new rates can be used for large-scale GHG accounting by governmental bodies, nongovernmental organizations and in scientific research. © 2019 The Authors.

Specifically, it analyses how domestic institutions serve parties in enforcing policy compromises onto national ministers negotiating legislation in the European Union (EU). In contrast to existing research on coalition politics, the model accounts for the benefits of not only legislative but also executive institutions and incorporates opposition parties as pivotal actors under minority governments. Ministers propose policy positions at the EU level that represent domestic coalition compromises when cabinet participation, executive coordination and parliamentary oversight of EU affairs make it cheap for coalition partners to challenge the minister's position and when ideological divisiveness increases the incentive to do so. Statistical analyses of 1,694 policy positions taken by ministers from 22 member states in the Council of the EU provide strong empirical evidence for the model. The results support the claim of executive dominance in EU policy making but also highlight that, where institutions are strong, ministers represent domestic coalition compromises rather than their own positions. © 2019 European Consortium for Political Research",coalition policy making; executive institutions; international level; parliamentary institutions; representation,

A comparative review shows large variation in the electoral trajectories of ostracized parties. We therefore propose a model of the context conditions that shape the repercussions of ostracism in public opinion. Under conditions that suggest substantial policy impact of an AIP were it to join a coalition government, ostracism should decrease the party’s electoral support. Vice versa, if context suggests strong “signaling” potential of an AIP if in opposition, ostracism should increase its support.

However, research has not univocally found this attenuating relation, suggesting it may not be universal, but rather contingent on other factors. This study investigates whether the relation between part-time work and work-life conflict is contingent on workplace support and gender. Results show that short part-time work (<25 h) relates to lower levels of work-life conflict for both women and men. We find some evidence that workplace support affects this relation: short part-time working women in an organization with a family supportive organizational culture had lower levels of work-life conflict than short part-time working women in organizations with an unsupportive organizational culture. For men working short part-time we find tendencies in the same direction, although this falls short of conventional statistical significance. In addition, long part-time work (25–35 h) is not significantly related to (lower) work-life conflict for either women or men. In line with previous research, managerial support is found to be linked to lower levels of work-life conflict, irrespective of whether one works full-time or part-time. Notably, the relation between working part-time and work-life conflict does not differ for mothers and fathers, suggesting that this work-family policy could help both men and women reduce work-life conflict. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Bayesian clustering produced three main genetic groups assigning all K. ivorensis and all K. senegalensis trees, respectively, in two different clusters and all remaining individuals in a third cluster. Genetic self-assignment tests with all 101 SNPs had success rates of 97–100% for all species except for K. nyasica and K. madagascariensis, which could not be clearly distinguished from each other. A success rate for species identification nearly as high was observed using a subset of 15 highly differentiated SNPs.

This allows to simultaneously run applications with different requirements on link characteristics and to increase resilience against interference. To this end, we first enable sub-GHz communication in TSCH, which has been primarily defined for the 2.4 GHz band. Thereafter, we propose two designs to support multiple physical layers in TSCH on the same nodes. Our experimental evaluation shows that TSCH is applicable in a wide range of data rates between 1.2 kbps and 1000 kbps. We find that data rates of 50 kbps and below have a long communication range and a nearly perfect link symmetry, but also have a 20x higher channel utilization compared to higher data rates, increasing the risk of collisions. Using these findings, we show the advantages of the multi-band support on the example of synchronization accuracy when exchanging TSCH beacons with a low data rate and application data at a high data rate. © 2019 IEEE.",IEEE 802.15.4; multi-band support; Sub-GHz communication; timeslot duration; TSCH,Computer networks; IEEE 802.15.4; Multi band; Sub-GHz; Time slots; TSCH; IEEE Standards

It remains unclear whether a passive visual stimulator could be used. Colors are an integral part of everyday life. We analyzed the potential use of both imagined colors and color exposure to control BCIs. We present here a comprehensive study of the feasibility of using the recognition of both exposed and imagined colors from the EEG signals recorded in a previous study. This constitutes the first step towards the development of a color-based BCI. We processed and analyzed the EEG signals from seven subjects recorded whilst they were exposed to three colors (red, green and blue) and whilst they imagined the same colors. The outcomes obtained suggest that the simultaneous use of these two tasks would facilitate the effective recognition of both imagined and displayed colors for the control of a BCI. An analysis of each task separately revealed that color exposure provided more information than color imagination for discriminating between the three colors. © 2019 IEEE.",Classification; Exposure color recognition; Imagined colors recognition,"Bioinformatics; Brain computer interface; Classification (of information); Color; Brain computer interfaces (BCIs); Color recognition; EEG signals; Exposed to; Imagined colors recognition; Integral part; Red , green and blues; Simultaneous use; Biomedical signal processing"

Despite theoretical benefits that have been widely agreed on, challenges have also been met in practice reflecting on issues about techniques, businesses, organizations, processes, and etc. It is not easy to understand the challenges from different perspectives and come up with an integrated solution. In this research, we reviewed nine scientific papers in which projects of applying EA in governments or public sectors in real scenario have been presented. We collected challenges reported in these projects and proposed to observe them by using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as a lens.

Whisper makes use of synchronous transmissions, a technique first introduced by the Glossy flooding protocol. In contrast to Glossy,Whisper does not let the radio switch from receive to transmit mode between messages. Instead, it makes nodes continuously transmit identical copies of the message and eliminates the gaps between subsequent transmissions. To this end, Whisper embeds the message to be flooded into a signaling packet that is composed of multiple packlets-where a packlet is a portion of the message payload that mimics the structure of an actual packet. A node must intercept only one of the packlets to detect that there is an ongoing transmission and that it should start forwarding the message. This allows Whisper to speed up the propagation of the flood and, thus, to reduce the overall radio-on time of the nodes. Our evaluation on the FlockLab testbed shows thatWhisper achieves comparable reliability but 2×lower radio-on time than Glossy. We further show that by embedding Whisper in an existing data collection application, we can more than double the lifetime of the network. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Consecutive packet transmissions; Energy-efficient sampling; Low-power wireless networks; Periodic and event-based traffic; Synchronous transmissions,Energy efficiency; Floods; Energy efficient; Event-based; Low power wireless networks; Packet transmissions; Synchronous transmission; Low power electronics

We argue that the European Parliament constitutes such a case and study issue competition on the radical right’s core issue: immigration. To establish the leverage of radical right members of the European Parliament (MEPs), we use an original data set of parliamentary questions and motions between 2004 and 2016.

A semi-analytical approach is proposed based on the Green’s second identity to obtain the CGF for diffusion in a secondary environment (the primary environment including a set of new boundaries). Employing the Green’s second identity, a linear integral equation for the CGF of diffusion in the secondary environment is obtained which can be transformed to a linear system of equations using the numerical method of moments.

However, lead-free materials lag lead-based piezo-composites in terms of performance, thus necessitating new design strategies to escalate piezoelectric response. Here, we build a modeling paradigm for improving the piezoelectric performance through improved matrices and optimal polycrystallinity in the piezoelectric inclusions. By incorporating carbon nanotubes in the matrix, we demonstrate 2–3 orders of improvement in the piezoelectric response, through simultaneous hardening of the matrix and improvement in its permittivity. By tuning the polycrystallinity of the piezoelectric inclusions, we show considerable improvements exceeding 50% in the piezo-response, compared to single crystal inclusions. We further analyze the influence of carbon nanotube agglomerations at supramolecular length scales, as well as vacancy defects in the nanotubes at the atomic level, on composite performance. Although nanomaterial agglomeration is conventionally considered undesirable, we show that, near nanotube percolation, clustering of nanotubes can lead to better matrix hardening and higher permittivities, leading to improvements exceeding 30% in the piezoelectric response compared to non-agglomerated architectures. We further demonstrate that although atomic vacancy defects in nanotubes effectively soften the matrix, this can be compensated by agglomeration of nanotubes at larger length-scales. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",3D printing; Agglomeration; Atomic defect; Carbon nanotube; Composite; Coupled problems; Finite element analysis; Lead-free piezoelectric; Multiscale design and homogenization; Network of contacts; Polycrystal; Smart materials,3D printers; Agglomeration; Atoms; Composite materials; Defects; Finite element method; Hardening; Intelligent materials; Permittivity; Piezoelectricity; Polycrystals; Single crystals; Solvents; Yarn; 3-D printing; Atomic defects; Coupled problems; Lead-free piezoelectrics; Multi-scale design; Carbon nanotubes

No significant broadening of azimuthal angular correlations is observed for forward-forward or forward-central dijets in p+Pb compared to pp collisions. For forward-forward jet pairs in the proton-going direction, the ratio of conditional yields in p+Pb collisions to those in pp collisions is suppressed by approximately 20%, with no significant dependence on the transverse momentum of the dijet system.

These drivers forcing widespread changes in rangeland ecosystem processes and vegetation dynamics create two-way interactions and feedback loops between biogeochemistry and vegetation composition. To support spatial simulation and forecasting in the global rangelands, the G-Range global rangelands model couples biogeochemical submodels from the CENTURY soil organic matter model with dynamic populations’ submodels for herbs, shrubs, and trees. Here is presented a model description for G-Range, including novel elements of G-Range and implementation of CENTURY code. An initial evaluation of G-Range at global and site scales follows. G-Range outputs for net primary productivity (NPP) and vegetation cover (herbs, shrubs, trees, bare ground) were evaluated against global MODIS layers at global and site scales, and aboveground and belowground NPP were compared with field data from globally distributed sites. Most model outputs evaluated were within the range of a priori benchmarks for tolerable absolute or relative error (two benchmarks per output, at two scales, for five outputs of NPP and vegetation cover). Trade-offs in model fit among variables, datasets, and scales indicated practical constraints on improving model fit with respect to the selected evaluation datasets, especially field NPP versus MODIS NPP. The relative effects of multiple drivers of rangeland vegetation change were the greatest sources of uncertainty in model outputs. G-Range is best suited to scenario analysis of large-scale and long-term impacts of climate, CO2, and management on rangeland ecosystem processes and vegetation, as well as ecosystem services, such as production of forage and browse and carbon sequestration. © 2019 The Authors",model description; net primary productivity; rangeland; simulation model; vegetation dynamics,biogeochemical cycle; carbon sequestration; ecological modeling; ecosystem service; MODIS; net primary production; rangeland; simulation; soil organic matter; vegetation cover; vegetation dynamics

Furthermore, the article theorizes and assesses specified scope conditions affecting socialization processes.

The survey revealed that inland valleys are largely devoid of ligneous species. Crop residues are mainly transferred from inland valley fields to feed cattle, burnt in situ by the farmers themselves or abandoned to wildfires or to pasture—not mulched. Crop diversification is not universal and is limited to rice and vegetables crops.

Innovations in remote sensing and forest monitoring provide ever-increasing levels of coverage, spatial and temporal detail, and accuracy. More global products and advanced open-source algorithms are becoming available. Still, these datasets and tools are not always consistent or complementary, and their suitability for local REDD+ performance assessments remains unclear. These assessments should, ideally, be free of any confounding factors, but performance estimates are affected by data uncertainties in unknown ways. Here, we analyse (1) differences in accuracy between datasets of forest cover change; (2) if and how combinations of datasets can increase accuracy; and we demonstrate (3) the effect of (not) doing accuracy assessments for REDD+ performance measurements. Our study covers five local REDD+ initiatives in four countries across the tropics. We compared accuracies of a readily available global forest cover change dataset and a locally modifiable open-source break detection algorithm. We applied human interpretation validation tools using Landsat Time Series data and high-resolution optical imagery. Next, we assessed whether and how combining different datasets can increase accuracies using several combination strategies. Finally, we demonstrated the consequences of using the input datasets for REDD+ performance assessments with and without considering their accuracies and uncertainties. Estimating the amount of deforestation using validation samples could substantially reduce uncertainty in REDD+ performance assessments. We found that the accuracies of the various data sources differ at site level, although on average neither one of the input products consistently excelled in accuracy. Using a combination of both products as stratification for area estimation and validated with a sample of high-resolution data seems promising. In these combined products, the expected trade-offs in accuracies across change classes (before, after, no change) and across accuracy types (user's and producer's accuracy) were negligible, so their use is advantageous over single-source datasets. More locally calibrated wall-to-wall products should be developed to make them more useful and applicable for REDD+ purposes. The direction and degree of REDD+ performance remained statistically uncertain, as CIs were overlapping in most cases for the deforestation estimates before and after the start of the REDD+ interventions. Given these uncertainties and inaccuracies and to increase the credibility of REDD+ it is advised to (1) be conservative in REDD+ accounting, and (2) not to rely on results from single currently available global data sources or tools without sample-based validation if results-based payments are intended to be made on this basis. © 2019 The Authors","Accuracy; Deforestation; Measurement, reporting and verification; Performance; REDD+; Uncertainty",

Purpose: We measure the lifetimes of two-quasiparticle states of the bands based on the 10+ states at 3296 and 3279 keV to investigate the shape change induced by the alignment of two protons or two neutrons in the h11/2 orbital. Methods: The recoil-distance Doppler shift method was used for the study of Nd136 studies, which was formed by the fusion reaction Sn120(Ne20,4n)Nd136, at Ebeam=85 MeV. Calculations were performed within the microscopic-macroscopic approach, based on the deformed Woods-Saxon single-particle potential and the Yukawa-plus-exponential macroscopic energy. Results: The lifetime of the 10+ state at 3279 keV of Nd136 was measured to be T1/210+=1.63(9) ns. The lifetimes of the 2+ state at 374 keV and of the 12+ state at 3686 keV of the ground band were also measured to be T1/22+=26.5(14) ps and T1/212+=22.5(14) ps. Conclusions: The measured lifetime of 10+ the state at 3279 keV together with other observables confirm the structure change in Nd136.

The measurements are compared to predictions of Monte Carlo generators and to measurements of inclusively selected jets. In pp collisions, a different jet fragmentation function in photon-tagged events from that in inclusive jet events arises from the difference in fragmentation between light quarks and gluons. The ratios of the fragmentation functions in Pb+Pb events to that in pp events are used to explore the parton color-charge dependence of jet quenching in the hot medium. In relatively peripheral collisions, fragmentation functions exhibit a similar modification pattern for photon-tagged and inclusive jets. However, photon-tagged jets are observed to have larger modifications than inclusive jets in central Pb+Pb events. © 2019 CERN.",,Charged particles; Colliding beam accelerators; Photons; Tellurium compounds; Charge dependence; Fragmentation functions; Isolated photons; Jet fragmentation; Large Hadron Collider; Monte Carlo generator; Particle fragmentation; Transverse momenta; Lead compounds

Decisions concerning the management of these production forests will be of major importance for Amazonian forests' fate. To date, no regional assessment of selective logging sustainability supports decision-making. Based on data from 3500 ha of forest inventory plots, our modelling results show that the average periodic harvests of 20 m3 ha-1 will not recover by the end of a standard 30 year cutting cycle. Timber recovery within a cutting cycle is enhanced by commercial acceptance of more species and with the adoption of longer cutting cycles and lower logging intensities. Recovery rates are faster in Western Amazonia than on the Guiana Shield. Our simulations suggest that regardless of cutting cycle duration and logging intensities, selectively logged forests are unlikely to meet timber demands over the long term as timber stocks are predicted to steadily decline. There is thus an urgent need to develop an integrated forest resource management policy that combines active management of production forests with the restoration of degraded and secondary forests for timber production. Without better management, reduced timber harvests and continued timber production declines are unavoidable. © 2019 The Author(s).

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overview of the reported birth prevalence of CHDs in liveborn MC twins with and without TTTS. Twelve studies were included in this review. Compared to the reference population, MC twins were 6.3 times more likely to be born with a CHD (59.3 per 1000 liveborn twins; relative risk (RR) 6.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.4–9.1), and TTTS twins had a 12-fold increased risk of having a CHD at birth (87.3 per 1000 live births; RR 12.4, 95% CI: 8.6–17.8). The increased incidence of CHDs can mainly be attributed to the risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (35/1000 TTTS twin live births vs. 0.5/1000 singleton live births).

We developed the empathy selection task, which uses free choices to assess the desire to empathize. Participants make a series of binary choices, selecting situations that lead them to engage in empathy or an alternative course of action. In each of 11 studies (N = 1,204) and a meta-analysis, we found a robust preference to avoid empathy, which was associated with perceptions of empathy as more effortful and aversive and less efficacious.

In particular we consider the setting in which individuals' perceptions of the game are influenced by their previous experiences and outcomes. Accordingly, we introduce a framework based on evolutionary games where individuals have the capacity to perceive their interactions in different ways. Starting from the narrative of social behaviors in a pub as an illustration, we first study the combination of the Prisoner's Dilemma and Harmony Game as two alternative perceptions of the same situation. Considering a selection of game pairs, our results show that the interplay between perception dynamics and game payoffs gives rise to nonlinear phenomena unexpected in each of the games separately, such as catastrophic phase transitions in the cooperation basin of attraction, Hopf bifurcations and cycles of cooperation and defection. Combining analytical techniques with multiagent simulations, we also show how introducing individual perceptions can cause nontrivial dynamical behaviors to emerge, which cannot be obtained by analyzing the system at a macroscopic level. Specifically, initial perception heterogeneities at the microscopic level can yield a polarization effect that is unpredictable at the macroscopic level. This framework opens the door to the exploration of new ways of understanding the link between the emergence of cooperation and individual preferences and perceptions, with potential applications beyond social interactions. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,"Game theory; Hopf bifurcation; Basin of attraction; Dynamical behaviors; Evolutionary games; Individual preference; Multi agent simulation; Non-linear phenomena; Polarization effect; Social interactions; Virtual reality; game; human; perception; prisoner dilemma; theoretical model; Game Theory; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Perception; Prisoner Dilemma"

Several methods of realized ΔGt estimation have been used in other studies, but none have been objectively evaluated in a plant breeding context. Stochastic simulations of 80 rice (Oryza sativa L.) breeding programs over 28 yr were done to generate data used to evaluate five methods of realized ΔGt estimation in terms of error, precision, efficiency, and correlation between true and predicted annual mean breeding values. Two indicators of ΔGt, the expected ΔGt, and the average number of equivalent complete generations (EqCg), were described and evaluated. At best, estimates of realized ΔGt were over or underestimated by 15 and 27% when considering all 28 yr and the past 15 yr of breeding, respectively. The best methods were the estimated breeding value, control population, and era trial methods. Among these, correlations between true and estimated ΔGt were at best 0.59, indicating that these methods cannot very accurately rank breeding programs in terms of realized ΔGt. The expected ΔGt and the average EqCg were shown to be useful indicators for determining if a nonzero genetic gain is expected. Determining which of the three best realized ΔGt estimation methods evaluated, if any, would be appropriate for any given breeding program should be done with careful consideration of the objectives, resources, seed stocks, and structure of the data available. © 2019 The Author(s).",,

Most of the existing mycoplasma vaccines are attenuated strains that have been empirically obtained by serial passages or by chemical mutagenesis. The recent development of synthetic biology approaches has opened the way for the engineering of live mycoplasma vaccines. Using these tools, the essential GTPase-encoding gene obg was modified directly on the Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri genome cloned in yeast, reproducing mutations suspected to induce a temperature-sensitive (TS+) phenotype. After transplantation of modified genomes into a recipient cell, the phenotype of the resulting M. mycoides subsp. capri mutants was characterized. Single-point obg mutations did not result in a strong TS+ phenotype in M. mycoides subsp. capri, but a clone presenting three obg mutations was shown to grow with difficulty at temperatures of ≥40°C. This particular mutant was then tested in a caprine septicemia model of M. mycoides subsp. capri infection. Five out of eight goats infected with the parental strain had to be euthanized, in contrast to one out of eight goats infected with the obg mutant, demonstrating an attenuation of virulence in the mutant. Moreover, the strain isolated from the euthanized animal in the group infected with the obg mutant was shown to carry a reversion in the obg gene associated with the loss of the TS+ phenotype. This study demonstrates the feasibility of building attenuated strains of mycoplasma that could contribute to the design of novel vaccines with improved safety. © 2019 Lartigue et al.",Attenuated strain; Genome engineering; Genome transplantation; GTPase Obg; Mycoplasma; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Temperature sensitivity; Vaccines,"bacterial DNA; bacterial protein; guanosine triphosphatase; animal; bacterial genome; blood; genetics; goat; microbiology; mutation; Mycoplasma mycoides; mycoplasmosis; pathogenicity; phenotype; procedures; synthetic biology; virulence; Animals; Bacterial Proteins; DNA, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Goats; GTP Phosphohydrolases; Mutation; Mycoplasma Infections; Mycoplasma mycoides; Phenotype; Synthetic Biology; Virulence"

As such, the topology of tree architecture links physical properties within a tree and influences the interaction of the tree with its environment. Prior work suggests the existence of general principles which govern tree architectural patterns across of species and bio-geographical regions. In particular, West, Brown and Enquist (WBE, 1997) and Savage et al. (2010) derive scaling exponents (branch radius scaling ratio α and branch length scaling ratio β) from symmetrical branch parameters and from these, an architecture-based metabolic scaling rate (θ) for the whole tree. With this key scaling exponent, the metabolism (e.g., number of leaves, respiration, etc.) of a whole tree, or potentially a group of trees, can be estimated allometrically. Until now, branch parameter values have been measured manually; either from standing live trees or from harvested trees. Such measurements are time consuming, labour intensive and susceptible to subjective errors. Remote sensing, and specifically terrestrial LiDAR (TLS), is a promising alternative, being objective, scalable, and able to collect large quantities of data without destructive sampling. In this paper, we calculated branch length, branch radius, and architecture-based metabolic rate scaling exponents by first using TLS to scan standing trees and then fitting quantitative structure models (TreeQSM) models to 3D point clouds from nine trees in a tropical forest in Guyana. To validate these TLS-derived scaling exponents, we compared them with exponents calculated from direct field measurements of all branches >10 cm at four scales: branch-level, cumulative branch order, tree-level and plot-level. We found a bias on the estimations of α and β exponents due to a bias on the reconstruction of the branching architecture. Although TreeQSM scaling exponents predicted similar θ as the manually measured exponents, this was due to the combination of α and β scaling exponents which were both biased. Also, the manually measured α and β scaling exponents diverged from the WBE's theoretical exponents suggesting that trees in tropical environments might not follow the predictions for the symmetrical branching geometry proposed by WBE. Our study provides an alternative method to estimate scaling exponents at both the branch- and tree-level in tropical forest trees without the need for destructive sampling. Although this approach is based on a limited sample of nine trees in Guyana, it can be implemented for large-scale plant scaling assessments. These new data might improve our current understanding of metabolic scaling without harvesting trees. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Architecture-based metabolic rate; Destructive harvesting; Quantitative structure models; Terrestrial LiDAR; WBE plant scaling exponent,3D modeling; Architecture; Harvesting; Metabolism; Optical radar; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Scaling laws; Seebeck effect; Surveying instruments; Tropics; Architectural pattern; Destructive sampling; Geometric structure; Metabolic rates; Quantitative structures; Scaling exponent; Terrestrial lidars; Tropical environments; Forestry; biogeographical region; estimation method; lidar; metabolism; plant architecture; reconstruction; three-dimensional modeling; tree; tropical environment; tropical forest; Data; Forestry; Guyana; Harvesting; Metabolism; Remote Sensing; Trees; Tropics; Guyana

Such an approach, although increasingly promoted, remains only loosely defined and requires further development in order to effectively integrate different interventions at landscape level. In particular, it is important to understand the possible interactions between different landscape interventions at local level—where they are intended to have effect—and the challenges associated with them. Inspired by the complexity of policy mix analysis, this article seeks to shed light on these interactions by analysing how different policies and measures for reducing deforestation and degradation have played out in a jurisdiction with wide-ranging actors and interventions aimed at shaping their behaviour. Focusing on smallholders, we examine the Sustainable Landscapes Pilot Programme in São Félix do Xingu, looking at how different policies interact—categorising interactions as “complementary,” “mutually reinforcing” (synergistic), “in conflict,” “interdependent,” and/or “redundant”—and explain how proponents of this pilot programme seek to integrate them. Most analysis is based on primary data collected through quantitative (i.e., random stratified sampling and surveys) and qualitative (i.e., observation and focus groups) methods.

Before this revisionist perspective can be believed, however, we need to observe the causal processes linking religious diversity and party system fragmentation. One of these is that religious diversity is negatively associated with the number of religious parties contesting elections. Using data counting the number of religious parties in elections around the world between 2011 and 2015, the analysis shows that religious diversity is negatively associated with the number of religious parties. In line with the revisionist perspective, these results suggest that religious diversity creates incentives for political cooperation that lead elites to cooperate across religious group lines in support of parties representing their shared political interests. © 2019, © 2019 McDougall Trust, London.",,

In this paper, a path planning algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed. This algorithm is able to perform natural and smooth maneuvers from source to destination while ensuring the safety of the autonomous robot and its surroundings. The optimization criteria consist of collision-free path length, travel time and energy consumption. Various test scenarios are used to test the success of the proposed method to generate feasible and optimal solutions. Simulation in Unity3D is used to illustrate and validate the proposed approach.

They are applicable for a novel type of application-specific processors based on predicate logic. These gates produce results equal to eight different types of logic operations which are suitable for artificial intelligence applications. To avoid the time-consuming program emulations of the above-mentioned logic in Boolean machines, the predicate signals are mapped to the inputs and outputs of the modified electronic gates. They fulfill logical operations with elementary predicate expressions in a parallel micro-level manner, where the time reduction and new logical functionalities are reached. Proposed gates are designed and verified by means of Intel (formerly Altera) field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board together with its commercially available computer-aided design tools.

Task-based programming model uses task abstractions to specify parallel tasks and schedules tasks onto processors at runtime. In order to increase the efficiency and get the highest performance, it is required to identify which runtime configuration is needed and how processor cores must be shared among tasks. Exploring design space for all possible scheduling and runtime options, especially for large input data, becomes infeasible and requires statistical modeling. Regression-based modeling determines the effects of multiple factors on a response variable, and makes predictions based on statistical analysis. In this work, we propose a regression-based modeling approach to predict the task-based program performance for different scheduling parameters with variable data size. We execute a set of task-based programs by varying the runtime parameters, and conduct a systematic measurement for influencing factors on execution time. Our approach uses executions with different configurations for a set of input data, and derives different regression models to predict execution time for larger input data. Our results show that regression models provide accurate predictions for validation inputs with mean error rate as low as 6.3%, and 14% on average among four task-based programs. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Performance prediction; regression; task-based programs,Computer systems programming; Forecasting; Input output programs; Parallel processing systems; Parallel programming; Regression analysis; Scheduling; Parallel programming model; Performance prediction; regression; Regression-based model; Run-time configuration; Scheduling parameters; Task-based; Task-based programming; Multicore programming

Here, we consider the dynamical and collisional evolution of the inner Solar system asteroids that join the Oort cloud. We compare the Oort cloud asteroid populations produced by migration scenarios based on the 'Nice' and 'Grand Tack' scenarios, as well as a null hypothesis where the planets have not migrated, to the detection of one such object, C/2014 S3 (PANSTARRS). Our simulations find that the discovery of C/2014 S3 (PANSTARRS) only has a > 1 per cent chance of occurring if the Oort cloud asteroids evolved on to Oort cloud orbits when the Solar system was 1 Myr old, as this early transfer to the Oort cloud is necessary to keep the amount of collisional evolution low. We argue that this only occurs when a giant (30m) planet orbits at 1 ∼ 2 au, and thus our results strongly favour a 'Grand Tack'-like migration having occurred early in the Solar system's history. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society",Asteroids: general; Comets: general; Minor planets; Oort cloud,

The experiment followed a 4 × 4 complete Latin Square design with four dietary treatments tested in four periods. Each period ran for 5 weeks with 3 weeks of adaptation and 2 weeks of sample collection; separated by 2 weeks of re-feeding. Steers were fed at 100%, 80%, 60%, and 40% of their metabolisable energy requirement for maintenance (MER, referred to as MER100, MER80, MER60, and MER40, respectively). Steers receiving MER80, MER60, and MER40 were only fed Rhodes grass hay. MER100 steers were offered Rhodes grass hay at 80% of their MER and cottonseed meal and sugarcane molasses at each 10% of MER. Mean daily dry matter intake differed between treatments (p < 0.001) and ranged between 2.1 kg/animal (SD 0.13) in MER40 and 4.5 kg/animal (SD 0.31) in MER100. Urinary N excretion and N balance did not differ between MER80, MER60, and MER40. According to contrast test, declining feed intake level from MER80 to MER40 reduced duodenal microbial crude protein flow (p < 0.001), but did not alter the EMPS (g microbial N/kg digestible organic matter intake). Yet, if scaled to N intake, EMPS increased (p < 0.049), whereas total N and faecal N excretions decreased linearly with declining intake level (p < 0.001 for both variables). At similar grass hay intake, duodenal microbial crude protein flow was 41% higher in MER100 than in MER80 steers (p < 0.001). In cattle offered poor-quality tropical forage below their MER, the very low EMPS and thus microbial protein supply aggravate the negative effects of low dietary nutrient and energy intakes in periods of feed shortage. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Maintenance requirement; nitrogen excretion; protein nutrition; purine derivatives; tropical ruminants,"bacterial protein; nitrogen; analysis; animal; animal food; bacterium; bottle feeding; bovine; diet; drug effect; energy metabolism; gene expression regulation; genetics; male; metabolism; physiology; randomization; standards; veterinary medicine; Animal Feed; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Bottle Feeding; Cattle; Diet; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Male; Nitrogen; Random Allocation"

In this context, the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women of Reproductive Age (MDD-W), validated as a proxy of micronutrient adequacy, does fill a gap. However, because it is a newly endorsed indicator, information on its linkages with other dimensions of food and nutrition security is still scarce. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate whether the MDD-W is related to household food insecurity and farm production diversity. Methods: A cross-sectional survey on a representative sample of 5046 women of reproductive age was conducted in the region of Kayes, Mali, in 2013. Dietary diversity was assessed through qualitative 24-h recall, and MDD-W was computed. MDD-W equaled 1 if the women consumed at least 5 different food groups and 0 otherwise. Food insecurity was measured using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale and the Household Hunger Scale (HHS), and a farm production diversity score (FPDS) was calculated based on a count of food crops/livestock groups produced. Logistic regressions were used to assess the relation between MDD-W and the indicators of household food security. Results: Only 27% of women reached the MDD-W. These women consumed animal source foods and/or vitamin A-rich vegetables and fruits more frequently than did other women. Women from extremely food insecure households (moderate to severe hunger according to the HHS) were less likely to reach the MDD-W (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.97). One more group in the FPDS increased the odds of attaining the MDD-W (OR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.18). Conclusion: In the rural region of Kayes, Mali, women's dietary diversity, as measured by the MDD-W, was associated with household-level food security indicators. © 2018, Tumilowicz et al.

Intracranial volume (ICV) and volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and putamen are smaller in people with ADHD compared with healthy individuals. The authors investigated the overlap between common genetic variation associated with ADHD risk and these brain volume measures to identify underlying biological processes contributing to the disorder. Methods: The authors combined genome-wide association results from the largest available studies of ADHD (N=55,374) and brain volumes (N=11,221-24,704), using a set of complementary methods to investigate overlap at the level of global common variant genetic architecture and at the single variant level. Results: Analyses revealed a significant negative genetic correlation between ADHD and ICV (r g =20.22). Meta-analysis of single variants revealed two significant loci of interest associated with both ADHD risk and ICV; four additional loci were identified for ADHD and volumes of the amygdala, caudate nucleus, and putamen. Exploratory gene-based and gene-set analyses in the ADHD-ICV meta-analytic data showed association with variation in neurite outgrowth-related genes. Conclusions: This is the first genome-wide study to show significant genetic overlap between brain volume measures and ADHD, both on the global and the single variant level. Variants linked to smaller ICV were associated with increased ADHD risk. These findings can help us develop new hypotheses about biological mechanisms by which brain structure alterations may be involved in ADHD disease etiology. © 2019 American Psychiatric Association.

The variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the ultraviolet and optical is usually at the few tens of per cent level over timescales of hours to weeks 1 . Recently, rare, more dramatic changes to the emission from accreting SMBHs have been observed, including tidal disruption events 2–5 , ‘changing look’ AGNs 6–9 and other extreme variability objects 10,11 . The physics behind the ‘re-ignition’, enhancement and ‘shut-down’ of accretion onto SMBHs is not entirely understood. Here we present a rapid increase in ultraviolet–optical emission in the centre of a nearby galaxy, marking the onset of sudden increased accretion onto a SMBH. The optical spectrum of this flare, dubbed AT 2017bgt, exhibits a mix of emission features. Some are typical of luminous, unobscured AGNs, but others are likely driven by Bowen fluorescence—robustly linked here with high-velocity gas in the vicinity of the accreting SMBH. The spectral features and increased ultraviolet flux show little evolution over a period of at least 14 months. This disfavours the tidal disruption of a star as their origin, and instead suggests a longer-term event of intensified accretion. Together with two other recently reported events with similar properties, we define a new class of SMBH-related flares. This has important implications for the classification of different types of enhanced accretion onto SMBHs. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,

This means that they generally operate in accordance with the principles endorsed by the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA). However, only a few of these organizations are successful in commercializing the agricultural produce of their members. In this study, we argue that growth-problems leading to commercial failure and organizational degeneration in these cooperatives can be attributed to a lack of managerial capital. Drawing on the literature and evidence from the field we set out key management solutions for counterbalancing cooperative principles in the context of rural Africa. These solutions were taught to the leaders and managers of 362 cooperatives at four training events held in Madagascar, Malawi and twice in Uganda. Using a production function for cognitive achievement and key informant interviews, we find that our training contributed to the adoption of the proposed solutions by some of the cooperatives.

Follow-up UV space spectroscopy of the Lyα region shows that all 10 have damped Lyα (DLA) absorption, corresponding to neutral hydrogen column densities in the range 2.4 × 1020 ≤ N(H I) ≤2.5 × 1021 atoms cm−2 and indicating that the gas is very optically thick and essentially neutral. The sample is a very small subset of systems compiled by searching the University of Pittsburgh catalogue of ≈30 000 intervening Mg II absorption line systems in SDSS quasar spectra up to DR7. We started by isolating ≈3000 that had strong Mg II absorption in the redshift interval 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5 in brighter background quasars. Of these, 36 exhibited significant absorption near Zn II. Space UV spectroscopy was then obtained for nine of these (25 per cent of the total), and a tenth system in a fainter quasar was found in the Hubble Space Telescope archives. The result is a representative sample of the highest Zn+ columns of gas within the DLA population. These Zn II-selected systems define the upper envelope of DLA metallicities near z = 1.2. They show a tight anti-correlation between N(H I) and [Zn/H], with the higher metallicity systems clearly exhibiting more depletion based on [Cr/Zn] values.

Expanded consortium efforts facilitating the discovery of additional susceptibility loci may capture unexplained familial risk. Methods: We conducted a GWAS in European descent CRC cases and control subjects using a discovery-replication design, followed by examination of novel findings in a multiethnic sample (cumulative n = 163 315). In the discovery stage (36 948 case subjects/30 864 control subjects), we identified genetic variants with a minor allele frequency of 1% or greater associated with risk of CRC using logistic regression followed by a fixed-effects inverse variance weighted meta-analysis. All novel independent variants reaching genome-wide statistical significance (two-sided P &lt; 5 × 10-8) were tested for replication in separate European ancestry samples (12 952 case subjects/48 383 control subjects). Next, we examined the generalizability of discovered variants in East Asians, African Americans, and Hispanics (12 085 case subjects/22 083 control subjects). Finally, we examined the contributions of novel risk variants to familial relative risk and examined the prediction capabilities of a polygenic risk score. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: The discovery GWAS identified 11 variants associated with CRC at P &lt; 5 × 10-8, of which nine (at 4q22.2/5p15.33/5p13.1/6p21.31/6p12.1/10q11.23/12q24.21/16q24.1/20q13.13) independently replicated at a P value of less than .05. Multiethnic follow-up supported the generalizability of discovery findings. These results demonstrated a 14.7% increase in familial relative risk explained by common risk alleles from 10.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.9% to 13.7%; known variants) to 11.9% (95% CI = 9.2% to 15.5%; known and novel variants). A polygenic risk score identified 4.3% of the population at an odds ratio for developing CRC of at least 2.0.

The straightforward solutions directly match decompressed data which multiply the data to be matched. The state-of-the-art works skip scanning some data in compressed segments, but still exist the redundant checking, which are not efficient enough. In this paper, we propose COmpression INspection (COIN) method for multi-pattern matching over compressed traffic. COIN does not recheck the patterns within compressed segment if it has been matched before, so as to further improve the performance of matching, we have collected real traffic data from Alexa top sites and performed the experiments. The evaluation results show that COIN achieves 20.3% and 17.0% in the average of improvement than the state-of-the-art approaches on the string and regular expression matching with real traffic and rule sets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Compressed traffic; Deep packet inspection; Multi-pattern matching; Regular expression matching,Computer system firewalls; Intrusion detection; Pattern matching; Web services; Data transferring; Deep packet inspection; Evaluation results; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multi-pattern matching; Packet inspection; Regular-expression matching; State-of-the-art approach; Inspection

A CARMA model consists of an environment in which a collective of components with attribute stores interact via unicast and broadcast communication, providing a rich modeling formalism. The semantics of a CARMA model are given by a continuous-time Markov chain which can be simulated using the CARMA Eclipse Plug-in. Furthermore, statistical model checking can be applied to the trajectories generated through simulation using the MultiVeStA tool.

In this paper we present an algorithm that adaptively runs a simulation experiment that focuses on finding areas of the response surface with a large gradient while also gathering an understanding of the entire surface.

Towards that aim, we present a detailed study of all isolated triplet systems (total of 315) taken from the 'SDSS-based catalogue of Isolated Triplets' (SIT). In addition, we compared our results with those obtained for a sample of triplets from the Local Supercluster, SDSS-triplets, Tully's catalogue, Wide (W) and Compact (K)-triplets. In addition, we performed the correlation between the dynamical parameters and the large-scale structure (LSS). Interestingly, we found that there is no correlation between both the mean projected separation for the triplet systems and the LSS and its dynamical parameters. Furthermore, we found that only 3 per cent of these systems can be considered as compact since the mean harmonic separation (rh) is more than 0.4 Mpc for 97 per cent of the population.

In order to study these internal fractures, the analyst tends to break the sample into pieces. However, this method creates additional mechanical stress and leads to a secondary crack where the point of origin will be difficult to analyze.

GridVoronoi augments the Voronoi Diagram with a virtual grid to promptly find out (in a geometric space) which Voronoi cell contains the query point. It consists of an off-line data pre-processing phase and an on-line query processing phase. In the off-line phase, the digital geographical space is partitioned with a Voronoi Diagram and a virtual grid, respectively. Next, for each square unit (i.e., grid cell), the corresponding Voronoi cells that contain or intersect with this square are derived and kept in a hashmap-like structure. In the on-line phase, for each real-time spatial NN query, the algorithm first identifies which virtual square(s) contain(s) this query; then looks up the hashmap structure to find the corresponding Voronoi cell(s) for this grid cell and the final result for the query. Overall, GridVoronoi significantly reduces the time complexity in finding spatial NN in 2D space, thus improves the efficiency of real-time spatial NN queries and Location Based Services. © 2013 IEEE.",Geospatial analysis; nearest neighbour methods; query processing; spatial databases,Cells; Computational geometry; Cytology; Data handling; Graphic methods; Nearest neighbor search; Query processing; Telecommunication services; Geometric space; Nearest neighbor queries; Nearest neighbour; Spatial indexes; Time complexity; Two Dimensional (2 D); Virtual grids; Voronoi diagrams; Location based services

For example, accuracy in the low-intensity tail is necessary in the design of FSO communication systems as it determines the probability of fade. Accuracy in the high-intensity portion of the tail is necessary for eye safety calculations and to prevent equipment damage. In this work, we evaluate PDF models considering the statistics of the fit to empirical data for point and distributed apertures for several values of Rytov variance. Based on p-values and level of significance, we compare the quality of the fit of common PDF models to empirical data.

Most of the porous media found in natural environments are laden with water, which might affect the confined hydrocarbons. To quantify the effect of hydration, we report here a combined quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study on the dynamics of propane confined in the 1.5 nm-wide micropores of MCM-41-S in the presence of water at 230 and 250 K. To eliminate the strong incoherent signal from water and emphasize the propane signal we have used heavy water (D2O). QENS data show two dynamically different populations of propane in MCM-41-S and suggest that the presence of water hinders the diffusion of propane. Weak elastic contributions to the QENS spectra suggest that only long-range translational motion of propane molecules contributes to the quasielastic broadening. MD simulations carried out using a model cylindrical silica pore of 1.6 nm diameter filled with water and propane agree with the experimental finding of water hindering the diffusion of propane. Further, the simulation results suggest that the slowing down of propane motions is a function of the water content within the pore and is stronger at higher water contents. At high water content, the structure and the dynamics, both translational and rotational, of propane are severely impacted. Simulation data suggest that the rotational motion of the propane molecule occurs on time scales much faster than those accessible with the QENS instrument used, and thus explain the weak elastic contribution to the QENS spectra measured in the experiments. This study shows the effects of hydration on the structure and dynamics of volatiles in porous media, which are of interest for fundamental understanding and applied studies of confined fluids.

We then use this theory to prove convergence for many different numerical schemes. In the nonlocal case most of the results are completely new. Our theory covers strongly degenerate Stefan problems, the full range of porous medium equations, and, for the first time for nonlocal problems, also fast diffusion equations. Examples of diffusion operators \frakL ς,μ are the (fractional) Laplacians Δ and - ( - Δ) α 2 for α \in (0, 2), discrete operators, and combinations. The observation that monotone finite difference operators are nonlocal Levy operators allows us to give a unified and compact nonlocal theory for both local and nonlocal linear and nonlinear diffusion equations. The theory includes stability, compactness, and convergence of the methods under minimal assumptions, including assumptions that lead to very irregular solutions. As a byproduct, we prove the new and general existence result announced in [F. del Teso, J. Endal, and E. R. Jakobsen, C. R. Math. Acad. Sci. Paris, 355 (2017), pp. 1154-1160].

Lack of attention to social equity can reinforce inequalities and undermine the potential index insurance holds as a tool for climate risk management that is also pro-poor. The aims of this article are to: (a) examine social equity concerns raised by index insurance in the context of climate risk management, (b) consider how greater attention can be paid to social equity in index insurance initiatives, and (c) reflect on the policy challenges raised by taking social equity into account as a mechanism for climate risk reduction. The article draws on learning from the CGIAR's Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and presents the cases of the Index Based Livelihoods Insurance (IBLI) and Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise Ltd. (ACRE) in East Africa. It proposes a framework for unpacking social equity related to equitable access, procedures, representation and distribution within index insurance schemes. The framework facilitates identification of opportunities for building outcomes that are more equitable, with greater potential for inclusion and fairer distribution of benefits related to index insurance. The article argues that systematically addressing social equity raises hard policy choices for index insurance initiatives without straightforward solutions. Attention to how benefits and burdens of index insurance are distributed, suggests the unpalatable truth for development policy that the poorest members of rural society can be excluded. Nevertheless, a focus on social equity—facilitated by the framework—opens up opportunities to ensure index insurance is linked to more socially just climate risk management. At the very least, it may prevent index insurance from generating greater inequality. Taking social equity into account, thus, shifts the focus from agricultural systems in transition per se to systems with potential to incorporate societal transformation through distributive justice.

To make the proceeds from their illegal activities look legitimate in the eyes of the rest of society they use complex and diverse money laundering techniques that takes advantage of poor policies and law loopholes. Current countermeasures taken by financial organizations are insufficient because they aim to comply in several cases on minimum base of the legal requirements. In this paper we argue that research in the area of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) is being hampered by the lack of available quality data sets. Classic computational controls such as thresholds and modern techniques such as machine learning can benefit from using synthetic data generation methods to target more accurately and efficiently suspicious transactions. The introduction of simulators of financial synthetic data generation for AML research has several benefits for the fight against this crime. In this paper we present also additional capabilities that we have identified and suggestions in how to define and implement a triple-helix cooperation model of interaction between academy, financial institutions and law enforcement agencies.

This article uses qualitative comparative analysis in order to find patterns of litigation victory and defeat by intersectional groups in their claims of violation of this provision. Our analyses show that intersectionalization, operating through a methodology particularly well suited to do so, was essential to render visible important patterns in the judicial arena. These patterns show the different outcomes of litigation by intersectional groups. In particular, Muslim women, whose cases frequently had a clear dimension of “claim intersectionality” related to religious clothing, systematically were defeated before the European Court of Human Rights. This contrasts with cases brought by male Muslims, a successful category of litigants, therefore emphasizing the importance of gender dimension when understanding cases on religious manifestation. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,

KELT-22Ab transits the moderately bright (V ∼ 11.1) Sun-like G2V star TYC 7518-468-1. The planet has an orbital period of days, a radius of , and a relatively large mass of . The star has , , K, (cgs), and [m/H] = ; thus other than its slightly super-solar metallicity, it appears to be a near-solar twin. Surprisingly, KELT-22A exhibits kinematics and a Galactic orbit that are somewhat atypical for thin-disk stars. Nevertheless, the star is rotating rapidly for its estimated age, and shows evidence of chromospheric activity. Imaging reveals a slightly fainter companion to KELT-22A that is likely bound, with a projected separation of 6″ (∼1400 au). In addition to the orbital motion caused by the transiting planet, we detect a possible linear trend in the radial velocity of KELT-22A, suggesting the presence of another relatively nearby body that is perhaps non-stellar. KELT-22Ab is highly irradiated (as a consequence of the small semimajor axis of ), and is mildly inflated. At such small separations, tidal forces become significant. The configuration of this system is optimal for measuring the rate of tidal dissipation within the host star. Our models predict that, due to tidal forces, the semimajor axis is decreasing rapidly, and KELT-22Ab is predicted to spiral into the star within the next Gyr. © 2019.

Generally, a software product is tested by executing a set of test cases, which can be performed manually or automatically. The number of test cases which are required to test a software product depends on several parameters such as the product type, size, and complexity. Executing all test cases with no particular order can lead to waste of time and resources. Test optimization can provide a partial solution for saving time and resources which can lead to the final software product being released earlier. In this regard, test case selection, prioritization, and scheduling can be considered as possible solutions for test optimization. Most of the companies do not provide direct support for ranking test cases on their own servers. In this paper, we introduce, apply, and evaluate sOrTES as our decision support system for manual integration of test scheduling. sOrTES is a Python-based supportive tool which schedules manual integration test cases which are written in a natural language text. The feasibility of sOrTES is studied by an empirical evaluation which has been performed on a railway use-case at Bombardier Transportation, Sweden. The empirical evaluation indicates that around 40 % of testing failure can be avoided by using the proposed execution schedules by sOrTES, which leads to an increase in the requirements coverage of up to 9.6%. © 2019 IEEE.",decision support systems; dependency; integration testing; manual testing; scheduler algorithm; Software testing; stochastic test scheduling; test optimization,Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Integration; Program debugging; Scheduling; Software testing; Stochastic systems; Testing; Bombardier Transportation; dependency; Empirical evaluations; Manual testing; Natural language text; Stochastic scheduling; Test optimization; Test scheduling; Integration testing

In a 2D map, the zero crossings form a set of zero-value contour lines, and they are dependent upon source parameters and data component. In this paper, we investigate the properties of the zero crossings in magnetic fields and their use in interpretation. We first derive analytic expressions for the zero contour lines of the fields produced by dipoles, and show that they are conic curves formed by the intersection of a characteristic cone with the observation plane. We define these zero contour lines as zero level curves and the cones zero level surfaces. The zero level curves contain the complete information about the source location and dipole direction, and can be used to estimate source depth and magnetization direction. As a result, zero level curves may offer a new means for quantitative interpretation of potential-field data. © 2018 SEG.",,Analytic expressions; Characteristic point; Complete information; Magnetization direction; Observation planes; Potential field datum; Quantitative interpretation; Source parameters; Contour measurement

We tested and applied a 32-multi-model ensemble to simulate global wheat yield and quality in a changing climate. Potential benefits of elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration by 2050 on global wheat grain and protein yield are likely to be negated by impacts from rising temperature and changes in rainfall, but with considerable disparities between regions. Grain and protein yields are expected to be lower and more variable in most low-rainfall regions, with nitrogen availability limiting growth stimulus from elevated CO 2 . Introducing genotypes adapted to warmer temperatures (and also considering changes in CO 2 and rainfall) could boost global wheat yield by 7% and protein yield by 2%, but grain protein concentration would be reduced by −1.1 percentage points, representing a relative change of −8.6%.

In contrast to this “seat-maximization” account, we focus on how PR affected party leaders’ control over nominations, thereby enabling them to discipline their followers and build more cohesive parties. We explore this “party-building” account in the case of Norway, using roll call data from six reform proposals in 1919. We show that leaders were more likely to vote in favor of PR than rank-and-file members, even controlling for the parties’ expected seat payoffs and the district-level socialist electoral threat facing individual legislators. Moreover, using within-legislator variation, we show that the internal cohesion of parties increased significantly after the introduction of PR. © The Author(s) 2018.",electoral reform; Europe; Norway; party cohesion; proportional representation,

The classical signal processing method named Prony has been used for estimating the parameters of measured signals such as frequency, damping factor and phasor. To reduce the impact of noise on the parameters estimated by Prony, multi-channel Prony has been previously explored and presented in the literature. The basic approach for multi-channel Prony is a generalized solution, in which new rows are added to matrices for every channel. Since the generalized multi-channel Prony is time-consuming, a new method based on recursive solution is proposed in this paper to make it suitable for real-Time application. Here, several channels of one Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) are used to estimate the phasor of current/voltage in a recursive pattern, in which the phasor is computed recursively over time based on previously calculated estimates and new measurements. The proposed method is compared with three other solutions for multi-channel Prony: A) data fusion which is based on the Kalman filter concept, b) an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and c) a consensus update approach which is based on an iterative procedure. Simulation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method for real-Time phasor estimation, both in terms of maintaining the accuracy and reducing computation time. © 2018 IEEE.",Multi-channel Prony; Phasor estimation; Prony algorithm; Recursive least square; Weighted least square,Data fusion; Electric power transmission networks; Iterative methods; Phasor measurement units; Signal processing; Smart power grids; Multi channel; Phasor estimation; Prony algorithm; Recursive least square (RLS); Weighted least squares; Parameter estimation

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of multiple exposures to macrocyclic GBCAs in children. Materials and methods This retrospective, single-center study included data from 43 patients who had received 4 injections of macrocyclic GBCAs during MRI examinations over performed over 8 to 84 months. Signal intensity was measured on unenhanced T1-weighted MRI, and globus pallidus to thalamus (GP/Th) and dentate nucleus to pons (DN/P) ratios were calculated. The differences in ratios were tested with the Student’s t-test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test. For categorical data, Pearson’s chi-squared test was used. Relationships were analyzed with the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Results Patients with the mean age of 7.5 years (SD = 4.2) received 8.19 (SD = 3.63) injections of GBCAs on average. Differences in GP/Th and DN/P ratios between the first and the last measurement were insignificant. Children before the end of myelination process (2 years of age) had the first GP/Th ratio values significantly lower than those >2 years of age (p = 0.0284), which than increased at the final scan and reached the level similar to values obtained in the group of >2 years of age. Conclusions Maturation of the brain may affect both signal intensity of brain structures and susceptibility to GBCAs; thus, assessment of signal intensity of the brain structures should be conducted taking into account the age of a child. © 2018 Olchowy et al.

Here, we present the b-values for intermediate-depth intraslab earthquakes in the Pacific slab beneath the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions, northeastern Japan and find a difference in the lower-plane event b-values in the double seismic zone. Lower-plane events reveal significantly larger b-values beneath Tohoku (0.96) than Hokkaido (0.86), implying that the brittle deformation beneath Hokkaido is more localized and leads to higher ratio of relatively large lower-plane events than occur beneath Tohoku. We also estimated the b-values for experimental earthquakes, and found they increase with increasing antigorite content in serpentinized peridotite. These experimental earthquakes already led to the “dehydration driven stress transfer” (DDST) model, which suggests that a highly hydrated peridotite is not required when oceanic mantle events occur. A comparison of experimental and natural earthquake b-values implies that lower-plane peridotite is more hydrated beneath the Tohoku region, which could also explain the difference in oceanic-plate velocity structures near the trench identified in Ocean Bottom Seismometer studies off Tohoku and Hokkaido. These results suggest that lower-plane events occur in fresh peridotite near serpentinized faults. © 2018, The Author(s).",,

The prevalence of political gender stereotypes has almost exclusively been investigated in the United States. As the presence of these stereotypes is highly dependent on contextual factors, we switch the context and investigate whether they are also present in a List-Proportional Representation (PR) system with a high share of women in parliament spread over different parties. The results of our experimental study, conducted in Flanders (Belgium), provide evidence for the existence of stereotypical patterns. The differences in perceived issue competence are, however, rather small and not always unequivocal, but larger differences were found in terms of ideological position. This leads us to conclude that misperceptions about women’s ideological orientation might be persistent and difficult to overcome. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the argument that female politicians are perceived as more leftist because they disproportionately belong to leftist parties does not hold, as female politicians are rather equally spread over the different parties in Belgium. © 2018 University of Utah.",gender; political psychology; political representation; public opinion; survey experiments,

We use a small image patch based combined feature method. Features include shape and color information and are extracted using histogram of oriented gradient and hue histogram methods. Dictionary learning based training is used to learn features and final feature vector is formed using sparse coding. For classification, we use patch image classification based on linear support vector machine and whole image thresholding. The proposed framework is evaluated using three public polyp databases. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme successfully classified polyps and normal images with over 95% of classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision.

However, the development of Zn-ion batteries is seriously impeded by a limited choice of positive electrodes. Herein, we report an electrochemical activated porous MoO2/Mo2N heterostructured nanobelts cathode. During the electrochemical activation, it is interesting to find that MoO2 grains in-situ generate in Mo2N matrix. The generated MoO2 grains can not only accommodate the intercalated zinc ions, leading to high reversible capacity, but also provide high electronic conductivity, thereby improving the rate capability. On the other hand, the Mo2N matrix could protect the MoO2 grains from structure degradation during cycling and keep stable in the slight acidic electrolyte. Based on the synergic effect of MoO2 and Mo2N, electrochemical activated MoO2/Mo2N heterostructured nanobelts exhibit a high reversible capacity of 113 mAh/g at high current density of 1 A/g for 1000 cycles, showing long-term cyclic stability (capacity retention is 78.8%) and remarkable rate capability. It is believed that the superior performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of integrated MoO2 grains and Mo2N nanobelt matrix.

At the local scale, we (i) characterized the temporal development of CWSB and explored associations with environmental and shade-related indicators. During two growing seasons and on 84 coffee plots, we recorded CWSB incidence/infestation and microclimate on an altitudinal gradient and different shading systems. The bimodal rainfall, altitude and shade affected CWSB development through their effect on minimum temperature. At the landscape level, we (ii) analyzed the spatial pattern of CWSB. Data on CWSB were collected on 180 plots. Pest incidence showed a spatial arrangement varying by districts. A possible relationship with human movement and the landscape context contributing to pest spread is suggested.

The research on the advancement of flood prediction models contributed to risk reduction, policy suggestion, minimization of the loss of human life, and reduction the property damage associated with floods. To mimic the complex mathematical expressions of physical processes of floods, during the past two decades, machine learning (ML) methods contributed highly in the advancement of prediction systems providing better performance and cost-effective solutions. Due to the vast benefits and potential of ML, its popularity dramatically increased among hydrologists. Researchers through introducing novel ML methods and hybridizing of the existing ones aim at discovering more accurate and efficient prediction models. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the state of the art of ML models in flood prediction and to give insight into the most suitable models. In this paper, the literature where ML models were benchmarked through a qualitative analysis of robustness, accuracy, effectiveness, and speed are particularly investigated to provide an extensive overview on the various ML algorithms used in the field. The performance comparison of ML models presents an in-depth understanding of the different techniques within the framework of a comprehensive evaluation and discussion. As a result, this paper introduces the most promising prediction methods for both long-term and short-term floods. Furthermore, the major trends in improving the quality of the flood prediction models are investigated. Among them, hybridization, data decomposition, algorithm ensemble, and model optimization are reported as the most effective strategies for the improvement of ML methods.

In this context, several software analytics tools have been developed in recent years. However, there is a lack of explainable software analytics that software practitioners trust. Aims: We aimed at creating a quality model (called Q-Rapids quality model) for actionable analytics in RSD, implementing it, and evaluating its understandability and relevance. Method: We performed workshops at four companies in order to determine relevant metrics as well as product and process factors. We also elicited how these metrics and factors are used and interpreted by practitioners when making decisions in RSD. We specified the Q-Rapids quality model by comparing and integrating the results of the four workshops. Then we implemented the Q-Rapids tool to support the usage of the Q-Rapids quality model as well as the gathering, integration, and analysis of the required data. Afterwards we installed the Q-Rapids tool in the four companies and performed semi-structured interviews with eight product owners to evaluate the understandability and relevance of the Q-Rapids quality model. Results: The participants of the evaluation perceived the metrics as well as the product and process factors of the Q-Rapids quality model as understandable. Also, they considered the Q-Rapids quality model relevant for identifying product and process deficiencies (e.g., blocking code situations).

Classical phasor estimation proposed many years ago, considers the phasor to be time independent which means constant amplitude and phase. However, the dynamic phasor concept introduced recently, improves the accuracy of the phasor estimation under a nonstationary signal as is typically the case of low frequency oscillations (LFO). However, more accurate estimates lead to higher computation time. To achieve both low computation time and more accurate estimates, an adaptive phasor estimation concept based on both static and dynamic phasors is proposed in this paper. A new method based on the Adaptive Prony algorithm is presented, in which the Static Prony is employed under steady state conditions and the Dynamic Prony under dynamic conditions. To switch between these two algorithms, a Cumulative Summation of the Phasor Estimation Error (CSPEE) is used. Simulation results show the applicability of the proposed method to achieve the most accurate estimates at the lowest computation time.

We find that the star has a mass of M/M o = 1.793 ±0.072, age t = 1.48 ±0.21 Gyr, and radius R/R o = 10.53 ±0.28. By analyzing the internal structure of the best-fitting model, we infer the evolutionary status of the star KIC 8263801 as being on the ascending part of the red-giant branch, and not on the RC. This result is verified using a purely asteroseismic diagnostic, the c - Δν c diagram which can distinguish red-giant branch stars from red-clump stars. Finally, by comparing its age with NGC 6866 (t = 0.65 0.1 Gyr), we conclude that KIC 8263801 is not a member of this open cluster. © 2018. The American Astronomical Society.

This search uses 36.1 fb−1 of data collected by the ATLAS detector in proton–proton collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of s=13 TeV at the LHC. The analysis is performed using requirements on the number of jets and the number of jets tagged as containing a b-hadron as well as a topological observable formed by the scalar sum of masses of large-radius jets in the event. No significant excess above the expected Standard Model background is observed. Limits are set on the production of gluinos in models with the R-parity-violating decays of either the gluino itself (direct decay) or the neutralino produced in the R-parity-conserving gluino decay (cascade decay). In the gluino cascade decay model, gluino masses below 1850 GeV are excluded for 1000 GeV neutralino mass. For the gluino direct decay model, the 95% confidence level upper limit on the cross section times branching ratio varies between 0.80 fb at mg˜=900 GeV and 0.011 fb at mg˜=1800 GeV. © 2018 The Author",,

The discretization of the ray trajectories in traditional ray-based CBET models does not account for the rapid variation in CBET gain as rays pass through caustics. We introduce a model that allows one to treat caustics much more accurately and greatly improves energy conservation.

The aim is to ensure fast and reliable broadcast without disturbing upstream communications (from SNs to BS), while taking into account constraints related to the energy harvesting (EH) environment. A new policy is proposed where from the one hand, the BS first selects the broadcast time-slots adaptively with the SNs schedules (to meet active periods that are constrained by EH conditions), and from the other hand, SNs adapt their schedules to enable optimal selection of the broadcast time-slots that minimizes the number of broadcasts per message and the latency. Compared to the existing solutions, this enables fast broadcast and eliminates the need of adding message overhead to the broadcast message. For this purpose, an analytical energy model, a Hidden Markov Model(HMM), Baum–Welch learning algorithm, and a heuristic algorithm of the minimum covering set problem (MCS) are proposed and combined in a unique solution. The proposed solution is analyzed and compared with a state-of-the-art approach. The results confirm that the former has the advantage of performing the broadcast operation more reliably and in lower delay. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Broadcast; Energy harvesting; Green communication; HMM; Wireless sensor networks,Broadcasting; Heuristic algorithms; Hidden Markov models; Learning algorithms; Sensor nodes; Solar energy; Wireless sensor networks; Adaptive learning; Broadcast messages; Broadcast operations; Green communications; Message broadcasts; Optimal selection; Reliable broadcast; State-of-the-art approach; Energy harvesting

Methane emissions peaked following dung application, whereas N2O and CO2 fluxes from dung patches were similar to fluxes from rangeland soils receiving no N additions. Greenhouse gas emissions scaled linearly with dung quantity during both seasons. Dung with a low (23) C/N ratio produced up to 10 times more CH4 than dung with a high (41) C/N ratio. Overall, CH4 emission factors (EFs) ranged from 0.001 to 0.042%, lower than those derived in temperate regions. Cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions were similar for all treatments across the different seasons. The N2O EF ranged from 0 to 0.01%, less than 1% of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 1 default EF (2%) for N2O emissions from dung and urine patches, likely because of the low dung N content (9.7–16.5 g N kg−1 dry matter). However, these results were consistent with the updated cattle dung EF (0.2%) developed for Kenya in 2016/2017 (EF database ID# 422665).

This paper investigates the evolution of such discs if they are very massive, as may be the case if their progenitor was a terrestrial planet, moon, or dwarf planet. Assuming the discs are physically thin and flat, like Saturn's rings, their evolution is governed by Poynting- Robertson drag or viscous spreading, where the disc's effective viscosity is due to self-gravity wakes. For discs with masses ≳ 1026 g, located in the outer parts of the tidal disruption zone, viscous spreading dominates the evolution, and mass is transported both in- and outwards. When outwards-spreading material flows beyond the Roche limit, it coagulates into new (minor) planets in a process analogous to the ongoing formation of moonlets at the outer edge of Saturn's rings. The newly formed bodies migrate outwards by exchanging angular momentum with the disc and coalesce into larger objects through mutual collisions. Eventually, the disc's Roche-limit overflow recycles tens of per cent of the original disc mass; most ends up in a single large body near 2:1 mean-motion resonance with the disc's outer edge. Hence, the recycling of a tidally disrupted super-Earth, for example, could yield an Earth-mass planet on a~10 h orbit, located in the habitable zone for 2-to-10-Gyr-old white dwarfs. The recycling process also creates a population of smaller bodies just outside the Roche limit, which may explain the minor planets recently postulated to orbit WD 1145+017. © 2018 The Author(s).",Accretion; Accretion discs; Planet-disc interactions; Planet-star interactions; Planets and satellites: formation; Stars: individual: WD 1145+017; White dwarfs,

The high phenotypic heterogeneity of C9orf72 patients includes a wide range in age of onset, modifiers of which are largely unknown. Age of onset could be influenced by environmental and genetic factors both of which may trigger DNA methylation changes at CpG sites. We tested the hypothesis that age of onset in C9orf72 patients is associated with some common single nucleotide polymorphisms causing a gain or loss of CpG sites and thus resulting in DNA methylation alterations. Combined analyses of epigenetic and genetic data have the advantage of detecting functional variants with reduced likelihood of false negative results due to excessive correction for multiple testing in genome-wide association studies. First, we estimated the association between age of onset in C9orf72 patients (n = 46) and the DNA methylation levels at all 7603 CpG sites available on the 450 k BeadChip that are mapped to common single nucleotide polymorphisms. This was followed by a genetic association study of the discovery (n = 144) and replication (n = 187) C9orf72 cohorts. We found that age of onset was reproducibly associated with polymorphisms within a 124.7 kb linkage disequilibrium block tagged by top-significant variation, rs9357140, and containing two overlapping genes (LOC101929163 and C6orf10). A meta-analysis of all 331 C9orf72 carriers revealed that every A-allele of rs9357140 reduced hazard by 30% (P = 0.0002); and the median age of onset in AA-carriers was 6 years later than GG-carriers. In addition, we investigated a cohort of C9orf72 negative patients (n = 2634) affected by frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and also found that the AA-genotype of rs9357140 was associated with a later age of onset (adjusted P = 0.007 for recessive model). Phenotype analyses detected significant association only in the largest subgroup of patients with frontotemporal dementia (n = 2142, adjusted P = 0.01 for recessive model). Gene expression studies of frontal cortex tissues from 25 autopsy cases affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis revealed that the G-allele of rs9357140 is associated with increased brain expression of LOC101929163 (a non-coding RNA) and HLA-DRB1 (involved in initiating immune responses), while the A-allele is associated with their reduced expression. Our findings suggest that carriers of the rs9357140 GG-genotype (linked to an earlier age of onset) might be more prone to be in a pro-inflammatory state (e.g. by microglia) than AA-carriers. Further, investigating the functional links within the C6orf10/LOC101929163/HLA-DRB1 pathway will be critical to better define age-dependent pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. © The Author(s) (2018).",age of onset; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; C9orf72; frontotemporal dementia; genetic association,"deoxyribonuclease I; guanine nucleotide exchange c6orf10; guanine nucleotide exchange C9orf72; guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HLA DRB1 antigen; unclassified drug; C9orf72 protein, human; guanine nucleotide exchange C9orf72; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Article; autopsy; DNA methylation; false negative result; frontotemporal dementia; gene expression; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic association; genetic association study; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; heredity; human; onset age; overlapping gene; priority journal; progressive nonfluent aphasia; semantic dementia; single nucleotide polymorphism; aged; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; CpG island; female; frontotemporal dementia; gene expression regulation; genetics; genotype; heterozygote; male; middle aged; onset age; Age of Onset; Aged; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; C9orf72 Protein; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Female; Frontotemporal Dementia; Gene Expression Regulation; Genotype; Heterozygote; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"

It argues that NGOs have managed to move questions about the use of force from the closed decision-making sphere of military commanders and arms control diplomats into open public debate. Thus NGOs have simultaneously desecuritised the use of force by states, securitised certain weapons technologies, and made human beings the referent object of security. This has marked a shift from state security and strategic disarmament to human security and humanitarian disarmament, without fundamentally challenging the laws of war. However, in contrast to realist views that only militarily useless weapons ever get banned and radical critical perspectives that see new legal regimes as legitimating war and US hegemony, I argue that NGOs have engaged in immanent critique of military arguments and practices based on prevailing principles of international humanitarian law. The resulting weapon ban treaties have both restrained US policy and undermined its legitimacy.

Abstract: Tree architecture is the three-dimensional arrangement of above ground parts of a tree. Ecologists hypothesize that the topology of tree branches represents optimized adaptations to tree’s environment. Thus, an accurate description of tree architecture leads to a better understanding of how form is driven by function. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has demonstrated its potential to characterize woody tree structure. However, most current TLS methods do not describe tree architecture. Here, we examined nine trees from a Guyanese tropical rainforest to evaluate the utility of TLS for measuring tree architecture. First, we scanned the trees and extracted individual tree point clouds. TreeQSM was used to reconstruct woody structure through 3D quantitative structure models (QSMs). From these QSMs, we calculated: (1) length and diameter of branches > 10 cm diameter, (2) branching order and (3) tree volume. To validate our method, we destructively harvested the trees and manually measured all branches over 10 cm (279). TreeQSM found and reconstructed 95% of the branches thicker than 30 cm. Comparing field and QSM data, QSM overestimated branch lengths thicker than 50 cm by 1% and underestimated diameter of branches between 20 and 60 cm by 8%. TreeQSM assigned the correct branching order in 99% of all cases and reconstructed 87% of branch lengths and 97% of tree volume. Although these results are based on nine trees, they validate a method that is an important step forward towards using tree architectural traits based on TLS and open up new possibilities to use QSMs for tree architecture. © 2018, The Author(s).",Destructive harvesting; Quantitative structure models; Terrestrial LiDAR; Tree architecture; Tree metrics,Architecture; Image reconstruction; Laser applications; Optical radar; Seebeck effect; Steel beams and girders; Surveying instruments; Three dimensional computer graphics; Tropics; Architectural traits; Individual tree; Quantitative structures; Terrestrial laser scanning; Terrestrial lidars; Tree architectures; Tree metrics; Tropical rain forest; Forestry; Branches; Diameter; Forestry; Models; Scanning; Trees; Tropics; Volume

We observe two sharp magnon resonances whose frequencies and amplitudes exhibit a discontinuity as a function of applied magnetic field, as well as two broader peaks at higher energy.

OBJECTIVE To examine the discriminative accuracy of [18F]flortaucipir for AD vs non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional study, 719 participantswere recruited from 3 dementia centers in South Korea, Sweden, and the United States between June 2014 and November 2017 (160 cognitively normal controls, 126 patients with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], of whom 65.9% were amyloid-β [Aβ] positive [ie, MCI due to AD], 179 patients with AD dementia, and 254 patients with various non-AD neurodegenerative disorders). EXPOSURES The index testwas the [18F]flortaucipir PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in 5 predefined regions of interest (ROIs). Cut points for tau positivitywere determined using the mean +2 SDs observed in controls and Youden Index for the contrastADdementia vs controls. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The reference standardwas the clinical diagnosis determined at the specialized memory centers. In the primary analysis, the discriminative accuracy (ie, sensitivity and specificity) of [18F]flortaucipir was examined for AD dementia vs all non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. In secondary analyses, the area under the curve (AUC) of [18F]flortaucipir SUVR was compared with 3 established magnetic resonance imaging measures (hippocampal volumes and AD signature and whole-brain cortical thickness), and sensitivity and specificity of [18F]flortaucipir in MCI due to AD vs non-AD neurodegenerative disorders were determined. RESULTS Among 719 participants, the overall mean (SD) age was 68.8 (9.2) years and 48.4% were male. The proportions of patients who were amyloid-β positive were 26.3%, 65.9%, 100%, and 23.8% among cognitively normal controls, patients with MCI, patients with AD dementia, and patients with non-AD neurodegenerative disorders, respectively. [18F]flortaucipir uptake in the medial-basal and lateral temporal cortex showed 89.9% (95% CI, 84.6%-93.9%) sensitivity and 90.6%(95%CI, 86.3%-93.9%) specificity using the threshold based on controls (SUVR, 1.34), and 96.8%(95%CI, 92.0%-99.1%) sensitivity and 87.9% (95%CI, 81.9%-92.4%) specificity using the Youden Index-derived cutoff (SUVR, 1.27) for distinguishing AD dementia from all non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. The AUCs for all 5 [18F]flortaucipir ROIs were higher (AUC range, 0.92-0.95) compared with the 3 volumetric MRI measures (AUC range, 0.63-0.75; all ROIs P < .001). Diagnostic performance of the 5 [18F]flortaucipir ROIs were lower in MCI due to AD (AUC range, 0.75-0.84). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with established diagnoses at a memory disorder clinic, [18F]flortaucipir PET was able to discriminate AD from other neurodegenerative diseases.

Baryons contribute to the mass distribution of galaxy clusters and the resulting mass estimates from lensing analysis. We use the cosmo-OWLS suite of hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the impact of baryonic processes on the bias and scatter of weak lensing mass estimates of clusters. These estimates are obtained by fitting NFW profiles to mock data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. In particular, we examine the difference in estimates between dark matter-only runs and those including various prescriptions for baryonic physics. We find no significant difference in themass bias when baryonic physics is included, though the overall mass estimates are suppressed when feedback from active galactic nucleus is included. For lowest-mass systems for which a reliable mass can be obtained (M200 ≈ 2 × 1014 M⊙), we find a bias of ≈ 10 per cent. The magnitude of the bias tends to decrease for higher mass clusters, consistent with no bias for the most massive clusters which have masses comparable to those found in the CLASH and HFF samples. For the lowest mass clusters, the mass bias is particularly sensitive to the fit radii and the limits placed on the concentration prior, rendering reliable mass estimates difficult. The scatter in mass estimates between the dark matter-only and the various baryonic runs is less than between different projections of individual clusters, highlighting the importance of triaxiality. © 2018 The Author(s).

Normative arguments suggest that debates enhance government accountability. Others warn of government bias, declining debate near elections, and parties avoiding Eurosceptic publics. Our conclusions are more differentiated. We argue that rank-and-file parliamentarians rather than leaders initiate debates. Political incentives guide their debate selection towards salient policies in the countries in which voters care most. However, where the motivation Eurosceptic publics provide and institutions facilitating rank-and-file agenda-setting are lacking, EU law-making and European Council priorities will raise little parliamentary attention. Analysis of original data, using a Bayesian and multilevel framework, lends credibility to our views. Claims of a government bias, election effects, or trends towards more debate are unlikely to hold in all countries. © The Author(s) 2018.",European Union; national parliaments; parliamentary debate; political parties,

The proposed approach, which is suited to an implementation on-board, exploits a complete 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) UAV model, which includes the coupled longitudinal/lateral dynamics and the impact of icing. The LPV formulation has the advantage of allowing the icing diagnosis scheme to be consistent with a wide range of operating conditions. The developed theory is supported by simulations illustrating the diagnosis of actuator faults and icing in a small UAV. The obtained results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Fault diagnosis; Icing diagnosis; Linear parameter varying (LPV) systems; Unknown input observers (UIOs); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),Actuators; Antennas; Failure analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Actuator fault; Discrete time; Ice accretion; Linear parameter varying; Linear parameter varying systems; Operating condition; Small UAV; Unknown input observer; Fault detection

In this paper, we investigate the prediction of the traffic generated by different mobile service classes over base station clusters, at an order-of-minute granularity and using relatively short historical data. This scenario is relevant to mobile edge computing (MEC), where resources need to be orchestrated for individual services separately across multiple base stations, at fairly long timescales. To address the prediction problem, we propose a novel forecasting model based on an autoregressive multiple-input single-output (MISO) approach, where the inputs are collected from regions exhibiting strong correlations in the offered load of a specific mobile service. Experiments on real-world data collected in an operational 3G/4G network demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which attains average relative errors between 0.4 % and 5 % when forecasting 5-minute-aggregate traffic of individual mobile service classes. © 2018 IEEE.",,Base stations; Forecasting; Accurate estimation; Autoregressive multiples; Average relative error; Forecasting modeling; Individual service; Mobile Edge Computing; Prediction problem; Strong correlation; Mobile telecommunication systems

In order to support ""real-time enterprise"" for software organizations and provide information transparency for diverse stakeholders, we integrate heterogeneous data sources about software analytics, such as static code analysis, testing results, issue tracking systems, network monitoring systems, etc. To deal with the heterogeneity of the underlying data sources, we follow an ontology-based data integration approach in this paper and define an ontology that captures the semantics of relevant data for software analytics. Furthermore, we focus on the integration of such data sources by proposing two approaches: a static and a dynamic one. We first discuss the current static approach with a predefined set of analytic views representing software quality factors and further envision how this process could be automated in order to dynamically build custom user analysis using a semi-automatic platform for managing the lifecycle of analytics infrastructures. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Measurements of voltage and current phasors are recorded by phasor measurement units (PMUs) installed across a wide area power system and time tagged at the point of measurement using a common time reference. Estimates of Phasor, Frequency and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) are duties of PMU in every installed bus. For this purpose, the Prony algorithm is one of the promising method since its phasor estimates are calculated adaptively based on estimated frequency. For fundamental phasor estimation, the Prony algorithm with the order of one is suitable but its performance in terms of accuracy is diminished when non-fundamental components interfere in the measured signal. These components can be eliminated from fundamental phasor estimates by increasing the Prony's model order. In order to specify adaptively the order of the Prony algorithm, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method is proposed in this paper to be combined with the Prony algorithm as EMD-Prony. The EMD decomposes a signal into finite Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) based on the number of modes in the measured signal. The number of IMFs is utilized by Prony to extend its model to higher order and so purifies the fundamental phasor estimates. In addition, EMD is also used as a pre-processor to filter the noise from the input signal of Prony. Finally, the proposed method can estimate phasors accurately under noisy and harmonic conditions. © 2018 IEEE.",,Monitoring; Power electronics; Real time systems; Signal processing; Common time reference; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Field of measurements; Intrinsic Mode functions; Phasor Measurement Unit (PMUs); Power system dynamics; Rate of change of frequencies; Wide area monitoring system; Phasor measurement units

Their implementation requires appropriate investment decisions by policy makers that are relevant for current as well as future scenarios of agro-ecology, climate and economic development. Decision support tools are therefore needed to assist different stakeholders to prioritize and hence implement appropriate strategic interventions. These interventions transform agriculture ecosystems to climate-resilient, adaptive and efficient. This paper outlines the mathematical modelling framework of one such, the Climate Smart Agricultural Prioritization (CSAP) toolkit. This toolkit employs a dynamic, spatially-explicit multi-objective optimization model to explore a range of agricultural growth pathways coupled with climate-adaptation strategies to meet agricultural development and environmental goals. The toolkit consists of three major components: (i) land evaluation including assessment of resource availability, land suitability, yield and input-output estimation for all promising crop production practices and technologies for key agro-ecological units; (ii) formulation of scenarios based on policy views and development plans; and (iii) land-use optimization in the form of linear programming models. Climate change and socio-economic drivers condition the land evaluation, technological input-output relations, and specification of optimization objectives that define modelled scenarios. By integrating detailed bottom-up biophysical, climate impact and agricultural-emissions models, CSAP is capable of supporting multi-objective analysis of agricultural production goals in relation to food self-sufficiency, incomes, employment and mitigation targets, thus supporting a wide range of analyses ranging from food security assessment to environmental impact assessment to preparation of climate smart development plans. © 2018 The Author(s)",Adaptation; Climate change; Climate-smart agriculture; Mitigation; Optimization; Prioritization,Climate models; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Food supply; Investments; Land use; Linear programming; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Adaptation; Environmental and economic impacts; Linear programming models; Mitigation; Multi-objective land use allocations; Multi-objective optimization models; Prioritization; Smart agricultures; Climate change; adaptive management; agricultural ecosystem; climate change; decision support system; innovation; land use; location-allocation model; mitigation; numerical model; optimization; prioritization; socioeconomic conditions; stakeholder; strategic approach

Haploinsufficiency has been proposed as one potential mechanism. However, insights if and how reduced C9orf72 proteins levels might contribute to disease pathogenesis are still limited because C9orf72 expression, localization and functions in the central nervous system (CNS) are uncertain, in part due to the poor specificity of currently available C9orf72 antibodies.Here, we generated and characterized novel knock-out validated monoclonal rat and mouse antibodies against C9orf72. We found that C9orf72 is a low abundant, cytoplasmic, highly soluble protein with the long 481 amino acid isoform being the predominant, if not exclusively, expressed protein isoform in mouse tissues and human brain. As consequence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion, C9orf72 protein levels in the cerebellum were reduced to 80% in our series of C9orf72 mutation carriers (n = 17) compared to controls (n = 26). However, no associations between cerebellar protein levels and clinical phenotypes were seen. Finally, by utilizing complementary immunohistochemical and biochemical approaches including analysis of human iPSC derived motor neurons, we identified C9orf72, in addition to its association to lysosomes, to be localized to the presynapses and able to interact with all members of the RAB3 protein family, suggestive of a role for C9orf72 in regulating synaptic vesicle functions by potentially acting as guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RAB3 proteins.In conclusion, our findings provide further evidence for haploinsufficiency as potential mechanism in C9orf72 pathogenesis by demonstrating reduced protein levels in C9orf72 mutation carriers and important novel insights into the physiological role of C9orf72 in the CNS. Moreover, the described novel monoclonal C9orf72 antibodies will be useful tools to further dissect the cellular and molecular functions of C9orf72.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; C9orf72; Frontotemporal dementia; Frontotemporal lobar degeneration; RAB3; Synaptic vesicles,"DNA binding protein; guanine nucleotide exchange C9orf72; monoclonal antibody; nerve protein; Rab protein; TDP-43 protein, human; aged; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; animal; brain; C57BL mouse; cell culture; cell fractionation; frontotemporal dementia; gene expression regulation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; human; immunology; induced pluripotent stem cell; knockout mouse; metabolism; middle aged; mutation; nerve ending; pathology; rat; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Brain; C9orf72 Protein; Cells, Cultured; DNA-Binding Proteins; Frontotemporal Dementia; Gene Expression Regulation; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Middle Aged; Mutation; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Presynaptic Terminals; rab3 GTP-Binding Proteins; Rats; Subcellular Fractions"

This is consistent with the Paris Declaration as well as SDG 5 on gender equality and women's empowerment. Critics have argued, however, that REDD+ design, both in policy and projects, does not take gender into account effectively, rather marginalizing women from decision making processes and exacerbating inequalities. Most of that research has been site specific or on single countries. This article uses data from a longitudinal study of subnational REDD+ initiatives in six countries to analyze their gendered impact on perceived wellbeing. Comparative research on subjective wellbeing was conducted at 62 villages participating in 16 REDD+ initiatives and 61 control villages at two periods in time, using a before-after-control-intervention (BACI) design. Focus groups with villagers (68% male) and women (100% female) permit a gendered comparison of definitions of wellbeing and outcomes of initiatives. The results highlight that while definitions of wellbeing overlapped between the two groups, almost half of the women's focus groups thought that having their own source of income was important. Outcomes regarding wellbeing change suggest that perceived wellbeing decreased in REDD+ villages both for villagers as a whole and for women, relative to control villages, but the decrease was much worse for women – a decrease that is significantly associated with living in a REDD+ village. These declines may be due to unrealized expectations for REDD+, combined with little attention to gender in REDD+ initiatives, in spite of an important portion (46%) of specific interventions that women view positively. These interventions provide insights into potential ways forward. Overall, however, REDD+ initiatives appear to be repeating past mistakes, with insufficient attention to gender equality and safeguarding women's rights. More effort needs to be paid to ensuring that gender is an integral part of future initiatives to combat climate change in rural communities. © 2018 The Author(s)",Climate change; Community forest management; Livelihoods; Mitigation; Tropical forests,climate change; community resource management; comparative study; deforestation; emission control; environmental degradation; forest management; gender role; livelihood; marginalization; mitigation; policy analysis; rural area; tropical forest; womens status

We explore differently treated data with various noise levels in linear polarization signals, from which structure and dynamics of the LPFs are studied. Physical properties of the detected LPFs are also obtained from the results of Stokes inversions. The number of LPFs and their sizes and polarization signals are found to be strongly dependent on the noise level and on the spatial resolution. While the linear polarization with a signal-to-noise ratio ≥ 4.5 covers about 26% of the entire area in the least noisy data in our study (with a noise level of 1.7 × 10 − 4 in the unit of Stokes I continuum), the detected (spatially resolved) LPFs cover about 10% of the area at any given time, with an occurrence rate on the order of 8 × 10 − 3s − 1 arcsec−2. The LPFs were found to be short lived (in the range of 30 – 300 s), relatively small structures (radii of ≈ 0.1 – 1.5 arcsec), highly inclined, posing hG fields, and they move with an average horizontal speed of 1.2 km s−1.

We also have performed spectroscopy on a smaller sample of previously known or suspected members to refine their spectral types and evidence of membership. We have classified 530 targets as members of Upper Sco, 377 of which lack previous spectroscopy. Our new compilation of all known members of the association contains 1631 objects. Although the census of Upper Sco has expanded significantly over the last decade, there remain hundreds of candidates that lack spectroscopy.

Using a multi-scale approach, we explore the relationship between farming diversity and food security and the diversification potential of African agriculture and its limits on the household and continental scale. On the household scale, we use agricultural surveys from more than 28,000 households located in 18 African countries. In a next step, we use the relationship between rainfall, rainfall variability, and farming diversity to determine the available diversification options for farmers on the continental scale. On the household scale, we show that households with greater farming diversity are more successful in meeting their consumption needs, but only up to a certain level of diversity per ha cropland and more often if food can be purchased from off-farm income or income from farm sales. More diverse farming systems can contribute to household food security; however, the relationship is influenced by other factors, for example, the market orientation of a household, livestock ownership, nonagricultural employment opportunities, and available land resources. On the continental scale, the greatest opportunities for diversification of food crops, cash crops, and livestock are located in areas with 500–1,000 mm annual rainfall and 17%–22% rainfall variability. Forty-three percent of the African cropland lacks these opportunities at present which may hamper the ability of agricultural systems to respond to climate change. While sustainable intensification practices that increase yields have received most attention to date, our study suggests that a shift in the research and policy paradigm toward agricultural diversification options may be necessary. © 2018 The Authors Global Change Biology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",coefficient of variation; crop production; farming diversity; food availability; livestock production,agricultural diversification; agricultural policy; agricultural research; alternative agriculture; climate change; climate effect; consumption behavior; crop production; food availability; food security; livestock farming; precipitation assessment; rainfall; Africa; Africa; agriculture; catering service; climate; human; procedures; statistics and numerical data; Africa; Agriculture; Climate; Food Supply; Humans

Investigating the relationships between users’ online and offline behaviors is critical for personalization and content caching, as well as improving urban planning. Although some studies have measured the spatial properties of online social relationships, there have been few in-depth investigations of the relationships between users’ online content browsing behaviors and their real-life locations. This paper provides the first insight into the geospatial properties of online content browsing behaviors from the perspectives of both geographical regions and individual users. We first analyze the online browsing patterns across geographical regions. Then, a multilayer-network-based model is presented to discover how inter-user distances affect the distributions of users with similar online browsing interests. Drawing upon results from a comprehensive study of users of three popular online content services in a metropolitan city in China, we achieve a broad understanding of the general and specific geospatial properties of users’ various preferences. Specifically, users with similar online browsing interests exhibit, to a large extent, strong geographic correlations, and different services exhibit distinct geospatial properties in terms of their usage patterns.

With accurate measurement, remote measurement technology offers the opportunity to augment health care by providing personalized, precise, and preemptive interventions that support insight into patterns of health-related behavior and self-management. However, for successful implementation, users need to be engaged in its use. Objective: Our objective was to systematically review the literature to update and extend the understanding of the key barriers to and facilitators of engagement with and use of remote measurement technology, to guide the development of future remote measurement technology resources. Methods: We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines involving original studies dating back to the last systematic review published in 2014. We included studies if they met the following entry criteria: Population (people using remote measurement technology approaches to aid management of health), intervention (remote measurement technology system), comparison group (no comparison group specified), outcomes (qualitative or quantitative evaluation of the barriers to and facilitators of engagement with this system), and study design (randomized controlled trials, feasibility studies, and observational studies). We searched 5 databases (MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) for articles published from January 2014 to May 2017. Articles were independently screened by 2 researchers. We extracted study characteristics and conducted a content analysis to define emerging themes to synthesize findings. Formal quality assessments were performed to address risk of bias. Results: A total of 33 studies met inclusion criteria, employing quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods designs. Studies were conducted in 10 countries, included male and female participants, with ages ranging from 8 to 95 years, and included both active and passive remote monitoring systems for a diverse range of physical and mental health conditions. However, they were relatively short and had small sample sizes, and reporting of usage statistics was inconsistent. Acceptability of remote measurement technology according to the average percentage of time used (64%-86.5%) and dropout rates (0%-44%) was variable. The barriers and facilitators from the content analysis related to health status, perceived utility and value, motivation, convenience and accessibility, and usability. Conclusions: The results of this review highlight gaps in the design of studies trialing remote measurement technology, including the use of quantitative assessment of usage and acceptability. Several processes that could facilitate engagement with this technology have been identified and may drive the development of more person-focused remote measurement technology. However, these factors need further testing through carefully designed experimental studies. © Sara Simblett, Ben Greer, Faith Matcham, Hannah Curtis, Ashley Polhemus, José Ferrão, Peter Gamble, Til Wykes.",Engagement; MHealth; Patient participation; Remote sensing technology; Review; Systematic review; Technology; Telemedicine,"adolescent; adult; aged; child; Cochrane Library; content analysis; controlled study; Embase; feasibility study; female; health status; human; human experiment; male; Medline; mental health; meta analysis; motivation; observational study; patient participation; practice guideline; quality control; quantitative analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); remote sensing; review; risk assessment; sample size; scientist; statistics; systematic review; telemedicine; Web of Science; clinical trial; middle aged; multicenter study; patient participation; procedures; prospective study; remote sensing; telemedicine; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Participation; Prospective Studies; Remote Sensing Technology; Telemedicine; Young Adult"

While MAVs have a large sensory gamut at their disposal; vision continues to dominate the external sensing scene, which has limited usability in scenarios that offer non-visual clues such as auditory. Therefore, we endeavor to provision a MAV auditory system (i.e., ears); and as part of this goal, our preliminary aim is to develop a robust acoustic localization system for detecting sound sources in the physical space of interest. However, devising this capability is extremely challenging due to strong ego-noise from the MAV propeller units, which is both wideband and non-stationary. It is well known that beamformers with large sensor arrays can overcome high noise levels; but in an attempt to cater to the platform (i.e., space, payload, and computation) constraints of a MAV, we propose DroneEARS: a binaural sensing system for geo-locating sound sources.

It sheds light on the challenges these multiple layers of actors and interests encounter around such alternatives in a subnational jurisdiction. Through transcript analysis of 93 interviews with institutional actors in the region of Madre de Dios, Peru, particularly with regard to five sites of land-use change, we identified the multiple actors who are included and excluded in the decision-making process and uncovered their complex interactions in forest and landscape governance and REDD+ arrangements. Madre de Dios is a useful case for studying complex land-use dynamics, as it is home to multiple natural resources, a large mix of actors and interests, and a regional government that has recently experienced the reverberations of decentralization. Findings indicate that multiple actors shaped REDD+ to some extent, but REDD+ and its advocates were unable to shape land-use dynamics or landscape governance, at least in the short term. In the absence of strong and effective regional regulation for sustainable land use alternatives and the high value of gold on the international market, illegal gold mining proved to be a more profitable land-use choice. Although REDD+ created a new space for multilevel actor interaction and communication and new alliances to emerge, the study questions the prevailing REDD+ discourse suggesting that better coordination and cooperation will lead to integrated landscape solutions. For REDD+ to be able to play a role in integrated landscape governance, greater attention needs to be paid to grassroots actors, power and authority over territory and underlying interests and incentives for land-use change. © 2018, The Author(s).",Decentralization; Integrated landscape governance; Land use and land-use change; Madre de Dios; Multi-level forest governance; REDD+,Decision making; Deforestation; Economic geology; International trade; Decentralization; Forest governance; Integrated landscape governance; Land-use change; Madre de dios; REDD; Land use; gold; bottom-up approach; complexity; decentralization; decision making; deforestation; environmental degradation; governance approach; land use change; landscape protection; questionnaire survey; top-down approach; Article; decentralization; decision making; deforestation; deforestation and forest degradation; forest management; government; land use; landscape; mining; natural resource; Peru; environmental protection; forest; government regulation; human; legislation and jurisprudence; politics; procedures; Madre de Dios; Peru; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Government Regulation; Humans; Mining; Peru; Politics

Bleed-Through severely impairs document readability and makes it difficult to decipher the contents. Digital image restoration techniques have been successfully employed to remove or significantly reduce this distortion. The main theme is to identify the bleedthrough pixels and estimate an appropriate replacement for them, in accordance to their surrounding. This paper proposes a two-step image restoration method, exploiting information from the recto and verso images. First, based on a non-stationary linear model of the two texts overlapped in the recto-verso pair, the bleed through pixels are identified. In the second step, a sparse representation based image inpainting technique, with a non-negative sparsity constraint, is used to find an appropriate replacement for the bleedthough pixels. Thanks to the power of dictionary learning and sparse image reconstruction methods, the natural texture of the background is well reproduced in the bleed-Through areas, and even a their possible overestimation is effectively corrected, so that the original appearance of the document is preserved. The experiments are conducted on the images of a popular database of ancient documents, and the results validate the performance of the proposed method compared to the state of the art. © 2018 IEEE.",Ancient document restoration; bleed-Through removal; image inpainting; sparse representation,Pixels; Restoration; Ancient documents; Bleed-through removals; Dictionary learning; Digital image restoration; Image Inpainting; Sparse representation; Sparsity constraints; State of the art; Image reconstruction

This study aims to show how trust towards online vendors, privacy, emotions and experience combine to predict consumers’ purchase intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Building on complexity theory, a conceptual model followed by research propositions is presented. The propositions are empirically validated through configurational analysis, using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on 182 customers with experience in personalized online shopping. Predictive validity analysis is also performed. Findings: Five solutions of trust, privacy, emotions and experience increase intention to purchase, and six solutions inhibit it. The findings verify the importance of trust and happiness in successful personalized online shopping. Their absence inhibits purchase intentions. Also, high experience may help to overcome low trust or negative emotions, whereas low experience requires the combination of high trust and happiness. None of the examined factors are indispensable to explain purchase intentions. Research limitations/implications: The study uses fsQCA, differentiating from traditional studies in the area that use variance-based methods and identifies multiple solutions explaining the same outcome. The proposed approach contributes to theory development in the field. Practical implications: The multiple solutions lead to new ways on how companies may approach their customers, as each one covers a specific part of the sample, adding to the fact that in personalized marketing there is not one single optimal solution explaining customer purchase intentions. Originality/value: This study contributes by extending existing knowledge on how trust, privacy, emotions and experience combine to increase or mitigate intention to purchase towards the development of new emotion-centric theories and the design and provision of personalized services and presenting a step-by-step methodological approach for how to apply fsQCA in e-commerce studies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Consumer behaviour; E-commerce; Emotions; Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA); Privacy; Trust,

It was evident from the literature that West Africa is vulnerable to climate change and variability, on account of its socio-economic and physical characteristics. As climate change and variability persists, the region's quest to use agriculture as the mainstream opportunity to deliver on set targets of the sustainable development goals will be strongly challenged without appropriate interventions. Adopting CSA seems to be a suitable strategy to achieving food security while also mitigating and adapting to climate-related risks. Among numerous CSA technologies, the review found (1) agroforestry (farmer-managed natural regenerations), soil and water conservation technologies (zai, half-moon, tie/contour ridges, conservation agriculture) and (3) climate information services as highly valued promising options for climate change adaptation and risk management in West Africa. In addition, institutional settings at the community, national and regional levels such as the establishment of multi-stakeholder innovation platforms, national science policy dialogue platforms on CSA in parts of West Africa and the formulation of the West Africa CSA Alliance were found to be crucial in promoting capacity development and awareness of CSA technologies and innovations in the region. The review found that CSA still faces a number of challenges, including: lack of clear conceptual understanding, limited enabling policy and financing. The prospects of CSA in West Africa hinge on the capacities of farming households and the region's national institutions to understand the environmental, economic and social challenges in the context of climate change, and consequently self-mobilize to develop and implement responsive policies at appropriate scales. © 2018 The Authors",Agroforestry; Climate information services; Institutions; Policies; Soil & water conservation,Agriculture; Food supply; Information services; Public policy; Risk management; Societies and institutions; Soil conservation; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Agroforestry; Climate change adaptation; Conceptual understanding; Conservation agricultures; Institutional setting; National institutions; Physical characteristics; Soil and water conservation; Climate change

Numerical simulations reveal that a DTP exists when the group effective refractive index (RI) difference between the even mode and the odd mode equals zero, where both ultrahigh positive RI sensitivities and negative RI sensitivities can be achieved. The position of the DTP is dependent on the coupler width, and it always exists over the surrounding RI (SRI) range of 1.333-1.41, which enables the ultrasensitive RI sensing in this wide RI range. Then, we studied the interference spectra characteristics around the DTP both theoretically and experimentally. We further experimentally demonstrate ultrahigh sensitivities of 59624 nm/refractive index unit (RIU) and -58470 nm/RIU around the SRI of 1.333 and 26999 nm/RIU and -29267 nm/RIU around the SRI of 1.35, respectively. High figure of merits of 4192 and 5280 are also achieved around the SRI of 1.333 and 1.35, respectively.

Most impacts of climate variability and change affect regions and jurisdictions in complex ways, and techniques for assessing this transmission of risk are still somewhat limited. Here, we begin to define new approaches to risk assessment that can account for transboundary and trans-sector risk transmission, by presenting: (i) a typology of risk transmission that distinguishes clearly the role of climate versus the role of the social and economic systems that distribute resources; (ii) a review of existing modelling, qualitative and systems-based methods of assessing risk and risk transmission; and (iii) case studies that examine risk transmission in human displacement, food, water and energy security. The case studies show that policies and institutions can attenuate risks significantly through cooperation that can be mutually beneficial to all parties. We conclude with some suggestions for assessment of complex risk transmission mechanisms: use of expert judgement; interactive scenario building; global systems science and big data; innovative use of climate and integrated assessment models; and methods to understand societal responses to climate risk. These approaches aim to inform both research and national-level risk assessment.

It is still elusive how monocytes transmigrate through the endothelial cell (EC) monolayer at atherosclerosis predilection sites. Platelets tethered to ultra-large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) multimers deposited on the luminal EC surface following CD40 ligand (CD154) stimulation may facilitate monocyte diapedesis. Human ECs grown in a parallel plate flow chamber for live-cell imaging or Transwell permeable supports for transmigration assay were exposed to fluid or orbital shear stress and CD154. Human isolated platelets and/or monocytes were superfused over or added on top of the EC monolayer. Plasma levels and activity of the ULVWF multimer-cleaving protease ADAMTS13 were compared between coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and controls and were verified by the bioassay. Two-photon intravital microscopy was performed to monitor CD154-dependent leukocyte recruitment in the cremaster microcirculation of ADAMTS13-deficient versus wild-type mice. CD154-induced ULVWF multimer-platelet string formation on the EC surface trapped monocytes and facilitated transmigration through the EC monolayer despite high shear stress. Twophoton intravital microscopy revealed CD154-induced ULVWF multimer- platelet string formation preferentially in venules, due to strong EC expression of CD40, causing prominent downstream leukocyte extravasation. Plasma ADAMTS13 abundance and activity were significantly reduced in CAD patients and strongly facilitated both ULVWF multimer-platelet string formation and monocyte trapping in vitro. Moderate ADAMTS13 deficiency in CAD patients augments CD154-mediated deposition of platelet-decorated ULVWF multimers on the luminal EC surface, reinforcing the trapping of circulating monocytes at atherosclerosis predilection sites and promoting their diapedesis. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

We expand this perspective by studying public opinion towards social investment compared to other welfare policies, exploiting new public opinion data from eight European countries. We identify three latent dimensions of welfare state preferences: ‘social investment’; ‘passive transfers’; and ‘workfare’ policies. We find that social investment is far more popular compared to the other two. Furthermore, we identify distinct supporting groups: passive transfer policies are most supported by low-income, low-educated people, by individuals leaning towards traditional social values and by those subscribing to left-wing economic attitudes. Social investment policies are supported by a broad coalition of individuals with higher educational backgrounds and left-libertarian views from all economic strata. Workfare policies are most popular with high-income individuals and those subscribing to economically conservative and traditional authoritarian values. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Multidimensional policy preferences; public opinion; social compensation; social investment; welfare state attitudes; welfare state reform,

We analyze and compare the extent to which the concept of measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) for REDD+ has become institutionalized in terms of new policy discourses, actors, resources, and rules in Indonesia, Peru, and Tanzania. To do so, we draw on discursive institutionalism and the policy arrangement approach. A qualitative scale that distinguishes between “shallow” institutionalization on the one end, and “deep” institutionalization on the other, is developed to structure the analysis and comparison. Results show that in all countries MRV has become institutionalized in new or revised aims, scope, and strategies for forest monitoring, and development of new agencies and mobilization of new actors and resources. New legislations to anchor forest monitoring in law and procedures to institutionalize the roles of the various agencies are being developed. Nevertheless, the extent to which MRV has been institutionalized varies across countries, with Indonesia experiencing “deep” institutionalization, Peru “shallow-intermediate” institutionalization, and Tanzania “intermediate-deep” institutionalization.

Replacement of traditional rice with less water crops such as maize under conservation agriculture (CA) based management (tillage, crop establishment and residue management) practices are required to promote sustainable intensification. Furthermore, inefficient nutrient management practices are responsible for low crop yields and nutrient use efficiencies in MW system. A 3-year field experiment was conducted in farmer's participatory strategic research mode at Taraori, Karnal, India to evaluate the effects of tillage and crop establishment (TCE) methods, residue management, mungbean integration, and nutrient management practices on crop yields, water productivity and profitability of MW system. The main plot treatments included four combinations of TCE, residue and mungbean integration [conventional tillage (CT), conventional tillage with mungbean (CT + MB), permanent bed (PB) and permanent bed with MB (PB + MB] with three nutrient management practices [farmer's fertilizer practice (FFP), recommended dose of fertilize (RDF) and site specific nutrient management (SSNM)] using Nutrient Expert® as sub plot treatments. System productivity, water use efficiency (WUE) and net returns under PB + MB were significantly increased by 28.2–30.7%, 27.8–31.0% and 36.8–40.5% compared to CT respectively, during three years of experimentation. Integration of MB in MW system contributed 24.9 and 27.6% increases in system productivity and net returns compared with no MB, respectively. SSNM based nutrient management increased the mean (averaged across 3 yrs) system productivity, WUE and net returns of MW system by 13.4%, 13.3% and 15.3% compared with FFP, respectively.

Unclear and conflicting tenure has been the main challenge faced by the proponents of subnational REDD+ initiatives, and accordingly, they have expended much effort to remedy the problem. This article assesses how well REDD+ has performed in laying an appropriate tenure foundation. Field research was carried out in two phases (2010–2012 and 2013–2014) in five countries (Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia) at 21 subnational initiatives, 141 villages (half targeted for REDD+ interventions), and 3,754 households. Three questions are posed: 1) What was the effect of REDD+ on perceived tenure insecurity of village residents?; 2) What are the main reasons for change in the level of tenure insecurity and security from Phase 1 to Phase 2 perceived by village residents in control and intervention villages?; and 3) How do intervention village residents evaluate the impact of tenure-related interventions on community well-being? Among the notable findings are that: 1) tenure insecurity decreases slightly across the whole sample of villages, but we only find that REDD+ significantly reduces tenure insecurity in Cameroon, while actually increasing insecurity of smallholder agricultural land tenure in Brazil at the household level; 2) among the main reported reasons for increasing tenure insecurity (where it occurs) are problems with outside companies, lack of title, and competition from neighboring villagers; and 3) views on the effect of REDD+ tenure-related interventions on community well-being lean towards the positive, including for interventions that restrain access to forest. Thus, while there is little evidence that REDD+ interventions have worsened smallholder tenure insecurity (as feared by critics), there is also little evidence that the proponents’ efforts to address tenure insecurity have produced results. Work on tenure remains an urgent priority for safeguarding local livelihoods as well as for reducing deforestation. This will require increased attention to participatory engagement, improved reward systems, tenure policy reform, integration of national and local efforts, and “business-as-usual” interests. © 2018 The Authors",Climate change; Deforestation; Forest; REDD+; Tenure; Tropical developing countries,deforestation; environmental policy; future prospect; policy implementation; policy reform; reforestation; smallholder; tenure system; Brazil; Cameroon; Indonesia; Peru; Tanzania

However, data on soil GHG emissions from smallholder coffee-dairy systems have not hitherto been measured experimentally. This study aimed to quantify soil GHG emissions at different spatial and temporal scales in smallholder coffee-dairy farms in Murang'a County, Central Kenya. GHG measurements were carried out for one year, comprising two cropping seasons, using vented static chambers and gas chromatography. Sixty rectangular frames were installed on two farms comprising the three main cropping systems found in the area: 1) coffee (Coffea arabica L.); 2) Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum); and 3) maize intercropped with beans (Zea mays and Phaseolus vulgaris). Within these fields, chambers were allocated on fertilised and unfertilised locations to capture spatial variability. Cumulative annual fluxes in coffee plots ranged from 1 to 1.9 kg N2O-N ha− 1, 6.5 to 7.6 Mg CO2-C ha− 1 and − 3.4 to − 2.2 kg CH4 -C ha− 1, with 66% to 94% of annual GHG fluxes occurring during rainy seasons. Across the farm plots, coffee received most of the N inputs and had 56% to 89% higher emissions of N2O than Napier grass, maize and beans. Within farm plots, two to six times higher emissions were found in fertilised hotspots – around the perimeter of coffee trees or within planted maize rows – than in unfertilised locations between trees, rows and planting holes. Background and induced soil N2O emissions from fertiliser and manure applications in the three cropping systems were lower than hypothesized from previous studies and empirical models. This study supplements methods and underlying data for the quantification of GHG emissions at multiple spatial and temporal scales in tropical, smallholder farming systems. Advances towards overcoming the dearth of data will facilitate the understanding of synergies and tradeoffs of climate-smart approaches for low emissions development. © 2018",Carbon dioxide; Hot moments; Hotspots; Methane; Mixed crop-livestock systems; Nitrous oxide,Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coffee; Fertilizers; Forestry; Gas chromatography; Gas emissions; Grain (agricultural product); Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Hot moments; Hotspots; Livestock systems; Manure applications; Nitrous oxide; Pennisetum purpureum; Spatial and temporal scale; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coffee; dairy farming; farming system; greenhouse gas; livestock; measurement method; methane; nitrous oxide; smallholder; Article; Coffea arabica; controlled study; cropping system; dairy industry; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; Kenya; limit of quantitation; maize; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; nonhuman; Pennisetum; Pennisetum purpureum; priority journal; seasonal variation; soil analysis; Kenya; Muranga; Coffea arabica; Pennisetum purpureum; Phaseolus vulgaris; Zea mays

The problem is to discover all (or almost all) associations among items in the transaction database that satisfy some user-specified constraints. Usually, the constraints are related to minimal support and minimal confidence. Class association rules (CARs) are a special type of association rules that can be applied for classification problem. Previous research showed that classification based on association rules has higher accuracy than can be achieved with an inductive learning algorithm or C4.5. As such, many methods have been proposed for mining CARs, although these use batch processing. However, datasets are often changed, with records added or/and deleted, and consequently updating CARs is a challenging problem. This paper proposes an efficient method for updating CARs when records are deleted. First, we use an MECR-tree to store nodes for the original dataset. The information in the nodes of this tree are updated based on the deleted records. Second, the concept of pre-large itemsets is used to avoid rescanning the original dataset. Finally, we propose an algorithm to efficiently update and generate CARs. We also analyze the time complexity to show the efficiency of our proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mining CARs from the dataset after record deletion. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Class association rules; Data mining; Record deletion; Updating rules,Association rules; Batch data processing; Dielectric materials; Forestry; Class association rules; Classification based on association rules; Inductive learning; Minimal supports; Record deletion; Transaction database; Updating rules; User-specified constraints; Data mining

I argue that post-accession compliance processes in this cluster are dominated by market-based modes of coordination, in which government ideologies and effectiveness gain greater explanatory power.

In this paper, we discuss the prospects for climate-smart agriculture technologies and enabling policies in dealing with climate change and variability at different sub-regional levels of sub-Saharan Africa to sustain farm productivity and livelihoods of agrarian communities. The review provides substantial information suggesting that without appropriate interventions, climate change and variability will affect agricultural yields, food security and add to the presently unaceptable levels of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. Although some of them were already existing, the past decades have seen the development and promotion of climate-smart agriculture innovations such as the use of high yielding drought tolerant crop varieties, climate information services, agricultural insurance, agroforestry, water harvesting techniques, integrated soil fertility management practices, etc. In the context of climate change, this appears as a stepping up approach to sustainably improving farm productivity, rural livelihoods and adaptive capacity of farmers and production systems while contributing to mitigation. The development of regional, sub-regional and national climate change policies and plans targeted at mitigating climate change and improving adaptive capacity of the African people have also been developed to enable mainstreaming of climate-smart agriculture into agricultural development plans. Financial commitments from governments and development agencies will be crucial for improving large scale adoption of climate-smart agriculture. © R.B.

Many policies debated in a British general election no longer apply at the subnational level, where separate devolved institutions control large areas of policy. This article therefore assesses the roles of national party manifestos at the subnational level in British general elections. It develops an original theory linking Strom’s alternative party goals to Ray’s typology of mandate/contract manifestos, advertisement manifestos and identity manifestos. It then explores a comparative overview of British parties’ general election manifestos at the subnational level, before focusing in detail on Labour’s 2010 and 2015 general election manifestos, which reflect the party’s strategic difficulties caused by devolution. The expected variation is found between the national and subnational manifestos. In some instances, multiple goals are pursued simultaneously and this is reflected in manifestos which assume elements of more than one manifesto ideal type. This supports the additional conclusion that manifestos can perform multiple functions in complex multilevel systems of government. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Britain; devolution; manifestos; Scotland; Wales,

We analysed their epidemiology and diversity using surveillance data from the NoroNet network. Methods: We included genetic sequences of norovirus specimens obtained from outbreak investigations and sporadic gastroenteritis cases between 2005 and 2016 in Europe, Asia, Oceania, and Africa. We genotyped norovirus sequences and analysed sequences that overlapped at open reading frame (ORF) 1 and ORF2. Additionally, we assessed the sampling date and country of origin of the first reported sequence to assess when and where novel drift variants originated. Findings: We analysed 16 635 norovirus sequences submitted between Jan 1, 2005, to Nov 17, 2016, of which 1372 (8·2%) sequences belonged to genotype GI, 15 256 (91·7%) to GII, and seven (<0·1%) to GIV.1. During this period, 26 different norovirus capsid genotypes circulated and 22 different recombinant genomes were found. GII.4 drift variants emerged with 2–3-year periodicity up to 2012, but not afterwards. Instead, the GII.4 Sydney capsid seems to persist through recombination, with a novel recombinant of GII.P16–GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant detected in 2014 in Germany (n=1) and the Netherlands (n=1), and again in 2016 in Japan (n=2), China (n=8), and the Netherlands (n=3). The novel GII.P17–GII.17, first reported in Asia in 2014, has circulated widely in Europe in 2015–16 (GII.P17 made up a highly variable proportion of all sequences in each country [median 11·3%, range 4·2–53·9], as did GII.17 [median 6·3%, range 0–44·5]). GII.4 viruses were more common in outbreaks in health-care settings (2239 [37·2%] of 6022 entries) compared with other genotypes (101 [12·5%] of 809 entries for GI and 263 [13·5%] of 1941 entries for GII non-GII.Pe–GII.4 or GII.P4–GII.4). Interpretation: Continuous changes in the global norovirus genetic diversity highlight the need for sustained global norovirus surveillance, including assessment of possible immune escape and evolution by recombination, to provide a full overview of norovirus epidemiology for future vaccine policy decisions.

However, the electron motion generates heat through ohmic losses. Although this heat is desirable for some applications such as photo-thermal therapy, it is a disadvantage in plasmonic devices for sensing and information technology 13 and has led to a widespread view that plasmonics is too lossy to be practical. Here we demonstrate that the ohmic losses can be bypassed by using 'resonant switching'. In the proposed approach, light is coupled to the lossy surface plasmon polaritons only in the device's off state (in resonance) in which attenuation is desired, to ensure large extinction ratios between the on and off states and allow subpicosecond switching. In the on state (out of resonance), destructive interference prevents the light from coupling to the lossy plasmonic section of a device. To validate the approach, we fabricated a plasmonic electro-optic ring modulator. The experiments confirm that low on-chip optical losses, operation at over 100 gigahertz, good energy efficiency, low thermal drift and a compact footprint can be combined in a single device. Our result illustrates that plasmonics has the potential to enable fast, compact on-chip sensing and communications technologies. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",,electrical method; electromagnetic field; electron; energy efficiency; information technology; instrumentation; nanotechnology; operations technology; amplitude modulation; Article; attenuation; heat sensitivity; light; low loss plasmon assisted electro optic modulator; priority journal; reproducibility; surface plasmon resonance; thermostability

This tutorial comprises two parts. The first introductory part will briefly explain the background, process, and tools available for combinatorial testing, including illustrations based on industry’s experience with the method. The main part, explains combinatorial testing-based techniques for effective security testing of software components and large-scale software systems. It will develop quality assurance and effective re-verification for security testing of web applications and security testing of operating systems. It will further address how combinatorial testing can be applied to ensure proper error-handling of network security protocols and provide the theoretical guarantees for trigerring Trojans injected in cryptographic hardware. Procedures and techniques, as well as workarounds will be presented and captured as guidelines for a broader audience. The tutorial is concluded with our vision for combinatorial security testing together with some current open research problems. The tutorial is designed for participants with a solid IT security background but will not assume any prior knowledge on combinatorial security testing.

In each case, an understanding of the significance of the polarization signal requires well-calibrated physical models of dust grains. Despite decades of progress in theory and observation, polarized dust models remain largely underconstrained. During its 2012 flight, the balloon-borne telescope BLASTPol obtained simultaneous broadband polarimetric maps of a translucent molecular cloud at 250, 350, and 500 μm. Combining these data with polarimetry from the Planck 850 μm band, we have produced a submillimeter polarization spectrum, the first for a cloud of this type. We find the polarization degree to be largely constant across the four bands. This result introduces a new observable with the potential to place strong empirical constraints on ISM dust polarization models in a previously inaccessible density regime. Compared to models by Draine & Fraisse, our result disfavors two of their models for which all polarization arises due only to aligned silicate grains. By creating simple models for polarized emission in a translucent cloud, we verify that extinction within the cloud should have only a small effect on the polarization spectrum shape, compared to the diffuse ISM. Thus, we expect the measured polarization spectrum to be a valid check on diffuse ISM dust models. The general flatness of the observed polarization spectrum suggests a challenge to models where temperature and alignment degree are strongly correlated across major dust components. © 2018.

This research fills a knowledge gap about the viability and dissimilarities of using these technologies for measuring the top of canopy structure in tropical forests. In an empirical study with data acquired in a Guyanese tropical forest, we assessed the differences between top of canopy models (TCMs) derived from TLS measurements and from UAV imagery, processed using structure from motion. Firstly, canopy gaps lead to differences in TCMs derived from TLS and UAVs. UAV TCMs overestimate canopy height in gap areas and often fail to represent smaller gaps altogether. Secondly, it was demonstrated that forest change caused by logging can be detected by both TLS and UAV TCMs, although it is better depicted by the TLS. Thirdly, this research shows that both TLS and UAV TCMs are sensitive to the small variations in sensor positions during data collection. TCMs rendered from UAV data acquired over the same area at different moments are more similar (RMSE 0.11–0.63 m for tree height, and 0.14–3.05 m for gap areas) than those rendered from TLS data (RMSE 0.21–1.21 m for trees, and 1.02–2.48 m for gaps). This study provides support for a more informed decision for choosing between TLS and UAV TCMs to assess top of canopy in a tropical forest by advancing our understanding on: (i) how these technologies capture the top of the canopy, (ii) why their ability to reproduce the same model varies over repeated surveying sessions and (iii) general considerations such as the area coverage, costs, fieldwork time and processing requirements needed. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Territory, Politics, Governance. Focusing on Europe, this paper analyses diplomacy as an uneven transnational field. The field is uneven not only along the predictable lines of big and small states, but also along the lines of wealth and tradition that are customarily overlooked in diplomatic studies. The political economy of European diplomacy cannot be read off the map of states without considering cross-national patterns of economic and symbolic capital. The field is transnational in the sense that national, international and supranational elements blend in daily practice to create qualitatively new forms of diplomatic knowledge production. By analysing such uneven transnationalism, the paper brings greater empirical and conceptual specificity to our understanding of bureaucratic knowledge production. The empirical material focuses on diplomatic training. It is drawn from web-based sources and over 100 interviews with the professionals of diplomacy in Brussels and five national capitals. This ‘peopled’ lens enables a high-resolution analysis of diplomatic practice and thereby illuminates socio-spatial patterns that remain invisible in traditional state-based accounts. By unpacking in concrete terms what the oft-used phrase ‘beyond the state’ means in diplomatic training, the paper advances the study of bureaucratic knowledge production in geography and cognate fields. © 2016 Regional Studies Association.",bureaucratic fields; diplomacy; European Union; organizations; policy; transnational networks,

Combining PRS and environmental risk factors will improve risk prediction; however, integrating PRS into risk prediction models requires evaluation of their joint association with known environmental risk factors. Methods: Analyses were based on data from 20 studies; datasets analysed ranged from 3453 to 23 104 invasive breast cancer cases and similar numbers of controls, depending on the analysed environmental risk factor. We evaluated joint associations of a 77-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) PRS with reproductive history, alcohol consumption, menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), height and body mass index (BMI). We tested the null hypothesis of multiplicative joint associations for PRS and each of the environmental factors, and performed global and tail-based goodness-of-fit tests in logistic regression models. The outcomes were breast cancer overall and by estrogen receptor (ER) status. Results: The strongest evidence for a non-multiplicative joint associations with the 77-SNP PRS was for alcohol consumption (P-interaction=0.009), adult height (P-interaction=0.025) and current use of combined MHT (P-interaction=0.038) in ER-positive disease. Risk associations for these factors by percentiles of PRS did not follow a clear dose-response. In addition, global and tail-based goodness of fit tests showed little evidence for departures from a multiplicative risk model, with alcohol consumption showing the strongest evidence for ER-positive disease (P=0.013 for global and 0.18 for tail-based tests). Conclusions: The combined effects of the 77-SNP PRS and environmental risk factors for breast cancer are generally well described by a multiplicative model. Larger studies are required to confirm possible departures from the multiplicative model for individual risk factors, and assess models specific for ER-negative disease. © 2018, International Journal of Epidemiology.",Breast cancer; Epidemiology; Gene-environment interactions; Genetic susceptibility; Risk prediction,"alcohol; estrogen receptor; alcohol; body mass; cancer; environmental risk; health risk; hormone; polymorphism; prediction; regression analysis; risk factor; alcohol consumption; Article; body height; body mass; breast cancer; environmental factor; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; hormonal therapy; human; medical society; menopause; polygenic risk score; priority journal; reproductive history; scoring system; single nucleotide polymorphism; adult; aged; breast tumor; case control study; clinical trial; Europe; female; genetic predisposition; genetics; genotype environment interaction; middle aged; multicenter study; risk assessment; risk factor; statistical model; Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Case-Control Studies; Europe; Female; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Logistic Models; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors"

Much scholarship on food systems governance is non-empirical, while existing empirical research is often case study-based and theoretically and methodologically incommensurable. This complicates aggregation of evidence and generalization. This paper presents a review of literature to identify a core set of methodological indicators to study food systems governance in future research. Indicators were identified from literature gathered through a structured consultation and sampling from recent systematic reviews and were classified according to governance levels and the food system activity domain they investigate. We found a concentration of indicators in food production at local to national levels and with less literature investigating how food governance affects food distribution and consumption. Many indicators of institutional structure were found, while indicators capturing social agency and indicators of cross-scale dynamics were moderately represented but critical perspectives on governance were lacking. These gaps present an opportunity for future empirical research to investigate more comprehensively the diverse components of food systems and how governance arrangements at different scales affect them. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature and International Society for Plant Pathology.",Evidence synthesis; Food security; Food systems; Governance; Research methods; Socio-ecological change,food production; food security; food supply; governance approach; institutional framework; literature review; research method; social change

Abstracting audit data provides a solution to improve the efficiency of data processing in intrusion detection. Data abstraction refers to abstract or extract the most relevant information from the massive dataset. In this work, we propose three strategies of data abstraction, namely, exemplar extraction, attribute selection and attribute abstraction. We first propose an effective method called exemplar extraction to extract representative subsets from the original massive data prior to building the detection models. Two clustering algorithms, Affinity Propagation (AP) and traditional k-means, are employed to find the exemplars from the audit data. k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for the detection. We then employ another two strategies, attribute selection and attribute extraction, to abstract audit data for anomaly intrusion detection. Two http streams collected from a real computing environment as well as the KDD'99 benchmark data set are used to validate these three strategies of data abstraction. The comprehensive experimental results show that while all the three strategies improve the detection efficiency, the AP-based exemplar extraction achieves the best performance of data abstraction. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Anomaly detection; Computer security; Data reduction; Intrusion detection,Abstracting; Big data; Clustering algorithms; Data reduction; Efficiency; Extraction; Metadata; Nearest neighbor search; Principal component analysis; Security of data; Support vector machines; Affinity propagation; Anomaly detection; Anomaly intrusion detection; Attribute extraction; Computing environments; Detection efficiency; One-class support vector machine; Real time performance; Intrusion detection

We carried out a genome-wide association study comparing 20,806 ALS cases and 59,804 controls. Independently, we performed a rare variant burden analysis comparing 1,138 index familial ALS cases and 19,494 controls. Through both approaches, we identified kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) as a novel gene associated with ALS. Interestingly, mutations predominantly in the N-terminal motor domain of KIF5A are causative for two neurodegenerative diseases: hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG10) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 (CMT2). In contrast, ALS-associated mutations are primarily located at the C-terminal cargo-binding tail domain and patients harboring loss-of-function mutations displayed an extended survival relative to typical ALS cases. Taken together, these results broaden the phenotype spectrum resulting from mutations in KIF5A and strengthen the role of cytoskeletal defects in the pathogenesis of ALS. Using a large-scale genome-wide association study and exome sequencing, we identified KIF5A as a novel gene associated with ALS. Our data broaden the phenotype resulting from mutations in KIF5A and highlight the importance of cytoskeletal defects in the pathogenesis of ALS. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",ALS; axonal transport; cargo; GWAS; KIF5A; WES; WGS,"adult; aged; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; controlled study; female; gene; gene identification; genetic analysis; genome-wide association study; hereditary motor sensory neuropathy; human; KIF5A gene; major clinical study; male; missense mutation; phenotype; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; survival; amino acid sequence; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; cohort analysis; genetics; loss of function mutation; middle aged; procedures; very elderly; young adult; KIF5A protein, human; kinesin; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Amino Acid Sequence; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Cohort Studies; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Kinesin; Loss of Function Mutation; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult"

However, the physical mechanisms for this improved behavior are not understood. Here, the thermally induced structural evolution of a-C:H:Si:O was investigated in situ by X-ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopy, as well as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The spectroscopy results indicate that upon high vacuum annealing, two thermally activated processes with a Gaussian distribution of activation energies with mean value E and standard deviation σ take place in a-C:H:Si:O: (a) ordering and clustering of sp2 carbon (E ± σ = 0.22 ± 0.08 eV) and (b) conversion of sp3- to sp2-bonded carbon (E ± σ = 3.0 ± 1.1 eV). The experimental results are in qualitative agreement with the outcomes of MD simulations performed using a ReaxFF potential. The MD simulations also indicate that the higher thermal stability of a-C:H:Si:O compared to a-C:H (with similar fraction of sp2-bonded carbon and hydrogen content) derives from the significantly lower fraction of strained carbon-carbon sp3 bonds in a-C:H:Si:O compared to a-C:H, which are more likely to break at elevated temperatures. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,Absorption spectroscopy; Activation energy; Amorphous carbon; Amorphous films; Amorphous materials; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrogenation; Molecular dynamics; Molecular oxygen; Oxygen; Silicon; Thermodynamic stability; Carbon and hydrogens; High vacuum annealing; Hydrogenated amorphous carbon; Hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H); Molecular dynamics simulations; Oxidative degradation; Thermally activated process; X-ray photoelectrons; Amorphous silicon

More importantly, the PES-defining principle of conditionality-monitoring compliance and sanctioning detected non-compliance-is seldom being implemented. Administrative ease, multiple non-environmental side objectives and social equity concerns may jointly help explain the reluctance to adopt more sophisticated, theoretically informed practices.

We simulated impacts on rice in irrigated systems (dry season and wet season) and rainfed systems (upland and lowland). We simulated the use of rice varieties with a higher temperature sum as adaptation option. We simulated rice yields for 4 RCP climate change scenarios and identified causes of yield declines. Without adaptation, shortening of the growing period due to higher temperatures had a negative impact on yields (−24% in RCP 8.5 in 2070 compared with the baseline year 2000). With varieties that have a high temperature sum, the length of the growing period would remain the same as under the baseline conditions. With this adaptation option rainfed rice yields would increase slightly (+8%) but they remain subject to water availability constraints. Irrigated rice yields in East Africa would increase (+25%) due to more favourable temperatures and due to CO2 fertilization. Wet season irrigated rice yields in West Africa were projected to change by −21% or +7% (without/with adaptation). Without adaptation irrigated rice yields in West Africa in the dry season would decrease by −45% with adaptation they would decrease significantly less (−15%). The main cause of this decline was reduced photosynthesis at extremely high temperatures. Simulated heat sterility hardly increased and was not found a major cause for yield decline. The implications for these findings are as follows. For East Africa to benefit from climate change, improved water and nutrient management will be needed to benefit fully from the more favourable temperatures and increased CO2 concentrations. For West Africa, more research is needed on photosynthesis processes at extreme temperatures and on adaptation options such as shifting sowing dates. © 2017 The Authors.

Within the kingdom Fungi, merely a few species-specific surveys have explored their snoRNA repertoire. However, the wide range of the snoRNA landscape spanning all major fungal lineages has not been mapped so far, mainly because of missing tools for automatized snoRNA detection and functional analysis. For the first time, we report here a comprehensive inventory of fungal snoRNAs together with a functional analysis and an in-depth investigation of their evolutionary history including innovations, deletions, and target switches. This large-scale analysis, incorporating more than 120 snoRNA families with more than 7700 individual snoRNA sequences, catalogs and clarifies the landscape of fungal snoRNA families, assigns functions to previously orphan snoRNAs, and increases the number of sequences by 450%. We also show that the snoRNAome is subject to ongoing rearrangements and adaptations, e.g., through lineage-specific targets and redundant guiding functions. © 2018 Canzler et al.

Insecure land tenure and unequal benefit sharing within forest user groups are two of the most important. Using original household-level survey data from 130 villages in six countries, we assess how current wealth inequality relates to tenure security and benefit flows from forest use. We find that villages with higher wealth inequality report lower tenure security and more unequal flows from forest income and externally sourced income. Furthermore, we find that wealthier individuals within villages capture a disproportionately larger share of the total amount of forest benefits available to each village, while external income often benefits poorer individuals more. These findings suggest that unless future forest conservation interventions actively work to mitigate inequalities linked to existing forest benefit flows, there is a risk that these interventions—including those associated with REDD+ activities—reproduce or even aggravate pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities within user groups, potentially undermining both their conservation and economic objectives. © 2018 The Authors",Conservation; Elite capture; Forests; Inequality; Payments for ecosystem services; REDD+,biome; deforestation; ecosystem service; emission control; nature conservation; tropical forest; village

This kind of oscillation appears different from those in doubly fed induction generator-based wind farm with series-compensation line or wind farm integration through two-level voltage-source converter-HVDC transmission system, because the internal dynamics of the MMC may have significant impact on the oscillation. By far, however, very few papers have reported it. In this paper, the generation mechanism of the SSO phenomenon in an MMC-HVDC transmission system for wind farm integration is revealed from an impedance point of view. The harmonic state-space modeling method is applied to model the multifrequency behavior of the MMC, based on which, the ac-side small-signal impedance of the MMC is analytically derived according to harmonic linearization theory. As a general rule, the controller parameters of the wind power inverter and the HVDC converter are designed separately, to meet the performance requirements of the single converter under ideal conditions, but this practice does not guarantee the stability of the interconnected system. Therefore, an optimal design method for controller parameters is proposed in this paper in order to guarantee the small-signal stability of the interconnected system from a system point of view. Finally, time-domain simulations validate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis and the proposed optimal design method. © 2013 IEEE.",Controller parameter design; High-voltage dc (HVDC); Modular multilevel converter (MMC); Stability; Wind farm,Controllers; Convergence of numerical methods; DC power transmission; Design; Electric impedance; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission; Electric utilities; Harmonic analysis; HVDC power transmission; Integration; Optimal systems; Power converters; Time domain analysis; Transmissions; Turbogenerators; Voltage control; Wind power; Wind turbines; Controller parameter; HVDC; Modular multi-level converters; Power system dynamics; Power system stability; Stability analysis; Wind farm; System stability

Predicting human mobility has the potential to enhance location-based services, intelligent transportation systems, urban computing, and so forth. In this paper, we focus on improving the prediction accuracy of non-Gaussian mobility data by constructing a hybrid Markov-based model, which takes the non-Gaussian and spatio-temporal characteristics of real human mobility data into account. More specifically, we (1) estimate the order of the Markov chain predictor by adapting it to the length of frequent individual mobility patterns, instead of using a fixed order, (2) consider the time distribution of mobility patterns occurrences when calculating the transition probability for the next location, and (3) employ the prediction results of users with similar trajectories if the recent context has not been previously seen. We have conducted extensive experiments on real human trajectories collected during 21 days from 3474 individuals in an urban Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, and the results demonstrate that the proposed model for non-Gaussian mobility data can help predicting people's future movements with more than 56% accuracy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Human mobility; Hybrid Markov-based model; Mobility prediction; Non-Gaussian mobility data; Spatio-temporal regularity,Behavioral research; Clustering algorithms; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Intelligent systems; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Markov chains; Telecommunication services; Urban transportation; Human mobility; Human mobility predictions; Intelligent transportation systems; Mobility datum; Mobility predictions; Non-gaussian distribution; Spatio temporal; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Location based services; accuracy; Article; hybrid; information processing; Markov chain; mathematical analysis; physical mobility; prediction; priority journal; probability; spatiotemporal analysis; time

Participatory scenario processes are believed to enhance participants’ systems understanding, learning, networking and subsequent changes in practices. However, limited empirical evidence is available to prove these assumptions. This study aimed to contribute to this knowledge gap. It evaluates whether these outcomes had resulted from the scenario planning exercise and the extent to which they can contribute to transformational processes. The research focused on a district level case study in rural Mali which examined food security and necessary policy changes in the context of climate change. The analyses of interviews with 26 participants carried out 12 months after the workshop suggested positive changes in learning and networking, but only limited influence on systems understanding. There was limited change in practice, but the reported changes occurred at the individual level, and no policy outcomes were evident. However, by building the adaptive capacity of participants, the scenario process had laid the foundation for ongoing collective action, and potential institutional and policy transformation. We conclude that to enhance the resilience of agricultural and food systems under climate change, participatory scenario processes require a broader range of cross-scale actors’ engagement to support transformational changes. Such process will both catalyse deeper learning and more effective link with national level policy-making process. In addition, individual scenario planning exercises are unlikely to generate sufficient learning and reflection, and instead they should form one component of more extensive and deliberate stakeholder engagement, learning and evaluation processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Climate change; Food security; Policy; Scenario; Transformation,climate change; empirical analysis; environmental policy; food security; participatory approach; scenario analysis; stakeholder; transformation; Mali

We used metagenomes to analyse how the composition of buried microbial communities may change to conform to altered environmental conditions at depth. Sediment samples were collected from down to 85 m below sea floor during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 347, “Baltic Sea Paleoenvironment”. The sediments vary in age, organic carbon content, porewater salinity, and other parameters that reflect the changing Baltic environment from the last ice age and throughout the Holocene. We found microorganisms capable of energy conservation by fermentation, acetogenesis, methanogenesis, anaerobic oxidation of methane, and reductive dehalogenation. Glacial sediments showed a greater relative abundance of genes encoding enzymes in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase than Holocene sediments. Relative abundance of genes conferring salinity tolerance was found to correlate with the present salinity, even in deep late-glacial sediment layers where salinity has increased since the sediment was deposited in a freshwater lake > 9000 years ago. This suggests that deeply buried and isolated sediment communities can slowly change in composition in response to geochemical changes that happen long after deposition. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Baltic Sea; Deep subsurface; Marine sediment; Metagenomes; Methane; Salinity,analysis; archaeon; bacterium; classification; environment; genetics; metagenome; microflora; salinity; sea; sediment; Archaea; Bacteria; Environment; Geologic Sediments; Metagenome; Microbiota; Oceans and Seas; Salinity

From a learning perspective, shorter information update cycles from an advanced traveller information system induce faster convergence when compared to longer information update cycles. This implies that drivers learn faster, given the additional computational and storage costs of travel information that the system is willing to invest in.

Bleed-through, appearing as an extra interfering text, hinders document readability and makes it difficult to decipher the information contents. Digital image restoration techniques have been successfully employed to remove or significantly reduce this distortion. This paper proposes a two-step restoration method for documents affected by bleed-through, exploiting information from the recto and verso images. First, the bleed-through pixels are identified, based on a non-stationary, linear model of the two texts overlapped in the recto-verso pair. In the second step, a dictionary learning-based sparse image inpainting technique, with non-local patch grouping, is used to reconstruct the bleed-through-contaminated image information. An overcomplete sparse dictionary is learned from the bleed-through-free image patches, which is then used to estimate a befitting fill-in for the identified bleed-through pixels. The non-local patch similarity is employed in the sparse reconstruction of each patch, to enforce the local similarity. Thanks to the intrinsic image sparsity and non-local patch similarity, the natural texture of the background is well reproduced in the bleed-through areas, and even a possible overestimation of the bleed through pixels is effectively corrected, so that the original appearance of the document is preserved. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the images of a popular database of ancient documents, and the results validate the performance of the proposed method compared to the state of the art. © 2018 by the authors.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common causes of blindness in the developed world. A pooled analysis of data from between 1980-2008 estimates that 93 million people around the world have DR. In this paper, we present a computer-aided automated image analysis system capable of handling images generated in real-life screening program. In this study, we analyzed 2932 color fundus images taken from 733 patients with DM, of which 454 (15%) images showed signs of DR validated by human graders. The system analyzed all images by detecting anatomical components such as the optic disc, macula and vascular system of the retina, then microaneurysms (MAs) and exudates as lesions. Once the presence/absence of the structures was determined, the combination of the results was subsequently used to provide a “DR/No DR” decision using a machine learning approach. The fundus images were graded by a trained and certified expert grader as well and the final diagnosis was compared to the outcome of the computer-based approach. The performances of the MA and exudate detectors used by the system were also evaluated. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.90 with the best performing setting of the algorithm. The evaluation of the proposed approach shows that it performs well against human graders and therefore might have the potential to be used in a clinical setting. There is a need for further evaluation on large scale, real-life clinical setting to explore its clinical utility. © 2018, Eszterhazy Karoly College.

The idea is to choose the minimum number of IMFs to reconstruct the brain activity. The EEG signals were processed by EMD and the IMFs were ordered according to the entropy cost function.

The proposed approach (in all its variants) requires only one scan to extract the candidate itemsets, and it has the advantage to generate a fixed number of candidate itemsets independently from the value of the minimum support. This accelerates the scan process compared with existing approaches while dealing with sparse and big databases. Numerical results show that SSFIM outperforms the state-of-the-art FIM approaches while dealing with medium and large databases. Moreover, EA-SSFIM provides similar performance as SSFIM while considerably reducing the runtime for large databases.

Given the current and projected transformation of socio-economic conditions in Africa (i.e. the increasing trend of urbanisation and population growth) and the adverse impacts of climate change, the development of a GHG research infrastructure (RI) is needed to support the design of suitable mitigation and adaptation strategies required to assure food, fuel, nutrition and economic security for the African population. This paper presents the initial results of the EU-African SEACRIFOG project, which aims to design a GHG observation RI for Africa. The first stages of this project included the identification and engagement of key stakeholders, the definition of the conceptual monitoring framework and an assessment of existing infrastructural capacity. Feedback from stakeholder sectors was obtained through three Stakeholder Consultation Workshops held in Kenya, Ghana and Zambia. Main concerns identified were data quality and accessibility, the need for capacity building and networking among the scientific community, and adaptation to climate change, which was confirmed to be a priority for Africa. This feedback in addition to input from experts in the atmospheric, terrestrial and oceanic thematic areas, facilitated the selection of a set of 'essential variables' that need to be measured in the future environmental RI. An inventory of 47 existing and planned networks across the continent allowed for an assessment of the current RIs needs and gaps in Africa. Overall, the development of a harmonised and standardised pan-African RI will serve to address the continent's primary societal and scientific challenges through a potential cross-domain synergy among existing and planned networks at regional, continental and global scales. © 2018 The Author(s).

And if the business as usual in production approaches may not be able to cope up with the projected climate changes effects. Therefore, a multi-location farmer's participatory strategic research was conducted to evaluate the effects of layering of key technologies, practices and services in varied combinations and compared with business as usual (farmer's practice) for sustainability of rice and wheat productivity. In our present study, six scenarios: Farmer's practice (FP); Improved FP (IFP) with low intensity of adaptive measures; IFP with high intensity of adaptive measures (IFP-AM); Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) with low intensity of adaptive measures (CSA-L); CSA with medium intensity of adaptive measures (CSA-M); CSA with high intensity of adaptive measures (CSA-H) were compared. The results revealed that CSAPs (CSA-L, CSA-M, and CSA-H) recorded higher plant height, panicles per sq m and biomass accumulation but lesser grains per panicle and 1000-grain weight compared to FP (transplanted rice; TPR). Rice yield was not much influenced under different management scenarios. The unfilled grains per panicle under IFP-AM, CSA-L, CSA-M, and CSA-H were 17, 18, 15 and 14% higher compared to FP. Growth and yield parameters of wheat were recorded higher under CSAPs during all the years. Three years mean, CSA-H, CSA-M and CSA-L recorded 16,14 and 11% higher grain yield compared to that of FP (5.06 q/ha), respectively. Improved farmer's practices (mean of IFP and IFP-AM) recorded 4% higher yield over FP in all the years. Intensive tillage-based scenarios (FP) showed water stagnation for long period (6 days) due to untimely rainfall (on 2 March 2015 with the amount 98.8 mm) which ultimately turned into lower grain yield but such factors did not influence grain yield under CSAPs. Therefore, our study results suggest that CSA practices should be promoted in dominated RW production region for increasing productivity and climate change mitigation. © 2018 Oriental Scientific Publishing Company.

The proposed scheme searches the available spectrum slots from the highest indexed spectrum slots and selects the slot position with the modulation level as high as possible, which guarantees the least spectrum slots consumption. It provides higher preference of the less robust modulation technique in order to minimize the number of required slots. The last fit spectrum allocation policy is used to keep lower indexed position slots available as much as possible, which have less dispersion effect, for incoming lightpath requests and gives them the opportunity to use the less number of slots. We introduce a dispersion-based highest modulation-first LF algorithm for allocation lightpath requests. The numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional schemes in terms of blocking probability, modulation usage ratio, and average number of required spectrum slots. © 2013 IEEE.",Blocking probability; dispersion based; elastic optical networks; spectrum allocation,Blocking probability; Dispersions; Fiber optic networks; Modulation; Conventional schemes; Dispersion effect; Elastic optical network (EONs); Elastic optical networks; Modulation techniques; Numerical results; Spectrum allocation; Spectrum-allocation scheme; Optical signal processing

Its increasing opposition to gender and sexual equality manifested, inter alia, in the imposition of an antidiscrimination law, which did not explicitly recognise sexual orientation as a ground of discrimination, the replacement of the rather liberal abortion law with a restrictive one, and the two attempts to constitutionally define marriage as a heterosexual union. Building upon earlier inquiries into the development of the LGBT movement in Macedonia and the introduction of the new abortion law, I examine here the discourse which the ruling coalitions used to justify the removal of the term ‘sexual orientation’ from the antidiscrimination law, and the need for a constitutional definition of marriage. I explore further how the authorities pushed their conservative agenda by undermining democracy through infringement of the official legislative procedures and suppression of dissent. In closing, I underline the retrograde impact of de-democratisation on the already and the yet to be attained progressive legislation and practices in the realm of gender and sexual equality. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",Antidiscrimination law; Constitutional definition of marriage; De-democratisation; Gender equality; Macedonia; NGOs; Party VMRO-DPMNE; Sexual equality; State capture,

The developed procedures are based on a loosely coupled, partitioned framework for the fluid, thermal, and structural solvers-each with different second-order time integrators. The procedures also implement subcycling, where disparate time scales between the solvers are leveraged to minimize communication between solvers. The first scheme uses a second-order predictor of fluid loads, along with second-order interpolations of structural and thermal solutions. The second scheme is an extension that adds a corrector step to the structural and thermal solvers. The two schemes are benchmarked against both a strongly coupled approach with subiterations and a basic loosely coupled approach that omits the use of predictors/ correctors. The schemes are examined in the context of the aerothermoelastic response of a panel in high supersonic flow, and are found to maintain second-order time accuracy with and without subcycling. Furthermore the approaches compare favorably against a strongly coupled approach at significantly reduced computational times, with the predictor-corrector approach yielding speedups of 2-4 times. In comparison, a basic scheme can yield characteristically different behavior.

The integration of such services can be solved by using reusable and third-party components. Furthermore, these interfaces must be adapted to user preferences, context changes, user interactions and component availability. Model transformation is a useful mechanism to address this adaptation but normally these operations only focus on the functional requirements. In this sense, quality attributes should be included in the adaptation process to obtain the best adapted mashup user interface. This paper proposes a generic quality-aware transformation process to support the adaptation of software architectures. The transformation process has been applied in ENIA, a geographic information system, by constructing a specific quality model for the adaptation of mashup user interfaces. This model is taken into account for evaluating the different transformation alternatives and choosing the one that maximizes the quality assessments. The approach has been validated by a set of adaptation scenarios that are intended to maximize different quality factors and therefore apply distinct combinations of metrics. © 2018 IOS Press.

Specifically, we combine suitable quadrature formulas of the integral with a finite element method for the approximation of the solution of the corresponding heat equation. We derive two families of discretizations with order of convergence depending on the regularity of the domain and the function on which the spectral fractional Laplacian is acting. Our method does not require the computation of the eigenpairs of the Laplacian on the considered domain, can be implemented on possibly irregular bounded domains, and can naturally handle different types of boundary constraints.

The normal salivary function is an important factor for the maintenance of health, with the positive consequences on the functionality. It neutralizes the oral pH and acts as a buffer. Buffers are resistant to changes in pH. There are three possible buffer systems in saliva - the protein buffer, phosphate buffer, and carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer. The diabetic patients have a lower stimulated parotid gland flow rate compared to well-controlled patients and patients without diabetes. Thus, the buffering capacity of the saliva of diabetic patients is much lower and leads to many oral complications. Objective: Variation in salivary pH and buffering capacity of saliva in normal and DM patients was compared and analyzed. Materials and Methods: Inclusion criteria include known diabetic type 2 patients of both sexes for at least 3 years and age between 26 and 65 years with a decayed, missing, or filled teeth score of =5. About 8-10 mL of unstimulated mixed saliva was obtained from all subjects 2 h after the breakfast. The saliva sample was collected from both the groups, and the salivary pH was estimated within 5 min. Results: The mean salivary pH for normal participants was found to be pH 7.2, whereas the diabetic mellitus patients showed a mean pH of 6.8. The mean buffering capacity of normal subjects is found to be 6.9, whereas the DM patients showed a mean pH of 5.3. Conclusion: Hyperglycemia alters the pH of the oral cavity, leading to dental caries. Therefore, adequate measures should be taken to prevent dental caries at an early stage. © 2018, JPR Solutions.",Buffering capacity; Diabetes mellitus; Hyperglycemia; Saliva; Salivary pH,adult; aged; Article; biological variation; buffering capacity; controlled study; dental caries; dental prevention; diabetic patient; DMFT index; female; human; hyperglycemia; male; meal; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pilot study; saliva analysis; salivary pH

Without restrictions to govern human behaviour, most natural resources are vulnerable to overexploitation. This study used a sample size of 336 households and community-level data from 30 communities around Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe, to analyse the relationship between institutions and biodiversity outcomes in community-based wildlife conservation. Our results suggest a much stronger effect of institutions on biodiversity outcomes via the intermediacy of cooperation. Overall, the performance of most communities was below the desired level of institutional attributes that matter for conservation. Good institutions are an important ingredient for cooperation in the respective communities. Disaggregating the metric measure of institutions into its components shows that governance, monitoring and enforcement are more important for increased cooperation, while fairness of institutions seems to work against cooperation. Cooperation increases with trust and group size, and is also higher in communities that have endogenised punishment as opposed to communities that still rely on external enforcement of rules and regulations. Cooperation declines as we move from communal areas into the resettlement schemes and with increasing size of the resource system. A very strong positive relationship exists between cooperation and biodiversity outcomes implying that communities with elevated levels of cooperation are associated with a healthy wildlife population. Biodiversity outcomes are more successful in communities that either received wildlife management training, share information or those that are located far away from urban areas and are not very close to the boundary of the game park. Erecting an electric fence, the household head’s age, the number of years in school and number of years living in the area negatively affect biodiversity outcomes. One policy implication of this study is to increase autonomy in CAMPFIRE communities so that they are able to invest in good institutions, which allows them to self-organise and to manage wildlife sustainably. © 2018, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

Index insurance represents a promising tool for mitigating the impacts of such risk but in practice has exhibited low uptake rates by potential clients. Basis risk—the remaining risk faced by an insured individual—is widely acknowledged as the Achilles heel of index insurance, and yet direct measurements of basis risk have never been used to study its role in determining demand for index insurance. Further, client knowledge of season-specific environmental information and spatial variation in basis risk introduces the possibility of adverse selection, a feature often presumed to be absent for index products. We used longitudinal household data to determine which factors affected demand for index based livestock insurance (IBLI). While both price and the non-price factors studied previously are indeed important, our findings indicate that basis risk and spatiotemporal adverse selection also play a major role in determining demand for IBLI. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,demand analysis; insurance system; risk assessment; risk factor; spatial variation; spatiotemporal analysis; Kenya

Demand for wheat is projected to continue to grow over the coming decades, particularly in the developing world, to feed an increasing population. More than 22% of global area under wheat is located in South Asia which is home to about 25% of the world's population. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has projected that in the 21st century South Asia is going to be hit hard by climate change. Changes in mean annual temperature will exceed 2°C above the late-20th-century baseline and there can be declines in the absolute amount of precipitation during December to February, when wheat is grown in the region. Temperature, precipitation, and enhanced CO2 level in the atmosphere, the three climate change drivers can affect wheat cropping both directly at plant level and indirectly through changes in properties and processes in the soil, shifts in nutrient cycling, insect pest occurrence, and plant diseases. Studies pertaining to the effects of climate change on soil processes and properties are now becoming available and it is becoming increasingly clear that climate change will impact soil organic matter dynamics, including soil organisms and the multiple soil properties that are tied to organic matter, soil water, and soil erosion. Warmer conditions will stimulate soil N availability through higher rates of mineralization so that fertilizer management in wheat is also going to be governed by emerging climate change scenarios. Similarly, higher temperatures and altered precipitation regimes will determine the net irrigation water requirements of wheat. Several simulation models have projected reduced wheat yields in the emerging climate change scenarios, but occurrence of an extreme heat event around senescence can lead to crop models to underestimate the effects of heat on senescence by as much as 50% for late sowing dates for 2°C rise in mean temperature. So as to project productivity of wheat in South Asia in the emerging climate change scenarios with increased certainty, integrated holistic modeling studies will be needed which also take into account effect of extreme heat events as well as the contribution of altered soil processes and properties. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Carbon cycle; Conservation agriculture; Nitrogen cycle; Nutrient management; Soil biological properties; Soil chemical properties; Soil erosion; Soil organic carbon; Soil physical properties; Wheat productivity,

This article develops and tests the argument that this variation to some extent can be traced to the degree of bureaucratic politicization in a polity. A politicized bureaucracy offers politicians greater opportunities to demand from bureaucrats—and raises incentives for bureaucrats to supply—public policy knowledge that is strategically biased or suppressed in a manner that benefits incumbents reputationally. Due to electoral competition, we suggest that the link between bureaucratic politicization and politicized policy knowledge will be stronger in democracies than in autocracies.

Under steady-state conditions, MG maintain homeostasis by producing antiinflammatory cytokines and neuro-trophic factors, support myelin production, and remove synapses and cellular debris, as well as participating in “cross-correction,” a process that supplies neurons with key factors for executing autophagy-lysosomal function. As sentinels for the immune system, MG also detect “danger” signals (pathogenic or traumatic insult), become activated, produce proinflammatory cytokines, and recruit monocytes and dendritic cells to the site of damage through a breached blood–brain barrier or via brain lymphatics. Failure to effectively resolve MG activation can be problematic and can lead to chronic inflammation, a condition proposed to underlie CNS pathophysiology in heritable brain disorders and age-related neurodegenerative and cognitive decline. Here, we show that APOBEC1-mediated RNA editing occurs within MG and is key to maintaining their resting status. Like bone marrow-derived macrophages, RNA editing in MG leads to overall changes in the abundance of edited proteins that coordinate the function of multiple cellular pathways. Conversely, mice lacking the APOBEC1 editing function in MG display evidence of dysregulation, with progressive age-related signs of neurodegeneration, characterized by clustering of activated MG, aberrant myelination, increased inflammation, and lysosomal anomalies that culminate in behavioral and motor deficiencies. Collectively, our study identifies posttranscriptional modification by RNA editing as a critical regulatory mechanism of vital cellular functions that maintain overall brain health.",aging; lysosome; Microglia; neuroinflammation; RNA editing,"apolipoprotein B messenger RNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 1; Apobec1 protein, mouse; apolipoprotein B messenger RNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bone marrow derived macrophage; controlled study; inflammation; lysosome; microglia; mouse; myelination; nerve degeneration; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; RNA editing; aging; animal; brain; genetics; growth, development and aging; male; metabolism; microglia; myelin sheath; pathology; ultrastructure; Aging; Animals; APOBEC-1 Deaminase; Brain; Lysosomes; Male; Mice; Microglia; Myelin Sheath; RNA Editing"

Coupled natural-human system modeling through explicit modeling of both natural and human behavior can help reveal the reciprocal interactions and co-evolution of the natural and human systems. This study develops a spatially scalable, generalized agent-based modeling (ABM) framework consisting of a process-based semi-distributed hydrologic model (SWAT) and a decentralized water system model to simulate the impacts of water resource management decisions that affect the food-water-energy-environment (FWEE) nexus at a watershed scale. Agents within a river basin are geographically delineated based on both political and watershed boundaries and represent key stakeholders of ecosystem services. Agents decide about the priority across three primary water uses: Food production, hydropower generation and ecosystem health within their geographical domains. Agents interact with the environment (streamflow) through the SWAT model and interact with other agents through a parameter representing willingness to cooperate. The innovative two-way coupling between the water system model and SWAT enables this framework to fully explore the feedback of human decisions on the environmental dynamics and vice versa. To support non-technical stakeholder interactions, a web-based user interface has been developed that allows for role-play and participatory modeling. The generalized ABM framework is also tested in two key transboundary river basins, the Mekong River basin in Southeast Asia and the Niger River basin in West Africa, where water uses for ecosystem health compete with growing human demands on food and energy resources. We present modeling results for crop production, energy generation and violation of eco-hydrological indicators at both the agent and basin-wide levels to shed light on holistic FWEE management policies in these two basins. © 2017 Author(s).",,Autonomous agents; Behavioral research; Computational methods; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Ecology; Ecosystems; Energy resources; Environmental management; Human resource management; Rivers; Software agents; Soil conservation; Stream flow; Sustainable development; User interfaces; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Waterworks; Decentralized water systems; Environmental dynamics; Hydro-power generation; Hydrological indicators; Semi-distributed hydrologic models; Sustainable watershed management; Technical stakeholders; Waterresource management; Water resources; basin management; decision making; ecosystem service; hydrological modeling; innovation; parameterization; participatory approach; political boundary; river basin; stakeholder; streamflow; sustainability; water resource; Mekong River

The analysed data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb-1, were collected in proton-proton collisions in Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13TeV. Final states containing zero, one and two charged leptons (electrons or muons) are considered, targeting the decays Z → νν, W → ℓν and Z → ℓℓ. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, an excess of events over the expected background from other Standard Model processes is found with an observed significance of 3.5 standard deviations, compared to an expectation of 3.0 standard deviations. This excess provides evidence for the Higgs boson decay into b-quarks and for its production in association with a vector boson. The combination of this result with that of the Run 1 analysis yields a ratio of the measured signal events to the Standard Model expectation equal to 0.90 ± 0.18(stat.)+0.21 -0.19(syst.). Assuming the Standard Model production cross-section, the results are consistent with the value of the Yukawa coupling to b-quarks in the Standard Model. © The Author(s) 2017.",Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments); Higgs physics,

The results revealed that each image-processing factor obtained can potentially be used to describe every colour attribute change, except for chroma value. The multivariate correlations of measured backscattering parameters as well as the digital image properties were found to yield the best fitting for colour validations.

It draws from two qualitative case studies on migrant workers in British hospitality and construction, focusing on regulatory outcomes of the Agency Worker Directive, the Posting of Workers Directive and the Tier System of immigration. The findings illustrate how workers’ experiences are critically shaped by the combination of their migration and employment statuses in the context of firms’ restructuring strategies and transnational labour mobility. Temporal employment constraints and exclusion from equal treatment linked to migrant status, combined with labour subcontracting across the sectors, produce intensification of work, inferior terms and conditions, greater insecurity and dependence for migrant temporary workers. The main argument is that increasing differentiation between categories of migrant workers goes beyond the simple distinction of EU and Third Country Nationals, and is produced by the exceptional regulatory spaces into which these migrants are locked. Highlighting the combined influence of migration regulation and management restructuring practices, the article proposes a re-theorisation of IHRM that includes migration perspectives into the study of management changes and labour regulation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",agency workers; construction; EU; fragmentation; hospitality; Migration; posting; regulation,

Implementation of these initiatives, however, face multiple challenges. State-prescribed community programs, for example, will remain isolated efforts if changes in the overall economic and social governance frameworks, including the devolution of rights to local users is lacking. Financial sustainability of these measures remains often uncertain and equity issues inherent to groups and communities formed for SF, can be exacerbated. In this article, we pose the question: Whose interests do SF policies serve? The effectiveness of SF would depend on the motivations and aims for a decentralization of forest governance to the community. In order to understand the underlying motivations behind the governments’ push for SF, we examine national policies in Vietnam and Indonesia, changes in their policies over time and the shift in discourses influencing how SF has evolved. Vietnam and Indonesia are at different sides of the spectrum in democratic ambitions and forest abundance, and present an intriguing comparison in the recent regional push towards SF in Southeast Asia. We discuss the different interpretations of SF in these two countries and how SF programs are implemented. Our results show that governments, influenced by global discourse, are attempting to regulate SF through formal definitions and regulations. Communities on the other hand, might resist by adopting, adapting or rejecting formal schemes. In this tension, SF, adopted to serve the interest of local people, in practice has not fulfilled its promise. © 2017, Hasanuddin University.

The four categories are the ones previously adopted in Xu and Borovsky (2015): ejecta, coronal hole origin plasma, streamer belt origin plasma, and sector reversal origin plasma. The algorithm is trained and tested on a labeled portion of the OMNI data set. It uses seven inputs: the solar wind speed Vsw, the temperature standard deviation σT, the sunspot number R, the F10.7 index, the Alfven speed vA, the proton specific entropy Sp, and the proton temperature Tp compared to a velocity-dependent expected temperature. The output of the Gaussian Process classifier is a four-element vector containing the probabilities that an event (one reading from the hourly averaged OMNI database) belongs to each category. The probabilistic nature of the prediction allows for a more informative and flexible interpretation of the results, for instance, being able to classify events as “undecided.” The new method has a median accuracy larger than 90% for all categories, even using a small set of data for training. The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and the reliability diagram also demonstrate the excellent quality of this new method. Finally, we use the algorithm to classify a large portion of the OMNI data set, and we present for the first time transition probabilities between different solar wind categories.

This paper exploits exogenous variation in program participation and panel data from Kenya to compare the causal impacts of a cash transfer program (HSNP) and an index-based insurance product (IBLI), which were implemented contemporaneously among the same population. We find that both programs benefit clients. HSNP improves child health, as measured by mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and helps households maintain their mobility-dependent livestock production strategies. Households with IBLI coverage make productivity increasing investments, reduce distress sales of livestock during droughts, and see a marked increase in income per adult equivalent. Estimating the impacts per total program costs reveals that the two programs perform comparably on average, while IBLI's impacts per unit marginal cost are considerably larger than HSNP's. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cash transfers; Index insurance; Pastoralists; Social protection,

In this paper, we propose a nested multiple-model adaptive estimation framework to detect and estimate icing using standard sensors only, ie, a pitot tube and an inertial measurement unit. The architecture of the estimation scheme is based on 2 different time scales, ie, one for the accretion of ice on aircraft surfaces and one for the accretion of ice on sensors, and consists of 2 nested adaptive observers, namely, outer and inner loops, respectively.

However, to date, few studies have examined whole-farm greenhouse gas (GHG) balances in smallholder crop-livestock systems. This study aimed to quantify GHG balances at farm-scale, identify GHG hotspots and assess mitigation options in coffee-dairy farms undergoing agricultural intensification in Central Kenya. In recent decades, decreasing farm size has forced the shift from extensive practices to zero-grazing systems and higher nitrogen (N) inputs. We hypothesised that different farm strategies and intensification levels determine the farm's GHG balance. A farm typology was constructed through principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering from 125 farms surveyed. Four farm types were identified ranging relatively from small to large farms, low to high livestock intensities, and low to high N input rates. Whole-farm GHG balances were estimated using an adapted version of the Cool Farm Tool (CFT). Farms were found to be net sources of GHG, averaging from 4.5 t CO2 eq ha−1 yr−1 in less intensive farms to 12.5 t CO2 eq ha−1 yr−1 in high intensive farms. Within the farm GHG hotspots identified, methane (CH4) from enteric fermentation processes accounted for 26–39% of total farm GHG emissions; nitrous oxide (N2O) and CH4 from manure management systems (MMS) for 26–38%; soil background and fertilizer induced N2O emissions for 24–29%; off-farm production of feeds and agrochemicals for 10–22%; and crop residue management (CRM) for the remaining 1–3%. Within the mitigation practices assessed, zero-grazing stalls already lowered the livestock maintenance energy requirements, reducing enteric fermentation emissions. Stall-feeding, however, brings the necessity-opportunity to manage the manure and our results showed that MMS can be a determining factor in the GHG balance. Increasing the frequency of manure collection from stalls in favour of solid storage systems can reduce N2O emissions by up to 75%. Furthermore, dry manure storage reduced the CH4 emissions of liquid slurry systems by more than 70%. Further benefits in terms of carbon (C) sequestration were identified along farm types from manure and crop residues applications in soils (with averages of −1.3 to −2.3 t CO2 eq ha−1 yr−1) and biomass growth in agroforestry systems (−1.2 to −2 t CO2 eq ha−1 yr−1). Together, soils and woody biomass offset 25–36% of farm emissions. We conclude that reduced farm size and increased livestock density lead to higher emissions per unit area, though this increase is smoothed by larger negative fluxes in soils (by higher C inputs) and woody biomass (by higher tree densities) until a steady state is reached. Average yield-scaled emissions, or product carbon footprints (CFs), resulted in 1.08 kg CO2 eq kg coffee berry−1, 0.64 kg CO2 eq kg maize−1 and 1.05 kg CO2 eq kg milk−1 on average. CFs did not always differ between farm types and intensification levels, meaning that increases in productivity were not higher than increases in GHG fluxes from intensification. This may be due to: 1) increases in productivity are the result of more processes other than N inputs; and/or 2) emissions from N inputs are overestimated by EFs and GHG calculators. Smallholders may benefit in the near future from climate initiatives and further field characterisation, models calibration and monitoring are required to overcome critical levels of uncertainty and provide more accurate estimations of GHG balances at farm-scale. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Agroforestry; C sequestration; Carbon footprint; Climate-smart; Coffee; Dairy; Sustainable intensification; Whole-farm GHG balance; Zero-grazing,agricultural development; agricultural intensification; agricultural management; agrochemical; agroforestry; biomass; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; coffee; crop residue; dairy farming; farm size; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; growth rate; livestock farming; mixed farming; nitrous oxide; principal component analysis; uncertainty analysis; Kenya

Estimations in the initial project phases are made with a lot of uncertainty that influences estimation accuracy which typically increases as the project progresses in time. Project data collected during the various project phases can be used in a progressive time-dependent fashion to train software cost estimation models. Our motivation is to reduce uncertainty and increase confidence based on the understanding of patterns of effort distributions in development phases of real-world projects. In this work, we study effort distributions and suggest a four-stage progressive software cost estimation model, adjusting the initial effort estimates during the development life-cycle based on newly available data. Initial estimates are reviewed on the basis of the experience gained as development progresses and as new information becomes available. The proposed model provides an early, a post-planning, a post-specifications, and a post-design estimate, while it uses industrial data from the ISBSG (R10) dataset. The results reveal emerging patterns of effort distributions and indicate that the model provides effective estimations and exhibits high explanatory value.

In recent decades, swidden systems across the region have undergone rapid transformation. While most analyses focus on swidden as a livelihood practice, we direct attention to the political nature of swidden. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork and household surveys from two villages in East Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, we examine the politics of swidden along two key dimensions. First, at the household level, we describe swidden as a land control strategy. We identify territorialization and speculation as drivers of ‘contentious land change’ in swidden systems under pressure from expanding plantations and mines. Second, at the village and district levels, we examine the politics of swidden within new forest governance arrangements. Control of swidden has provided a focus for multi-stakeholder forest governance, but with ambivalent effects, developing village land management and livelihoods at a cost of temporary increases in swidden clearing and with minimal impact on deforestation for industrial land uses. Our analysis suggests forest governance efforts will be ineffective in eliminating contentious land change or reducing district-level deforestation until they address plantation and mining expansion as the dominant direct and indirect drivers of forest conversion. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",deforestation; environmental governance; REDD; swidden; territorialization,deforestation; governance approach; land management; land use change; livelihood; shifting cultivation; stakeholder; territory; village; East Kalimantan; Indonesia

Despite this, there are a lack of published data on both the strength of association after adjusting for potential confounders, and the absolute incidence among different subgroups of patients. Objectives: To assess the relative and absolute risks of liver injury following exposure to flucloxacillin and identify subgroups at potentially increased risk. Methods: A cohort study between 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2012 using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, including 1046699 people with a first prescription for flucloxacillin (861962) or oxytetracycline (184737). Absolute risks of experiencing both symptom-defined (jaundice) and laboratory-confirmed liver injury within 1-45 and 46-90 days of antibiotic initiation were estimated. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate 1-45 day relative effects. Results: There were 183 symptom-defined cases (160 prescribed flucloxacillin) and 108 laboratory-confirmed cases (102 flucloxacillin). The 1-45 day adjusted risk ratio for laboratory-confirmed injury was 5.22 (95% CI 1.64-16.62) comparing flucloxacillin with oxytetracycline use. The 1-45 day risk of laboratoryconfirmed liver injury was 8.47 per 100000 people prescribed flucloxacillin (95% CI 6.64-10.65). People who received consecutive flucloxacillin prescriptions had a 1-45 day risk of jaundice of 39.00 per 100000 (95% CI 26.85-54.77), while those aged > 70 receiving consecutive prescriptions had a risk of 110.57 per 100000 (95% CI 70.86-164.48). Conclusions: The short-term risk of laboratory-confirmed liver injury was > 5-fold higher after a flucloxacillin prescription than an oxytetracycline prescription. The risk of flucloxacillin-induced liver injury is particularly high within those aged > 70 and those who receive multiple flucloxacillin prescriptions. The stratified risk estimates from this study could help guide clinical care. © The Author 2017.

However, the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations provide a regulatory framework that can prevent Canadian consumers from identifying protein-rich plant-based foods. In Canada, protein nutrient content claims are based on the protein efficiency ratio (PER) and protein rating method, which is based on a rat growth bioassay. PERs are not additive, and the protein rating of a food is underpinned by its Reasonable Daily Intake. The restrictive nature of Canada’s requirements for supporting protein claims therefore presents challenges for Canadian consumers to adapt to a rapidly changing food environment. This commentary will present two options for modernizing the regulatory framework for protein content claims in Canada. The first and preferred option advocates that protein quality not be considered in the determination of the eligibility of a food for protein content claims. The second and less preferred option, an interim solution, is a framework for adopting the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score as the official method for supporting protein content and quality claims and harmonizes Canada’s regulatory framework with that of the USA. © 2017 by the authors.",Protein; Protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS); Protein efficiency ratio; Protein quality; Regulation,"milk fat; plant protein; analytical parameters; appetite; bioassay; breakfast cereal; Canada; chickpea; conceptual framework; cross-sectional study; food intake; human; Note; protein content; protein digestibility corrected amino acid score; protein efficiency ratio; protein quality; protein rating; regulatory framework; scoring system; dietary reference intake; feeding behavior; food industry; food packaging; government regulation; health promotion; law; legislation and jurisprudence; management; nutrition policy; nutritional value; Canada; Feeding Behavior; Food Industry; Food Labeling; Food Packaging; Government Regulation; Health Promotion; Humans; Legislation, Food; Nutrition Policy; Nutritive Value; Policy Making; Recommended Dietary Allowances; Vegetable Proteins"

The aim of REDD+ social safeguards is to ensure that REDD+ does not harm, and actually benefits, local people. To be eligible for results-based compensation through REDD+, countries should develop national-level safeguard information systems to monitor and report on the impacts of REDD+. Although safeguards represent a key step for promoting social responsibility in REDD+, they are challenging to operationalize and monitor. We analyzed the impacts of different types of REDD+ interventions (incentives vs. disincentives) on key safeguard-relevant indicators, i.e., tenure security, participation, and subjective well-being, as well as on reported forest clearing. We used household-level data collected in Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia, and Vietnam from approximately 4000 households in 130 villages at two points in time (2010-2012 and 2013-2014). Our findings highlight a decrease in perceived tenure security and overall perceived well-being over time for households exposed to disincentives alone, with the addition of incentives helping to alleviate negative effects on well-being. In Brazil, although disincentives were associated with reduced reported forest clearing by smallholders, they were the intervention that most negatively affected perceived well-being, highlighting a clear trade-off between carbon and noncarbon benefits. Globally, although households exposed to REDD+ interventions were generally aware of local REDD+ initiatives, meaningful participation in initiative design and implementation lagged behind. Our analysis contributes to a relatively small literature that seeks to operationalize REDD+ social safeguards empirically and to evaluate the impacts of REDD+ interventions on local people and forests. © 2017 by the author(s).",Climate change mitigation; Livelihoods; Monitoring; Social impact assessment; Well-being,carbon emission; deforestation; emission control; environmental degradation; environmental monitoring; incentive; livelihood; mitigation; smallholder; social impact assessment; Brazil; Cameroon; Indonesia; Peru; Tanzania; Viet Nam; Daucus carota

Here, we show that (a) KDE output depends in useful ways on dataset size and bias, (b) other species distribution modelling methods make equally stringent but different assumptions about dataset bias, (c) simulation results presented by Qiao et al.

A gene expression-based classifier was developed to distinguish between BRCA1-like and non-BRCA1-like tumors. We hypothesized that these tumors may also be more sensitive to PARP inhibitors than standard treatments. Methods: A diagnostic gene expression signature (BRCA1ness) was developed using a centroid model with 128 triple-negative breast cancer samples from the EU FP7 RATHER project. This BRCA1ness signature was then tested in HER2-negative patients (n=116) from the I-SPY 2 TRIAL who received an oral PARP inhibitor veliparib in combination with carboplatin (V-C), or standard chemotherapy alone. We assessed the association between BRCA1ness and pathologic complete response in the V-C and control arms alone using Fisher's exact test, and the relative performance between arms (biomarker×treatment interaction, likelihood ratio p<0.05) using a logistic model and adjusting for hormone receptor status (HR). Results: We developed a gene expression signature to identify BRCA1-like status. In the I-SPY 2 neoadjuvant setting the BRCA1ness signature associated significantly with response to V-C (p=0.03), but not in the control arm (p=0.45). We identified a significant interaction between BRCA1ness and V-C (p=0.023) after correcting for HR. Conclusions: A genomic-based BRCA1-like signature was successfully translated to an expression-based signature (BRC1Aness). In the I-SPY 2 neoadjuvant setting, we determined that the BRCA1ness signature is capable of predicting benefit of V-C added to standard chemotherapy compared to standard chemotherapy alone.

Companies use them to achieve interoperability of (parts of) their software, standardization, and faster development. In contrast to system-specific software architectures that ""emerge"" during development, reference architectures dictate significant parts of the software design early on. Agile software development frameworks (such as Scrum) acknowledge changing software requirements and the need to adapt the software design accordingly. In this paper, we present lessons learned about how reference architectures interact with Scrum (the most frequently used agile process framework). These lessons are based on observing software development projects in five companies. We found that reference architectures can support good practice in Scrum: They provide enough design upfront without too much effort, reduce documentation activities, facilitate knowledge sharing, and contribute to ""architectural thinking"" of developers.

Using the long-term radio pulsar timing of 36 ms pulsars in the cluster core, we provide new measurements of key physical properties of the system. As Terzan 5 is located within the galactic bulge, stellar crowding and reddening make optical and near-infrared observations difficult. Pulsar accelerations, however, allow us to study the intrinsic characteristics of the cluster independent of reddening and stellar crowding and probe the mass density profile without needing to quantify the mass-to-light ratio. Relating the spin and orbital periods of each pulsar to the acceleration predicted by a King model, we find a core density of 1.58+0.13-0.13×106M⊙pc-3 a core radius of 0.16+0.01-0.01pc a pulsar density profile of n α r-3+0.52-0.53, and a total mass of MT(R⊥&gt;1.0pc) ≃ 3.0 × 105M⊙assuming a cluster distance of 5.9 kpc. Using this information, we argue against Terzan 5 being a disrupted dwarf galaxy and discuss the possibility of it being a fragment of the Milky Ways proto-bulge. We also discuss whether low-mass pulsars were formed via electroncapture supernovae or exist in a core full of heavy white dwarfs and hard binaries.

In this paper, we present the first resolved millimetre study of the debris disc in the 4.6 Gyr old multiplanet system 61 Vir, combining Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope data at 0.86 mm. We fit the data using a parametric disc model, finding that the disc of planetesimals extends from 30 au to at least 150 au, with a surface density distribution of millimetre-sized grains with a power-law slope of 0.1-0.8 +1.1. We also present a numerical collisional model that can predict the evolution of the surface density of millimetre grains for a given primordial disc, finding that it does not necessarily have the same radial profile as the total mass surface density (as previous studies suggested for the optical depth), with the former being flatter. Finally, we find that if the planetesimal disc was stirred at 150 au by an additional unseen planet, that planet should be more massive than 10 M⊕ and lie between 10 and 20 au.

The modification of the SOL upstream profile, with the appearance of what is generally called a density shoulder, has been related to the properties of filamentary blobs.

In this case, the textures and details are eliminated from the sketch image while structures are preserved. So using sketch image to calculate the data term can avoid the influence caused by textures or details. Moreover, we use the addition operator to combine the confidence term and the two data terms rather than multiplication operator used in traditional priory calculation. New priority function can solve the drawback of the traditional priority rapidly tending to zero with the confidence tending to zero, which may result in chaotic inpainting. The experimental results on both synthetic and real images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, compared with traditional Criminisi algorithm and two improved Criminisi algorithms, the proposed model has better performance in terms of PSNR and MSSIM values.

This recent upsurge in the abundance of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) was directly linked to serious damage to cassava crops resulting from spread of whitefly-borne cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMGs). There is currently very little information describing whitefly populations on cassava and associated crops in Central African Republic. The current study aimed to address this gap, and to determine whether the increasing damage associated with B. tabaci whiteflies was the consequence of a new invasion, or an upsurge of a local population. The molecular genetic identification and phylogenetic relationships of 898 B. tabaci adult individuals collected from representative locations (54) throughout CAR were determined based on their mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequences (mtCOI). Field and ecological data were also collected from each site, including whitefly abundance, CMD incidence, host plants colonized by B. tabaci and agro-ecological zone. Phylogenetic analysis of the whitefly mtCOI sequences indicated that SSA1 (-SG1, -SG2), SSA3, MED, MEAM1 and Indian Ocean (IO) putative species occur in CAR. One specific haplotype of SSA1-SG1 (SSA1-SG1-P18F5) predominated on most cassava plants and at the majority of sites. This haplotype was identical to the SSA1-SG1 Mukono8-4 (KM377961) haplotype that was recorded from Uganda but that also occurs widely in CMD pandemic-affected areas of East Africa. These results suggest that the SSA1-SG1-P18F5 haplotype occurring in CAR represents a recent invasive population, and that it is the likely cause of the increased spread and severity of CMD in CAR. Furthermore, the high mtDNA sequence diversity observed for SSA1 and its broad presence on all sites and host plants sampled suggest that this genetic group was the dominant resident species even before the arrival of this new invasive haplotype. © 2017 Tocko-Marabena et al.

Study focus Intensive development over the past half century across Southeast Asia's Lower Mekong Basin has inevitably affected natural resources. Large areas have been converted from forests for subsistence and commercial agriculture, and urban development. We implement an innovative approach to screen hydrologic data for detecting impacts of such large-scale changes on hydrological response. In a first step, temporal changes in the rainfall-runoff relationship were assessed using the parsimonious, two-parameter GR2M hydrological model. In a second step, a distribution-free statistical test was applied to detect whether significant changes have occurred in the wet season (high flow) and dry season (low flow) conditions. New hydrological insights for the region Our results indicate that the majority of catchments (64% of those considered) with sufficiently long data records exhibited no discernable trends in hydrological response. Those catchments that did exhibit significant trends in hydrological response were fairly evenly split between increasing trends (between 21% and 24%) and decreasing trends (between 15% and 12%) with time. There was a lack of evidence that these changes where brought about by shifts in precipitation or potential evapotranspiration; however, catchments exhibiting significant increasing trends in hydrological behavior were found to have different land cover compositions (lower percentage of forest coverage and subsequently higher paddy rice coverage) than those exhibiting significant decreasing trends. The approach presented here provides a potentially valuable screening method to highlight regions for further investigation of improved mechanistic understanding. Without this connection, we might be blind to future hydrological shifts that can have significant impact on development. © 2017 The Authors",Distribution-free trend test; GR2M model; Hydrological response change; Lower Mekong Basin,

This paper assesses in two locations, West Java, Indonesia and eastern Bangladesh, current land use conditions from the perspective of smallholder farmers, the factors that facilitate their adoption of tree farming, and the potential of landscape-scale approaches to foster sustainable land management. Data were collected through rapid rural appraisals, focus group discussions, field observations, semi-structured interviews of farm households and key informant interviews of state agricultural officers. Land at both study sites is typically fragmented due to conversion of forest to agriculture and community settlement. Local land use challenges are associated with pressures of population increase, poverty, deforestation, shortage of forest products, lack of community-scale management, weak tenure, underdeveloped markets, government decision-making with insufficient involvement of local people, and poor extension services. Despite these challenges, smallholder tree farming is found to be successful from farmers' perspectives. However, constraints of local food crop cultivation traditions, insecure land tenure, lack of capital, lack of knowledge, lack of technical assistance, and perceived risk of investing in land due to local conflict (in Bangladesh) limit farmers' willingness to adopt this land use alternative. Overcoming these barriers to adoption will require management at a landscape scale, including elements of both segregation and integration of land uses, supported by competent government policies and local communities having sufficiently high social capital. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Community; Land sharing; Land sparing; Land use; Livelihood,decision making; ecosystem service; forest product; land management; livelihood; smallholder; social capital; sustainability; willingness to pay; adoption; agricultural worker; Bangladesh; decision making; deforestation; food crop; forest; government; household; human; Indonesia; land use; landscape; market; poverty; semi structured interview; social capital; agriculture; Asia; environmental protection; Bangladesh; Indonesia; West Java; Agriculture; Asia; Bangladesh; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Indonesia

Co-culturing human or murine iMacs with iPSC-derived neurons promoted differentiation into microglia-like cells in vitro. Furthermore, murine iMacs differentiated in vivo into microglia after injection into the brain and into functional alveolar macrophages after engraftment in the lung. Finally, iPSCs from a patient with familial Mediterranean fever differentiated into iMacs with pro-inflammatory characteristics, mimicking the disease phenotype. Altogether, iMacs constitute a source of tissue-resident macrophage precursors that can be used for biological, pathophysiological, and therapeutic studies. Yolk-sac (YS) embryonic macrophages contribute to tissue-resident macrophages but remain difficult to study because of their stage-dependent limited availability. Takata et al. demonstrate that iPSCs can generate YS macrophage-like cells (iMacs) that differentiate into functional tissue-resident macrophage-like cells upon receiving organ-specific cues, thus providing a platform for modeling tissue-resident macrophages. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",co-culture; familial Mediterranean fever; hematopoiesis; induced pluripotent stem cells; IPSC; macrophages; microglia; neurons; primitive; pulmonary alveolar proteinosis; resident,"biological marker; CD11b antigen; CD276 antigen; CD38 antigen; CD45 antigen; CD48 antigen; CD81 antigen; CD9 antigen; CD93 antigen; chemokine receptor CX3CR1; CXCL1 chemokine; cyclin dependent kinase 9; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; f4 80 protein; fibrinogen receptor; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; Isg15 protein; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; Nfkbia protein; peptides and proteins; RANTES; siglec f; stem cell factor; surfactant protein B; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor alpha induced protein 3; unclassified drug; Usp18 protein; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bone marrow derived macrophage; brain; brain injury; cell differentiation; cell specificity; cell structure; coculture; controlled study; cytokine production; engraftment; familial Mediterranean fever; female; gene expression; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; induced pluripotent stem cell; induced pluripotent stem cell derived primitive macrophage; inflammation; innate immunity; lung; lung alveolus macrophage; lung alveolus proteinosis; lung function; macrophage; macrophage differentiation; macrophage function; male; microglia; mouse; nerve cell; nerve cell culture; nerve cell differentiation; newborn; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phagocytosis; phenotype; priority journal; stem cell culture; tissue specificity; upregulation; animal; C57BL mouse; cell culture; cell culture technique; cell differentiation; hematopoiesis; macrophage; mammalian embryo; nervous system development; physiology; pluripotent stem cell; procedures; transgenic mouse; Animals; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Embryo, Mammalian; Hematopoiesis; Humans; Macrophages; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Pluripotent Stem Cells"

When the system is underactuated, only a subset of the outputs can be arbitrarily controlled, and the remaining ones are constrained. The problem of finding the input that minimizes a cost function of the overall output tracking error is investigated for a special class of LPV systems that admit steady-states. Moreover, it is shown how such solution is related to the inputs associated to the singularly optimal regulation of each output. © 2017 IEEE.",,Control; LPV systems; Output regulation; Output-tracking; Special class; Steady state; Underactuated; Cost functions

Traditionally, it is often assumed that all the properties of each packet are known immediately upon arrival. However, as traffic becomes increasingly heterogeneous and complex, such assumptions are in many cases invalid. In particular, in various scenarios information about packet characteristics becomes available only after the packet has undergone some initial processing. In this work, we study the problem of managing queues with limited knowledge. We start by showing lower bounds on the competitive ratio of any algorithm in such settings. Next, we use the insight obtained from these bounds to identify several algorithmic concepts appropriate for the problem, and use these guidelines to design a concrete algorithmic framework. We analyze the performance of our proposed algorithm, and further show how it can be implemented in various settings, which differ by the type and nature of the unknown information. We further validate our results and algorithmic approach by a simulation study that provides further insights as to our algorithmic design principles in face of limited knowledge. © 2017 IEEE.",,Queueing theory; Scheduling; Algorithmic approach; Algorithmic design; Algorithmic framework; Competitive ratio; Computer networking; Lower bounds; Simulation studies; Quality of service

First, we find very good agreement between the polarization orientations in the three wavelength-bands, suggesting that, at the considered common angular resolution of 3.0 that corresponds to a physical scale of approximately 0.61 pc, the inferred magnetic field orientation is not significantly affected by temperature or dust grain alignment effects. Second, we find that the relative orientation between gas column density structures and the magnetic field changes progressively with increasing gas column density, from mostly parallel or having no preferred orientation at low column densities to mostly perpendicular at the highest column densities. This observation is in agreement with previous studies by the Planck collaboration towards more nearby molecular clouds. Finally, we find a correspondence between (a) the trends in relative orientation between the column density structures and the projected magnetic field; and (b) the shape of the column density probability distribution functions (PDFs). In the sub-regions of Vela C dominated by one clear filamentary structure, or ""ridges"", where the high-column density tails of the PDFs are flatter, we find a sharp transition from preferentially parallel or having no preferred relative orientation at low column densities to preferentially perpendicular at highest column densities. In the sub-regions of Vela C dominated by several filamentary structures with multiple orientations, or ""nests"", where the maximum values of the column density are smaller than in the ridge-like sub-regions and the high-column density tails of the PDFs are steeper, such a transition is also present, but it is clearly less sharp than in the ridge-like sub-regions. Both of these results suggest that the magnetic field is dynamically important for the formation of density structures in this region. © ESO, 2017.","Astroparticle physics; Dust, extinction; ISM: clouds; ISM: magnetic fields; Submillimeter: ISM","Density of gases; Distribution functions; Dust; Molecular orientation; Probability distributions; Astroparticle physics; Dust , extinction; ISM : clouds; ISM: magnetic fields; Submillimeter: isms; Magnetic field effects"

Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) can be used to derive unbiased and non-destructive estimates of tree structure and volume and can, therefore, be used to address key uncertainties in forest AGB estimates. Here we review our experience of TLS sampling strategies from 27 campaigns conducted over the past 5 years, across tropical and temperate forest plots, where data was captured with a RIEGL VZ-400 laser scanner. The focus is on strategies to derive Geometrical Modelling metrics (e.g. tree volume) over forest plots (≥1 ha) which require the accurate co-registration of 10s to 100s of individual point clouds. We recommend a 10 m  × 10 m sampling grid as an approach to produce a point cloud with a uniform point distribution, that can resolve higher order branches (down to a few cm in diameter) towards the top of 30+ m canopies and can be captured in a timely fashion i.e. ∼3–6 days per ha.

As reducing vulnerability rises on political agendas, identifying empirically validated measures will become increasingly important in the design and evaluation of multi-site and multi-scale programmatic interventions. Using a systematic review methodology, we analyze the current range of conceptual frameworks, operationalizations and research methodologies as used in empirical studies of local-level vulnerability in agricultural settings. Detailed analysis of theories and methods provides a platform for moving toward reporting that supports valid comparisons between disparate studies. This in turn, enables the design and implementation of empirically-informed programmatic interventions. The results show that earlier concerns remain relevant. Even the best reported cases do not support aggregated analysis because conceptual ambiguity and methodological heterogeneity renders each study effectively unique. While conceptualization is broadly consolidating around the IPCC framework, declaration of that framework does not predict consistent operationalization. Furthermore, emerging alternative frameworks, especially Vulnerability as Expected Poverty, reveal important limitations of the IPCC framework. Findings also highlight that reporting practices in vulnerability research perpetuate problematic ambiguity. When designing and reporting research, we recommend addressing six key questions that can help specify the objectives of the study: (1) Is this system vulnerable? (2) To what is this system vulnerable? (3) How vulnerable is this system? (4)What is causing this system to be vulnerable? (5) How is vulnerability distributed within the system? (6) What is causing the observed distribution of vulnerability within the system? WIREs Clim Change 2017, 8:e464. doi: 10.1002/wcc.464.

We found limited literature directly addressing the topic, necessitating the use of proxy measures to enlarge the sample. Where necessary, we used agricultural system richness and diversity as proxies for the presence of the sort of synergistic relationships that typify IAS, interannual climate variability for climate change, and myriad agricultural indicators for resilience. We found that (1) 37 papers addressed the topic either through mathematical modeling or statistical modeling; (2) in the statistical papers, integration was overwhelmingly (n = 17/24) associated with increased climate resilience; (3) these findings stemmed mainly from comparisons of more versus less diverse or rich farming systems, while few studies investigated the influence of farm system synergies on resilience; (4) yield, revenue, profit, and yield variance were all used to demonstrate resilience; (5) modeling studies tended to investigate resilience across multiple years, while most statistical approaches tracked single-year outcomes; (6) the IAS-climate resilience links demonstrated were not generalizable across units of analysis, spatiotemporal scale, and from autonomous to directed integration; and (7) few of the articles reviewed identified and measured the mechanism by which IAS were shown to have conferred resilience. Our findings reveal suggestive, although by no means conclusive, evidence that farm system integration can enhance resilience and highlight the need for research to test whether integration policies can have similar outcomes.

The new European medium size tokamak task force (EU-MST) coordinates research on ASDEX Upgrade (AUG), MAST and TCV. This multi-machine approach within EU-MST, covering a wide parameter range, is instrumental to progress in the field, as ITER and DEMO core/pedestal and SOL parameters are not achievable simultaneously in present day devices. A two prong approach is adopted. On the one hand, scenarios with tolerable transient heat and particle loads, including active edge localised mode (ELM) control are developed. On the other hand, divertor solutions including advanced magnetic configurations are studied. Considerable progress has been made on both approaches, in particular in the fields of: ELM control with resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP), small ELM regimes, detachment onset and control, as well as filamentary scrape-off-layer transport. For example full ELM suppression has now been achieved on AUG at low collisionality with n = 2 RMP maintaining good confinement . Advances have been made with respect to detachment onset and control. Studies in advanced divertor configurations (Snowflake, Super-X and X-point target divertor) shed new light on SOL physics. Cross field filamentary transport has been characterised in a wide parameter regime on AUG, MAST and TCV progressing the theoretical and experimental understanding crucial for predicting first wall loads in ITER and DEMO. Conditions in the SOL also play a crucial role for ELM stability and access to small ELM regimes. © 2017 Culham Centre for Fusion Energy.",alternative divertor concepts; ASDEX upgrade; divertor; edge localised modes; heat loads; MAST; TCV,Fusion reactor divertors; Plasma turbulence; Sols; Thermal load; alternative divertor concepts; ASDEX upgrade; divertor; Localised; MAST; Magnetoplasma

Methods: Research was conducted with smallholder farmers in 2013 and 2014 in two communities in the Upper West Region of Ghana to evaluate the effects of NPK mineral fertilizer (64-38-38 kg ha-1 N-P2O5-K2O, respectively) on growth and yield of maize at Bompari, and 375 kg ha-1 of YaraLegume™ fertilizer (0-18-13 NPK + 3 CaO + 2 MgO + 4 S) on growth and yield of soybean at Doggoh, under no-tillage (using pre-plant application of glyphosate) and conventional tillage (using hand hoe). Results: Mean grain yields of both maize and soybean were higher in 2014 than 2013. In both years, no-tillage and conventional tillage had similar effect on soybean plant height, pods per plant and aboveground dry matter production. Averaging over fertilizer treatment, grain yield of no-tillage soybean was 51% higher when compared with tilled soybean in 2014 only. Mean grain yield of no-tillage maize was 68% higher than that of tilled maize in 2013 only. Regardless of tillage method, fertilizer application significantly increased maize and soybean grain yields. Application of fertilizer to soybean resulted in 59% (193 kg ha-1) and 54% (474 kg ha-1) increase in grain yields in 2013 and 2014, respectively, over no fertilizer treatment. Mean grain yield of maize was 140 and 252% higher with fertilizer treatment in 2013 and 2014, respectively. No-till system showed cost savings due to reduced labour mainly for weed control. Conclusion: The results of these studies showed that no-tillage with fertilizer, whether for maize or soybean, generally resulted in the highest grain yields. No-tillage also gave the highest economic returns. Farmers can get better returns to the money invested in herbicide for producing maize and soybean under no-till than with their traditional practice even on degraded savanna soils with low levels of plant available nutrients. © 2017 The Author(s).",Economic analysis; Ghana; Maize; Mineral fertilizer; No-till; Rainfall; Soil fertility; Soybean,

The national economy is vulnerable to climate change due to 50% of the gross domestic product coming from the agricultural sector and 75% of the population living in rural areas. The Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) concept arises from a need to provide innovative solutions towards the complex and integrated goals of increasing yields, improving resilience, and promoting a low emissions agricultural sector. A major challenge for policymakers to operationalize CSA is the identification, valuation (cost-benefit), and subsequent prioritization of climate-smart options and portfolios (groups of CSA options) for investment. This paper presents the process, results, and lessons learned from a yearlong pilot of the Climate-Smart Agriculture Prioritization Framework (CSA-PF) in Mali. Key national and international stakeholders participated in the co-development and prioritization of two CSA portfolios and related action plans for the Malian Sudanese zone.

This approach has proved inefficient because of low adoption of the so-called improved technologies. This paper describes the strategic approaches to the development of a climate-smart village (CSV) model in the groundnut basin of Senegal. A CSV model is a participatory integrated approach using climate information, improved context-based technologies/practices aiming at reachingimproved productivity (food and nutrition security), climate resilient people and ecosystem and climate mitigation. In this study, participatory vulnerability analysis, planning adaptation capacity and participatory communication for development were implemented, putting people affected by the impacts of climate change (CC) at the center of the approach. Four interdependent groups of activities/domains, namely-local and institutional knowledge, use of climate information services, development of climate-smart technology and local development plans, were covered. It was emphasized, how all this taken together could create improved livelihoods for women, men and vulnerable groups. Results: The approach made it possible to involve local people in the decision-making process for the development of their adaptation capacity to CC. It also helped to set up an overall land management process by identifying and addressing environmental (sustainable resource management, ecosystem resilience) and socioeconomic (institutional organization, empowerment, poverty alleviation and food security) challenges. A monitoring survey revealed that farmers appreciate well this participatory approach compared to previous top-down approach in that the former allow them to own the process. Also determinant drivers of adoption of the technologies were identified. Conclusion: Scaling this community development model in sites with similar climatic and socioeconomic conditions could help in contributing toward achieving food security in rural areas at wider scale because of better enthusiasm and engagement from rural farmers to pursue solution to their constraints taking into consideration constraints posed by climate and more need based and tailored advisory services. © 2017 The Author(s).",Adaptation; Climate-smart technologies; Resilience; Sustainable development,

They are more likely to cooperate if others cooperated before, and are ready to retaliate if others defected. To capture the emergence of reciprocity, most previous models consider subjects who can only choose from a restricted set of representative strategies, or who react to the outcome of the very last round only. As players memorize more rounds, the dimension of the strategy space increases exponentially. This increasing computational complexity renders simulations for individuals with higher cognitive abilities infeasible, especially if multiplayer interactions are taken into account. Here, we take an axiomatic approach instead. We propose several properties that a robust cooperative strategy for a repeated multiplayer dilemma should have. These properties naturally lead to a unique class of cooperative strategies, which contains the classical Win-Stay Lose-Shift rule as a special case. A comprehensive numerical analysis for the prisoner's dilemma and for the public goods game suggests that strategies of this class readily evolve across various memory-n spaces. Our results reveal that successful strategies depend not only on how cooperative others were in the past but also on the respective context of cooperation.",Evolutionary game theory; Reciprocity; Repeated games,"Article; behavior; controlled study; cooperation; coordination; human; imitation; memory; priority journal; prisoner dilemma; simulation; biological model; memory; physiology; Humans; Memory; Models, Neurological"

The observations achieve a sensitivity of 17 µJy and a resolution of 0.28 arcsec (2.1 au at a distance of 7.66 pc), which are the highest resolution observations to date of the millimetre grains in Fomalhaut's main debris ring. The ring is tightly constrained to 139+−23 au with a full width at half-maximum of 13 ± 3 au, following a Gaussian profile. The millimetre spectral index is constrained to αmm = −2.73 ± 0.13. We explore fitting debris disc models in the image plane, as well as fitting models using visibility data directly. The results are compared and the potential advantages/disadvantages of each approach are discussed. The detected central emission is indistinguishable from a point source, with a most probable flux of 0.90 ± 0.12 mJy (including calibration uncertainties). This implies that any inner debris structure, as was inferred from far-infrared observations, must contribute little to the total central emission. Moreover, the stellar flux is less than 70 per cent of that predicted by extrapolating a blackbody from the constrained stellar photosphere temperature. This result emphasizes that unresolved inner debris components cannot be fully characterized until the behaviour of the host star's intrinsic stellar emission at millimetre wavelengths is properly understood. © 2016 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society",Circumstellar matter,

This is combined to other drivers such as population growth and livestock number increase. To cope with such changing environment, endogenous adaptation strategies of poor local communities rely on the use of natural resources through empirical knowledge. Unfortunately, these knowledge and practices are insufficiently known to policy makers, and this hampers their consideration in the elaboration of adaptation strategies. A household survey was conducted in the Sillia village in northern Burkina Faso using semi-structured interviews. This study identified most used (preferred) species in this changing environment together with their ethnobotanical use value (VUET). Results: Overall, 86 ligneous species were listed in seven (7) use categories: human nutrition, fodder, fuel, traditional medicine, handicraft, construction and trade. From the 86 species, 11 appeared the most preferred by local population (VUET ≥ 6). Except Piliostigma reticulatum and Boscia senegalensis, all these species were part of the 21 very vulnerable species as revealed by the study. Tamarindus indica, Balanites aegyptiaca, Lannea microcarpa and Vitellaria paradoxa are the first most preferred species (VUET ≥ 7) and also most vulnerable (IV > 2.5). In this changing environment, Cassia sieberiana, Combretum micranthum, Balanites aegyptica have, for instance, become the main species used in traditional medicine replacing Ximenia americana, Coclospermum tinctorim, Maytenus senegalensis and Securidaca longepedunculata, formerly used for this need. Also, Piliostigma reticulatum is the main species used in farm lands to combat low soil fertility. Pterocarpus lucens and Adansonia digitata are the main fodder species both during dry and rainy seasons. Apart from the household surveys, vegetation survey was conducted on 96 plots in Sillia. The results showed that 25 species cited in the household surveys had locally disappeared, 22 were rare, 5 were abundant and the others were relatively abundant. Certain collection practices of given species in many use categories increase their vulnerability. Conclusion: This study documented preferred species in the adaptation strategies to changing environments and also assessed their vulnerability status under human influence; it is therefore of great use for designing sustainable management. © 2017 The Author(s).",Ligneous species; Semi-arid zone; Uses; Vulnerability; West Africa,

Twenty-four infants with bronchiolitis were recruited: 12 were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)–positive, 12 were RSV-negative. Infants were sampled by nasosorption and nasopharyngeal aspiration (NPA). Results. Nasosorption was well tolerated and identified all RSV+ samples. RSV load measured by nasosorption (but not NPA) correlated with length of hospital stay (P = .04) and requirement for mechanical ventilation (P = .03). Nasosorption (but not NPA) levels of interferon γ, interleukin 1β, CCL5/ RANTES, and interleukin 10 (IL-10) were elevated in RSV+ bronchiolitis (all P < .05), furthermore CCL5 and IL-10 correlated with RSV load (P < .05). Conclusions. Nasosorption allowed measurement of RSV load and the mucosal inflammatory response in infants. © The Author 2017.

In this paper, we assess the usefulness, constraints, and factors likely to influence farmers' decisions to patronize mobile phone-based weather and market information. Methods: We rely on primary data from 310 farmers in the Upper West Region, an understudied part of Ghana. We subject the data to three types of analysis. First, we model farmers' decision to patronize mobile phone-based weather and market information by estimating a binary logit model. Second, we use descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing to analyse the level of usefulness of mobile phone-based weather and market information. We disaggregate the analysis by sex, income status, and age group. Finally, we use qualitative analysis to summarize the constraints associated with the utilization of mobile phone-based weather and market information. Results: We find that contact with agricultural extension agents and farmer-to-farmer extension services significantly influences farmers' decision to patronize mobile phone-based weather and market information. Regardless of sex, income status, and age group, farmers generally rate mobile phone-based weather and market information as very useful. We identify inexact information, complex text messages, information that are too costly to implement, and poor infrastructure as the constraints to the utilization of mobile phone-based weather and market information. Conclusion: In order to improve the utilization of mobile phone-based weather and market information, disseminators of mobile phone-based information such as Esoko should constantly update and provide client-specific information. Improvements in mobile phone networks and related services will enhance the utilization of mobile phone-based weather and market information. © 2017 The Author(s).",Agricultural extension; Binary logit; Esoko; Ghana; Mobile phone; Weather and market information,

Its leaves, fruits and seeds are important for income generation and food and nutrition security of local communities. Its fruit pulp is rich in vitamin C and calcium, among other nutrients. Domestication of baobab, using mother trees with desired traits for vegetative mass propagation and planting, could meet the increasing demand for baobab pulp and the decreasing abundance of the trees in natural habitats. Two grafting methods were tested in the ICRAF nursery site (Nairobi, Kenya) to identify a suitable propagation technique. Two mother trees were selected (Trees 1 and 2) for harvesting scions. ‘Top cleft’ and ‘side veneer’ grafting were performed on a total of 38 rootstocks for each mother tree (20 of 1-year and 18 of 2-year age), resulting in a total of 76 grafted trees. The grafted trees were then followed during eight months. The experiment was conducted to evaluate grafting success and shoot growth. Statistical analyses included Binomial Logistic Regression for survival rates and three-factorial ANOVA for shoot length. The overall grafting survival rate was 63%. Top cleft grafting showed slightly more survival success than side veneer (71% vs. 55%, p = 0.114). Using 2-year old rootstock was significantly more successful than 1-year old ones (75% vs. 53%; p = 0.029). Using scions from mother Tree 1 was significantly more successful than from Tree 2 (82% vs. 45%; p = 0.001). Length of new shoots growing from the scions of the successful grafts did not significantly differ among the treatments. Our results showed that both grafting methods and rootstock ages were successful and can contribute to the development of baobab domestication programmes for improving food security and livelihoods in African drylands. © 2016 The Author(s).

In addition, the small amount of rain falls as heavy storms in very short periods of time leading to water losses by runoff which in turn causes a lot of erosion. The two phenomena therefore call for a combination of both strategic (combating erosion) and tactical (coping with inter- and intra-annual rainfall variability) measures to cope with the production uncertainties in such risk-prone environment. As opposed to most farmers' practice of using the same variety, a tactical solution of using varieties of different cycles for different rainfall amounts/patterns was thought to be worth testing. Varieties of different cycles for different rainfall amounts/patterns were combined with a well-known soil and water conservation practice which is the contour ridge tillage (CRT). The combined effects of the two measures on the production of different varieties of sorghum and millet as well as on soil water content were assessed in on-farm participatory trials in five villages. The experiment was run during three consecutive years (2012, 2013 and 2014). Results: A key finding of this research is that regardless of the yearly rainfall amount and provided CRT is used, there were large differences in yields between improved varieties and local ones. This is a result of higher soil water conservation and better response of the improved varieties. Conclusion: The use of CRT increases considerably the yields of improved varieties of the most important staple crops of the Cinzana commune which are millet and sorghum. Thus, the use of these early maturing improved varieties, along with CRT, could be an accessible adaptation strategy to climate variability by farmers. © 2017 The Author(s).",Climate variability; Improved varieties; Mitigation; Soil moisture,

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the seasonality and association with climate factors (temperature and precipitation) on the incidences of DF in four provinces where the highest incidence rates were observed from 1994 to 2013 in Vietnam. Methods: Incidence rates (per 100,000) were calculated on a monthly basis from during the study period. The seasonal-decomposition procedure based on loess (STL) was used in order to assess the trend and seasonality of DF. In addition, a seasonal cycle subseries (SCS) plot and univariate negative binomial regression (NBR) model were used to evaluate the monthly variability with statistical analysis. Lastly, a generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to assess the relationship between monthly incidence rates and weather factors (temperature and precipitation). Results: We found that increased incidence rates were observed in the second half of each year (from May through December) which is the rainy season in each province. In Hanoi, the final model showed that 1 °C rise of temperature corresponded to an increase of 13% in the monthly incidence rate of DF. In Khanh Hoa, the final model displayed that 1 °C increase in temperature corresponded to an increase of 17% while 100 mm increase in precipitation corresponded to an increase of 11% of DF incidence rate. For Ho Chi Minh City, none of variables were significant in the model. In An Giang, the final model showed that 100 mm increase of precipitation in the preceding and same months corresponded to an increase of 30% and 22% of DF incidence rate.

This paper presents a collaborative filtering approach to AS. Collaborative filtering, popularized by the Netflix challenge, aims to recommend the items that a user will most probably like, based on the previous items she liked, and the items that have been liked by other users. As first noted by Stern et al. [47], algorithm selection can be formalized as a collaborative filtering problem, by considering that a problem instance “likes better“ the algorithms that achieve better performance on this particular instance. Two merits of collaborative filtering (CF) compared to the mainstream algorithm selection (AS) approaches are the following. Firstly, mainstream AS requires extensive and computationally expensive experiments to learn a performance model, with all algorithms launched on all problem instances, whereas CF can exploit a sparse matrix, with a few algorithms launched on each problem instance. Secondly, AS learns a performance model as a function of the initial instance representation, whereas CF builds latent factors to describe algorithms and instances, and uses the associated latent metrics to recommend algorithms for a specific problem instance. A main contribution of the proposed algorithm recommender ALORS system is to handle the cold start problem – emitting recommendations for a new problem instance – through the non-linear modeling of the latent factors based on the initial instance representation, extending the linear approach proposed by Stern et al. [47]. The merits and generality of ALORS are empirically demonstrated on the ASLib [6] and OpenML [53] benchmarks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Algorithm selection; Collaborative filtering; Constraint programming; Constraint satisfaction; Meta-learning,Computer programming; Constraint theory; Learning algorithms; Recommender systems; Algorithm portfolios; Algorithm selection; Cold start problems; Constraint programming; Constraint Satisfaction; Metalearning; Performance Model; Problem instances; Collaborative filtering

We review the realities of REDD+ implementation in 13 REDD+ candidate countries and the risks related to REDD+ policies and benefit sharing based upon a synthesis of the findings presented in 'country profiles' that were developed between 2009 and 2013 as part of the Center for International Forestry Research's (CIFOR) Global Comparative Study on REDD+. We find that REDD+ policies in all countries studied are at high risk of ineffectiveness, inequity and inefficiency. By classifying these risks and understanding not only their impacts on different stakeholder groups, but also the consequences for achieving specific objectives, countries can identify solutions in order to address these shortcomings in their implementation of REDD+. © 2016 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.",benefit sharing; carbon rights; climate change; governance; multilevel governance; policy implementation; REDD+; risks,Deforestation; Design; Forestry; Risks; Benefit sharing; governance; Multi-level governance; Policy implementations; REDD; Climate change; carbon sequestration; deforestation; design method; emission control; environmental planning; environmental policy; environmental risk; global perspective; governance approach; policy implementation; stakeholder; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

Although burning of straw residues emits large amounts of CO2, this component of the smoke is not considered as net GHG emissions and only concludes the annual carbon cycle that has started with photosynthesis. Hence, we focused on emissions of CH4 and N2O from open-field burning against a baseline of straw incorporation. The experimental approach combined a newly designed combustion chamber for the collection of smoke followed by chemical analysis (Exp. A) as well as field observations of soil-borne emissions for different straw treatments (Exp. B). At constant straw moisture of 10%, the mass-scaled Emission Factors (EFm) were 4.51 g CH4 and 0.069 g N2O per kg dry weight (kg−1dw) of straw. In Exp. B, we conducted field trials over two seasons with the following straw management practices: SRt − straw retained including stubbles and incorporated, PSRm − partial straw removal only stubbles incorporated, CSRm − complete straw removal including removal of stubbles, and SB − straw burned followed by incorporation of ash and unburned residues. Soil-borne emissions were recorded with a closed chamber approach whereas straw burning was computed indirectly using the EF from Exp. A. As metrics for comparison, we have used the GWP contributions of CH4 and N2O for the different straw management practices over two cropping seasons in the field. On an annual basis, SRt had the highest total GWP (8023 kg CO2eq ha−1). SB entailed a GWP of 4913 kg CO2eq ha−1 that was almost identical to the GWP of PSRm (4531 kg CO2eq ha−1). CSRm had the lowest GWP (3470 kg CO2eq ha−1) that was significantly lower than that of SRt. However, full GHG accounting of straw removed from the field will depend on the ensuing utilization of straw and the off-field emissions involved − which was outside of the boundaries of this study.

Model improvements can improve the accuracy of simulations and reduce the uncertainty of climate change impact assessments. Furthermore, they can reduce the number of models needed in a MME. Herein, 15 wheat growth models of a larger MME were improved through re-parameterization and/or incorporating or modifying heat stress effects on phenology, leaf growth and senescence, biomass growth, and grain number and size using detailed field experimental data from the USDA Hot Serial Cereal experiment (calibration data set). Simulation results from before and after model improvement were then evaluated with independent field experiments from a CIMMYT world-wide field trial network (evaluation data set). Model improvements decreased the variation (10th to 90th model ensemble percentile range) of grain yields simulated by the MME on average by 39% in the calibration data set and by 26% in the independent evaluation data set for crops grown in mean seasonal temperatures >24 °C. MME mean squared error in simulating grain yield decreased by 37%. A reduction in MME uncertainty range by 27% increased MME prediction skills by 47%. Results suggest that the mean level of variation observed in field experiments and used as a benchmark can be reached with half the number of models in the MME. Improving crop models is therefore important to increase the certainty of model-based impact assessments and allow more practical, i.e. smaller MMEs to be used effectively. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",High temperature; Impact uncertainty; Model improvement; Multi-model ensemble; Wheat crop model,agricultural modeling; benchmarking; climate change; crop improvement; crop yield; data set; ensemble forecasting; environmental impact assessment; environmental stress; experimental study; high temperature; model validation; temperature effect; uncertainty analysis; wheat; Triticum aestivum

Reproducing these correlations has long been a problem for hierarchical galaxy formation theory, both in semi-analytic models and cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We show that a simulation in which gas cooling in massive dark haloes is quenched by radio-mode active galactic nuclei (AGNs) feedback naturally reproduces the observed trend between α/Fe and the velocity dispersion of galaxies, σ. The quenching occurs earlier for more massive galaxies. Consequently, these galaxies complete their star formation before α/Fe is diluted by the contribution from Type Ia supernovae. For galaxies more massive than ~1011M⊙, whose α/Fe correlates positively with stellar mass, we find an inversely correlated mass-metallicity relation. This is a common problem in simulations in which star formation in massive galaxies is quenched either by quasar- or radio-mode AGN feedback. The early suppression of gas cooling in progenitors of massive galaxies prevents them from recapturing enriched gas ejected as winds. Simultaneously reproducing the [α/Fe]-σ relation and the mass-metallicity relation is, thus, difficult in the current framework of galaxy formation. © 2016 The Authors.

These practices present productivity and mitigation benefits and in some cases may also contribute to enhance resilience. In this study, we used a data set of 1538 farm households across nine Sub-Saharan countries. A mixed logit model was used to assess the influence on adoption and to estimate the probability of adoption. Our results show that there seems to be stronger influence of physical and financial capitals on adoption than the other capitals. Different types of capitals influence the uptake of different agricultural practices. Yet the probability of adoption would change across countries.

Based on the conventional LQR method, the proposed controller is designed and makes the following two improvements. First, in order to eliminate the phase error caused by right-half-phase zero emerged in non-minimum phase boost converter, a feedforward controller is implemented by zero phase error tracking control technique because the inverse of non-minimum phase system is unstable. Second, since the models of DC-DC converter in CCM or DCM are different, the proposed control strategy allows boost converter to autonomously operate in CCM or DCM controller by utilising a mode detector. The proposed mode detector greatly enhances the control performance in both operating modes. Finally, the proposed controller has been implemented for voltage control of a boost converter.

Forty-four people died as a result of the superstorm, and the ongoing governmental recovery plans have estimated nearly three billion Fijian dollars (£1.1 billion) in damages. Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, in a national address following Winston, stated ‘almost no part of our nation has been left unscarred’. This paper explores the adaptation measures for extreme weather and climate change in Fiji following Winston, as well as the author’s experiences both as a survivor of Winston and as a volunteer aid-relief worker living in Suva, the Fijian capital, at the time of the superstorm. Notably, Winston struck 5 days after Fiji became the first nation to ratify the United Nations Climate deal agreed to by 195 nations in Paris in December 2015. Many Pacific island nations have played a vital role in leading the global dialogue on climate change. In the lead up to the Paris summit, Prime Minister Bainimarama, stressed that ‘unless the world acts decisively in the coming weeks to begin addressing the greatest challenge of our age, then the Pacific, as we know it, is doomed.’ This is undoubtedly true and a global response is desperately needed, but equally true is the importance for such a reaction to be a cultural and faith-integrated process across multiple scales, ranging from village and community to regional, in scope. One critical aspect of extreme weather and climate change response in the Pacific is migration. However, the impacts of migration include organizing, adaptation and urban poverty, a further source of vulnerability. Consequently, human mobility in response to extreme weather and climate change is far more complex than originally addressed and is deserving of deeper consideration. © 2017 WIT Press,",Climate change; Extreme weather; Faith-based organisations (FBOs); Fiji; Mobility; Resiliency; Tropical cyclone Winston,Carrier mobility; Hurricanes; Storms; Extreme weather; Faith-based organisations (FBOs); Fiji; Resiliency; Tropical cyclone; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; extreme event; global climate; integrated approach; Southern Hemisphere; storm; tropical cyclone; United Nations; village; Fiji; Fiji; Pacific Ocean; Suva; Viti Levu

We classify six regions in the planet's mass versus semimajor axis parameter space according to the dominant outcome for scattered objects: ejected, accreted, remaining, escaping, Oort Cloud, and depleted Oort Cloud. We use these outcomes to consider which planetary system architectures maximize the observability of specific signatures, given that signatures should be detected first around systems with optimal architectures (if such systems exist in nature). Giant impact debris is most readily detectable for 0.1-10 M⊕ planets at 1-5 au, depending on the detection method and spectral type. While A stars have putative giant impact debris at 4-6 au consistent with this sweet spot, that of FGK stars is typically ≪1 au contrary to expectations; an absence of 1-3 au giant impact debris could indicate a low frequency of terrestrial planets there. Three principles maximize the cometary influx from exo-Kuiper belts: a chain of closely separated planets interior to the belt, none of which is a Jupiter-like ejector; planet masses not increasing strongly with distance (for a net inward torque on comets); and ongoing replenishment of comets, possibly by embedded low-mass planets. A high Oort Cloud comet influx requires no ejectors and architectures that maximize the Oort Cloud population. Cold debris discs are usually considered classical Kuiper belt analogues.

Among them, post-compression rate-distortion optimization (PCRD-Opt) is the most widely used, and the one recommended by the standard. The approach followed by this method is to first compress the entire image split in code blocks, and subsequently, optimally truncate the set of generated bit streams according to the maximum target bit rate constraint. The literature proposes various strategies on how to estimate ahead of time where a block will get truncated in order to stop the execution prematurely and save time. However, none of them have been defined bearing in mind a parallel implementation. Today, multi-core and many-core architectures are becoming popular for JPEG 2000 codecs implementations. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze how some techniques for efficient rate control can be deployed in GPUs. In order to do that, the design of our GPU-based codec is extended, allowing stopping the process at a given point. This extension also harnesses a higher level of parallelism on the GPU, leading to up to 40% of speedup with 4K test material on a Titan X. In a second step, three selected rate control methods are adapted and implemented in our parallel encoder. A comparison is then carried out, and used to select the best candidate to be deployed in a GPU encoder, which gave an extra 40% of speedup in those situations where it was really employed. © 2017 SPIE.",EBCOT; GPGPU; Image Compression; JPEG 2000; Rate Control,Computer architecture; Electric distortion; Graphics processing unit; Image coding; Image processing; Program processors; Signal distortion; Signal encoding; EBCOT; GPGPU; JPEG 2000; Multi core and many cores; Parallel implementations; Post compression rate distortion; Rate controls; Target bit rate; Image compression

In particular, rising powers such as Brazil, China, and India regularly reject the idea that coercion should be a feature of world politics, and they portray military intervention as irresponsible. But this raises the problem of how a society's norms can be upheld without coercive measures. Critics have accused them of free riding on existing great powers and failing to address the dilemma of how to deal with actors undermining societal values. This article examines writing on responsibility and international society, with particular reference to the English School, to identify why the willingness and capacity to use force-as well as creative thinking in this regard-are seen as important aspects of responsibility internationally. It then explores statements made by Brazil, China, and India in UN Security Council meetings between 2011 and 2016 to identify which actors they see as responsible and how they define responsible action. In doing so, it pinpoints areas of concurrence as well as disagreements in their understandings of the concept of responsibility, and concludes that Brazil and India have a more coherent and practical understanding of the concept than China, which risks incurring the label great irresponsible.

Here, intraoperative navigation-based guidance technologies may provide outcome. In this study, gamma camera-based freehandSPECT was evaluated in combination with the hybrid tracer ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid. Materials and methods: Eight patients with melanoma located in the head-and-neck area were included. Indocyanine green (ICG)-99mTc-nanocolloid was injected preoperatively, whereafter lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT imaging were performed in order to define the location of the SN(s). FreehandSPECT scans were generated in the operation room using a portable gamma camera. For lesion localization during surgery, freehandSPECT scans were projected in an augmented reality video-view that was used to spatially position a gamma-ray detection probe. Intraoperative fluorescence imaging was used to confirm the accuracy of the navigation-based approach and identify the exact location of the SNs. Results: Preoperatively, 15 SNs were identified, of which 14 were identified using freehandSPECT. Navigation towards these nodes using the freehandSPECT approach was successful in 13 nodes. Fluorescence imaging provided optical confirmation of the navigation accuracy in all patients. In addition, fluorescence imaging allowed for the identification of (clustered) SNs that could not be identified based on navigation alone. Conclusions: The use of gamma camera-based freehandSPECT aids intraoperative lesion identification and, with that, supports the transition from pre- to intraoperative imaging via augmented reality display and directional guidance. © 2017, The Author(s).",Augmented reality; Dual modality imaging; Fluorescence; Image guided surgery; Melanoma; Nuclear medicine; Sentinel node; Surgical navigation; Virtual reality,

This study was therefore conducted to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the effect of long-term CO2 exposure on the chemico-mineralogical structure and corresponding strength characteristics of saline aquifer rock formations using silicate cement (SS) and carbonate cement (CS) Hawkesbury sandstone samples collected from the Sydney basin. Sandstone samples were first reacted with brine+CO2 under different injection pressures (both sub-critical (4, 6 MPa) and super-critical (8, 10 MPa)) under a constant temperature of 35 °C. A comprehensive chemico-mineralogical analysis (ICP-AES and XRD) was first conducted on both the rock mass pore fluid and the rock matrix over the saturation period of one year, giving special attention to the alteration of dominant rock minerals (quartz, calcite and kaolinite). The overall influence after 12 months of saturation with brine and CO2 on the strength characteristics of the two types of sandstones (SS and CS) was then investigated and correlated with the chemico-mineralogical reaction, in order to understand the coupled process. According to the test results, compared to the silicate cement-dominant mineral structure (SS), the presence of a carbonate cement-dominant mineral structure (CS) in the aquifer rock formation creates more significant alterations in the formation's chemico-mineralogical structure upon CO2 injection. This is because calcite mineral reactions occur at much greater rates compared to quartz mineral reactions in CO2-exposed environments. In addition, although some minor precipitation of kaolinite minerals may also occur upon CO2 injection, the effect may not be significant. Overall, rock mineral changes in deep saline aquifers upon CO2 injection have a significant influence on the strength characteristics of the reservoir rock mass, depending on the aquifer mineral structure, and CS formations are subject to much greater strength property changes upon exposure to CO2 than SS formations. Interestingly, CO2 injection causes a strength gain in SS sandstone and a strength reduction in CS sandstone. These mechanical property alterations in aquifer rock formations are also dependent on the CO2 injection pressure and phase, and increasing the injecting CO2 pressure significantly enhances the changes, due to the highly acidic environment created by the enhanced CO2 solubility process. Changing the CO2 phase from sub- to super-critical condition also accelerates the reaction mechanisms, due to the greater chemical potential of super-critical CO2. However, overall SS sandstone exhibits more stable chemical-mineralogical and mechanical characteristics upon CO2 injection than CS sandstone, and exhibits more suitable characteristics for CO2 sequestration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Carbonate; Chemical; Mechanical; Mineralogical; Sequestration; Silicate,Aquifers; Atmospheric structure; Atomic emission spectroscopy; Calcite; Carbonates; Carbonation; Cements; Chemicals; Hydrogeology; Kaolinite; Mechanical properties; Mechanisms; Minerals; Quartz; Rock mechanics; Rocks; Sandstone; Silicates; Structural properties; Experimental investigations; Mechanical; Mechanical characteristics; Mineralogical; Mineralogical analysis; Mineralogical properties; Sequestration; Strength characteristics; Carbon dioxide; aquifer; atmospheric gas; brine; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbonate; cement; chemical alteration; chemical composition; experimental study; fluid injection; hydrogeochemistry; hydromechanics; hypersaline environment; mineral; mineralogy; rock microstructure; sandstone; solubility; underground storage; water-rock interaction

This is achieved by designing an unknown input observer combined with a set-membership estimation in the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. The observer is designed using quadratic boundedness approach that is used to overbound the estimation error. Sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of the proposed state and actuator fault estimator are expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

Infections of pigs with gastrointestinal helminths can limit production output, increase production costs, and pose zoonotic risks. A cross-sectional, community-based study in three districts in Eastern and Central Uganda examined the prevalence of gastrointestinal helminthes and associated risk factors in 932 randomly sampled pigs. Using the combined sedimentation-flotation method, 61.4 % (58.2–64.5 %, 95 % confidence interval [CI]) tested positive for one or more gastrointestinal helminths, namely, strongyles (57.1 %, 95 % CI), Metastrongylus spp. (7.6 %, 95 % CI), Ascaris suum (5.9 %, 95 % CI), Strongyloides ransomi (4.2 %, 95 % CI), and Trichuris suis (3.4 %, 95 % CI). Coccidia oocysts were found in 40.7 % of all pigs sampled (37.5–44.0 %, 95 % CI). Significant differences across the three districts were observed for the presence of A. suum (p < 0.001), Metastrongylus spp. (p = 0.001), S. ransomi (p = 0.002), and coccidia oocysts (p = 0.05). All animals tested negative for Fasciola spp. and Balantidium coli. Thirty-five variables were included in univariable analyses with helminth infection as the outcome of interest. A causal model was generated to identify relationships among the potential predictors, and consequently, seven variables with p ≤ 0.15 were included in a multivariable analysis for helminth infection. The final regression models showed that routine management factors had a greater impact on the prevalence of infection than regular, preventive medical treatment or the level of confinement. Factors that negatively correlated with gastrointestinal infection were the routine removal of manure and litter from pig pens (p ≤ 0.05, odds ratio [OR] = 0.667) and the routine use of disinfectants (p ≤ 0.05, OR = 0.548). © 2016, The Author(s).",Coccidia; Gastrointestinal helminths; Husbandry practices; Pigs; Risk factors; Uganda,"albendazole; coccidiostatic agent; ivermectin; levamisole; piperazine; antihelminthic therapy; Article; Ascaris suum; Coccidia; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; flotation; gastrointestinal infection; helminthiasis; intestine parasite; male; Metastrongylus; nonhuman; oocyst; pig; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; sedimentation; Strongyloidea; Strongyloides; Strongyloides ransomi; Trichuris suis; tropics; Uganda; vaccination; animal; classification; feces; Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic; parasitology; strongyloidiasis; Swine Diseases; trichuriasis; Trichuris; veterinary; Animals; Cross-Sectional Studies; Feces; Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic; Male; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Strongyloides; Strongyloidiasis; Swine; Swine Diseases; Trichuriasis; Trichuris; Uganda"

This paper was synthesized from several scholarly literature and aimed at providing up-to-date information on climate change impacts, adaptation strategies, policies and institutional mechanisms that each agriculture subsector had put in place in dealing with climate change and its related issues in West Africa. For each subsector (crop, fishery and livestock), the current status, climate change impacts, mitigation and adaption strategies have been analyzed. In addition, we reviewed recent policy initiatives in the region that foster the development and adoption of climate-smart agricultural options to improve resilience of farming systems and livelihoods of smallholder farmers to climate change risks.

We quantified C stocks and GHG emissions of 30 dual-purpose cattle farms in Nicaragua using farm inventories and lifecycle analysis. Trees in silvo-pastoral systems were the main C stock aboveground (16-24 Mg ha-1), compared with adjacent secondary forests (43 Mg C ha-1).

Seven farms that we classified as climate-smart agriculture (CSA) out of 16 farms had highest milk yields (6.2 kg cow-1day-1) and lowest emissions (1.7 kg CO2-eq. per kg milk produced). Livestock on these farms had higher-quality diets, especially during the dry season, and manure was managed better.

Yet plausible agricultural development pathways with mitigation cobenefits deliver only 21–40% of needed mitigation.

In particular, we summarize the challenges, advantages and drawbacks of each approach, and discuss future prospects for these technologies. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Dark Matter detectors; Gaseous imaging and tracking detectors; Micropattern gaseous detectors; Nuclear emulsions; Time Projection Chambers; Wire chambers,

This overview piece describes the geographic and methodological scope of these studies, as well as the policy instruments covered in the Collection as of June 2016. Focusing on forest cover change, we systematically compare the conservation effects estimated by the studies and discuss them in the light of previous findings in the literature. Nine studies estimated that annual conservation impacts on forest cover were below one percent, with two exceptions in Mexico and Indonesia. Differences in effect sizes are not only driven by the choice of conservation measures. One key lesson from the studies is the need to move beyond the current scientific focus of estimating average effects of undifferentiated conservation programs. The specific elements of the program design and the implementation context are equally important factors for understanding the effectiveness of conservation programs. Particularly critical will be a better understanding of the causal mechanisms through which conservation programs have impacts. To achieve this understanding we need advances in both theory and methods. © 2016 Börner et al.

This measurement uses events with an opposite-charge electron–muon pair in the final state. Jets containing b-quarks are tagged using an algorithm based on track impact parameters and reconstructed secondary vertices. The numbers of events with exactly one and exactly two b-tagged jets are counted and used to determine simultaneously σtt¯ and the efficiency to reconstruct and b-tag a jet from a top quark decay, thereby minimising the associated systematic uncertainties. The cross-section is measured to be: σtt¯=818±8(stat)±27(syst)±19(lumi)±12(beam) pb, where the four uncertainties arise from data statistics, experimental and theoretical systematic effects, the integrated luminosity and the LHC beam energy, giving a total relative uncertainty of 4.4%.

The extent to which each neuronal population is affected varies between individuals. The subsequent patterns of disease progression form the basis of diagnostic criteria and phenotypic classification systems, with considerable overlap in the clinical terms used. This overlap can lead to confusion between diagnosis and phenotype. Formal classification systems such as the El Escorial criteria and the International Classification of Diseases are systematic approaches but they omit features that are important in clinical management, such as rate of progression, genetic basis, or functional effect. Therefore, many neurologists use informal classification approaches that might not be systematic, and could include, for example, anatomical descriptions such as flail-arm syndrome. A new strategy is needed to combine the benefits of a systematic approach to classification with the rich and varied phenotypic descriptions used in clinical practice. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,biological marker; riluzole; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; assessment of humans; bulbar paralysis; clinical practice; clinical research; cognition; diagnostic test; disease classification; El Escorial criteria; family history; frontotemporal dementia; genetic analysis; genotype environment interaction; human; International Classification of Diseases; laboratory test; medical information; motor dysfunction; motor neuron disease; neuroimaging; neurologic disease; neurologist; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; onset age; pathophysiology; patient coding; phenotype; priority journal; Review; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; classification; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Humans

But mitigation cost assessments have featured opportunity costs, neglecting policy implementation costs. Here we use official data to identify the Brazilian federal government's operational and institutional budgets related to forest conservation policies implemented from 2000 to 2014. We distinguish the allocated and executed budgets of these policies, and provide scenario-based estimates of their cost-effectiveness. On average, Brazil spent US$ 1 billion/year on forest conservation policies at the federal level. Brazil's substantial reduction in annual forest loss after 2004 was accompanied by a higher operational budget execution of disincentive-based policy instruments, and an absolute increase in both allocated and executed institutional budgets. The post-2004 successful mitigation effort represented additional implementation costs to the Brazilian federal government of US$ 308–923/ha of avoided deforestation, or US$ 0.87–2.60/tCO2 of avoided emissions. Factoring in also approximate municipal and state expenditures, these costs increase to US$ 385–1153/ha or US$ 1.09–3.25/tCO2. We conclude that implementations costs are non-trivial in size, including compared to estimates of land users' opportunity costs. This has important implications for REDD + policy design, in the sense that implementation costs need to be adequately considered. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Brazil; Decentralization; Forest conservation; Implementation costs; REDD +;  Policy instruments,climate change; conservation planning; cost analysis; decentralization; deforestation; federal system; forest ecosystem; policy implementation; Brazil

The international process on measurement, reporting and verification of REDD + outcomes (REDD + MRV) expands the scope of forest inventories to include quantification of forest carbon stocks and their changes for results-based REDD + payments. UNFCCC decisions also specify methods to be used, and actors to be involved. Although forest management in developing countries has clearly been influenced by international processes in the past, exactly how and to what extent REDD + MRV has affected institutional arrangements for forest assessments in developing countries remains unknown. Using as a theoretical framework Discursive-Institutionalism, a concept derived from political science, this paper examines (1) the historical evolution of institutional arrangements for forest inventories in Peru; and (2) how and to what extent their development has been shaped by international processes on forests, and, more recently, specifically by REDD + MRV. The findings show that the international REDD + MRV discussion has expanded the objectives of forest assessments in Peru, inspired the mobilization of new actors and resources, and spawned the development of new protocols for forest assessments. However, the ‘depth’ of these changes is not yet extensive, since the new rules for forest inventories have not yet been formally adopted, and the institutes envisaged to implement forest inventories, including measurement of carbon stocks and their changes, have not been established. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Discursive institutionalism; National forest resource assessments; Peru; Policy arrangements approach; REDD + MRV,Deforestation; Developing countries; Natural resources; Societies and institutions; Discursive institutionalism; Forest resource assessments; Historical development; Institutional arrangement; National forests; Peru; REDD + MRV; Sustainable management; Forestry

The application of cattle manure (3tha1), micro-dose (3ghole1 equivalent to 62kgha1) of a mineral fertilizer composed of 14% N, 23% P2O5 and 14% K2O (NPK), their combination and a control (no manure and no NPK) as four soil fertilization options, two improved varieties of millet (SOSAT-C88 and IKMP5), two varieties of cowpea (KVX 396-4-5-2D and KVX 61-1) and two cropping systems (millet-cowpea intercropping, sole crop) were tested on-farm for two seasons (2013 and 2014). During the third season a survey was conducted on the acceptability by farmers of the tested combinations as a way of buffering or coping with rainfall variability. Results: Two-year trial revealed that the combination of manure and NPK applied to the intercropping of millet and cowpea significantly increased crop production (land equivalent ratio=1.83±0.18 and 1.78±0.20, intercropping millet variety IKMP5 with cowpea KVX 61-1 and intercropping millet variety SOSAT-C88 with cowpea KVX 396-4-5-2D, respectively). During erratic rainfall year, intercropping millet IKMP5 and cowpea KVX 61-1 performed the best, while under well-distributed rainfall conditions, intercropping millet SOSAT-C88 with cowpea KVX 396-4-5-2D displayed higher production, respectively, for millet and cowpea. Some varieties were not well accepted by most farmers (based on a survey of 36 farmers) mainly because of loss in grains before harvest for millet IKMP5 (97%) and high grain attacks by insects in storage for cowpea KVX 61-1 (89%). The alternative for farmers rejecting these varieties could be the intercropping of millet SOSAT-C88 and cowpea KVX 396-4-5-2D fertilized with manure. Conclusions: Making weather forecasts and related agronomic advices available to farmers in this region will allow them to better plan their agricultural practices such as mineral fertilizer application and will also be a great move toward climate-smart agriculture. Developing more performant storage measures that drastically reduce insect attacks for some of the tested varieties (cowpea KVX 61-1, for instance) could contribute to promoting their adoption. © 2016 The Author(s).",Acceptability; Climate risks; Climate-smart agriculture; Soil fertilization,

The extent of these two situations is contested in tropical biodiversity hotspots where objective data are limited. Here, we explore delays between deforestation and the establishment of industrial tree plantations on Borneo using satellite imagery. Between 1973 and 2015 an estimated 18.7 Mha of Borneo's old-growth forest were cleared (14.4 Mha and 4.2 Mha in Indonesian and Malaysian Borneo). Industrial plantations expanded by 9.1 Mha (7.8 Mha oil-palm; 1.3 Mha pulpwood). Approximately 7.0 Mha of the total plantation area in 2015 (9.2 Mha) were old-growth forest in 1973, of which 4.5-4.8 Mha (24-26% of Borneo-wide deforestation) were planted within five years of forest clearance (3.7-3.9 Mha oil-palm; 0.8-0.9 Mha pulpwood). This rapid within-five-year conversion has been greater in Malaysia than in Indonesia (57-60% versus 15-16%). In Indonesia, a higher proportion of oil-palm plantations was developed on already cleared degraded lands (a legacy of recurrent forest fires). However, rapid conversion of Indonesian forests to industrial plantations has increased steeply since 2005. We conclude that plantation industries have been the principle driver of deforestation in Malaysian Borneo over the last four decades. In contrast, their role in deforestation in Indonesian Borneo was less marked, but has been growing recently. We note caveats in interpreting these results and highlight the need for greater accountability in plantation development. © 2016 The Author(s).",,Borneo; clearance; deforestation; driver; Elaeis; fire; forest; human; Indonesia; Malaysia; nonhuman; plantation; satellite imagery; agricultural land; agriculture; Arecaceae; Borneo; comparative study; environmental protection; legislation and jurisprudence; politics; procedures; rain forest; time factor; tree; trends; Agriculture; Arecaceae; Borneo; Conservation of Natural Resources; Farms; Indonesia; Malaysia; Politics; Rainforest; Satellite Imagery; Time Factors; Trees

For each group, we calculate hunted animal numbers and biomass available per inhabitant, P, per year (harvest rates) and killed per hunter, H, per year (extraction rates). We assess the impact of hunting of both hunter groups from estimates of numbers and biomass of prey species killed per square kilometre, and by examining the proportion of hunted taxa of low, medium and high population growth rates as a measure of their vulnerability to overhunting. We then map harvested biomass (kg1 P-1 Yr-1) of bushmeat by Pygmies and non-Pygmies throughout the Congo Basin. Hunting patterns differ between Pygmies and non-Pygmies; Pygmies take larger and different prey and non-Pygmies sell more for profit. We show that non-Pygmies have a potentially more severe impact on prey populations than Pygmies. This is because non-Pygmies hunt a wider range of species, and twice as many animals are taken per square kilometre. Moreover, in non-Pygmy settlements there was a larger proportion of game taken of low population growth rate. Our harvest map shows that the non-Pygmy population may be responsible for 27 times more animals harvested than the Pygmy population. Such differences indicate that the intense competition that may arise from the more widespread commercial hunting by non-Pygmies is a far more important constraint and source of conflict than are protected areas. © 2016 Fa et al.

The median u-r of star-forming ('blue cloud') galaxies reddens by 1 mag from z = 2 to 0 at fixed stellar mass, as their specific star formation rates decrease with time. A red sequence starts to build-up around z = 1, due to the quenching of low-mass satellite galaxies at the faint end, and due to the quenching of more massive central galaxies by their active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the bright end. This leaves a dearth of intermediate-mass red sequence galaxies at z = 1, which is mostly filled in by z = 0. We quantify the time-scales of colour transition finding that most galaxies spend less than 2 Gyr in the 'green valley'. We find the time-scale of transition to be independent of quenching mechanism, i.e. whether a galaxy is a satellite or hosting an AGN. On examining the trajectories of galaxies in a colour-stellar mass diagram, we identify three characteristic tracks that galaxies follow (quiescently star-forming, quenching and rejuvenating galaxies) and quantify the fraction of galaxies that follow each track. © 2016 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.",Galaxies: evolution; Galaxies: formation,

Dynamical studies of the inner asteroid belt have identified several families overlapping in proper orbital elements, including the Polana and Eulalia families that contain a large fraction of the low-albedo asteroids in this region.We present results from two coordinated observational campaigns to characterize this region through near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. These campaigns ran from August 2012 to May 2014 and used the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. The observations focused on objects within these families or in the background, with low albedo (pv ≤ 0.1) and low inclination (iP ≤ 7°). We observed 63 asteroids (57 never before observed in the NIR): 61 low-albedo objects and two interlopers, both compatible with S- or E- taxonomical types.We found our sample to be spectrally homogeneous in the NIR. The sample shows a continuum of neutral to moderately-red concave-up spectra, very similar within the uncertainties. Only one object in the sample, asteroid (3429) Chuvaev, has a blue spectrum, with a slope (S'=-1.33± 0.21%/1000 Å) significantly different from the average spectrum (S'=0.68± 0.68%/1000 Å). This spectral homogeneity is independent of membership in families or the background population. Furthermore, we show that the Eulalia and Polana families cannot be distinguished using NIR data. We also searched for rotational variability on the surface of (495) Eulalia which we do not detect. (495) Eulalia shows a red concave-up spectrum with an average slope S'=0.91± 0.60%/1000 Å, very similar to the average slope of our sample.The spectra of two targets of sample-return missions, (101955) Bennu, target of NASA's OSIRIS-Rex and (162173) 1999 JU3 target of the Japanese Space Agency's Hayabusa-2, are very similar to our average spectrum, which would be compatible with an origin in this region of the inner belt. © 2016 Elsevier Inc..","Asteroids, composition; Asteroids, surface; Origin, Solar System; Spectroscopy",

The charged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity and the dependence of the mean transverse momentum on the charged-particle multiplicity are presented. The measurements are performed with charged particles with transverse momentum greater than 500 MeV and absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.5, in events with at least one charged particle satisfying these kinematic requirements.

Capnocytophaga species form a part of human oral flora both in health and disease. They have been implicated as putative periodontal pathogens, and yet, they are less understood members of plaque flora. No studies have been conducted on the association of Capnocytophaga species with periodontal diseases in India. Aim: The aim of this study was to detect the prevalence of Capnocytophaga species in patients with healthy periodontium, gingivitis, and periodontitis using culture method. Methods: Forty patients each with healthy periodontium, gingivitis, and periodontitis were selected. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from all the patients using sterile curettes and transferred to transport medium and sent to the laboratory. The plaque samples were inoculated on blood agar and trypticase-blood-bacitracin-polymyxin agar to grow Capnocytophaga species. Later, Gram-staining and microscopy were done to confirm the presence of Capnocytophaga in each sample. The prevalence of Capnocytophaga species was statistically analyzed using Chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance, and Mann-Whitney U-test. Results: Capnocytophaga was detected in 21 (52.50%) samples out of 40 samples of gingivitis group, 11 (27.50%) samples of healthy group, and 12 (30%) samples of periodontitis group. Conclusions: Capnocytophaga is more prevalent in gingivitis compared to healthy periodontium and periodontitis. Capnocytophaga has the potential to cause periodontal disease, but as it is less competitive in the periodontal pocket, it is usually overgrown by other rapidly growing bacteria. © 2016 Journal of Orofacial Sciences Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Capnocytophaga; culture; gingivitis; periodontitis,

Herein, to overcome these challenges, we report a facile and scalable approach fabricating coral-like SnO2/C composite electrodes through a top-down strategy followed by a sol–gel carbon-coating method. During the synthesis, well-defined SnS2 nanoflowers and dopamine serve as structural template and carbon source for integrating the desired structure. The three-dimensional coral-like SnO2/C composite exhibits a high reversible capacity of 648 mAh g−1 after 50 electrochemical cycles and a low capacity fading of 0.778 % per cycle from the 2nd to the 50th cycle, demonstrating an outstanding cycling stability. It also shows a discharge capacity of 1294, 784, 658, 532, and 434 mAh g−1 at a specific current of 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mAh g−1, respectively, and retains a specific capacity of 719 mAh g−1 when the specific current goes back to 100 mA g−1, displaying an excellent rate capability. Compared to SnS2 nanoflowers and bare interconnected SnO2 nanoparticles anode, the optimized coral-like SnO2/C composite shows significantly improved electrochemical performances in terms of rate capability and cycling reversibility, demonstrating great potential as superior anodes in next-generation lithium ion batteries. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These data were jointly analysed with 5331 harvest weight records from three generations to estimate genetic parameters and correlated selection responses. Multiple trait animal models were used in the analyses. The potential for correlated responses was evaluated by estimating heritabilities and genetic correlations between body traits (weight, length, depth and width) and fillet traits (weight and yield) with the above mentioned flesh characteristics. The heritabilities for protein%, fat% and colour were low (0.06–0.11), whereas for moisture% and pH they were moderate (0.15–0.20).

This article examines institutional effectiveness of REDD+ MRV by assessing countries' progress in implementing these technical guidelines and good governance requirements, from three dimensions. Ownership of technical methods examines whether countries own technical methods for forest area and area change measuring, and for estimating forest carbon stocks; and whether national MRV systems cover all forests, land uses and carbon pools. Administrative capacity examines development of administrative competence to implement MRV. Good governance examines whether countries espouses norms of good governance in their MRV systems. We apply these dimensions to assess and compare progress in 13 REDD+ countries, based on a review of national and international documents. Findings show that REDD+ countries have high to very high ownership of technical methods. However, majority ranks only low to moderate on administrative capacity and good governance. This means that although countries have started developing technical methods for MRV, they are yet to develop the competence necessary to administer MRV and to inculcate good governance in MRV.

The data set used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb-1. Many extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of massive charged long-lived particles, such as R-hadrons. These massive particles are expected to be produced with a velocity significantly below the speed of light, and therefore to have a specific ionization higher than any Standard Model particle of unit charge at high momenta. The Pixel subsystem of the ATLAS detector is used to measure the ionization energy loss of reconstructed charged particles and to search for such highly ionizing particles. The search presented here has much greater sensitivity than a similar search performed using the ATLAS detector in the s=8 TeV data set, thanks to the increase in expected signal cross section due to the higher center-of-mass energy of collisions, to an upgraded detector with a new silicon layer close to the interaction point, and to analysis improvements. No significant deviation from Standard Model background expectations is observed, and lifetime-dependent upper limits on R-hadron production cross sections and masses are set. Gluino R-hadrons with lifetimes above 0.4 ns and decaying to qq plus a 100 GeV neutralino are excluded at the 95% confidence level, with lower mass limit ranging between 740 and 1590 GeV. In the case of stable R-hadrons the lower mass limit at the 95% confidence level is 1570 GeV. © 2016 CERN.",,

The spectrum is relatively flat and does not exhibit a pronounced minimum at λ ∼ 350 μm as suggested by previous measurements of other molecular clouds. The shape of the spectrum does not depend strongly on the radiative environment of the dust, as quantified by the column density or the dust temperature obtained from Herschel data.

Agents are performing computations on complex objects [e.g., (behavioral) patterns, classifiers, clusters, structural objects, sets of rules, aggregation operations, (approximate) reasoning schemes]. In Granular Computing (GrC), all such constructed and/or induced objects are called granules. To model interactive computations performed by agents, crucial for the complex systems, we extend the existing GrC approach to Interactive Granular Computing (IGrC) approach by introducing complex granules (c-granules or granules, for short). Many advanced tasks, concerning complex systems, may be classified as control tasks performed by agents aiming at achieving the high-quality computational trajectories relative to the considered quality measures defined over the trajectories. Here, new challenges are to develop strategies to control, predict, and bound the behavior of the system. We propose to investigate these challenges using the IGrC framework. The reasoning, which aims at controlling of computations, to achieve the required targets, is called an adaptive judgement. This reasoning deals with granules and computations over them. Adaptive judgement is more than a mixture of reasoning based on deduction, induction and abduction. Due to the uncertainty the agents generally cannot predict exactly the results of actions (or plans). Moreover, the approximations of the complex vague concepts initiating actions (or plans) are drifting with time. Hence, adaptive strategies for evolving approximations of concepts are needed. In particular, the adaptive judgement is very much needed in the efficiency management of granular computations, carried out by agents, for risk assessment, risk treatment, and cost/benefit analysis. In the paper, we emphasize the role of the rough set-based methods in IGrC. The discussed approach is a step towards realization of the Wisdom Technology (WisTech) program, and is developed over years, based on the work experience on different real-life projects. © 2015, The Author(s).",(Interactive) granular computing; Adaptive judgement; Big data technology; Cost/benefit analysis; Cyber-physical system; Efficiency management; Interactive computation; Risk management; Rough set; Ultra-large system; Wisdom web of things,

The underlying event is characterised through measurements of the average value of the sum of the transverse energy at large pseudorapidity downstream of one of the protons, which are reported here as a function of hard-scattering kinematic variables. The hard scattering is characterised by the average transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the two highest transverse momentum jets in the event. The dijet kinematics are used to estimate, on an event-by-event basis, the scaled longitudinal momenta of the hard-scattered partons in the target and projectile beam-protons moving toward and away from the region measuring transverse energy, respectively. Transverse energy production at large pseudorapidity is observed to decrease with a linear dependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction in the target proton and to depend only weakly on that in the projectile proton.

The article elaborates this model to account for settlement in Northern Ireland. It argues that what made the difference between relative success in the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 and earlier failures was not short-term actor-oriented mechanisms, or even a lessening of structural inequality alone, but change in a deeper structural configuration, triggered by a change in the role of the British state.

When do these PES schemes likely achieve significant environmental additionality? Using binary logistical regression, we find additionality to be positively influenced by three theoretically recommended PES best design features: spatial targeting, payment differentiation, and strong conditionality, alongside some contextual controls (activity paid for and implementation time elapsed).

This region of the belt is believed to be the most likely origin of the two primitive near-Earth asteroids that are the current targets of two sample return missions: NASA's OSIRIS-REx and JAXA's Hayabusa 2 to Asteroids (101955) Bennu and (162173) Ryugu (also known as 1999 JU3), respectively. Therefore, understanding these families will enhance the scientific return of these missions.We present the results of a spectroscopic survey of asteroids in the region of the Polana-Eulalia family complex, and also asteroids from the background population of low-albedo, low-inclination objects. We obtained visible spectra of a total of 65 asteroids, using the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the 3.6. m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG), both located at the El Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory, in the island of La Palma (Spain), and the 3.6 m New Technology Telescope (NTT), located at the European Southern Observatory of La Silla, in Chile. From the spectral analysis of our sample we found that, in spite of the presence of distinct dynamical groups, the asteroids in this region present spectral homogeneity at visible wavelengths, showing a continuum of spectral slopes, from blue to moderately red, typical of primitive asteroids classified as B- and C-types. We conclude that visible spectra cannot be used to distinguish between members of the Polana and the Eulalia families, or members of the background population.The visible spectra of the two targets of sample return missions, Asteroids Bennu and Ryugu, are compatible with the spectra of the asteroids in this region, supporting previous studies that suggested either the Polana family or the background population as the most likely origins of these NEAs. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Asteroids; Asteroids, composition; Asteroids, dynamics; Near-Earth objects; Origin, Solar System; Spectroscopy",

The surface area of majority of these reservoirs ranges from 3 to 30 ha. In Burkina Faso, a small reservoir is defined by the height of the dam, which should be below 10 m. They have multiple uses: irrigation during dry spells, fishing, livestock watering, domestic use and groundwater recharge through increased infiltration. Although one of the major uses of small reservoirs in the Volta River Basin is for livestock watering, there is limited information, if any, on how livestock management practices affect this use. This study was conducted in communities using five small reservoirs (Bagyalgo, Soumyalga, Goinre, Ninighi and Thiou) in Yatenga Province of Burkina Faso in the Volta River Basin. The aim of the study was to document the multiple uses of small reservoirs in the study sites with an emphasis on access to, and use by, livestock, and conflicts that arise over the use of these reservoirs. Specifically, the objectives of this study are to: (i) document the multiple uses of small reservoirs with a focus on how livestock management practices affect this use; and (ii) identify the proximate and long-term causes of livestock-related conflicts with regard to multiple uses of small reservoirs and strategies to manage them. The results of this study have confirmed the commonly reported trend of the increasing use of the small reservoirs for vegetable production, even though most of the small reservoirs were initially constructed for livestock watering. The competition for use of these small reservoirs for vegetable production and livestock watering is the main challenge to the management of these reservoirs in the study sites. Adult males and boys accounted for at least 60% of the users of small reservoirs in this study. Livestock watering was carried out mainly by adult males and boys, whereas the use of small reservoirs for domestic purposes was dominated by adult females and girls. In addition to the provision of water for livestock, small reservoirs also contributed to supplying feed resources for livestock by providing green forage in the dry season, which accounted for at least 5% of the total dry matter feed. None of the five small reservoirs in the study were used for fodder production. Increased competition over the use of small reservoirs, damage caused by livestock to irrigated crops and vegetables, and an increased number of livestock using the small reservoirs were ranked as the most important causes of conflict. However, most cases of conflict over the use of the small reservoirs were resolved at the community level. Peaceful coexistence in the use of the small reservoirs for vegetable production and livestock watering is essential for reducing the incidence of conflict, and this will require engagement of key stakeholders such as vegetable growers' associations and livestock keepers' associations. © 2012, by IWMI.",,Catchments; Crops; Drought; Recharging (underground waters); Rivers; Vegetables; Watersheds; Agro ecosystems; Domestic purpose; Ground water recharge; Irrigated crops; Limited information; Management practices; Small reservoirs; Vegetable productions; Reservoirs (water)

It was shown that pressure and force evolution are well described by fluid film lubrication equations if cavitation is taken into account. The practically important case that plate separation starts from a mechanical contact condition was only studied by experiments. They showed that quite substantial negative pressures can occur in the gap for a very short time and that the peak forces are varying strongly even between consecutive experiments with equal test conditions. In this paper two models are presented which complement the Reynolds equations with dynamical bubble evolution equations. Initial gap height, bubble number density, and initial bubble radius are the three unknown parameters of these models. Initial gap height accounts for surface roughness, the two other parameters refer to the bubble nucleation of the fluid in the small roughness indentations of the gap. A first model employs the Rayleigh- Plesset bubble dynamic model. It requires that the bubbles stay small compared to the gap. Results show that its stiction force dynamics is two orders of magnitude faster than experimentally observed and that the bubble size condition is violated. The second model assumes that bubbles span over the whole gap height and that the flow of the liquid between the bubbles is guided by the Reynolds equation. This model can be brought into reasonable agreement with the experiments. Force variation from experiment to experiment can at least in part be reproduced by a random variation of the initial bubble sizes. The model exhibits a kind of boundary layer behavior close to the outer boundary. This layer represents the interaction zone between bubble growth dynamics, pressure distribution due to viscous flow, and the pressure boundary condition.

Starch is associated with the shelf life and nutritional value (glycaemic index) of different wheat products. Starch quality is closely associated with the ratio of amylose to amylopectin, the two main macromolecules forming starch. In this review, we briefly summarise the discovery of waxy proteins—shown to be the sole enzymes responsible for amylose synthesis in wheat. The review particularly focuses on the different variants of these proteins, together with their molecular characterisation and evaluation of their effects on starch composition. There have been 19 different waxy protein variants described using protein electrophoresis; and at a molecular level 19, 15 and seven alleles described for Wx-A1, Wx-B1 and Wx-D1, respectively. This large variability, found in modern wheat and genetic resources such as wheat ancestors and wild relatives, is in some cases not properly ordered. The proper ordering of all the data generated is the key to enhancing use in breeding programmes of the current variability described, and thus generating wheat with novel starch properties to satisfy the demand of industry and consumers for novel high-quality processed food. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Biosynthesis; Cyclodextrins; Electrophoresis; Grain (agricultural product); Proteins; Breeding programmes; Current variability; Genetic resources; Molecular characterisation; Molecular characterization; Nutritional value; Protein electrophoresis; Starch properties; Starch; amylose; starch; starch synthase; vegetable protein; waxy protein, plant; allele; biosynthesis; chemistry; genetic polymorphism; genetics; plant gene; wheat; Alleles; Amylose; Genes, Plant; Plant Proteins; Polymorphism, Genetic; Starch; Starch Synthase; Triticum"

The heritable effect of an individual on the trait values of other individuals it interacts with is known as an indirect genetic effect (IGE). Such IGEs may affect response to selection. Fish selected for high growth rate, for example, have been shown to be more aggressive and competitive, which may reduce the observed response in growth rate. The main objective of this study is to quantify the genetic and non-genetic indirect effects for harvest weight in the GIFT strain of Nile tilapia. A total of 6330 fish with harvest weight information were used to estimate genetic and non-genetic parameters. A bivariate analysis of harvest weight and survival was conducted by fitting different mixed models to investigate the presence of IGEs and other non-genetic effects. The full set of genetic parameters could not be estimated simultaneously with the inclusion of maternal common environmental effects. A confounding between maternal common environmental effects and direct genetic effects resulted from the mating strategy, where one sire was mated to only one or two dams. A 1 male to 2 females mating design is common in aquaculture, but it has limited power to estimate genetic parameters. Models without maternal common environmental effects showed significant IGE on harvest weight, which contributed 48% of total heritable variance. Models with maternal common environmental effects suggested the presence of IGE. The direct-indirect genetic correlation for harvest weight was negative (-. 0.38. ±. 0.19), indicating that traditional selection, if performed in an environment where the fish have to compete with each other for the resources, will increase competition. A strongly negative genetic correlation between direct effects on survival and indirect effects on harvest weight (-. 0.79. ±. 0.30) showed that individuals with better genes for survival suppressed growth rate of their social partners. Our results suggest that heritable competitive interactions affect harvest weight in Nile tilapia. Hence, breeding schemes may need to be adapted to avoid an increase in aggressiveness due to selection for growth rate in a competitive environment. Further studies are required to investigate the relevance of IGE and its implications on different systems of commercial aquaculture production.

Access granularity control is a crucial issue in this combination. Specifically, this issue focuses on how to tune the subchannel bandwidth and the number of accessible subchannels towards the maximum channel utilization. This paper analyzes access granularity control in an OFDMA system that adopts a multichannel Carrier Sensing Multiple Access (CSMA) MAC and resolves contention by the frequency-domain backoff. The theoretical analysis verifies the significance of access granularity control.

While this coexistence of RATs offers various advantages, it also imposes many challenges for the network operator, whose aim is to maximize the generated revenue while satisfying the customers' increasing demands. One important mechanism in heterogeneous wireless networks (HWN) is the RAT selection. It is normally triggered when a new call arrives, and provides the decision on whether the call can be admitted or not, and by which RAT it has to be served. Different approaches can be used to tackle the problem of RAT selection in HWNs.

The case studies explore how network maps can serve as boundary objects to engage stakeholders of diverse points of view and jointly design strategies to address governance challenges. More specifically they show how network maps are used to gain a better understanding of governance situations, to help stakeholders identify strategies for navigation of the complex networks in which they are embedded and to support transdisciplinary research processes.

It counters the dominant assumption that empathy tends to be largely benign and beneficial by conceptualizing a typology of the costs of empathy. The dimensions of costs addressed are epistemological, cognitive, emotional, material, and embodied. I argue that these costs are frequently tangible for those who make the ethical-political choice to engage in empathy in situations of conflict and political violence. Drawing on social psychology approaches, empathy is located within a framework of collective narratives, emotions, and social structures shaped by both micro- and macro-political processes. A model of empathy, which acknowledges social influences and the psychological mechanisms through which these influences may be mediated, contributes to a deeper understanding of how politics, psychology, and culture shape empathy and, crucially, helps understand the conditions which may affect the successes, limitations, and failures of empathy in the (international) political sphere.

Most of the analyses use 20 fb−1of collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √s = 8 TeV, although in some case an additional 4.7 fb−1of collision data at √s = 7 TeV are used. New analyses are introduced to improve the sensitivity to specific regions of the model parameter space. Since no evidence of third-generation squarks is found, exclusion limits are derived by combining several analyses and are presented in both a simplified model framework, assuming simple decay chains, as well as within the context of more elaborate phenomenological supersymmetric models. © CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS collaboration 2015.",,

Applying this boundary-work framework, the manuscript examines the process of knowledge co-production and evaluates its effectiveness in supporting the negotiation process of four cases of payment for watershed services (PWS) in Indonesia. Our case studies reveal that local communities and policy-makers have a diverse range of knowledge regarding watershed functions and services. Recognizing this knowledge diversity, and combining it with scientific information, leads to (i) enlightenment, by engaging local stakeholders in more active roles for knowledge co-production thus setting realistic targets for ecosystem services' interventions in the design of PWS schemes; (ii) decision-making support for stakeholders, by providing opportunities for collaborative learning; and (iii) effective negotiations, by providing salient and credible information. We recognize 10 different prototypes that lead to a better understanding of how payments can be channeled to enhance, or at least maintain, underlying hydrological functions. The case studies, in different landscape configurations and associated PWS prototype settings, show that knowledge interfacing and sharing towards co-producing collaborative products helps to clarify the performance-based indicators for effective PWS negotiation between potential sellers and buyers of ecosystem services. © 2015 The Authors.",Boundary work; Knowledge co-production; Knowledge diversity; Payment for ecosystem services (PES); Watershed management,

Various profitability criteria and utility-based switching fees indicate that the largest gains stem from combining historical daily returns with volume information. Using common statistical loss functions, the largest degree of predictive power is found instead in intraday returns. Our analysis thus reinforces the view that statistical significance does not have a direct mapping onto economic value.

On the other hand, energy harvesting communication has emerged as a potential candidate to reduce the communication cost by tackling the problem in a contrasting fashion. While green communication techniques focus on minimizing the use of radio resources, energy harvesting communication relies on environment friendly techniques to generate energy from renewable resources and on effective use of the stored energy under the condition that there is always energy available when required. Thus, the focus migrates from minimization of energy to optimal time domain 'distribution' of energy, which causes a paradigm shift in radio resource allocation research. This survey summarizes major research work in the area of energy harvesting resource allocation. Instead of just focusing on the power allocation based on average and maximum power constraints, the random energy arrival process and packet/energy buffering interact in a challenging way to open new research problems. First, we present the fundamental concepts in energy harvesting communications and review recent research work in different wireless network applications. We discuss some quantitative results from the existing literature to explain the state of the art work. The energy cooperation aspect of energy harvesting is addressed in detail which has emerged as an interesting area of research recently. Finally, we conclude by summarizing some open challenges for future research and scope for innovation in this emerging area. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Energy harvesting; Green communications; Radio resource allocation; Wireless energy transfer,Energy transfer; Radio; Radio communication; Resource allocation; Surveys; Time domain analysis; Wireless telecommunication systems; Energy harvesting communications; Environment friendly; Fundamental concepts; Green communications; Network applications; Radio resource allocation; Wireless communications; Wireless energy transfers; Energy harvesting

Exploring how the structure of the corpus callosum (CC) reorganizes ensuing visual deprivation is of particular interest due to its important functional implication in vision (e.g., via the splenium of the CC). Moreover, comparing early versus late visually deprived individuals has the potential to unravel the existence of a sensitive period for reshaping the CC structure. Here, we develop a novel framework to capture a complete set of shape differences in the CC between congenitally blind (CB), late blind (LB) and sighted control (SC) groups. The CCs were manually segmented from T1-weighted brain MRI and modeled by 3D tetrahedral meshes. We statistically compared the combination of local area and thickness at each point between subject groups. Differences in area are found using surface tensor-based morphometry; thickness is estimated by tracing the streamlines in the volumetric harmonic field. Group differences were assessed on this combined measure using Hotelling’s T2 test. Interestingly, we observed that the total callosal volume did not differ between the groups. However, our fine-grained analysis reveals significant differences mostly localized around the splenium areas between both blind groups and the sighted group (general effects of blindness) and, importantly, specific dissimilarities between the LB and CB groups, illustrating the existence of a sensitive period for reorganization. The new multivariate statistics also gave better effect sizes for detecting morphometric differences, relative to other statistics. They may boost statistical power for CC morphometric analyses. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Blindness; Corpus Callosum Thickness; Multivariate Tensor-based Morphometry (mTBM); Volumetric Laplace-Beltrami Operator,"adult; blindness; corpus callosum; female; human; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures; sensory deprivation; three dimensional imaging; vision; Adult; Blindness; Corpus Callosum; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Sensory Deprivation; Visual Perception"

Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) intends to compensate local stakeholders for demonstrated carbon emission reduction and increased removals accounted for internationally, while promoting social and environmental benefits locally. Thus, monitoring REDD+ inherently requires the use of interdisciplinary data at different scales. Forest carbon monitoring, central to REDD+, is considerably advanced, yet the progress on social and environmental monitoring systems is uneven. We argue that scalar and interdisciplinary integration of REDD+ monitoring is crucial to uncover and understand trade-offs and synergies on which effectiveness, efficiency and equity of REDD+ may depend.We review previous efforts in integrating environmental and social monitoring, as well as efforts specific to REDD+, and discuss how old and new knowledge can contribute towards integrated monitoring. We observe that there are many challenges, but strong advantages, in an integrated monitoring approach. The current emergence of diverging standards and methodologies with narrow focus can inform future integrative efforts but could, in the long run, hinder coherence in national processes. We conclude that recent technological advances open new opportunities to integrate information across scale and disciplines, leveraging and combining existing data with targeted additional measures. The application of mixed methods in data collection can foster integration, in particular from the local level upwards. However, this requires greater coordination at higher levels to efficiently upscale multiple data streams.

To investigate differences in body weight at harvest of males and females among different tilapia strains, we analyzed data from 62,787 individuals collected from pedigreed breeding programs of O. niloticus (GIFT from Malaysia, the Abbassa line from Egypt, and the Akosombo line from Ghana), O. shiranus (the Bunda College-Domasi selection line), O. aureus (a selection line under development in Abbassa, Egypt, and a selection line from Israel) and a synthetic selection line of Red tilapia under development in Jitra, Malaysia, derived from stock from Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand (O. sp.). Mixed models were separately fitted to the data from each selection line. There was a significant sex effect in all strains (P < 0.001). A significant (P < 0.001) sex by generation interaction was observed in all strains (scale effect, not reversal of rankings), except Red tilapia and O. shiranus. Least squares means showed a large range in the magnitude of body weight differences between sexes across the seven strains. The largest percentage difference between females and males was in O. aureus from Egypt (female body weight was 52.2% that of males at harvest), whereas the smallest difference was observed in the GIFT strain of O. niloticus (female body weight 84.7% that of males). Female to male body weight percentages for Red tilapia, O. shiranus, Egypt O. niloticus, Israeli O. aureus and Ghana O. niloticus were 81.3, 81.0, 69.1, 61.7 and 61.0, respectively.

Lessons learned show that fairness and efficiency objectives must be achieved simultaneously in designing and implementing a sustainable PES scheme, especially in developing country contexts.

In SNPSP systems, neurons can create or delete synapses using plasticity rules. We report two families of solutions: a non-uniform and a uniform one, to the NP-complete problem Subset Sum using SNPSP systems. Instead of the usual rule-level nondeterminism (choosing which rule to apply) we use synapse-level nondeterminism (choosing which synapses to create or delete). The nondeterminism due to plasticity rules have the following improvements from a previous solution: in our non-uniform solution, plasticity rules allowed for a normal form to be used (i.e. without forgetting rules or rules with delays, system is simple, only synapse-level nondeterminism); in our uniform solution the number of neurons and the computation steps are reduced. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Membrane computing; NP-complete; Spiking neural P system; Structural plasticity; Subset sum,Computational complexity; Neurons; Biological neuron; Families of solutions; Membrane computing; Models of computation; NP Complete; Spiking neural P systems; Subset sum; Subset sum problems; Bioinformatics

We show here that the inference rules of labeled proof systems for modal logics can similarly be described as pairs of such phases within the LKF focused proof system for first-order classical logic. We consider the system G3K of Negri for the modal logic K and define a translation from labeled modal formulas into first-order polarized formulas and show a strict correspondence between derivations in the two systems, i.e., each rule application in G3K corresponds to a bipole—a pair of a positive and a negative phases—in LKF. Since geometric axioms (when properly polarized) induce bipoles, this strong correspondence holds for all modal logics whose Kripke frames are characterized by geometric properties. We extend these results to present a focused labeled proof system for this same class of modal logics and show its soundness and completeness.

This paper presents constraints on the off-shell Higgs boson event yields normalised to the Standard Model prediction (signal strength) in the ZZ → 4ℓ, ZZ → 2ℓ2ν and WW → eνµν final states. The result is based on pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb-1 at a collision energy of √s = 8 TeV. Using the CLs method, the observed 95 % confidence level (CL) upper limit on the off-shell signal strength is in the range 5.1-8.6, with an expected range of 6.7-11.0. In each case the range is determined by varying the unknown gg → ZZ and gg → WW background K-factor from higher-order quantum chromodynamics corrections between half and twice the value of the known signal K-factor. Assuming the relevant Higgs boson couplings are independent of the energy scale of the Higgs boson production, a combination with the on-shell measurements yields an observed (expected) 95 %CL upper limit on ΓH/ΓSM H in the range 4.5-7.5 (6.5-11.2) using the same variations of the background K-factor. Assuming that the unknown gg → VV background K-factor is equal to the signal K-factor, this translates into an observed (expected) 95 % CL upper limit on the Higgs boson total width of 22.7 (33.0) MeV. © CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS collaboration 2015.",,

It is often argued that contextual factors, such as the ambient illuminance in relation to characteristics of the display (e.g., surface treatment, screen reflectance, display luminance...) may have a strong influence on the use of such devices and corresponding user experiences. However, the current understanding of these influence factors is still rather limited. In this work, we therefore focus in particular on the impact of lighting and display luminance on readability, visual performance, subjective experience and preference. A controlled lab study (N=18) with a within-subjects design was performed to evaluate two car displays (one glossy and one matte display) in conditions that simulate bright outdoor lighting conditions. Four ambient luminance levels and three display luminance settings were combined into 7 experimental conditions. More concretely, we investigated for each display: (1) whether and how readability and visual performance varied with the different combinations of ambient luminance and display luminance and (2) whether and how they influenced the subjective experience (through self-reported valence, annoyance, visual fatigue) and preference. The results indicate a limited, yet negative influence of increased ambient luminance and reduced contrast on visual performance and readability for both displays. Similarly, we found that the self-reported valence decreases and annoyance and visual fatigue increase as the contrast ratio decreases and ambient luminance increases. Overall, the impact is clearer for the matte display than for the glossy display. © 2015 SPIE-IS&T.",Ambient luminance; Display luminance; Display readability; Reflectance; Subjective study; Visual acuity; Visual fatigue; Visual performance,Display devices; Lighting; Navigation systems; Reflection; Surface treatment; Display luminances; Display readability; Subjective study; Visual acuity; Visual fatigue; Visual performance; Luminance

Our input solids can be given under any representation: boundary meshes, voxels, indicator functions or CSG expressions. The result is a ray-based representation of the offset solid directly used for visualization and fabrication: we never need to recover a boundary mesh in our context. We define the offset solid as a sequence of morphological operations along line segments. This is equivalent to offsetting the surface by a solid defined as a Minkowski sum of segments, also known as a zonotope. A zonotope may be used to approximate the Euclidean ball with precise error bounds. We propose two complementary implementations. The first is dedicated to solids represented by boundary meshes. It performs offsetting by modifying the mesh in sequence. The result is a mesh improper for direct display, but that can be resolved into the correct offset solid through a ray representation. The major advantage of this first approach is that no loss of information - re-sampling - occurs during the offsetting sequence. However, it applies only to boundary meshes and cannot mix sequences of dilations and erosions. Our second implementation is more general as it applies directly to a ray-based representation of any solid and supports any sequence of erosion and dilation along segments. We discuss its fast implementation on modern graphics hardware. Together, the two approaches result in a versatile tool box for the efficient offsetting of solids in the context of fabrication. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A new report explores how three countries are using integrated policy approaches to CSA and offers insights for how other countries can build CSA into their policy mix. Brazil has invested in research to support sustainable intensification while creating legal and enforcement mechanisms to protect forest areas as a response to unrestrained agricultural expansion driven by market demand. Ethiopia initiated innovative participatory watershed development programs, in partnership with numerous international institutions, which helped smallholder farmers to rehabilitate marginal land and break out of a poverty cycle. New Zealand has removed agricultural subsidies while partnering on research and development with the private sector as a way to ensure efficiency and resilience in an agricultural sector influenced by climate change and international trade dynamics. To assemble an integrated set of national policies that fosters CSA, governments will need context-specific assessments, strong multi-stakeholder institutions, coordination frameworks, and multi-scale information systems. Governments can select from an array of policy instruments ranging from regulatory mechanisms and economic incentives to public investments and educational campaigns. Many existing national policy goals and public programs designed to increase agricultural production, improve livelihoods, and reduce environmental risks can become important pillars of a national CSA strategy. Countries have obvious interests in fostering an agriculture sector that is climate-resilient, provides national needs for food, fiber, and fuel, and supports farm livelihoods. However, the incentives for national-level action toward reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) levels are less clear in the absence of serious and shared international commitment. Integrated national CSA policies will be encouraged by clear, consistent signals from multilateral agencies, global donors, and international conventions and trade agreements that promote agriculture as a pathway for poverty reduction and food security. © 2014 Negra et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Brazil; Climate-smart agriculture; Ethiopia; Food security; New Zealand; Policy,

Eclipsing M dwarfs that orbit solar-type stars (EBLMs), like J0113+31, have been identified from their light curves and follow-up spectroscopy in the course of the WASP transiting planet search. We present the analysis of the first binary of the EBLM sample for which masses, radii and temperatures of both components are derived, and thus, define here the methodology. The primary component with a mass of 0.945? ±? 0.045 M? has a large radius (1.378±0.058 R?) indicating that the system is quite old, ∼9.5 Gyr. The M-dwarf secondary mass of 0.186? ±? 0.010 M? and radius of 0.209? ±? 0.011 R? are fully consistent with stellar evolutionary models. However, from the near-infrared secondary eclipse light curve, the M dwarf is found to have an effective temperature of 3922? ±? 42 K, which is ∼600 K hotter than predicted by theoretical models. We discuss different scenarios to explain this temperature discrepancy. The case of J0113+31 for which we can measure mass, radius, temperature, and metallicity highlights the importance of deriving mass, radius, and temperature as a function of metallicity for M dwarfs to better understand the lowest mass stars.

Session types, in turn, describe the behaviour of each individual channel end, as usual. A novel notion of typing context split allows for typing processes not typable with extant type systems. We show that our system guarantees that typed processes do not engage in races for linear resources. We assess the expressiveness of the type system by providing three distinct encodings - from the pi calculus with polarized variables, from the pi calculus with accept and request primitives, and from the linear pi calculus - into our system. For each language we present operational and typing correspondences, showing that our system effectively subsumes foregoing works on linear and session types.

In this paper, we analysed prevailing key water and nutrient interaction practices namely stone bund, zaï and half-moon techniques in order to explore how their outcomes could be linked to climate change adaptation and mitigation. Data were derived from previous publications but were reinterpreted in the angle of technologies' alignment with the three pillars of climate-smart agriculture (CSA). We found that the most successful systems are those that provide water, nutrients and a supportive soil structure in a synergistic manner. Indeed, technologies such as zaï, half-moons and stone bunds, combined with an application of organic/inorganic sources of nutrients, are promising climate-smart agricultural practices that could be widely used by smallholder farmers to maintain food production and secure farmers' livelihoods, while contributing to ecosystem services. However, accompanying incentive measures are needed to empower and capacitate rural farmers to adopt the considered techniques.

Cryptographic acceleration is typically achieved either with a coprocessor or via instruction set extensions. ISA modifications require re-engineering the CPU core, making the approach inapplicable outside the realm of open source processor cores. At minimum, we suggest implementing CAESAR AEADs as universal memory-mapped cryptographic coprocessors, synthesizable even on low end FPGA platforms. AEADs complying to SÆHI must also include C language API drivers targeting low-end MCUs that directly utilize the memory mapping in a ""bare metal"" fashion. This can also be accommodated on MMU-equipped mid-range CPUs. Extended battery life and bandwidth resulting from dedicated cryptographic hardware is vital for currently dominant computing and communication devices: mobile phones, tablets, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. We argue that these should be priority hardware optimization targets for AEAD algorithms with realistic payload profiles. We demonstrate a fully integrated implementation of Whirl-Bob and Keyak AEADs on the FPGA fabric of Xilinx Zynq 7010.

Economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services could promote conservation, but deforestation often occurs on land without crucial tenure-security prerequisites. Improving the enforcement of existing regulatory disincentives thus represents an important element of Brazil's anti-deforestation action plan. However, conservation law enforcement costs and benefits have been much less studied than for conditional payments. We develop a conceptual framework and a spatially explicit model to analyze field-based regulatory enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon. We validate our model, based on historical deforestation and enforcement mission data from 2003 to 2008. By simulating the current conservation law enforcement practice, we analyze the costs of liability establishment and legal coercion for alternative conservation targets, and evaluate corresponding income impacts. Our findings suggest that spatial patterns of both deforestation and inspection costs markedly influence enforcement patterns and their income effects. Field-based enforcement is a highly cost-effective forest conservation instrument from a regulator's point of view, but comes at high opportunity costs for land users. Payments for environmental services could compensate costs, but will increase budget outlays vis-à-vis a command-and-control dominated strategy. Both legal and institutional challenges have to be overcome to make conservation payments work at a larger scale. Decision-makers may have to innovatively combine incentive and disincentive-based policy instruments in order to make tropical forest conservation both financially viable and socially compatible. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Environmental policy mix; Forest conservation; Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+); Spatial enforcement model,

The measurement was performed with the 2011 7 TeV dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb−1 and the 2012 8 TeV dataset of 20.3 fb−1. The numbers of events with exactly one and exactly two b-tagged jets were counted and used to simultaneously determine σtt and the efficiency to reconstruct and b-tag a jet from a top quark decay, thereby minimising the associated systematic uncertainties. The cross-section was measured to be: σtt = 182.9 ± 3.1 ± 4.2 ± 3.6 ± 3.3 pb (√s = 7 TeV) and σtt = 242.4 ± 1.7 ± 5.5 ± 7.5 ± 4.2 pb (√s = 8 TeV), where the four uncertainties arise from data statistics, experimental and theoretical systematic effects, knowledge of the integrated luminosity and of the LHC beam energy. The results are consistent with recent theoretical QCD calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order. Fiducial measurements corresponding to the experimental acceptance of the leptons are also reported, together with the ratio of cross-sections measured at the two centre-of-mass energies.

Motivated by this and particularly the aim of extracting such information from a given dataset collected through end-to-end measurement, this paper presents a novel approach, called SCI (Service-quality Characterization of Internet-path). Specifically, SCI utilizes delay and loss measurements collected from vantage points at the two ends of an Internet path. It transforms collected probes into performance signals, namely aggregate delay, average delay and aggregate loss signals. On the aggregate delay and average delay signals, abrupt changes are detected using Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). The detected abrupt changes in aggregate delay and average delay, together with the loss information, are further mapped as different types of events causing degradations and failures in the service within the path. Predicated on the set of identified such service-level events, SCI characterizes the service quality of the measured Internet path using three metrics, namely availability, stability and fatigue. The proposed approach has been systematically evaluated on the dataset collected from a real operational environment. The results show that SCI achieves good accuracy in detecting abrupt changes in aggregate delay and average delay and identifying service-level events, boosting the feasibility of service quality assessment of an Internet path based exclusively on end-to-end measurement. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here, by analysing the exome sequences of 2,536 schizophrenia cases and 2,543 controls, we demonstrate a polygenic burden primarily arising from rare (less than 1 in 10,000), disruptive mutations distributed across many genes. Particularly enriched gene sets include the voltage-gated calcium ion channel and the signalling complex formed by the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated scaffold protein (ARC) of the postsynaptic density, sets previously implicated by genome-wide association and copy-number variation studies. Similar to reports in autism, targets of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP, product of FMR1) are enriched for case mutations. No individual gene-based test achieves significance after correction for multiple testing and we do not detect any alleles of moderately low frequency (approximately 0.5 to 1 per cent) and moderately large effect.

This leukopenia is associated with genetic variation in TPMT (encoding thiopurine S-methyltransferase). Despite a lower frequency of TPMT mutations in Asians, the incidence of thiopurine-induced leukopenia is higher in Asians than in individuals of European descent. Here we performed an Immunochip-based 2-stage association study in 978 Korean subjects with Crohn's disease treated with thiopurines. We identified a nonsynonymous SNP in NUDT15 (encoding p.Arg139Cys) that was strongly associated with thiopurine-induced early leukopenia (odds ratio (OR) = 35.6; P combined = 4.88 × 10-94). In Koreans, this variant demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 89.4% and 93.2%, respectively, for thiopurine-induced early leukopenia (in comparison to 12.1% and 97.6% for TPMT variants). Although rare, this SNP was also strongly associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia in subjects with inflammatory bowel disease of European descent (OR = 9.50; P = 4.64 × 10-4).

The projected yields of crops under a range of agricultural and climatic scenarios are needed to assess food security prospects. Previous meta-analyses have summarized climate change impacts and adaptive potential as a function of temperature, but have not examined uncertainty, the timing of impacts, or the quantitative effectiveness of adaptation. Here we develop a new data set of more than 1,700 published simulations to evaluate yield impacts of climate change and adaptation. Without adaptation, losses in aggregate production are expected for wheat, rice and maize in both temperate and tropical regions by 2 °C of local warming. Crop-level adaptations increase simulated yields by an average of 7-15%, with adaptations more effective for wheat and rice than maize. Yield losses are greater in magnitude for the second half of the century than for the first. Consensus on yield decreases in the second half of the century is stronger in tropical than temperate regions, yet even moderate warming may reduce temperate crop yields in many locations. Although less is known about interannual variability than mean yields, the available data indicate that increases in yield variability are likely.© 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The study of hospital methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) epidemiology is complicated by its transmissibility. Our objective was to understand how MRSA importation and transmission influence MRSA nosocomial infections in Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs).Methods. We performed hospital-level analyses of acute-care MRSA admission prevalence, acquisition rates, and incident nosocomial clinical culture (INCC) rates, each a surrogate measure of importation, transmission, and nosocomial infection, respectively. We studied 112 VAMCs from October 2007 through September 2010, after the start of a bundled intervention including active surveillance for MRSA. We analyzed data using generalized linear mixed models.Results. A total of 2.9 million surveillance tests were collected from 1.4 million patient admissions. Overall MRSA admission prevalence was 11.4%, acquisition was 5.2 per 1000 patient-days at risk, and INCC was 1.8 per 1000 patient-days at risk. A 10% increase in a hospital's average admission prevalence was associated with a 9.7% increase in its weekly acquisition rates (P <. 001) and a 9.8% increase in its weekly INCC rates (P <. 001). Significant decreases were observed in all 3 measures during the study period (P <. 001). When INCC rates were stratified by nasal MRSA carriage at admission, a significant downward trend was observed only among those initially negative.Conclusions. Measured associations between MRSA admission prevalence, acquisition rate, and INCC rate were consistent with the hypothesis that decreased acquisition led to decreased importation, which in turn further abated acquisition. The downward trend in INCC rate specifically among individuals with negative admission surveillance tests suggests that decreasing transmission contributed to lower rates of nosocomial MRSA infection. © The Author 2013.",healthcare-associated infection; incidence; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; prevalence; transmission,"article; bacterial transmission; bacterium culture; disease association; disease surveillance; healthcare associated infection; hospital admission; hospital infection; host resistance; human; major clinical study; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection; microbiology test; nose smear; observational study; prevalence; priority journal; healthcare-associated infection; incidence; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; prevalence; transmission; Bacteriological Techniques; Cross Infection; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Hospitals, Veterans; Humans; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Prevalence; Staphylococcal Infections; Veterans"

And the objective of the model is to find their optimal combinations by DE in the predefined intervals, such that the objective functional is minimized.

Baseline and end-line surveys were applied to assess the changes in their livelihoods following intervention.

Thus, it is essen-tial to develop approaches for sustainable intensification of livestock systems to mitigate GHG emissions, addressing biophysical, socio-economic and policy challenges. This paper highlights the potential of improved tropical forages, linked with policy incentives, to enhance livestock production, while reducing its environmental footprint.

The receiver-to-receiver paradigm is used, which has the advantage of reducing the time-critical-path and thus improving the accuracy compared to common sender-to-receiver protocols. The protocol is fully distributed and does not rely on any fixed reference. The role of the reference is divided amongst all nodes, while timestamp exchange is integrated with synchronization signals (beacons). This enables fast acquisition of timestamps that are used as samples to estimate relative synchronization parameters. An appropriate model is used to derive maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) and the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) for both the offset-only, and the joint offset/skew estimation. The model permits to directly estimating relative parameters without using or referring to a reference' clock. The proposed protocol is extended to multi-hop environment, where local synchronization is performed proactively and the resulted estimates are transferred to the intermediate/end-point nodes on-demand, i.e. as soon as a multi-hop communication that needs synchronization is initiated. On-demand synchronization is targeted for multi-hop synchronization instead of the always-on global synchronization model, which avoids periodic and continuous propagation of synchronization signals beyond a single-hop. Extension of local MLE estimators is proposed to derive relative multi-hop estimators. The protocol is compared by simulation to some state-of-the-art protocols, and results show much faster convergence of the proposed protocol. The difference has been on the order of more than twice compared to CS-MNS, more than ten times compared to RBS, and more than twenty times compared to TPSN. Results also show scalability of the proposed protocol concerning the multi-hop synchronization. The error does not exceed few microseconds for as much as 10 hops in R4Syn, while in CS-MNS, and TPSN, it reaches few tens of microseconds. Implementation and tests of the protocol on real sensor motes confirm microsecond level precision even in multi-hop scenarios, and high stability (long lifetime) of the skew/offset model. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The core of the framework is an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) used to control crop model runs, assimilate remote sensing (RS) data and update model state variables. We modified the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer - Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM)-Maize model (Jones et al., 2003) to be able to stop and start simulations at any given time in the growing season, such that the EnKF can update model state variables as RS data become available. The data assimilation-crop modeling framework was evaluated against 2003-2009 maize yields in Story County, Iowa, USA, assimilating AMSR-E soil moisture and MODIS-LAI data independently and simultaneously. Assimilating LAI or soil moisture independently slightly improved the correlation of observed and simulated yields (R=0.51 and 0.50) compared to no data assimilation (open-loop; R=0.47) but prediction errors improved with reductions in MBE and RMSE by 0.5 and 0.5Mgha-1 respectively for LAI assimilation while these were reduced by 1.8 and 1.1Mgha-1 for soil moisture assimilation. Yield correlation improved more when both soil moisture and LAI were assimilated (R=0.65) suggesting a cause-effect interaction between soil moisture and LAI, prediction errors (MBE and RMSE) were also reduced by 1.7 and 1.8Mgha-1 with respect to open-loop simulations. Results suggest that assimilation of LAI independently might be preferable when conditions are extremely wet while assimilation of soil moisture+LAI might be more suitable when conditions are more nominal. AMSR-E soil moisture tends to be more biased under the presence of high vegetation (i.e., when crops are fully developed) and that updating rootzone soil moisture by near-surface soil moisture assimilation under very wet conditions could increase the modeled percolation causing excessive nitrogen (N) leaching hence reducing crop yields even with water stress reduced at a minimum due to soil moisture assimilation. However, applying the data assimilation-crop modeling framework strategically by considering a-priori information on climate condition expected during the growing season may improve yield prediction performance substantially, in our case with higher correlation (R=0.80) and more reductions in MBE and RMSE (2.5 and 3.3Mgha-1) compared to when there is no data assimilation. Scaling AMSR-E soil moisture to the climatology of the model did not improve our data assimilation results because the model is also biased. Better soil moisture products e.g., from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, may solve the soil moisture data issue in the near future. © 2013.",Crop model; Data assimilation; Leaf area index; Soil moisture; Yield forecasting,Crop model; Data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman Filter; Leaf Area Index; Open-loop simulations; Remotely sensed soil moisture; Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); Yield forecasting; Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation; Crops; Data processing; Decision support systems; Errors; Forecasting; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Solvents; Technology transfer; Vegetation; Soil surveys; agricultural management; agricultural technology; correlation; crop yield; data acquisition; decision support system; growing season; Kalman filter; maize; MODIS; remote sensing; simulation; soil moisture; water stress; Iowa; Story County; United States

We study the problem of putting in sleep mode links of a backbone network, while limiting the number of times each device changes its power state (full power mode or sleep mode). Our aim is to limit the number of network configurations, i.e., the change of the current set of network links at full power. We tackle the problem both analytically and by simulations. We first present a model, based on random graph theory, to compute the links energy saving given a traffic variation, QoS requirements, and the number of allowed network configurations. The same analysis is then repeated over two realistic case studies, and with realistic algorithms to choose the set of links in sleep mode. Results show (both analytically and by simulation) that the energy savings with few configurations (two or three per day) are close to the maximum one, in which a new configuration is applied for each traffic matrix. Moreover, we show that few configurations per day limit the number of overhead messages required for exchanging information about the device state. Thus, we can conclude that a practical implementation of sleep mode strategies for network operators is to define, on the basis of typical traffic trend, few configurations to be activated in specific time instants. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Of the discharges, 58118 had a primary ICD-9-CM diagnosis classifiable as PNEU, 36797 as SSTI, 30223 as UTI and 1243098 as NON_INF. Empirical antibiotic use during the first 2 hospital days was frequent for all infectious disease diagnoses. Type of empirical coverage varied among facilities for all conditions, as did treatment durations. Roughly half of all empirical courses of therapy where the patientwas still hospitalized on day 4 did not exhibit any change to the antibiotic regimen. There is substantial variation in the management of common infectious diseases with regard to choice of empirical agents and duration of therapy. Diagnosis-specific antibiotic use metrics may prove useful for antibiotic stewardship programmes. © The Author 2013.

It enables certain complicated operations involving orientation manipulation on images to be executed with high efficiency. Thus, we focus our attention on the steerability of Hermite polynomials and their versions modulated by the Gaussian function with different powers, defined as the Hermite kernel. Certain special cases of such kernel, Hermite polynomials, Hermite functions and Gaussian derivatives are discussed in detail. Correspondingly, these cases demonstrate that the Hermite kernel is a powerful and effective tool for image processing. Furthermore, the steerability of the Hermite kernel is proved with the help of a property of Hermite polynomials revealing the rule concerning the product of two Hermite polynomials after coordination rotation. Consequently, any order of the Hermite kernel inherits steerability. Moreover, a couple sets of an explicit interpolation function and basis function can be directly obtained. We provide some examples to verify steerability of the Hermite kernel.

Researchers in nanocommunication networks propose novel engineering solutions for various application areas such as biological neural systems. In a neural communication network, the signals are encoded, propagated through synaptic channels, and decoded in a noise-free network. The desired performance of the nanocommunication network would be influenced by either internal or external disturbances, i.e. the spiking irregularities, history of firing in the neural cell, and the randomness in release of the neurotransmitters depending on the operating conditions. In this paper, a noise-free biological communication network is stochastically modeled. The internal and external disturbance sources are characterized considering the in-body communications and a comprehensive stochastic model is developed to verify the effects of various noise sources. The proposed model is comprised of a signal dependent encoding noise and signal independent synaptic/ionic disturbances. An effective probabilistic algorithm is given to model the firing rate of the neurons, while the noise sources are coupled. The proposed model is numerically studied and simulated, when various noise sources are applied simultaneously on the neural communication network. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Nanocommunication network; Noise characterization; Spiking neuron; Stochastic process; System modeling,Biological communications; Biological neural systems; Engineering solutions; In-body communications; Noise characterization; Probabilistic algorithm; Spiking neuron; System modeling; Biocommunications; Computer simulation; Nanotechnology; Random processes; Neural networks

We developed a theoretical model of yield loss to diseases and pests as a function of weather, and used this model to evaluate the effects of variance in conduciveness to loss and the effects of the color of time series of weather conduciveness to loss. There were two qualitatively different results for changes in system variance. If median conditions are conducive to loss, increasing system variance decreases mean yield loss. On the other hand, if median conditions are intermediate or poor for disease or pest development, such that conditions are conducive to yield loss no more than half the time, increasing system variance increases mean yield loss. Time series for weather conduciveness that are darker pink (have higher levels of temporal autocorrelation) produce intermediate levels of yield loss less commonly. A linked model of decision-making based on either past or current information about yield loss also shows changes in the performance of decision rules as a function of system variance.

The maximum number of comparisons permitted for an arrival can be controlled by a parameter called maxcomp. The quality of flow protection improves with maxcomp. Compared to the plain CHOKe (which is just the simplest case of gCHOKe), our analysis and simulations show that the scheme can achieve over 20% improvement in the bounds of both bandwidth and buffer space used by an aggressive flow.

This analysis attains sensitivity for charginos with a lifetime between 0.1 and 10 ns, and significantly surpasses the reach of the LEP experiments. No significant excess above the background expectation is observed for candidate tracks with large transverse momentum, and constraints on chargino properties are obtained. In the AMSB scenarios, a chargino mass below 270 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level. © 2013 CERN, for the ATLAS Collaboration.",,

A non-linear enhancement function has been designed based on the local dispersion of the wavelet coefficients modelled as a bivariate Cauchy distribution. Within the same statistical framework, a simultaneous noise reduction in the image is performed by means of a shrinkage function, thus preventing noise amplification. The proposed enhancement method has been shown to perform very well with insufficiently illuminated and noisy imagery, outperforming other conventional methods, in terms of contrast enhancement and noise reduction in the output data. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, multiscale-synchronization between two different FOHCSs is achieved by utilizing the different linear and nonlinear feedback control method in a short period and both remain in chaotic states.

The jet energy uncertainty is less than 2.5 % in the central calorimeter region (|η| &lt; 0.8) for jets with 60 ≤ pT &lt; 800 GeV, and is maximally 14 % for pT ≤ 30 GeV in the most forward region 3.2 ≤ |η| &lt; 4.5. The jet energy is validated for jet transverse momenta up to 1 TeV to the level of a few percent using several in situ techniques by comparing a well-known reference such as the recoiling photon pT, the sum of the transverse momenta of tracks associated to the jet, or a system of low-pT jets recoiling against a high-pT jet. More sophisticated jet calibration schemes are presented based on calorimeter cell energy density weighting or hadronic properties of jets, aiming for an improved jet energy resolution and a reduced flavour dependence of the jet response. The systematic uncertainty of the jet energy determined from a combination of in situ techniques is consistent with the one derived from single hadron response measurements over a wide kinematic range. The nominal corrections and uncertainties are derived for isolated jets in an inclusive sample of high-pT jets.

This anisotropy is characterized via a Fourier expansion of the distribution of charged particles in azimuthal angle relative to the reaction plane, with the coefficients vn denoting the magnitude of the anisotropy. Significant v2–v6 values are obtained as a function of transverse momentum (0.5 &lt; pT &lt; 20 GeV), pseudorapidity (|η| &lt; 2.5), and centrality using an event plane method. The vn values for n ≥ 3 are found to vary weakly with both η and centrality, and their pT dependencies are found to follow an approximate scaling relation, v1/n n (pT) ∝ v1/2 2 (pT), except in the top 5% most central collisions. A Fourier analysis of the charged particle pair distribution in relative azimuthal angle (Δϕ = ϕa − ϕb) is performed to extract the coefficients vn, n = (cos nΔϕ). For pairs of charged particles with a large pseudorapidity gap (|Δη = ηa − ηb| &gt; 2) and one particle with pT &lt; 3 GeV, the v2,2–v6,6 values are found to factorize as vn, n(pa T, pb T) ≈ vn(pa T)vn(pb T) in central and midcentral events. Such factorization suggests that these values of v2,2–v6,6 are primarily attributable to the response of the created matter to the fluctuations in the geometry of the initial state. A detailed study shows that the v1,1(pa T, pb T) data are consistent with the combined contributions from a rapidity-even v1 and global momentum conservation.A two-component fit is used to extract the v1 contribution.

In this paper, we analytically derive a model for seismic anisotropy caused by small triaxial stresses. We first consider a linearly isotropic elastic medium permeated by a distribution of cracks with random orientations. The geometry of cracks is not specified; instead, their behavior is defined by a ratio of their normal to tangential excess compliances. When this isotropic rock is subjected to small triaxial stresses, crack closure occurs perpendicular to the applied stresses. This effect is modeled using Sayers and Kachanaov (1995) non-interactive approximation. The model predicts ellipsoidal anisotropy and also expresses the ratios of Thomsen's parameters as a function of the compliance and Poisson's ratios in the three orthogonal planes of symmetry. A reasonable agreement was obtained when comparing the model predictions to laboratory measurements for small stresses (up to 20 MPa). These results could be used to differentiate stress-induced anisotropy from that caused by aligned fractures. Besides, if the cause of anisotropy is known, then this model could enable one to fully estimate the elasticity tensor from log data. © 2012 SEG.",,Crack closure; Elastic waves; Geophysical prospecting; Microcracks; Orthogonal functions; Rocks; Elastic wave velocity; Elasticity tensor; Isotropic elastic medium; Laboratory measurements; Model prediction; Random orientations; Seismic anisotropy; Stress-induced anisotropy; Anisotropy

The Linearization Problem asks to extract, from a given binary matrix, a maximum weight subset of rows that satisfies such a property. This problem is in general intractable, and in particular if the ancestral genome is expected to contain only linear chromosomes or a unique circular chromosome. In the present work, we consider a relaxation of this problem, which allows ancestral genomes that can contain several chromosomes, each either linear or circular. We show that, when restricted to binary matrices of degree two, which correspond to adjacencies, the genomic characters used in most ancestral genome reconstruction methods, this relaxed version of the Linearization Problem is polynomially solvable using a reduction to a matching problem. This result holds in the more general case where columns have bounded multiplicity, which models possibly duplicated ancestral genes. We also prove that for matrices with rows of degrees 2 and 3, without multiplicity and without weights on the rows, the problem is NP-complete, thus tracing sharp tractability boundaries. As it happened for the breakpoint median problem, also used in ancestral genome reconstruction, relaxing the definition of a genome turns an intractable problem into a tractable one. The relaxation is adapted to some biological contexts, such as bacterial genomes with several replicons, possibly partially assembled. Algorithms can also be used as heuristics for hard variants. More generally, this work opens a way to better understand linearization results for ancestral genome structure inference.",,"algorithm; article; chromosome; genetics; genome; genomics; methodology; molecular evolution; Algorithms; Chromosomes; Evolution, Molecular; Genome; Genomics; MLCS; MLOWN"

There is no data about the validity and characteristics of ADAS-Cog in Hungarian sample. This study is a part of the Hungarian standardization process of ADAS-Cog. It is crucial to examine the cognitive performance of patients with pseudodementia caused by depression (D) because of its' similarities with Alzheimer's disease (AK). The objective of the study was to analyze the characteristics of the cognitive subscale for further validation purposes. The study aimed at analyzing the ADAS-Cog performance of patients with D and AK in a Hungarian sample to make future studies more accurate through more exact differentiation between the two diseases. Fourty-seven normal elderly control (KNT) subjects, 66 AK patients and 39 patients with D participated in the study. The mental state and the severity of depressive symptoms of the participants were assessed by the means of ADAS-Cog, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Beck Depression Inventory. The ADAS-Cog is sensitive to the cognitive decline of the depressed group (sensitivity=69.2%, specificity=89.4%, AUC=0.868, p>0.001). While the performance of the two patient groups differed from the KNT, the groups are overlapping and the characteristic of the ROC curve and the optimal cut-off point (D:11.8; AK:12.1) indicates that the differentiation is mediocre. The results suggest that pseudodementia should be considered during the design of studies using ADASCog.

The proposed protocol targets WSN's applications having different types of data traffic. It is based on differentiating QoS requirements according to the data type, which enables to provide several and customized QoS metrics for each traffic category. With each packet, the protocol attempts to fulfill the required data-related QoS metric(s) while considering power efficiency. It is modular and uses geographical information, which eliminates the need of propagating routing information. For link quality estimation, the protocol employs distributed, memory and computation efficient mechanisms. It uses a multisink single-path approach to increase reliability. To our knowledge, this protocol is the first that makes use of the diversity in data traffic while considering latency, reliability, residual energy in sensor nodes, and transmission power between nodes to cast QoS metrics as a multiobjective problem. The proposed protocol can operate with any medium access control (MAC) protocol, provided that it employs an acknowledgment (ACK) mechanism. Extensive simulation study with scenarios of 900 nodes shows the proposed protocol outperforms all comparable state-of-the-art QoS and localized routing protocols.

LIBERO supports multiple autonomic managers within the same behavioural skeleton, each taking care of a different non-functional concern. We introduce LIBERO-built on plain Java and JBoss-and discuss how multiple managers may be coordinated to achieve a common goal using a two-phase coordination protocol developed in earlier work. We present experimental results that demonstrate how the prototype may be used to investigate autonomic management of multiple, independent concerns. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",autonomic management; behavioural skeletons; non-functional concerns; performance; security; structured parallel/distributed programming,Managers; Musculoskeletal system; Autonomic management; behavioural skeletons; Non-functional concerns; Parallel/distributed programming; performance; security; Functional programming
