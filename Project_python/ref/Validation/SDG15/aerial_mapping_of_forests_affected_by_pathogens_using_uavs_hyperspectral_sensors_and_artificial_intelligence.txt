Abstract: The environmental and economic impacts of exotic fungal species on natural and plantation
forests has been historically catastrophic. Recorded surveillance and control actions are challenging
because they are costly, time-consuming, and hazardous in remote areas. Prolonged periods of
testing and observation of site-based tests have limitations to verify the rapid proliferation of exotic
pathogens and deterioration rates in hosts. Recent remote sensing approaches have offered fast,
broad-scale and affordable surveys, and additional indicators that can complement on-ground
tests. This paper proposes a framework that consolidates site-based insights and remote sensing
capabilities to detect and segment deteriorations by fungal pathogens in natural and plantation
forests. This approach is illustrated with an experimentation case of myrtle rust (Austropuccinia psidii)
on paperbark tea trees (Melaleuca quinquenervia) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The method
integrates unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), hyperspectral image sensors, and data processing
algorithms using machine learning. Imagery is acquired using a Headwall Nano-Hyperspec R camera,
orthorectified in Headwall SpectralView R , and processed in Python programming language using
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) and Scikit-learn
third-party libraries. In total, 11,385 samples were extracted and labelled into five classes: two classes
for deterioration status and three classes for background objects. Insights reveal individual detection
rates of 95% for healthy trees, 97% for deteriorated trees and a global multiclass detection rate of 97%.
The methodology is versatile to be applied to additional datasets taken with different image sensors,
and the processing of large datasets with freeware tools.

1. Introduction
Exotic pathogens have caused irreversible damage to flora and fauna within a range of
ecosystems worldwide. Popular outbreaks include the enormous devastations of chestnut blight
(Endothia parasitica) on American chestnut trees (Castanea dentata) in the U.S. [13], sudden oak
death (Phytophthora ramorum) on oak populations (Quercus agrifolia) in Europe, California and
Oregon [46], dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) on hundreds of hosts globally [79], and myrtle

rust (Austropuccinia psidii) on Myrtaceae family plants in Australia [1013]. The effects of the latter case
have raised national alerts and response programmes given the extensive host range and the ecological
and economic importance of Myrtaceae plants in the Australian environment [1417]. As a result,
various surveillance and eradication programmes have been applied in an attempt to minimise the
impacts invasive pathogens cause on local hosts such as dieback in the Western Australia Jarrah forests
[18], sudden oak death in the tan oak forests of the U.S. [19] and rapid ohia death (Ceratocystis fimbriata)
on ohia trees (Metrosideros polymorpha) in Hawaii [20].
Modern surveillance methods to map hosts vulnerable to and affected by exotic pathogens can
be classified in site-based and remote sensing methods, according to Lawley et al. [21]. Site-based
approaches are commonly small regions used to collect exhaustive compositional and structural
indicators of vegetation condition with a strong focus on biophysical attributes of single vegetation
communities [22,23]. These methods, nonetheless, require deep expertise and time to conduct
experimentation, data collection and validation that, along with their limited area they can cover,
represent a challenge while assessing effects on a broad scale [24]. Research has also suggested the
design of decision frameworks to monitor and control the most threatened species [17,25,26]. Although
these models can determine flora species that require immediate management control, limitations on
the amount of tangible, feasible and broad quantified data of vulnerable host areas [21] have resulted
in lack of support from state and federal governments [27].
The role of remote sensing methods to assess and quantify the impacts of invasive pathogens in
broad scale has increased exponentially [28,29]. Standard approaches comprise the use of spectral and
image sensors through satellite, manned and unmanned aircraft technology [30]. Concerning sensing
technology by itself, applied methods by research communities range from the use of non-imaging
spectroradiometers, fluorescence, multi-, hyperspectral and thermal cameras, and light detection and
ranging (LiDAR) technology [3134]. These equipment are usually employed for the calculation of
spectral indexes [3538] and regression models in the host range [39,40]. Nevertheless, these methods
are mainly focused on the quantification, distribution, among other physical properties of flora species.
Satellite and manned aircraft surveys have reported limitations concerning resolution, operational
costs and unfavourable climate conditions (e.g. cloudiness and hazard winds) [41]. In contrast, the
continuous development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) designs, navigation systems, portable
image sensors and cutting-edge machine learning methods allow unobtrusive, accurate and versatile
surveillance tools in precision agriculture and biosecurity [4244]. Many studies have positioned UAVs
for the collection of aerial imagery in applications such as weeds, diseases and pests mapping, and
wildlife monitoring [21,4547]. More recently, unmanned aerial systems (UASs) have been deployed
in cluttered and global positioning system (GPS)-denied environments [48].
Approaches to the use of UAVs, hyperspectral imagery and artificial intelligence are gaining
popularity. For example, Aasen et al. [49] deployed UAS to boost vegetation monitoring efforts
using hyperspectral three-dimensional (3D) imagery. Nasi et al. [50] developed techniques to assess
pest damages at canopy levels using spectral indexes and k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) classifiers,
achieving global detection rates of 90%. Similar research focused on diseases monitoring, however,
has been limited. Calderon et al. [51] for instance, evaluated the early detection and quantification of
Verticillium Wilt in Olive plants using support vector machines (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis
(LDA), obtaining mixed accuracy results among the evaluated classes of infection severity (59% to
75%) [52]. Albetis et al. [53] presented a system to discriminate asymptomatic and symptomatic red
and white vineyards cultivars by Flavescence doree, using UAVs, multispectral imagery and up to 20
data features, collecting contrasting results between the cultivars and maximum accuracy rates of 88%.
In sum, the integration of site-based and remote sensing frameworks have boosted the capabilities of
these surveillance solutions by combining data from abiotic and biotic factors and spectral responses,
respectively [54]. However, this synthesis is still challenging due to the high number of singularities,
data correlation and validation procedures presented in each case study.

Considering the importance of site-based and remote sensing methods to obtain reliable and
broader assessments of forest health, specifically, for pest and fungal assessments [55], this paper
presents an integrated system that classifies and maps natural and plantation forests exposed and
deteriorated by fungal pathogens using UAVs, hyperspectral sensors and artificial intelligence. The
framework is exemplified by a case study of myrtle rust on paperbark tea trees (Melaleuca quinquenervia)
in a swamp ecosystem of north-east New South Wales (NSW), Australia.

A novel framework was designed for the assessment of natural and plantation forests exposed
and potentially exposed to pathogens as presented in Figure 1. It comprises four sections linked each
other denominated Data Acquisition, Data Preparation, Training and Prediction. The system interacts
directly and indirectly with the surveyed area to acquire information, preprocess and arrange obtained
data into features, fit a supervised machine learning classifier, tune the accuracy and performance
indicators to process vast amounts of data, and provide prediction reports through segmented images.

2.1. Data Acquisition
The data acquisition process involves an indirect data collection campaign using an airborne
system, and direct ground assessments of the studied pathogen through exclusion trials, which are
controlled by biosecurity experts. Airborne data is compiled using a UAV, image sensors and a ground
workstation in the site to acquire data above the tree canopy. Similarly, ground data is collected
through field assessment insights by biosecurity experts. Field assessments bring several factors such
as growth, reproduction and regeneration on coppiced trees exposed to any specific pathogen. A
database is created by labelling, georeferencing and correlating relevant insights into every tested
plant. Details on the studied area, flight campaign and field assessments can be found in Sections 3.1,
3.2 and 3.3.

This methodology incorporates a hexa-rotor DJI S800 EVO (DJI, Guangdong, China) UAV. The
drone features high-performance brushless rotors, a total load capacity of 3.9 kg and dimensions of
118  100  50 cm. It follows an automatic mission route using the DJI Ground Station 4.0 software,
controlling the route, speed, height above the ground, and overlapping values remotely. It is worth
mentioning, however, that other UAVs with similar characteristics can also be used and included into
the airborne data collection process of Figure 1.

Spectral data is collected using a Headwall Nano-Hyperspec R hyperspectral camera (Headwall
Photonics Inc., MA, USA). This visible near infra-red (VNIR) sensor provides spectral wavelength
responses up to 274 bands, a wavelength range from 385 to 1000 nm, a spectral resolution of 2.2 nm, a
frame rate of 300 Hz, spatial bands of 640 pixels and a total storage limit of 480 GB. The camera
is mounted in a customised gimbal system that augments data quality by minimising external
disturbances such as roll, pitch and yaw oscillations, as depicted in Figure 2.

2.2. Data preparation
Imagery is downloaded and fed into a range of software solutions to transform raw data into
filtered and orthorectified spectral bands in reflectance. Using Headwall SpectralView R software, raw
hypercubes from the surveyed area were automatically processed. The preprocessing operations
included radiance, orthorectification (through ground control points) and the white reference
illumination spectrum (WRIS). The WRIS spectrum comes from the extraction of the radiance signature
of a Spectralon target from an acquired image in the surveyed area. Using the orthorectified imagery
and the WRIS, reflectance data and scene shading are calculated through CSIRO | Data61 Scyven
1.3.0. software [56,57]. Considering the massive amount of data contained for any orthorectified
hyperspectral cube (4-12 GB), each cube is cropped to process regions of interest only (0.5-1 GB) and
handle with system resources efficiently, as shown in Figure 3.

An additional image that contains the localisation of tested trees in the exclusion trial is created.
From a recovered red, green, blue colour model (RGB) image of the cropped hypercube, each tree
is graphically labelled using their tracked GPS coordinates in Argis ArcMap 10.4. To handle all the
data processing from the proposed system framework, Algorithm 1 was developed. These tasks
were conducted with Python 2.7.14 programming language and several third-party libraries for data
manipulation and machine learning, including Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) 2.2.2 [58],
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) 0.6 [59], Scikit-learn 0.19.1 [60], OpenCV 3.3.0 [61] and

Reflectance cube bands are loaded into the program to calculate suitable spectral indexes and
improve the detection rates as mentioned in Step 2. For this approach, the most traditional indexes
are calculated such as the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) [63], the green normalised
difference vegetation index (GNDVI) [64], the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) [65] and the second
modified adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI2) [66]. Additionally, two-dimensional (2D) smoothing
kernels are applied into such indexes, following Equation (1).

where K is the kernel of the filter and w the size of the window. Here, up to three kernels for w = 3,
w = 7 and w = 15 are calculated per vegetation index. All the hypercube bands in reflectance, as well
as calculated vegetation spectral indexes, are denominated data features. In Step 3, an array of features
is generated from all the retrieved bands I and the calculated indexes S.

2.3. Training and Prediction

140
141

The labelled regions from the ground-based assessments are exported from ArcMap and loaded
into an array Y. In Step 5, an array D is created by filtering the features from X with their corresponding
labels in Y only. Filtered data is separated into a training (80%) and testing (20%) data array. In step 7,
data is processed into a supervised XGBoost classifier. This model is utilised considering the moderate
amount of labelled data (insufficient to run a deep learning model), the amount of information to be
processed for a single hypercube and the nature of data from the exclusion trial (ground-based test).
This classifier is currently a cutting-edge decision tree and gradient boosting model optimised for
large tree structures, excellent performance and fast execution speeds, outperforming detection rates
of standard non-linear models such as random forests, k-NN, LDA and SVM [59]. Moreover, input
data features do not require any scaling (normalisation) in comparison with other models. Once the
model is fitted, Step 8 retrieves the relevance of each processed feature (reflectance bands, spectral
indexes and transformed images) from the array X in a list R. The list is sorted to discard irrelevant
features, increment the detection rates of the algorithm, avoid over-fitting, decrease the complexity of
the model and reduce computer processing loads.
Algorithm 1 executes a loop to evaluate the optimal number of ranked features that can offer
the best balance between accuracy and data processing load. At each instance of the loop, specific
features from the training set DT is filtered based on a threshold of relevance scores (Step 10). Later,
the XGBoost model is fit using the filtered training set (Step 11) to records all the accuracy values per
combination. In Step 14, the best combination of accuracy and number of features is retrieved to re-fit
the classifier. Finally, the fitted model is validated using k-fold cross validation (Step 15).
In the prediction stage, unlabelled pixels are processed in the optimised classifier and their values
displayed into the same 2D spatial image from the orthorectified hyperspectral cube. Ultimately,
classified pixels are depicted using distinguishable colours and exported in tagged image file (TIF)
format, a compatible file with georeferencing-based software.

myrtle rust on them.

In order to evaluate the effects and flora response of myrtle rust on paperbark trees, a biological
study in an exclusion trial on the mentioned site was conducted. Several on-ground assessments were
conducted in individual trees within a replicated block design using four treatments: trees treated
with fungicides (F), insecticides (I), fungicides and insecticides (F + I) and trees without any treatment
action. Figure 5 illustrates the treatment methods the studied trees received.

From the indicators generated, insect and disease assessments were extracted to label every
tree. Overall, the assessment report showed that only the trees that received insecticide and fungicide
treatments remained healthy under direct exposure to the rust. In contrast, trees treated with insecticide
were affected by rust and those treated with fungicide were affected by insects. Thus, trees treated
with fungicides and insecticides were consequently labelled as healthy and the others as affected in
the database.

As mentioned in Section 2.2, the entire surveyed area included an exclusion trial. As a result, an
orthorectified hyperspectral cube in reflectance with spatial dimensions of 2652  1882 pixels sized
5.4 GB was generated. This area was cropped from the original hypercube, reducing computational
costs and discarding irrelevant data. Eventually, a 1.7 GB cube of 1200  1400 pixels as depicted in
Figure 6 was extracted.

The XGBoost classifier contains several hyper-parameters to be set. Following a grid search
technique, in which the classifier performance and detection rates were tracked with a set of possible
hyper-parameters, the optimal values found for this case study were:

where estimators is the number of trees, learning rate is the step size of each boosting step and
maximum depth is the maximum depth per tree that defines the complexity of the model.

To visualise the benefits of inserting an optimisation scheme in Step 8 of Algorithm 1, detection
rates were tracked by training and running the classifier multiple times with only a set of filtered
features per instance. The features were ranked with their relevance by the XGBoost classifier and
sorted consequently, as illustrated in Figure 7.

The classifier can achieve high accuracy rates exceeding 97% of global accuracy when it processes
data using from 10 to 40 features only, with an optimal number of features of 24. On the other
hand, the classifier merely improves their registers when the number of processed features is more
substantial. With this capability, the proposed approach can process fewer data and reduce the number
of calculations to achieve high detection values. Additionally, this boosts the capability of the algorithm
of processing large datasets in less time, an ideal scenario for mapping vast rural areas. The most
relevant features of this study case are depicted in Table 1 and Figure 8.

It is shown how the first four features for this classification task come from specific vegetation
indexes and processed images by 2D kernels, specifically, NDVI, shading and GNDVI features
(Figure 8a,8b,8c,8d). Although their illustrations show insights of distinguishable intensities between
healthy and affected tree regions from Figure 5, these set of features are insufficient to segment areas of
other objects. Thus, specific reflectance wavelengths bands such as 999 and 444 nm (Figure 8e,8f) are
also determinant. Also, features processed with 2D kernels obtained better relevance scores than their
unprocessed counterparts. That difference was even greater for processed features using big window
kernels considering that high amounts of noise, common in raw hyperspectral imagery, altered the
performance of the approach. Nonetheless, these rankings do not suggest that these features can be
used as global indicators to detect and map similar case studies (myrtle rust); the feature ranking table
showed here is relevant to the fitted XGBoost model only and results may differ if the same features
are processed through other machine learning techniques. It is recommended, therefore, to perform
individual analyses for every case study.
A total of 11, 385 pixels contained in 23 features filtered by their relevance were read again in
Step 14 of Algorithm 1. Data was divided into a training array DE with 9108 pixels and a testing array
DT with 2277 pixels. The generated confusion matrix of the classifier and its performance report is
shown in Table 2 and Table 3.

In sum, most of the classes were predicted favourably. The majority of misclassifications between
the Healthy and Affected classes are possibly caused by human error while labelling the regions
manually in the raw imagery. Considering a weighed importance of precision and recall of 1:1, the
F-support scores highlight a detection rate of 97.24% for healthy trees, 94.25% for affected trees, and an
overall detection rate of 97.35%.

Taking into account the dimensions of the processed hypercube (1400  1200) and the initial
number of bands (274), it is observed how a great demand of resources were invested to open the file
itself and calculate spectral indexes, accumulating 61.7 seconds, in average. Similarly, the features
filtering process in the training section also demanded considerable time, exceeding 50 seconds. On
the other hand, the elapsed time executing the remaining tasks of the training phase are remarkably
small. Specifically, the report highlights the benefits of filtering irrelevant features by comparing the
duration of fitting the classifier for the first time with the duration of re-fitting it again with less yet
relevant data from 8.74 to 0.99 seconds. Overall, the application spent 2 minutes and 51 seconds to
evaluate and map an area of 338 m2 approximately.
The GSD value of 4.7 cm/pixel from the acquired hyperspectral imagery represented a minor
challenge to label individual trees, but is still problematic when highlighting specific stems or leaflets
is needed. Higher resolution can assist in higher classification rates. As an illustration, the final
segmented image of the optimised classifier is shown in Figure 9, where Figure 9a shows the digital
labelling of every class region and Figure 9b depicts the generated segmentation output by Algorithm 1.
A hypercube covering the entire area flown was also processed using the trained model with results
shown in Figure 10.

Results show a segmentation output using XGBoost as the supervised machine learning classifier
that works well for this task. This classifier as well as Algorithm 1 are not only important for their
capabilities to offer a pixel-wise classification task, but they also allow a rapid convergence, do not
involve many complex mathematical calculations and filter irrelevant data, compared to other methods.
Nevertheless, it is suggested to revise their prediction performance with new data. Like any model
based on decision trees, over-fitting may occur, and misleading results might be generated. In those
situations, labelling misclassified data, aggregating them into the features database and rerunning the
algorithm is suggested.

The availability to process and classify data with small GSD values demonstrates the potential
of UASs for remote sensing equipment compared with satellite and manned aircraft for forest health
assessments on forest and tree plantations, and traditional estimation methods, such as statistical
regression models in regions of study. In comparison with similar approaches of non-invasive
assessment techniques using UAVs and spectral sensors, this framework does not provide general
spectral indexes that can be applied with different classifiers and similar evaluations. In contrast, this
presented method boosts the efficiency of the classifier by receiving feedback from the accuracy scores
of every feature and transforming the input data in consequence. The more explicit the data for the
classifier is, the better the classification rates are. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that a classifier
which processes and combines data from multiple spectral indexes provides better performance than
analysing individual components from different source sensors.

This paper describes a pipeline methodology for effective detection and mapping of indicators
of poor health in forest and plantation trees integrating UAS technology and artificial intelligence
approaches. The techniques were illustrated with an accurate classification and segmentation task
of paperbark tea trees deteriorated by myrtle rust from an exclusion trial in NSW, Australia. Here,
the system achieved detection rates of 97.24% for healthy trees and 94.72% for affected trees. The
algorithm obtained a multiclass detection rate of 97.35%. Data labelling is a task that demands many
resources from both site-based and remote sensing methods, affecting smoothly, the accuracy and
reliability of the classifier results due to human errors.
The approach can be used to train various datasets from different sensors to improve detection
rates that single solutions offer as well as the capability of processing large datasets using free-ware
software. The case study demonstrates an effective approach that allows rapid and accurate indicators,
and alterations of exposed areas at early stages. However, understanding disease epidemiology
and interactions between the pathogen and host is still required to enable the effective use of these
technologies.
Future research should discuss the potential of monitoring the evolution of affected species
through time, the prediction of expansion directions and rates of the disease, and how data will
contribute on improving control actions to deter their presence in unaffected areas. Technologically,
future works should analyse and compare the efficacy of unsupervised algorithms to label vegetation
items accurately, integrate the best approaches in the proposed pipeline and evaluate regression models
that predict data based on other biophysical information offered by site-based methods.
