Abstract
Tropical forest condition has important implications for biodiversity, climate change and human needs. Structural features of forests can
serve as useful indicators of forest condition and have the potential to be assessed with remotely sensed imagery, which can provide
quantitative information on forest ecosystems at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Herein, we investigate the utility of remote sensing for
assessing, predicting and mapping two important forest structural features, stem density and basal area, in tropical, littoral forests in
southeastern Madagascar. We analysed the relationships of basal area and stem density measurements to the Normalised Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI) and radiance measurements in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+).
Strong relationships were identified among all of the individual bands and field based measurements of basal area ( pb0.01) while there were
weak and insignificant relationships among spectral response and stem density measurements. NDVI was not significantly correlated with
basal area but was strongly and significantly correlated with stem density (r=0.69, pb0.01) when using a subset of the data, which
represented extreme values. We used an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict basal area from radiance values in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 and
to produce a predictive map of basal area for the entire forest landscape. The ANNs produced strong and significant relationships between
predicted and actual measures of basal area using a jackknife method (r=0.79, pb0.01) and when using a larger data set (r=0.82, pb0.01).
The map of predicted basal area produced by the ANN was assessed in relation to a pre-existing map of forest condition derived from a semiquantitative field assessment. The predictive map of basal area provided finer detail on stand structural heterogeneity, captured known
climatic influences on forest structure and displayed trends of basal area associated with degree of human accessibility. These findings
demonstrate the utility of ANNs for integrating satellite data from the Landsat ETM+ spectral bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 with limited field survey
data to assess patterns in basal area at the landscape scale.

(Gedney & Valdes, 2000), act as carbon sinks (Grace et al.,
1995), are rich in biodiversity, containing over half of the
planets life forms (Wilson, 1988), provide valuable
ecosystem services, and serve as vital resources for human
populations (Laurance, 1999). Thus, monitoring the state
and condition of tropical forests can also provide indications
of the health of our planet and its inhabitants. A considerable amount of research has investigated the use of
satellite imagery for measuring tropical deforestation, a
process which can be readily observed by comparing pixels
that have changed from forest to non-forest in images
collected on different dates (Green & Sussman, 1990; Skole
& Tucker, 1993). However, this crisp, binary approach is

492

unable to capture and describe the great variety of processes
that reduce or alter forest cover without eliminating it
(Sgrenzaroli et al., 2002; Stone & Lefebvre, 1998). This
more subtle process of dforest degradationT refers to the
temporary or permanent decrease in the density, biomass
and/or overall structure of vegetation cover and/or its
species composition (Grainger, 1993; Sgrenzaroli et al.,
2002). Because forest degradation involves internal or
vertical change within the forest, it is more difficult to
detect with remote sensing than forest clearance. It is
important to investigate methods for monitoring these subtle
changes since forest modification is generally a more
prevalent process than deforestation (Lambin, 1999; Nepstad et al., 1999).
A degraded or modified forest may also be classified as
a secondary forest. Tropical secondary forests are
excluded from many forest assessments and conservation
plans despite the fact that they constitute approximately
40% of tropical forest cover (Brown & Lugo, 1990).
Conservation and management of these forests are crucial
since they often provide valuable resources to human
communities, retain significant amounts of biodiversity
and may relieve pressure on primary forests (Cadotte et
al., 2002). Sustainable management of tropical secondary
forests will require more scientific knowledge and a better
understanding of human impact on these forests (Brown &
Lugo, 1990; Moran et al., 1996).
Multi-spectral satellite images available at high spatial
and temporal resolutions can provide a useful means for
monitoring and assessing forest condition, forest modification and dtop downT secondary forest formation (i.e., the
conversion of old growth forest to secondary forest through
continual degradation processes). A key step towards using
remotely sensed images for this purpose is to determine the
relationship between spectral information contained within
an image and forest structural properties that are indicative
of forest condition. The spectral response of a forest is
determined by the structure of the canopy through its
relationships with leaf area index or canopy cover (Danson,
1995), which controls the amount of understory vegetation,
leaf litter and soil that are visible to the sensor (Franklin,
1986). The spectral response is indirectly determined by
features that shape the structure of the canopy such as
biomass, age, density, mean tree height and basal area (Lee
& Nakane, 1996; Peterson et al., 1987; Rock et al., 1986).
Many of these features, such as basal area and stem density,
are also indicators of forest condition. For example, basal
area and density of large stems has been shown to be higher
in protected areas and old growth forests and tend to
decrease with increasing levels of disturbance (Bhat et al.,
2000; Bhuyan et al., 2002; Chittibabu & Parthasarathy,
2000; Macedo & Anderson, 1993). Reduction in basal area
or tree biomass due to human disturbance, such as selective
logging, may be attributed to a preference for trees of larger
size classes for construction purposes (Medley, 1993;
Vermeulen, 1996), although these patterns may vary across

sites. Similarly, most tropical secondary forests are characterized as having a high density of trees b10 cm diameter at
breast height (dbh), short trees with small diameters, low
overall basal area and a high leaf area index (Brown &
Lugo, 1990). The distinct structural characteristics of
disturbed and secondary forests and the correlative relationships with canopy reflectance support the utility of remote
sensing as a useful tool for assessing forest condition and
forest disturbances, which are often patchily distributed
across a landscape both spatially and temporally (Cannon et
al., 1994).
Multiple studies have compared the application of different satellite sensors for monitoring forest structural features
(Brockhaus & Khorram, 1992; Hyyppa et al., 2000; Lefsky
et al., 2001). These studies have shown that the Landsat
Thematic Mapper (TM) provides comparable and, in some
cases, stronger predictions of certain forest structural
features, such as basal area, when compared to radar satellite
systems (Hyyppa et al., 2000; Lefsky et al., 2001) or other
optical sensors of similar spectral and spatial resolution
(Brockhaus & Khorram, 1992). The Landsat data have clear
practical advantages over the spectrally comparable SPOT
imagery, which include lower costs (Hyyppa et al., 2000). In
comparison to hyperspectral or hyperspatial resolution
sensors, the Landsat data are less expensive, have lower
storage requirements, higher spatial coverage and comparative ease of processing, which is aided by a substantial body
of published literature concerning Landsat image processing
methods. Due to the strong results derived from Landsat
imagery for monitoring forest structural features as shown in
previous studies combined with the practical advantages of
the sensor, this research utilized Landsat ETM+ imagery for
the assessment of tropical forest basal area and stem density
in southeastern Madagascar. The practical advantages of a
sensor are especially important to consider when determining suitable imagery to use for research or monitoring in
developing countries where a high percentage of tropical
forests are located and where resources for conservation and
environmental management are often limited.
Previous studies have found significant relationships
among spectral information within Landsat TM or ETM+
imagery and variables such as forest age, successional
status, basal area, height, biomass, density and volume
(Brockhaus & Khorram, 1992; Foody et al., 2001, 2003;
Jakubauskas, 1996; Olsson, 1994; Puhr & Donoghue, 2000;
Steininger, 2000). Research on remote sensing of tropical
forest attributes has indicated that the optimal spectral bands
for estimating forest structural features may vary across
studies and across sites within the same study (Foody et al.,
2001, 2003; Steininger, 2000). These issues are at the crux
of a central problem in remote sensing applications, which is
the inability to generalize across studies in both space and
time (Woodcock et al., 2001).
To overcome these obstacles, more knowledge is
needed on the relationships among spectral response and
forest structural characteristics at different sites. Addition-

ally, there is a need to apply and test similar methodologies so as to increase comparability of results from
separate investigations.
Various methods exist for utilizing and analyzing spectral
information to assess vegetation or forest structural parameters. One widely used approach is to combine spectral
information from multiple bands into a composite value
known as a spectral vegetation index (Cohen & Goward,
2004). Of the many vegetation indices that exist, the
Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is among
the most common in remote sensing studies and provides an
estimate of vegetation greenness or biomass per pixel
(Goward et al., 1985). However, several factors limit the
applications of NDVI in tropical forest studies. One
limitation of the NDVI is that vegetation greenness within
a pixel saturates at a threshold level, beyond which NDVI
values are insensitive to increasing vegetation amount
(Ripple, 1985). Furthermore, NDVI provides measures of
vegetation greenness and soil reflectance, which may be
more sensitive to topographic variation than to actual soil or
vegetation properties (Cohen & Goward, 2004). An additional disadvantage of using the NDVI alone is that it
utilizes a limited amount of the total spectral information
available within an image (Foody et al., 2001). Methods that
integrate a broader range of spectral data may provide more
information on vegetation cover than possible with the use
of a single vegetation index.
The statistical analyses used for understanding the
relationships among spectral data and forest attributes
should accommodate for the possibility that these relationships may be non-linear and complex. Regression and
correlation analyses have commonly been used within
remote sensing studies (Jensen et al., 1999; Lawrence &
Ripple, 1998). However, these approaches typically assume
linear relationships among variables of interest while plant
biophysical characteristics often do not conform to these
criteria (Jensen et al., 1999). For this reason, nonparametric
statistical methods may be more useful for describing the
relationship between remotely sensed imagery and environmental variables since these tests make no a priori
assumptions about the data. An artificial neural network
(ANN) offers a powerful method for analysing complex
relationships among variables without making assumptions
about the data. ANNs are capable of handling non-normality, nonlinearity and collinearity in a system (Haykin, 1994).
This capability is a major advantage of ANNs for assessing
the relationships between forest structural attributes and
spectral reflectance values, which are frequently non-linear
and complex and, in turn, may vary across the different
wavebands.
An ANN is defined by an assemblage of bneurons,Q a
protocol for the way the neurons are networked, organized,
weighted and connected, and a learning rule (Baret, 1995).
An ANN is typically composed of an input layer, one output
layer and one or more hidden layers (Jensen et al., 1999).
The system dlearnsT by predicting output data from patterns

493

learned from a set of input training data (Pearson et al.,
2002). By comparing the current output layer to a desired
output response, the difference between the two can be
obtained and used to adjust weights within the network. The
goal is to achieve a set of weights that produce results that
closely resemble the target output. This adaptive learning
process is repeated until the difference between predicted
and training values drop below a predetermined threshold of
user-defined accuracy (Jensen et al., 1999). Once constructed and after patterns in the data have been learned, the
ANN can be used to estimate or predict values for similar
but unexperienced instances of the data (Carvalho, 2001).
ANNs have recently been shown to provide useful
alternatives to traditional statistical analyses in forest remote
sensing research. Jensen et al. (1999) observed stronger
relationships among the age of coniferous forests in Brazil
and spectral data from bands 3,4 and 5 of the Landsat TM
when using artificial neural networks versus multiple
regression. They suggest that this reflects the ability of
ANNs to handle collinearity among the spectral bands,
which may degrade the predictive power of the multiple
regression. ANNs have also been shown to provide stronger
relationships between actual and predicted estimates of
biomass when using ground data and Landsat TM data of
moist tropical forests in Brazil, Malaysia and Thailand when
compared to predictions derived from multiple regression or
vegetation indices (Foody et al., 2003). In a comparison of
the predictive power of neural networks to multiple
vegetation indices, including NDVI, Foody et al. (2001)
found that the neural networks provided the strongest
relationship between predicted and actual estimates of
above ground biomass (derived from dbh, basal area and
tree height) using the 6 non-thermal bands of the Landsat
TM in a tropical rain forest in Borneo.
In this study, we used Landsat ETM+ imagery to assess
structural attributes of coastal forests in southeast Madagascar. Madagascar is one of the worlds foremost biodiversity hotspots due to its combination of exceptional
amounts of endemic species and high estimates of forest
loss (Myers et al., 2000). The islands forests are also
important for human livelihoods since approximately 80%
of the islands population is rural and villagers are often
largely dependent upon forests for ecosystem services and
resources such as fuel wood and construction materials
(Shyamsundar & Kramer, 1997; World Bank, 2003).
Despite considerable research on the clearance and extent
of Madagascars rain forests (Green & Sussman, 1990;
Mayaux et al., 2000; Nelson & Horning, 1993), there has
been surprisingly little research on the application of remote
sensing for estimating forest structural features on the
island. An initial assessment of the utility of remote sensing
data for estimating forest structure in Madagascar is a
necessary first step towards developing a program for
monitoring forest degradation. Thus, the aims of this study
are (i) to assess the utility of using remotely sensed data
from the Landsat ETM+ for the assessment of forest

494

structural features in southeast Madagascar, (ii) to assess
patterns in forest structure at a landscape scale and (iii) to
determine if remote sensing can provide a useful quantitative alternative to commonly used semi-quantitative surveys
of forest condition. In this study, basal area and stem density
are the primary structural features assessed because they
have been shown to be useful indicators of forest
disturbance (Bhat et al., 2000; Bhuyan et al., 2002;
Chittibabu & Parthasarathy, 2000; Macedo & Anderson,
1993) and because basal area can be directly related to
biomass and collected with relative ease (Salvador, 2000).

2. Methods
2.1. Site description
The study site is comprised of approximately 2800 ha of
tropical littoral rain forest in southeastern Madagascar and is
distributed across three sites: Ste. Luce, Mandena and
Petriky (Fig. 1). The forests of St. Luce and Mandena exist
as a mosaic of littoral forest fragments while Petriky, the
southernmost of the three forests, exists predominately as
one large littoral forest parcel. These forests are the last
intact vestiges of littoral forest located on sand and have
been characterized as floristically and structurally distinct
from other similar forests in the region due to their low
height and low dbh values (Dumetz, 1999). The three forests
have been classified as a subtype of rain forest within a
broader class of regional lowland rain forest, which,
collectively, are among the worlds most biodiverse forest
regions for plants due to high tree species richness and a
high proportion of endemics (Dumetz, 1999). There is a
distinct climatic gradient from north to south, with
conditions becoming drier and hotter to the south (Goodman
et al., 1997). The wet season occurs from November to May
with annual average rainfall amounts averaging 2400 mm in
Mandena and Ste. Luce and 1200 mm in Petriky (QMM,
2001). The forests are located at elevations less than 50 m
and comprise a relatively narrow band of coastal plain and
adjacent foothills averaging approximately 7 km in width
and extending from 24835VS to 25808VS latitude (Lewis
Environmental Consultants, 1992).
The forests in the three areas are used by local people for
subsistence purposes, which include fuel wood, construction
materials, food and medicine. Due to long-term human
pressure, the forests are considered as degraded or secondary forests. The future persistence of the forests is under
pressure not only from local use but also from the potential
establishment of a large mining operation, which will
progressively exploit each of the three forest blocks for
ilmenite deposits.
These forests have been mapped and preclassified by
degradation level as determined from a semi-quantitative
ground assessment of canopy closure conducted from 1999
to 2001 as part of an Environmental Impact Assessment of

mining in the region (QMM, 2001, Fig. 1). Forest stands
were classified as belonging to one of five classes of forest
condition: very good condition, good condition, moderate
degradation, strong degradation, extreme degradation. Classification was based on percent canopy cover as determined
from visual assessments made by at least two observers
walking transect(s) throughout forest parcels. If a forest
block possessed a high degree of heterogeneity in canopy
closure, then more than one class could be assigned to a
single stand. This classification system was reviewed by
Missouri Botanical Gardens, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew
and the Centre National de Recherche Appliquee au
Developpement Rural (FOFIA) in Madagascar and was
deemed valid for the assessment and mapping of canopy
degradation in littoral forests (Lowry et al., 1999). However,
the reviewers noted that an investigation into the use of
canopy degradation as a proxy for overall levels of littoral
forest disturbance was needed. The reviewers also suggested
that a quantitative study in selected parcels representing
each of the forest condition classes be undertaken to provide
information on patterns of forest degradation, such as the
spatial correlation of tree cutting to villages, roads and paths
(Lowry et al., 1999). Forest resource use may intensify
differentially across the landscape when the mining proceeds as there would be progressively less forest available to
local people. Thus, because such pressure will directly
impact biodiversity and resource needs of local communities, it is important to identify and map patterns in forest
structure before widespread land use change begins.
2.2. Field surveys
In November 2001, twenty-one belt transects were
surveyed in the three study sites. Samples were taken
within six forest stands belonging to four of the five
different degradation classes (2 strongly degraded, 2
moderately degraded, 1 in good condition, 1 in very good
condition). The more degraded stands were smaller in size
and, for this reason, two stands were sampled within the
strongly degraded and moderately degraded classes. No
samples were collected in the extreme degradation class
since there was often no intact forest at these sites. Each
transect was 100 m by 4m and the site of each transect was
randomly selected within each stand and sited at least 100 m
from the forest edge when stand size permitted. The cardinal
direction of each transect was randomly selected unless the
selected direction of the transect would extend the transect
into a land cover type other than forest (i.e., swamp or
matrix). At each site, geographic coordinates were recorded
with a Geographical Positioning System (GPS) allowing
geo-referencing to the satellite data. Within each transect, all
trees with a dbh (dbh taken at 1.3 m from the forest floor) N5
cm within the 4 m by 100 m transect were identified and the
dbh recorded. Where there was more than one stem, all
stems N5 cm dbh were recorded, enabling basal area and
stem density to be calculated.

An earlier field campaign was conducted in the region
during July 2000 and measurements of stem density and
dbh within 23 transects were collected. This data set was
used to test the predictive power of the neural networks
when trained with the ground data collected in 2001.
However, the 18-month time lag between the collection
of the 2000 test data and satellite image acquisition in
January 2002 is less than ideal since these forests are
used daily by local people and, thus, there could easily
have been significant change in the forest structure in the
interim. This is a problem characteristic of many remote
sensing studies in which it is often difficult to obtain
appropriate satellite imagery and ground data from
identical time periods (Foody & Curran, 1994). Seven
points were removed from the data set because significant forest change had occurred at these sites as indicated
by ground observations, visual analysis of aerial photography of the study region taken in December 2000 and a
comparison of Landsat TM satellite images of the area
from November 1999 and January 2002. Thus, the final
set of testing data was comprised of 16 samples. The
2000 field data were collected using a variable area
transect (VAT) which is a rapid assessment method for
measuring forest structure (Askew, 2001). Transect width
was identical to the field surveys conducted in 2001,
although the length of the VAT varied as a function of
the amount of trees counted within each of three size
classes (510 cm dbh, 1015 cm dbh, and N15 cm dbh).
The length of the transect terminated when the quota of
forty trees of each of three size classes had been filled or
when the length of the transect reached 100 m. These
transects were located in 6 forest stands (5 in Mandena
and 1 in St. Luce) and were selected to represent the five
different forest condition classes (2 stands were necessary
to obtain an adequate number of samples within the
extreme degradation class). The forest stands selected in
the 2000 survey were based on classifications of forest
condition made in 1998 and were derived using the same
semi-quantitative assessment method (QMM, 1998).
Transects within each stand were carefully sited so as
to reflect the overall classification status of the forest
stand.
To determine the compatibility between the measurements of total basal area/m2 and stem density derived from
the different methods, the ground data collected in 2001
were transformed into the VAT data format. This transformation was done by dividing the data collected in 2001
into the three size classes designated in 2000 and
recalculating the basal area and stem density. The relationship between the estimates of forest structure using the VAT
method of 2000 and the fixed transect method of 2001 was
very strong for basal area (r=0.98, n=21, pb0.01) and strong
for stem density (r=0.79, n=21, pb0.01). Thus, the potential
error associated with the use of these slightly different
methods is negligible for basal area but more of a concern
for stem density.

2.3. Landsat ETM+ data
A Landsat ETM+ scene (path 158, row 077) covering the
study site was obtained for January 2002. Preprocessing
requirements of satellite imagery may include atmospheric,
radiometric, topographic and geometric correction. Atmospheric and radiometric corrections are necessary when
comparing multiple images from different locations or time
periods. However, atmospheric corrections were not performed in this study since single date imagery was used, all
of the sites of interest are located within the same image
(Song et al., 2001), the image was free from cloud cover,
and the topography of the study site is relatively uniform
(Jensen et al., 1999). For the same reasons, it was not
necessary to convert radiance values into reflectance values
(Jensen et al., 1999). The image was received in the UTM/
WGS 84 coordinate system and reprojected to the Oblique
Mercator Hotine projection system using a nearest neighbour resampling method and a polynomial approximation.
The root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.058 pixels. Pixel
size was 28.5 m. All transect geographical coordinates were
converted into the Oblique Mercator Hotine projection
system and then located on the image. All of the image
preprocessing and spectral extraction operations were
conducted in Erdas Imagine version 8.4.
The radiance of the red (band 3), near-infrared (NIR)(band 4), mid-infrared (MIR) (band 5) and MIR (band 7)
bands and standard deviations (SD) for each band at each
transect site were extracted using a 33 pixel window. Each
window was centered on the GPS recorded position of each
transect in order to minimize any potential mislocation
errors (similar to Asner et al., 2002; Foody et al., 2001). An
NDVI image was created from the red and NIR bands and,
in the same manner, the NDVI value and SD of each
window was extracted. Bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the Landsat
ETM+ were selected for this study since these bands have
distinct spectral responses to vegetation, soil and litter and
have successfully been used within similar studies to predict
forest structural features such as age and basal area (Jensen
et al., 1999; Steininger, 2000). In band 3 (red), vegetation
appears dark and soils and surface litter appear brighter than
vegetation (Richardson & Wiegand, 1990) due to chlorophyll absorption of red wavelengths. In band 4 (NIR),
vegetation appears bright due to high reflectance and multiscattering of photons as a function of the internal structure
of the leaves and the number of layers in the canopy
(Lillesand & Kiefer, 1994) while soils and litter appear
darker (Asner, 1998). The mid-infrared (MIR) bands are less
studied than the red and NIR bands and are commonly
known as the dwater absorption bandsT because water in the
leaf strongly absorbs radiation at these wavelengths, meaning reflectance in these bands is inversely related to the total
water present in the leaf (Lillesand & Kiefer, 1994). The
inclusion of the MIR bands on the Landsat Thematic and
Enhanced Thematic sensors, the first Earth Observing
satellite system to provide data at these wavelengths, has

J.C. Ingram et al. / Remote Sensing of Environment 94 (2005) 491507

enhanced the amount and type of forestry information that
can be derived from satellite imagery (Cohen & Goward,
2004). Steininger (2000) found that the MIR bands were the
most useful Thematic Mapper bands for estimating age and
biomass of Amazonian forests. Nemani et al. (1993) found
that MIR response decreases with increasing canopy
closure. Open canopy sites have a relatively high MIR
response compared to closed canopy sites due to the lower
water content of understory vegetation and bare soil. In turn,
among open canopy stands, sites with understory vegetation
had a lower MIR response compared to those with bare soil
(Nemani et al., 1993). Horler and Ahern (1986) suggested
that the Landsat TM MIR bands are also sensitive to
shadowing and vegetation density, making them useful for
monitoring clear cuts and regeneration. The two MIR bands
on the Landsat TM and ETM+ are band 5 (mid-infrared
centered at 1.65 Am) in which vegetation appears moderately dark while soils and litter appear very bright, and band
7 (mid infrared at 2.22 Am) in which vegetation appears
extremely dark while soils and litter are extremely bright
(Asner et al., 2002).
The standard deviation of the spectral response of each
band can provide a textural assessment of canopy structure
(Hudak & Wessman, 1998). Canopy roughness is known to
increase with the age and/or successional status of a forest
(Whitmore, 1990) as a canopy changes from a homogenous
canopy of a few light loving pioneers to a more diverse,
uneven canopy composed of many mature, slow growing
species of various ages (Swaine & Hall, 1983). Mature
forests have natural intercrown shadowing and treefall gaps
that give rise to background reflectance and textural values
(Asner et al., 2002).
2.4. Statistical analyses
2.4.1. Correlation analyses
Preliminary analyses of the structural, spectral reflectance and NDVI data were conducted within the SPSS
statistical package using descriptive statistics and correlation analyses. A KolmogorovSmirnov test was conducted to determine the normality of the data (Dytham,
1999). All of the bands and NDVI statistically conformed
to normal distributions, as did the forest structural
parameters of stem density and basal area. However,
the degree of normality was variable, there were potential
outliers in the dataset(s) and the relationships of interest
were likely to be non-linear and complex. Therefore,
Spearmans rank correlations were used in this analysis
(Catlow, 1993; Zou et al., 2003). Spearmans tests were
conducted to determine the correlations of the spectral
information in each band with the field data. The data
sets collected in 2000 and 2001 were analysed separately
in order to assess the influence of the time lag and
slightly different ground survey techniques on the
relationships among spectral response and forest structural

2.4.2. Artificial neural networks
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used in this
research (i) to determine the relationship of Landsat ETM+
bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 and textural information in those bands
to basal area and stem density and (ii) based on this
relationship, to use the spectral data within the image to
predict structural attributes of pixels comprising littoral
forest where no ground data had been collected. NDVI was
excluded from the ANN analysis because of the weak
correlations observed among NDVI and structural measures.
Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are the most common type
of ANN used for remote sensing studies (Carvalho, 2001)
and have proved to be effective in comparable studies
(Foody et al., 2001). MLP networks were applied in this
research and were trained with a back propagation learning
principle and one hidden layer. The back propagation
learning principle has been demonstrated in other studies
to be the best learning principle for modelling non-linear
relationships (Jensen et al., 1999). The number of neurons,
also known as processing elements, is data dependent and so
the following general formula was applied:
N  2i  1

1

where N is the number of neurons and i is equal to the
number of inputs in the input layer. There were eight
inputs consisting of the spectral response values for each
of the four spectral bands and the SD values of each
band. The desired output was either the basal area or stem
density. These structural parameters were tested separately
in relation to the spectral information but the same
architecture was used for each network: one input layer,
one hidden layer and one output layer. For all of the
networks created, a sigmoid axon transfer function, which
is a non-linear transfer function, was used with a
momentum learning rule, a step size of 1.00 and a
momentum set to 0.700. It is recommended to standardize
input variables to values between 0 and 1 (Jensen et al.,
1999; Lloyd, 1996) so the data were standardized using
the formula:
SV   R  min=max  min

2

where SV is the standardized value, R is the real value,
min is the minimum value in the training data and max is
the maximum value of the training data.
Two different approaches were used for testing the
relationship between spectral response and forest structure
within the neural networks, although the network architecture and structure was identical for both approaches.
2.4.2.1. The ANN using ground data from 2001 and 2000:
the 2001/2000 ANN. In the 2001/2000 ANN, the 21
transects collected in November of 2001 were used as the
training data and the 16 transects collected in July of 2000
were used as the testing data. After creating and training the
network, the model was tested and actual measures of basal
area and stem density were plotted against the values for

498

each feature as predicted by the network for each transect
site. The predictive power of the model was tested using a
linear regression and a BlandAltman test (Bland & Altman,
1986). The linear regression gives information on the extent
to which the results of two methods are related while the
BlandAltman test examines whether values derived from
two methods agree sufficiently as to be used interchangeably. In this case, we compared the values of basal area
derived from two methods: (i) the remote sensing combined
with the ANN and (ii) the field surveys. Using a Bland
Altman test, the lack of agreement between two methods
can be summarized by calculating the bias, or the mean
difference between methods, and the standard deviation of
the differences using the equation:
LA  dF2SD

3

where d is the mean difference, SD is the standard deviation
of the differences and LA represents the upper and lower
limits of agreement. The degree of difference deemed
suitable to permit the substitution of one method for another
must be judged by the researcher and will depend on the
specific applications of the method.
2.4.2.2. The ANN using the 2001 ground data: 2001
Jackknife ANN. Due to concern over (a) the possibility
of structural change between the collection of the
validation data in July 2000 and acquisition of the satellite
image in January 2002 and (b) potential error associated
with differences in the ground survey methodologies, a
jackknifing technique was also used to test the predictive
power of the network. This analysis utilized only the
ground data collected in November 2001. In this
approach, all but one of the 21 transects from 2001 were
used as training data and the excluded transect was used
as the testing data. This process was repeated 21 times so
that all values of stem density and basal area were used as
testing data once, which produced a predicted value of
stem density and basal area for each of the 21 transects.
The relationship between predicted and actual values of
stem density/ basal area were assessed using a linear
regression and the BlandAltman test.

3. Results
3.1. Relationship of forest structure to spectral reflectance
values using correlation analyses
The results showed that the 2001 ground data were
strongly and significantly correlated with spectral response
in all wavebands while the relationships varied in strength
and significance when using the ground data collected in
2000 (Table 1). The correlations among basal area
measured in 2001 and spectral values were (in decreasing
order of strength) MIR band 5 (r=0.77, pb0.01), MIR
band 7 (r=0.76, pb0.01), NIR band 4 (r=0.66,
pb0.01) and the red band 3 (r=0.61, pb0.01). The basal
area measurements from the data collected in 2000 were
most strongly and significantly correlated with the NIR
band 4 (r=0.67, pb0.01), followed by reasonable and
significant relationships for the red band (r=0.55,
pb0.05) and MIR band 5 (r=0.54, pb0.05). The
relationship between basal area from the year 2000 data
and MIR band 7 (r=0.45, pN0.05) was not strong or
significant. In all cases, the correlation between basal area
and the spectral response was negative. NDVI was not
strongly or significantly correlated to basal area in either
of the data sets.
Stem density was not strongly related to spectral
response in any of the individual bands and demonstrated
widely divergent relationships with NDVI between the two
data sets. Stem density from the 2000 data was strongly and
significantly related to NDVI (r=0.69, pb0.01) but there
was no strong or significant relationship between the 2001
stem density data and NDVI (r=0.09, pN0.05). To test if
the difference in the relationship between the two data sets
was due to the different ground survey methods, the 2001
data were transformed into the VAT format and then
reanalysed with a Spearmans test in relation to NDVI.
The results showed no improvement in the strength of the
relationship (r=0.03, pN0.05) suggesting that the methodological difference does not account for the variability in the
correlations between the two years of ground data. A plot of
the negative relationship between NDVI and stem density
measurements from the year 2000 revealed a trend in which

2.5. Predictive map of basal area
The littoral forests were isolated from other vegetation
types by creating a littoral forest mask developed from
previous land cover classifications of the region. Using the
basal area data set collected from the field survey conducted
in 2001 as the training data, the neural network was used to
predict the basal area for all unsurveyed littoral forest pixels
from the spectral information in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7. The
predictions of basal area made by the neural network were
spatially displayed across the littoral landscape. The
resultant predictive map of basal area was compared to
the map of forest condition derived from the semiquantitative ground survey.

very high values of NDVI were tightly clustered at sites of
low stem density and scattered values of NDVI were

3.2.1. The 2001 Jackknife ANN
The 2001 Jackknife ANN produced stronger predictions
for basal area than for stem density. The relationship
between actual and predicted values of stem density was
weak and insignificant (r=0.02, n=21, pN0.05). The values
of basal area predicted by the 2001 Jackknife ANN were
strongly and significantly related to actual measurements of
basal area (r=0.79, n=21, pb0.01; Fig. 3a). The regression
line for this method was closely aligned with the 1:1 line.
The results of the BlandAltman test (Fig. 3b) revealed that
the mean difference between the actual measures and
predicted measures of basal area was low, at 0.25. The

J.C. Ingram et al. / Remote Sensing of Environment 94 (2005) 491507

agreement was 9.90. All of the measurements occur
within 2 SD of the mean difference.
3.2.2. The 2001/2000 ANN
The 2001/2000 ANN proved to be more powerful for
predicting basal area than for predicting stem density. The
relationship between predictions of stem density and actual
values of stem density was weak and insignificant (r=0.04,
n=16, pN0.05). The 2001/2000 ANN produced a strong and
significant relationship between actual and predicted values
of basal area (r=0.69, n=16, pb0.01). There was one outlier
for which the predicted values of basal area produced by the
2001/2000 ANN were considerably lower than the actual
measure of basal area. A plot of the residuals identified this
as an outlier, having a residual value greater than two
standard deviations from the mean residual value. It is likely
that this low prediction could be due to tree removal, which
has occurred at this transect since the ground data were
collected in July of 2000 and which was not detectable in
the visual comparison of aerial photography from December
2000 and satellite imagery from 2002 and 1999. This
sampling station was located in a forest fragment that is
close to the main village in St. Luce (S9) and is frequently
accessed by villagers for resources. Once this outlier was
removed, the relationship improved (r=0.82, n=15, pb0.01;
Fig. 3c). A comparison of the regression line with the 1:1
line demonstrates that, although the relationship is strong
between predicted and actual values of basal area, the
relationship substantially deviates from an exact relationship. This is shown in Fig. 3d through the results of the
BlandAltman test: the mean difference between actual and
predicted measures of basal area/m2 was 1.11. The upper
limit of agreement was 13.78 and the lower limit of
agreement was 11.56. The 15 data points fell within these
limits, which represent a 2 SD envelope around the mean
difference.
3.2.3. Textural information
The contribution of textural values to basal area
predictions was tested by running each network, the 2001/
2000 ANN and the 2001 Jackknife ANN, with the radiance
values within each band but without the textural information. The relationship between predicted and actual basal
area did not change significantly when the textural data
were removed from the input data within either the 2001/
2000 ANN (r=0.82, n=15, pb0.01) or the 2001 Jackknife
ANN (r=0.78, n=21, pb0.01).
3.2.4. The predictive map of basal area
The predictive map of basal area (Fig. 4) portrays
climatic influences on forest structure and trends in basal
area that appear to be associated with human access and
distance from forest edge. The model predicts Petriky to
have an overall low basal area when compared to St. Luce.
Within each forest site, where climate and other physical
conditions are generally uniform, distinctive trends of basal

501

area that appear to be linked to human access and distance
from forest edge can be observed.
In Petriky, pixels predicted to have the highest basal area
occur within the middle of the forest fragment. Although
these high predictions of basal area occur within pixels
proximate to the road, they were at a maximal distance from
the three villages located on the periphery of the forest.
A high degree of heterogeneity in the basal area
predictions across the Mandena site. Two fragments,
M15 and M16, have been designated by the mining
company as conservation zones and were predicted to have
a relatively high basal area when compared to the other
forest stands in the site. Forest fragments that lie proximate
to roads, such as M13 and M3, are predicted to have very
low basal area. These predictions of low basal area have
been confirmed by ground observations within these forest
parcels (JCI, the authors observations). In comparison,
fragments M4, M5, M6 and M7, which are set slightly
back from the road and are bordered by a river on the
northern boundaries of the fragments, were predicted to
have more inter-stand heterogeneity in basal area values
and a higher abundance of high basal area pixels when
compared to unprotected fragments within Mandena. The
pixels predicted to have the lowest basal area within M4,
M5, M6 and M7 fragments were located predominantly
along the edge of these fragments. Multiple pixels across
the Mandena site were predicted to have very high basal
area values (N20 cm/m2), notably in the area between
stands M15 and M16. However, ground observations have
revealed that most of these areas are wetland-like forest
habitats (JCI and TD, authors observations). These
swampy areas are characterized by a high abundance of
palm-like trees, with large leaves, which may have a
spectral signal similar to dense vegetation.
In St. Luce, there is one main road that passes by the
three surveyed forest parcels (S9, S8 and S7). Three villages
are located towards the end of this road, one of which is
extremely close to the forest stand of S9. The forest pixels
located closest to this village were predicted to have a
relatively lower basal area than pixels at greater distances
from the village and the road, most likely due to the ease of
access at these locations. The core areas of the forest parcels
were generally comprised of pixels with higher predicted
values of basal area. Within the three larger fragments, S9
and S6/S7 (which is bisected by a stream into S6 and S7),
there was a higher overall basal area when compared to the
smaller fragments such as S8 and other forest stands
included in the region.

4. Discussion
The relationships among spectral values and basal area
derived from the correlation analyses and those between
predicted and actual measures of basal area derived from the
ANNs demonstrate that the selected wavebands from the

502

J.C. Ingram et al. / Remote Sensing of Environment 94 (2005) 491507

Landsat ETM+ are useful for estimating forest basal area for
the study site. The correlation analyses provided descriptive
information on the strength of each band in relation to stem
density and basal area while the ANNs made use of these
relationships to predict basal area across the landscape with
reasonable accuracy. The spatial depiction of basal area
across the landscape displayed climatic impacts on basal
area as well as trends associated with distance from human
population centres and accessibility to forest fragments. The
findings in this study support observations from similar
studies and contribute to the growing body of knowledge on
the application of remote sensing for assessing tropical
forest condition.
4.1. Correlations of NDVI to stem density and basal area
There were inconsistent relationships between stem
density measures and NDVI. The stronger relationship
between the stem density measurements collected in 2000
and NDVI in comparison to the very weak relationship
between stem density measures collected in 2001 and
NDVI could be due to the careful pre-stratification of sites
within each forest fragment during the 2000 field survey.
During the 2000 field survey, each transect site was chosen
to represent the deterioration status of the forest fragment.
In contrast, during the 2001 survey, transect sites were
randomly selected within each fragment in order to assess
the range of internal fragment structural diversity. Because
of the stratification during the 2000 survey, more extreme
differences in stem density among fragments were captured
when compared to the 2001 data on stem density (as seen
in Fig. 2). This stratification of sites and fragments resulted
in an extreme separation between the high and low-tomoderate stem densities and, thus, NDVI values. NDVI
may be sensitive to detecting extremes in forest condition
(i.e., old growth forest versus highly degraded forest), but
is less able to predict structural values of forests
characterized by moderate condition. The negative relationship observed here is similar to the negative, but weak,
relationship observed by Foody and Curran (1994) using
Landsat TM derived NDVI to tree density in a West
African tropical forest.
There was no significant relationship between NDVI and
basal area using data from either of the two field campaigns.
Previous studies in tropical forests have also reported weak
and insignificant relationships between Landsat TM-derived
NDVI values and biomass (Foody et al., 2003). The use of
the NDVI is problematic for estimating structural features of
mixed, broad leaf tropical forests because it loses sensitivity
at high vegetation amounts (Foody et al., 1996; Sader,
1989). For this reason, one of the most valuable applications
of the NDVI for tropical forest assessments continues to be
for estimation of vegetation loss through clearance or
detecting extreme differences in forest condition rather than
estimating values of forest structural features or detecting
subtle landscape variations in these features.

4.2. Correlations of spectral response with stem density and
basal area
The lack of strong and significant relationships of
individual bands with stem density is similar to findings
in other studies, which have failed to identify a strong
relationship between stem density and spectral response
(e.g., Puhr & Donoghue, 2000). From these results, stem
density does not seem to be a structural feature that can be
accurately assessed using our methods.
All correlations of the spectral values in the individual
wavebands with basal area were negative. Negative
correlations of TM bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 with forest
structural parameters have also been observed in other
studies investigating canopy spectral reflectance (Jensen et
al., 1999; Steininger, 2000). The negative relationship of
basal area to NIR reflectance is unexpected since green
vegetation reflects strongly in the NIR, which means that
the relationship between NIR reflectance and increasing
LAI of vegetation should be positive. However, the effects
of increasing shadow of the canopy, which may accompany an increase in LAI, will counteract the expected
positive relationships of NIR with measured forest
structural attributes (Danson, 1995). Within the correlation
analyses using the 2001 ground data, reflectance values in
the MIR band 5 and MIR band 7 demonstrated the
strongest relationships with basal area and the weakest
correlations with the red band 3. These findings are
consistent with other studies, which have identified strong
relationships among the MIR region and forest structural
features (Foody et al., 2001; Horler & Ahern, 1986;
Steininger, 2000). Foody et al. (2001) found that the data
acquired in MIR band 5 was the most useful and red band
3 was the least useful for predicting biomass of tropical
rain forests in Borneo using ANNs. Similar to our results,
basal area of Bolivian tropical secondary forests has been
correlated with the following bands in decreasing order of
strength: MIR band 5, MIR band 7, NIR band 4 and red
band 3 (Steininger, 2000). Our study contributes to a
growing body of research that has demonstrated the
usefulness of these bands for discriminating structural
features such as basal area of tropical secondary forests.
The strength of the relationship between basal area
collected in 2000 and spectral response varied from the
correlations observed from the analysis of the 2001 ground
data. The decrease in the strength of the relationship
between basal area and spectral response in MIR band 5,
MIR band 7 and the red band 3 could be due to physical
alterations to the forest vegetation at sites surveyed in 2000
and the sensitivity of these bands to forest change. The MIR
band 5 has been shown to have high sensitivity to canopy
changes during tropical forest succession (Asner et al.,
2002; Steininger, 2000). MIR band 7 has also been strongly
correlated with vegetation condition, forest stand basal area
and height in previous studies in temperate regions (Ahern
et al., 1991; Jakubauskas, 1996; Puhr & Donoghue, 2000)

J.C. Ingram et al. / Remote Sensing of Environment 94 (2005) 491507

and should show a strong contrast between forest canopy
and gaps (Asner et al., 2002). The red band is highly
sensitive to variability across the forest canopy (Foody &
Curran, 1994) and to changes in forest cover associated with
selective logging and regrowth (Asner et al., 2002). Asner et
al. (2002) found that the relationships among Landsat
ETM+ bands 3 and 5 and canopy gap fraction of
Amazonian forests were significantly weakened after 1.5
years, similar to the time lag between the July 2000 ground
survey and the January 2002 satellite image in this study.
Thus, these bands would be expected to be sensitive to any
subtle ground-based changes. The high degree of human
activity in these forests means that it is very plausible that
physical changes to the forest canopy, basal area and/or
height due to the removal or regrowth of trees have occurred
since the ground data were collected in 2000. This would act
to weaken the relationship between ground measures of
basal area and spectral response within these bands.
The NIR band was the only band in which the relationship between spectral response and basal area did not
change significantly when using the ground data collected in
2000. A plot of the NIR values versus basal area measurements from the 2000 survey revealed a tight cluster of
relatively high NIR values at sites with low values of basal
area (Fig. 5). There was a wider variation and scatter among
the lower NIR values at sites where moderate to high basal
area was recorded in 2000. The strength of the relationship
between NIR and basal area measurements collected in the
year 2000 is most likely because NIR response increases in
open stands due to the high reflectance of understory
vegetation and other highly reflective backgrounds (Nemani
et al., 1993). Thus, if there had been growth or succession at
the sites recorded as having low basal area in the year 2000,
NIR reflectance would have increased at these locations due
to an increase in understory vegetation. Such a scenario is
likely since sites with very low basal area would not be
preferred for further cutting and, thus, temporarily, would be
abandoned and left to regenerate. The tight clustering of
these high values at sites with low basal area in comparison
to the scatter of the relatively lower NIR values contributes
to this observed, but unexpected, strong relationship.

4.3. Neural networks for predicting stem density and basal
area
Although the correlation analyses showed that the
correlations of the MIR bands 5 and 7 with basal area
were very strong and, thus, potentially useful individually
for predictive purposes, the ANN approach was robust
across the two data sets and allowed inclusion of multiple
wavebands also known to provide useful information on
forest structure and, thus, providing more predictive
power than one or two bands used alone. Using a neural
network, the radiance values within the four spectral
bands produced predictions of forest basal area, which
were strongly and significantly correlated with the actual
measures of basal area. The strong and significant
relationships between predicted and actual measures of
basal area using both the 2001/2000 ANN and 2001
Jackknife ANN support the utility of neural networks for
predicting patterns of basal area from the spectral bands
used in this study. However, the two networks did differ
in the prediction tendencies. The predictions of basal area
using the 2001 Jackknife ANN were fairly close to a 1:1
relationship and were consistent in variability with respect
to the field measurements. The 2001/2000 ANN produced
a strong and significant relationship between actual and
predicted measures of basal area but, in contrast to the
2001 Jackknife ANN, the relationship deviated substantially from the 1:1 line as indicated from the results of
the BlandAltman test. The model derived from the
2001/2000 ANN had a tendency to underpredict values
of basal area at sites with medium to high actual values
of basal area and to overpredict values of basal area at
sites with relatively low actual values of basal area. This
trend can be attributed to changes in basal area since the
data were recorded in July 2000, which would alter the
relationship between actual and predicted estimates of
basal area derived from the 2002 satellite image. The
nature of the models systematic error, due largely to
observed physical changes occurring in this forest,
supports the utility of the method. However, the results
from the two ANN models demonstrate the importance of
obtaining a satellite image as close as possible to the date
of the ground survey for more accurate estimations of
basal area.
Remote sensing alone may not be able to produce
exact values of basal area, but when used in combination with ground data, the bias and limits of agreement
can be calculated to give an indication of the deviation
from a 1:1 agreement and, thus, the error associated
with the predictions. The strong relationship between
actual and predicted values of basal area for both ANNs
demonstrate the usefulness of remote sensing for
assessing patterns in basal area across a landscape and
its potential as a tool for first-order assessments of
forest condition when ground survey data are not
available.

4.4. Contribution of textural information for predicting
basal area
Textural information appears to be insignificant in this
study since the relationships between predicted and actual
measures of basal area did not change significantly when
textural data were removed from the network. Textural
measures derived from the standard deviation of pixels
within a 33 window have been useful for discriminating
heterogeneity in vegetation structure using imagery of
higher spatial resolutions than Landsat TM or ETM+
images (Hudak & Wessman, 1998). The 30-m pixel size
of the Landsat ETM+ image may be too coarse for detecting
subtle differences in basal area or stem density across a
forest fragment. However, textural measures may be useful
at this spatial resolution for assessing more extreme differences in land cover types (such as forest versus non-forest)
or for assessment of structural differences across less
disturbed, old growth forests where canopy roughness is
at a maximum. The lower, more homogenous canopy of the
forests in these study sites, such as the Petriky forest, make
textural analyses less useful for discriminating variations in
basal area within these forest stands.
4.5. Predictive map of basal area
The map derived from the ANN predictions of basal area
displayed patterns of forest condition comparable to those
presented within the semi-quantitative map, captured intersite differences in basal area associated with environmental
variability and portrayed intra-site trends in basal area
associated with human impact. The ANN predictive map
provided finer spatial detail on the heterogeneity of basal
area within a forest fragment and displayed trends in basal
area that were lacking within the semi-quantitative preexistent map of forest condition (Fig. 1).
In the absence of humans, spatial patterns of forest basal
area will be determined by environmental variables (Salvador, 2000). The environmental factors that influence tropical
rain forest structure and biomass include soil type, soil
nutrients, climate, disturbance regime and topography (see
Clark & Clark, 2000, for a review). Soil nutrients and
climate are known to vary across the three study sites
(Lewis Environmental Consultants, 1992) and influence
forest basal area. Rainfall decreases progressively from
north to south, which has discernible impacts on Petriky, the
southernmost of the forest sites. Petriky is a drier, more
nutrient-poor zone, similar to a scrub woodland, and for this
reason has been classified as a distinct subtype from St.
Luce and Mandena (Dumetz, 1999). The ANN predictive
map captured these differences, most notably between the
extremes of St. Luce and Petriky, by predicting low basal
area values throughout Petriky and higher basal area values
throughout St. Luce. However, structural differences were
not as evident between Mandena and Petriky. Mandena
represents a transition area amid the two climatic extremes

and it has been extremely impacted by human pressure, such
as charcoal making (QMM, 2001). Thus, basal area and
forest structure at this site may have been shaped by both
anthropogenic factors and environmental factors such as
climate. Additionally, it should be noted that there are fewer
villages within the St. Luce region, which may also
contribute to the higher overall basal area predictions and
ground measurements, when compared to Mandena. The
qualitative classification of forest condition employed by
QMM (Fig. 1) suggests forest structure and condition at
these sites is primarily determined by human impact. In
contrast, the predictive map of basal area produced by the
ANN provides numerical values related to forest condition
and, thus, avoids the use of value laden categorisations (i.e.,
very good condition, good condition, moderate deterioration, high deterioration, extreme deterioration), which deemphasize the role of climate and other environmental
factors in shaping forest structure.
Within each of the three forest sites where environmental
variables are relatively constant, predicted patterns of basal
area appear to be associated with centres of human
population combined with ease of accessibility to the
forests. Changes in forest structure and decreases in basal
area have been observed with distance from human
settlements or roads and represent the impact of human
pressure on forests (Chittibabu & Parthasarathy, 2000;
Medley, 1993; Vermeulen, 1996). In this region, specifically, degree of stand isolation and human accessibility has
been shown to impact community composition and biodiversity of trees and shrubs (Cadotte et al., 2002). The
predictive map of basal area portrayed such trends by
displaying gradients of increasing basal area with increasing
distance away from forest edges, villages and roads. This
trend is especially noticeable in the forest of Petriky, where
the basal area is highest in the middle of the forest parcel, at
a maximal distance from the three villages, but, interestingly, proximate to the road, which bisects the forest parcel.
Deforestation along roads has been observed in other areas
both globally and in Madagascar due to increased ease of
access (Kistler & Spack, 2003), especially when using
mechanized transport for exporting trees from the forest.
However, at this site, all tree removal occurs by the manual
labour of local people, few of whom, if any, have access to
any form of ground transport other than walking. This limits
the distance people can travel while carrying heavy timber.
Additionally, the droadT is a very coarse grained sand path,
which makes walking long distances difficult, especially
during the heat of the day. Such findings underline the fact
that local context is crucial when considering trends in forest
cover and land use (Kull, 2000). The high basal area
predicted for the conservation zones in Mandena, M15 and
M16, are attributed to protection status of the fragments
since the stands were predicted to have the highest overall
basal area values for the site despite their very close
proximity to villages and roads. Within St. Luce and
Mandena, unprotected stands that were bisected by roads

J.C. Ingram et al. / Remote Sensing of Environment 94 (2005) 491507

and located close to villages were predicted by the model to
have lower basal area values when compared to fragments
that were slightly more removed from the road, villages and/
or protected by river or water boundaries. The ANN was
also able to capture edge effects by predicting low basal area
pixels along stand edges. This was especially evident for the
larger parcels comprising S8 in St. Luce. The ability of the
ANN to portray trends of basal area in relation to environmental and anthropogenic factors, known to influence forest
systems from other studies, demonstrates the utility of this
method for broad assessments of forest structural patterns at
a landscape level.
4.6. The application of this method for monitoring forest
condition
The relationship between spectral information and
ground-collected forest structural data can be combined
with other indicators of forest change detectable throughout
a time series of satellite images to monitor forest modification (Lambin, 1999). The results found in this study
provide a foundation and crucial first step for establishing
such a monitoring program of forest degradation in southeastern Madagascar. Such research could provide a useful
supplement to traditional ground-based forest inventories,
which can be expensive and time consuming (Hyyppa et al.,
2000) and are limited in spatial extent. The ability to derive
temporal and spatial generalizations of the relationships
among spectral data and forest structural features awaits
more research (Foody et al., 2003) and should be pursued to
produce a method useful for long-term monitoring.

5. Conclusion
This study has demonstrated the potential for using a
limited amount of ground-collected data and Landsat ETM+
spectral information from bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 for estimating
the basal area of tropical forests in southeastern Madagascar.
The strong and significant relationships between predicted
and actual measurements of basal area derived from ANNs
and the compatibility of the ANN-derived map of basal area
(Fig. 4) with a preexistent map of forest condition (Fig. 1)
support the use of the methods presented here for assessments of basal area across a forest landscape. Future
research should build upon these relationships and investigate how the predictive relationships between spectral
information and basal area observed here can be generalized
temporally and, thus, incorporated into long term monitoring of forest condition for the region.
