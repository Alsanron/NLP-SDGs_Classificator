Marxan is the most widely used conservation planning software in the world and is designed for solving
complex conservation planning problems in landscapes and seascapes. In this paper we describe
a substantial extension of Marxan called Marxan with Zones, a decision support tool that provides landuse zoning options in geographical regions for biodiversity conservation. We describe new functions
designed to enhance the original Marxan software and expand on its utility as a decision support tool.
The major new element in the decision problem is allowing any parcel of land or sea to be allocated to
a specic zone, not just reserved or unreserved. Each zone then has the option of its own actions,
objectives and constraints, with the exibility to dene the contribution of each zone to achieve targets
for pre-specied features (e.g. species or habitats). The objective is to minimize the total cost of
implementing the zoning plan while ensuring a variety of conservation and land-use objectives are
achieved. We outline the capabilities, limitations and additional data requirements of this new software
and perform a comparison with the original version of Marxan. We feature a number of case studies to
demonstrate the functionality of the software and highlight its exibility to address a range of complex
spatial planning problems. These studies demonstrate the design of multiple-use marine parks in both
Western Australia and California, and the zoning of forest use in East Kalimantan.

Systematic conservation planning involves nding cost-efcient
sets of areas to protect biodiversity. One goal of systematic
conservation planning is to meet quantitative conservation objectives, such as conserving 30% of the range of each species, as
cheaply as possible (Carwardine et al., 2009). This is referred to as
the minimum-set problem (Possingham et al., 2006). It can be
expressed as an integer linear programming problem if the cost and
constraints are linear functions of the number of sites in the system
(Cocks and Baird, 1989; Possingham et al., 1993; Underhill, 1994;
Willis et al., 1996; McDonnell et al., 2002).
Recent research efforts have focused on developing computer
software to solve the minimum-set problem (Sarkar, 2006).
Numerous algorithms can nd solutions to the minimum-set
problem (Margules et al., 1988; Rebelo and Sieged, 1992; Nicholls
and Margules, 1993; Csuti et al., 1997; Pressey et al., 1997). The large
number of feasible solutions to the minimum-set problem makes
some iterative and optimizing algorithms unsuitable for large

conservation planning problems. They often are slow to nd solutions, nd only inefcient solutions or nd only single solutions.
Marxan is the most widely used conservation planning software in
the world with over 2600 individuals and 1500 organisational users
in 110 countries. It uses a simulated annealing algorithm because of
its ability to nd many near-optimal solutions to large problems
fairly quickly (Ball and Possingham, 2000; Possingham et al., 2000).
A major limitation of the approach to spatial planning employed
in existing systematic conservation planning software such as
Zonation, ResNet, C-Plan and Marxan, is the inability to simultaneously consider different types of zones to reect the range of
management actions or conservation activities being considered as
part of a conservation plan (Moilanen et al., 2009). Indeed, in
terrestrial environments, conservation practitioners implement
a diversity of management actions, ranging from re management
and predator control, to restoration and reservation (Wilson et al.,
2007). Furthermore, conservation activities occur in a matrix of
alternative land and sea uses, many of which are contrary to
conservation objectives. While the outer boundaries of protected
areas are often identied using systematic conservation planning
software (e.g. Fernandes et al., 2005; Airame et al., 2003), the actual
process of zoning is often performed outside of a systematic
framework because of software limitations.
Zoning is a common management practice to spatially and
temporally designate areas for specic purposes (Anon, 1977;
Korhonen, 1996; Liffmann et al., 2000; Day et al., 2002; Russ and
Zeller, 2003; Airame, 2005; Foster et al., 2005). Zoning plans
provide an explicit approach to resolving conicts between activities and determining trade-offs when balancing these competing
interests (Halpern et al., 2008). Zoning is implemented around the
world as an approach to support the multiple objectives of marine
parks (notably in Australias Great Barrier Reef Marine Park,
Fernandes et al., 2005). The purpose of zoning in a conservation
context is typically to accommodate potentially conicting activities including conservation, non-consumptive recreation (e.g.
scuba), and consumptive uses (e.g. shing) within an integrated
system of management (Day, 2002).
The original Marxan software could only include or exclude
a planning unit from being reserved, implicitly assuming two
zones: reserved or not reserved. Furthermore all conservation
features (such as vegetation types or species) are assumed to be
fully protected in a reserve and all conservation features outside
a reserve are lost  an assumption which does not match reality.
Multiple zoning could be achieved by iterative application of the
software (Loos, 2006), but that is clumsy and sub-optimal. Forest
managers have used simulated annealing algorithms to harmonize
site suitability for forestry regimes (Bos, 1993), and planners have
internally zoned protected areas based upon spatial attributes such
as compatibility and connectivity (Sabatini et al., 2007). Our zoning
approach differs by explicitly targeting representation, complementarity and constraints of conicting objectives in the problem
denition (Lourival, 2008).
In this paper we introduce Marxan with Zones, an analytic tool
that expands on the basic reserve design problem to allow for zones.
This enables users to move from the binary decision framework of
conservation planning to multi-use landscape and seascape planning by allowing for the efcient allocation of planning units (i.e. the
units of land or sea available for selection) to a range of different
management actions that may offer different levels of protection.
We present Marxan with Zones as a tool for systematic zoning; not
only to improve planning for reserve systems but also with application to a wider range of natural resource management and spatial
planning problems. Two particular limitations of Marxan are overcome in Marxan with Zones: 1) the ability to spatially separate
multiple and potentially conicting activities (e.g. shing and non-

consumptive recreational activities) and 2) the ability to explicitly
address multiple objectives (e.g. conservation and socioeconomic)
in a systematic way. This is the rst land-use zoning software with
a particular focus on conservation.
First, we describe the mathematical formulation of the problem
for which Marxan nds good and feasible solutions as well as the
new decision problem addressed by Marxan with Zones. Next, we
discuss additional data requirements and example applications
that illustrate the new functions of the software. We conclude by
discussing some challenges and potential applications of Marxan
with Zones in conservation planning. The software should be of
interest to systematic conservation planning practitioners, policy
makers and natural resource managers.
2. Mathematical formulation of Marxan
The original Marxan software aims to minimize the sum of the
site-specic costs and connectivity costs of the selected planning
units, subject to the conservation features reaching predetermined
targets in the reserve system. The Marxan minimum representation
problem is:

(1)

i1  1 i2  1

aij xi  tj cj:

(2)

i1

where there are m planning units under consideration. The rst
term of equation (1) is the sum of the selected planning unit costs,
where the control variable xi  1 if planning unit i is selected and
0 if planning unit i is not selected. The planning unit dependent
parameter, ci, is the cost of selecting planning unit i. The second
term of equation (1) is the weighted connectivity cost of the reserve
system conguration, where b is the connectivity weighting factor
that controls the relative importance of connectivity in relation to
the cost and target objectives and cvi1,i2 is the connectivity cost
associated with having planning unit i1 selected and planning unit
i2 not selected. In other words, the connectivity cost describes the
connections between planning units and a cost is paid if only one of
the pair is selected, but not if both or neither is selected. This can be
the monetary, distance or other value associated with a connection
or adjacent boundary between a planning unit within the conguration and one without, and can also be applied to more general
ideas of connectivity (Klein et al., 2008b). The parameter b is
referred to as the boundary length modier: it can be varied for
more or less connected reserve systems. In equation (2), aij is the
amount of each feature j held in each planning unit i, and tj is the
amount of each feature j that must be reserved.
We use a representation shortfall penalty equation to implement the target constraint in the Marxan objective function:
n

where there are n features under consideration. This penalty is zero
if every feature j has met its representation target in the selected
reserve system. It is greater than zero if the targets are not met, and
gets larger as the gap between the target and the conserved amount
increases. The terms FPFj and FRj are the feature penalty factor and
feature representation respectively, which are the scaling factors
used when a feature has not met its representation targets. FPFj is
a scaling factor which determines the relative importance of
meeting the representation target for feature j. FRj is computed as

the representation cost of meeting the representation target of
feature j. A zone conguration that satises the target for feature j
only is computed, and then FRj for feature j is set as the cost of this
zone conguration. This representation cost is given in terms of the
conguration cost plus the connectivity cost, and is computed for
each feature by using that features representative zone conguration as the control variable x in equation (1). The shortfall s is the
amount of the representation target not met and is given by
P
s  tj  m
i  1 aij xi . The Heaviside function, H(s), is a step function
which takes a value of zero when s  0 and 1 otherwise. The feature
specic parameter tj is the target representation for feature j. The
expression s=tj  is the measure of the shortfall in representation for
feature j. It is reported as a proportion and equals 1 when feature j is
not represented within the conguration and approaches 0 as the
level of representation approaches the target amounts. The Heaviside function ensures the whole equation becomes zero when the
representation is greater than the target amount. We use the
shortfall as a weighting factor of the total cost to meet the target,
which assumes the cost associated with the shortfall is a linear
proportion of the total cost to meet the target. This is a simplication
as the total cost may vary non-linearly as the shortfall changes. We
use the simplication because the actual cost of meeting the target
for each iteration of Marxan is computationally expensive to nd
and provides little improvement in the nal answer.
We combine equations (1) and (3) to get the overall Marxan
objective function, which gives a value to any reserve system,
a conguration of selected planning units. Hence, the value of the
reserve system is:

Marxan uses the simulated annealing algorithm (Kirkpatrick
et al., 1983) to minimize the objective function score (equation (4))
by varying the control variables, xi, which tell us which planning
unit is in, or out, of the reserve system.
Marxan with Zones generalizes this approach by increasing the
number of states or zones to which a planning unit can be assigned.
Each term of the objective function is increased in complexity.
Furthermore, two types of representation targets are allowed and
consequently the representation shortfall penalty reects two
types of shortfall.

The aim of the Marxan with Zones software is to minimize the
sum of costs and connectivity costs of the zone conguration of
planning units, subject to meeting the representation targets and
zone targets. A zone conguration is a solution and it fully species
the type of zone in which each planning unit is placed. This is the
Marxan with Zones minimum representation problem, formally
dened as:

In this case there are m planning units and p zones. The rst
term of equation (5) represents the sum of the costs for a conguration of planning units where each planning unit is allocated to
a particular zone, and is composed of a control variable and cost
matrix. The control variable xik f0; 1g records which of the k zones
each planning unit i is allocated to; its value is 1 if the planning unit
i is allocated to zone k, and 0 if the planning unit i is not allocated to
zone k. Each planning unit must only be in a single zone, so
Pp
x  1 ci. We dene a cost matrix cik , which is the cost of
k  1 ik
placing each planning unit i in zone k. The second term of equation
(5) represents the connectivity cost of a conguration of planning
units assigned to particular zones, and is composed of a connectivity matrix recording the cost of the connections between planning units i1 and i2 if and only if i1 is in zone k1, and i2 is in zone k2.
In equation (6), aij is a feature matrix that records the amount of
each feature j in each planning unit i, the parameter t1j is a representation target objective for each feature, j, that records the
amount of each feature required to be protected in the zone
conguration, and cajk is a contribution matrix that records the
level of protection offered to each feature j by each zone k. Typically
this contribution will be 1 for zones in which the feature achieves
full representation, 0 for zones which do not protect the feature and
an intermediate value for a zone that offers partial protection for
a feature. For example, a conservation feature might enjoy full
representation in a conservation zone, no representation in zones
where natural resources (e.g. timber, sh etc) are extracted and
partial protection where ecologically sensitive natural resource
extraction is allowed.
In equation (7), t2jk is a zone target objective matrix that records
the amount of each feature j required to be captured in a particular
zone k. For example the user may specify that a particular species
has at least half of its feature target conserved in full no-take
reserves. If both targets t1 and t2 are used, the software attempts to
satisfy their requirements simultaneously. Users should take care to
enter targets that can be simultaneously achievable to avoid situations where the algorithm cannot nd an answer.

4. Additional information requirements
for Marxan with Zones
Marxan with Zones has a number of information requirements
beyond those used in Marxan. Individual planning problems will
determine the amount of additional information required. At
a minimum, the number of zones and the costs of assigning each
planning unit to each zone must be dened. In this section, we
describe the additional information requirements and introduce
three case studies. The case studies demonstrate how the new
capabilities of Marxan with Zones can be applied to a variety of
multi-zone problems. A detailed description of how to use Marxan
with Zones, and the interaction between its many input parameter
les, is provided in the on-line manual (Watts et al., 2008a).
4.1. Multiple zones
A list of all possible zones must be dened. These can range from
high quality conservation zones (e.g. well managed national park)
to extractive use zones (e.g. intensive agriculture, forestry, or
shing). The user can specify zone-specic targets to prescribe how
feature targets are achieved. For example, given an overall target of
20% for each habitat type, which could be met across three different
conservation zones, the user may require at least 10% of the overall
target to be met in the zone offering the highest level of protection.
Not specifying a zone-specic target means that the overall target
for a feature can be achieved across all zones (see Case Study 1).
Furthermore, Marxan with Zones allows the user to prescribe
preferred spatial relationships between zones using a zone
boundary cost (Lourival, 2008). Parameters for spatial compactness
and buffering of zones can be can be derived through a process of
calibration, the procedure for which is described in a Marxan with
Zones user guide (Watts et al., 2008b) which includes a worked
example. This is useful if the user prefers two zones to be adjacent
or spatially separated. For example the user may prefer national
parks to be buffered by sustainable low intensity logging rather
than intensive agriculture. The spatial compactness capability also
exists in Marxan but the new software allows for buffering of zones.

Case Study 1. Zoning multiple-use marine parks: achieving
multiple objectives and minimising conflict of use (Stewart
et al., 2008)
We applied the use of Marxan with Zones to the zoning of
a multiple-use marine park in Rottnest Island, Western
Australia. Biodiversity and human usage data compiled for
the case study was originally developed by the Department
of Environment and Conservation for the Rottnest Island
Authority to assist in the development of the Rottnest Island
Marine Management Strategy. Coastal and marine biodiversity data included information on 28 biodiversity
features, including benthic habitats, coastal landforms and
marine species (such as invertebrates). We categorized
human usage data as either non-extractive recreational
activities (surfing, SCUBA diving, recreational boat moorings and shipwrecks), or recreational fishing activities (trolling, game fishing, and shore based fishing). The primary
goal was to conserve biodiversity whilst providing for
fishing and non-extractive recreational activities to the
extent that they did not conflict with conservation objectives.

Several potential conflicting uses within the marine park
were identified:
1) Conservation and fishing (e.g. protection vs. extraction
of benthic habitat)
2) Conservation and non-extractive recreational activities
(e.g. coral reefs vs. SCUBA activities  Harriott et al., 1997)
3) Non-extractive recreational activities and recreational
fishing (e.g. SCUBA activities vs. recreational fishing 
Lynch et al., 2004).
These interactions informed the definition of a zoning
framework with the flexibility to deliver across competing
objectives. The three zones defined for this case study are
presented in Table 1.
Marxan with Zones provides a systematic approach to the
problem of managing multiple uses by allowing spatial
separation of activities into zones. This reduces the potential
conflict between the different uses. An additional function
within Marxan with Zones is the zone boundary cost. This
serves to prescribe the spatial relationship between zones
and is useful to encourage further separation of conflicting
uses (by setting a high zone boundary cost) or to cluster
zones which share compatible management objectives (a
low zone boundary cost). We set this feature so that the high
protection zone is preferably buffered by partial protection
zone to further reduce the potential conflict between
conservation objectives and fishing activities.
To successfully manage the multiple activities within the
marine park, explicit objectives must be defined that identify
the target level of reservation for each activity (Table 2).
These objectives can be defined broadly at the park level, or
they may be more prescriptive in quantifying how much of
each activity must be retained in a particular zone (or
combination of zones). In this case study, we did not apply
prescriptive zone targets.
Each zone makes a different contribution towards these
objectives, according to whether activities are included or
excluded. Table 3 defines the zones in terms of their contributions (between 0 and 100%) towards the feature targets.
Marxan with Zones generated many efficient solutions to
this problem, each of which meet all of the objectives. An
example map illustrating the spatial configuration of one of
the solutions is shown in Fig. 1. In the example shown,
Marxan with Zones retained 90% of the fishing activity, 81%
of the recreational activity, and included an average of 34%
of each conservation feature (with a minimum of 30%).
Marxan with Zones outperforms standard Marxan for this
particular problem by delivering a zonation scheme which
supports multiple objectives within an individual reserve,
and configuring the zones to accommodate a range of uses
that can be spatially separated. In this example these functions serve to minimize conflict of use between resource
protection and resource extraction. Standard Marxan would
have been limited to meeting one of the objectives (traditionally the conservation objective) and could only spatially
separate two activities. Using Marxan with Zones, marine
park managers can systematically approach the zoning of
multiple-use marine parks, separate potentially conflicting
activities, and achieve multiple objectives.

4.2. Costs
The cost of allocating each planning unit to each zone must be
dened. Marxan with Zones can accommodate multiple costs for
individual planning units (see Case Study 2), with the total cost of

assigning a planning unit to a particular zone measured as the sum
of the individual costs. Costs can also be zone-specic. For example,
there may be purchasing, opportunity, and management costs
associated with designating a planning unit as a national park
(Naidoo et al., 2006). A weighting factor for each cost in each zone
may also be applied. All costs in a given zone will be weighted by
the zone-specic multiplier, and then summed to give zonespecic costs for every planning unit.

4.3. Features
Features may be dened as elements that the user would like to
occur in particular zones (Stewart et al., 2008). For example, these
spatially specic elements may include, for example: habitat types,
elevation gradients, soil types, and species distributions. The
current use of each planning unit (e.g. protection, agriculture,
recreation) may also be described as a feature and used to constrain
the allocation of planning units to particular zones. For example,
the user may wish to ensure that at least 20% of a landscape is

Case Study 2. Spatial marine zoning for fisheries and
conservation: a case study from California (Klein et al., in
review)
We applied Marxan with Zones to design a network of marine
protected areas (MPAs) in Central California (Fig. 2), using
the objectives and zones defined by Californias Marine Life
Protection Act Initiative. Our aim was to determine what
socioeconomic advantages, if any, can be delivered by a tool
that allows for multiple zones, Marxan with Zones, vs. a tool
that can only identify one type of MPA, Marxan.
We planned for five zones, each restricted to different fisheries: 1) No-take marine reserve (all fisheries restricted); 2)
Conservation area, high (7 fisheries restricted); 3) Conservation area, high/medium (4 fisheries restricted); 4)
Conservation area, medium (3 fisheries restricted); 5)
Commercial fishing zone (no fishing restrictions).
We used the same spatial data representing habitats, depth
zones, and commercial fishing value used in the Initiative.
Habitats included coastal marshes, eelgrass, estuaries, hard
bottom, kelp forests, soft bottom, surfgrass, and tidal flats.
We subdivided these features into three biogeographic
regions (North, South, and the Farallon Islands) and three
depth zones (intertidal, intertidal30 m, 30100 m). In all, 32
separate biodiversity features which were targeted for the
inclusion in a MPA.
Spatial fishing data were derived from 174 interviews with
fishermen in 2007 (Scholz et al., 2008). The surveys aimed to
capture information from at least 50% of the landings and/or
ex-vessel revenue from 2000 to 2006 and at least five fishermen per fishery. These data include the value in 2006 US
dollars of a given planning unit to individual fishermen
across eight commercial fisheries: Dungeness crab, California halibut, Chinook salmon, coastal pelagic finfish, deep
nearshore rockfish, market squid, nearshore rockfish, and
sea urchin.
We implemented Marxan with Zones for two different
scenarios, each with different zone-specific targets. In
scenario 1, represented 10% of the distribution of each
biodiversity feature in a no-take reserve (zone 1) and an
additional 20% in any of the four protected area zones (zone
14). We evaluated the results of scenario 1 to determine the
proportion of lost value overall and for each of the fisheries.
With the aim of more equitably affecting the fisheries, in
scenario 2 we also targeted a percentage of each fisheries
total value, where the fishing targets could only be achieved
in zones where the given fishery was not restricted. We
targeted the same proportion for each fishery and incrementally increased the target by 1% until 100% of the fishing
grounds were placed in a zone without spatial fishing
regulations. In addition we compare the results of our
scenarios to those produced using Marxan (without zoning),
where we minimized lost fishing value subject to the
constraint that 30% of each biodiversity feature is protected
in a no-take reserve. Given that Marxan can only select areas
important for one type of protected area, we assume that
selected areas are a cost to all fisheries.
We found that Marxan with Zones outperforms Marxan in
two ways. First, the overall impact on the fishing industry is
reduced. Second, there is a more equitable impact on
different fishing sectors (Fig. 3).
Results from this application of Marxan with Zones will
inform Californias Marine Life Protection Act Initiatives
stakeholders, staff, and scientific advisors in designing
marine protected areas that efficiently achieve the biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic objectives.

allocated to forestry, or the expected total timber production is
above a certain level.
4.4. Relationship between zones and features
In some cases, it may be useful to dene the relationship
between each zone and feature. The contribution of a zone towards
achieving feature targets can be indicated by the user (see Case
Studies 1 and 3). Feature targets can be achieved across a combination of zones, with the potential for some zones to contribute
more than others to feature targets than others. For example, in
Case Study 1, the shing and recreational zones represent

5. Software evaluation
System testing of Marxan with Zones used a staged approach.
Multiple scenarios were constructed, starting with the standard
Marxan dataset, and then incrementally adding new zoning and
cost data structures. Using this method, we determined the inuence of each new data structure on the resulting spatial congurations and summary outputs. This simplied the sensitivity
analysis and identication of the cause for observed software bugs
and discrepancies. The software was tested on a range of problems
relating to biosphere reserves (Lourival, 2008), marine planning
(see Case Studies 1 and 2), integrated natural resource management
(Stewart et al., 2008), and multiple-use forestry planning (see Case
Study 3). The operation of Marxan with Zones in solving realistic
problems in spatial planning was veried to be mathematically
correct. A user guide providing detailed examples of software
validation, scenario construction and calibration is available on the
Marxan website for case study 2 (Watts et al., 2008b). It includes
graphs and gures that quantify the behaviour of Marxan with
Zones.
The number of zones, planning units, features, and costs that can
be input into Marxan with Zones is limited by the applications
memory address space, which is currently 2 GB due to our use of
a 32 bit computer operating system and 32 bit C compiler. A relatively simple conversion of the C code to available 64 bit operating
systems and 64 bit C compilers would result in an increase of the
potential memory address space to around 512 GB. A dataset with
80,000 planning units and 6000 features uses only 20% of the 32 bit
application address space, and the amount of memory used scales
approximately linearly with changes in the number of planning
units and features. The number of zones and costs has little impact
on the amount of memory used.
We developed a systematic validation software system for
Marxan with Zones that reproduced every computation at each
step of the algorithm in an alternative software system (Zonae
Cogito). This involved implemented reporting functionality in the

Case Study 3. A zoning configuration of multiple conservation strategies in East Kalimantan (Wilson et al., in review)
Tropical rainforest habitat is used for a diversity of land uses
ranging from protected areas to production forests. Each
alternative land use makes a different contribution to the
conservation of biodiversity (Meijaard and Sheil, 2008). The
degree of protection offered by different land uses varies,
and a high protection status may not be necessarily synonymous with a large contribution to biodiversity conservation
(Curran et al., 2004; DeFries et al., 2005). The contribution of
different land uses to the conservation of species varies
depending on the relative sensitivity of species to habitat
modification and degradation (Nakagawa et al., 2006).
We applied Marxan with Zones to prioritize conservation
investments in East Kalimantan by accounting for the relative costs and benefits of three conservation strategies
across four primary land uses (Fig. 4). We obtained data on
the distribution of 170 mammal species that occur in the
study region and evaluated their relative sensitivity to forest
conversion and degradation (Catullo et al., 2008). We
assigned species-specific conservation targets and determined through expert evaluation the contribution of each
land-use zone to achieving targets for each species
depending on their sensitivity to forest loss and degradation.
While some land uses contribute to the representation
targets for all species, some land uses make no contribution
to the target achievement of some species. This variable
contribution was specified in the problem formulation.
We prioritized investments in each alternative strategy in
a spatially explicit manner, in order to achieve the conservation targets cost-effectively. Our results revealed the
potential for the costs of conservation to be grossly overestimated if we assume that conservation goals can only be
met through establishing new protected areas and if we
assume that the unprotected matrix makes no contribution to
conserving biodiversity. If we would have accounted only for
the contribution of protected areas to our conservation goals
we would have overestimated the required expenditure by
an order of magnitude, and the area requiring protection
would have been overestimated by almost five orders of
magnitude. The effective and sustainable management of
the unprotected matrix is revealed to be essential in East
Kalimantan in order to achieve our conservation goals.
This case study illustrates the economic and ecological
imperative of considering the contribution of the unprotected matrix in planning analyses and the full suite of
conservation strategies available for implementation. We
found that traditional approaches deliver pessimistic estimates of the costs of achieving conservation goals, and
similarly a conservative estimate of our conservation progress. By applying Marxan with Zones and making use of the
expanded land-use planning functionality we have been
able to evaluate not only where to act, but how to act in order
to effectively and efficiently conserve biodiversity in East
Kalimantan. This research provides an important step
towards the development of an integrated conservation plan
in East Kalimantan, and highlights the value of enhanced
political and industry support for sustainable forest
management, along with the need for an improved understanding of the contribution of sustainably managed forest
to biodiversity conservation goals.

validation purposes. This extremely robust validation technique
gave us condence in the reliability of Marxan with Zones.
Marxan with Zones is signicantly more complicated than the
original Marxan software. The software was implemented very
carefully to efciently use computing resources. As a result, the
performance of Marxan with Zones at runtime is approximately
equivalent to the performance of an equivalent dataset running in
the original Marxan. We have found that the number of iterations
used needs to be scaled according to the number of zones used for
efcient operation of Marxan with Zones. For example, the original
Marxan software has two zones, so if we are using six zones for
a Marxan with Zones problem, we need to use three times as many
iterations for equivalent efciency, resulting in the software taking
three times longer to run.
6. Discussion
Marxan with Zones offers key improvements to the Marxan
software by extending the range of problems to which the software
can be applied. The in-built exibility for users to dene multiple
objectives, multiple zones and accept multiple costs makes the
software versatile and suitable for a wide range of resource
management problems. Effective conservation zoning plans must
often integrate the management of multiple uses and account for
the different types of interactions between and among activities.
They must not only separate conicting activities but explicitly
balance competing interests in a way that delivers acceptable
trade-offs. Brokering trade-offs is a challenging task and will most
likely be guided by government policy. Marxan with Zones provides
a systematic planning framework to evaluate the consequences and
trade-offs of alternative zoning congurations, which is critical for
informed decision making.
The ability to specify zone-specic planning unit costs presents
a number of potential uses. It could support the design of conservation landscapes and seascapes that include both communally and
privately managed areas, where the costs of conservation actions

differ, but the conservation outcomes are equivalent. It also allows
for complex natural resource management situations where costs
and biodiversity benets vary depending on the land and sea use or
management action. For example, conservation actions such as
weed control, protected area establishment, and the creation of
conservation easements could be spatially assigned in a zoning
conguration. Moreover, this approach could prioritize actions
based on ecosystem services, where biodiversity benets and
management costs of the delivery of one ecosystem service such as
carbon sequestration could differ from others such as pollination or
water ltration services (Chan et al., 2006). Marxan with Zones
could help identify which parts of the planning region are most
suitable for providing each ecosystem service.
Marxan with Zones can support many types of conservation
focused decision making including; land-use planning, marine
planning, urban and regional planning, and support for group
decision making in a multi-stakeholder context. More generally,
the software can solve spatial resource allocation problems
involving multiple actions, objectives and constraints (Wilson et al.,
2009). The objectives and constraints can be based on economic,
social, cultural or biological spatial features. The software is
a decision support tool and is meant to support rather than replace
decision making processes. The outputs can be useful in a decision
making process through identication of priority areas that must
be allocated to a particular zone (Klein et al., 2008a), and through
the generation of alternative options for use in a negotiation setting
(Airame, 2005). We hope the novel functionality of Marxan with
Zones will attract wide use in a range of conservation planning
problems beyond those solvable by Marxan.
