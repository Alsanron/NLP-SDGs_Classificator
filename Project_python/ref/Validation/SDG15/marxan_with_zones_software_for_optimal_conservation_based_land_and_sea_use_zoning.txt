Marxan is the most widely used conservation planning software in the world and is designed for solving
complex conservation planning problems in landscapes and seascapes. In this paper we describe
a substantial extension of Marxan called Marxan with Zones, a decision support tool that provides landuse zoning options in geographical regions for biodiversity conservation. We describe new functions
designed to enhance the original Marxan software and expand on its utility as a decision support tool.
The major new element in the decision problem is allowing any parcel of land or sea to be allocated to
a speciﬁc zone, not just reserved or unreserved. Each zone then has the option of its own actions,
objectives and constraints, with the ﬂexibility to deﬁne the contribution of each zone to achieve targets
for pre-speciﬁed features (e.g. species or habitats). The objective is to minimize the total cost of
implementing the zoning plan while ensuring a variety of conservation and land-use objectives are
achieved. We outline the capabilities, limitations and additional data requirements of this new software
and perform a comparison with the original version of Marxan. We feature a number of case studies to
demonstrate the functionality of the software and highlight its ﬂexibility to address a range of complex
spatial planning problems. These studies demonstrate the design of multiple-use marine parks in both
Western Australia and California, and the zoning of forest use in East Kalimantan.

Systematic conservation planning involves ﬁnding cost-efﬁcient
sets of areas to protect biodiversity. One goal of systematic
conservation planning is to meet quantitative conservation objectives, such as conserving 30% of the range of each species, as
cheaply as possible (Carwardine et al., 2009). This is referred to as
the minimum-set problem (Possingham et al., 2006). It can be
expressed as an integer linear programming problem if the cost and
constraints are linear functions of the number of sites in the system
(Cocks and Baird, 1989; Possingham et al., 1993; Underhill, 1994;
Willis et al., 1996; McDonnell et al., 2002).
Recent research efforts have focused on developing computer
software to solve the minimum-set problem (Sarkar, 2006).
Numerous algorithms can ﬁnd solutions to the minimum-set
problem (Margules et al., 1988; Rebelo and Siegﬁed, 1992; Nicholls
and Margules, 1993; Csuti et al., 1997; Pressey et al., 1997). The large
number of feasible solutions to the minimum-set problem makes
some iterative and optimizing algorithms unsuitable for large

conservation planning problems. They often are slow to ﬁnd solutions, ﬁnd only inefﬁcient solutions or ﬁnd only single solutions.
Marxan is the most widely used conservation planning software in
the world with over 2600 individuals and 1500 organisational users
in 110 countries. It uses a simulated annealing algorithm because of
its ability to ﬁnd many near-optimal solutions to large problems
fairly quickly (Ball and Possingham, 2000; Possingham et al., 2000).
A major limitation of the approach to spatial planning employed
in existing systematic conservation planning software such as
Zonation, ResNet, C-Plan and Marxan, is the inability to simultaneously consider different types of zones to reﬂect the range of
management actions or conservation activities being considered as
part of a conservation plan (Moilanen et al., 2009). Indeed, in
terrestrial environments, conservation practitioners implement
a diversity of management actions, ranging from ﬁre management
and predator control, to restoration and reservation (Wilson et al.,
2007). Furthermore, conservation activities occur in a matrix of
alternative land and sea uses, many of which are contrary to
conservation objectives. While the outer boundaries of protected
areas are often identiﬁed using systematic conservation planning
software (e.g. Fernandes et al., 2005; Airame et al., 2003), the actual
process of zoning is often performed outside of a systematic
framework because of software limitations.
Zoning is a common management practice to spatially and
temporally designate areas for speciﬁc purposes (Anon, 1977;
Korhonen, 1996; Liffmann et al., 2000; Day et al., 2002; Russ and
Zeller, 2003; Airame, 2005; Foster et al., 2005). Zoning plans
provide an explicit approach to resolving conﬂicts between activities and determining trade-offs when balancing these competing
interests (Halpern et al., 2008). Zoning is implemented around the
world as an approach to support the multiple objectives of marine
parks (notably in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef Marine Park,
Fernandes et al., 2005). The purpose of zoning in a conservation
context is typically to accommodate potentially conﬂicting activities including conservation, non-consumptive recreation (e.g.
scuba), and consumptive uses (e.g. ﬁshing) within an integrated
system of management (Day, 2002).
The original Marxan software could only include or exclude
a planning unit from being reserved, implicitly assuming two
zones: reserved or not reserved. Furthermore all conservation
features (such as vegetation types or species) are assumed to be
fully protected in a reserve and all conservation features outside
a reserve are lost – an assumption which does not match reality.
Multiple zoning could be achieved by iterative application of the
software (Loos, 2006), but that is clumsy and sub-optimal. Forest
managers have used simulated annealing algorithms to harmonize
site suitability for forestry regimes (Bos, 1993), and planners have
internally zoned protected areas based upon spatial attributes such
as compatibility and connectivity (Sabatini et al., 2007). Our zoning
approach differs by explicitly targeting representation, complementarity and constraints of conﬂicting objectives in the problem
deﬁnition (Lourival, 2008).
In this paper we introduce Marxan with Zones, an analytic tool
that expands on the basic reserve design problem to allow for zones.
This enables users to move from the binary decision framework of
conservation planning to multi-use landscape and seascape planning by allowing for the efﬁcient allocation of planning units (i.e. the
units of land or sea available for selection) to a range of different
management actions that may offer different levels of protection.
We present Marxan with Zones as a tool for systematic zoning; not
only to improve planning for reserve systems but also with application to a wider range of natural resource management and spatial
planning problems. Two particular limitations of Marxan are overcome in Marxan with Zones: 1) the ability to spatially separate
multiple and potentially conﬂicting activities (e.g. ﬁshing and non-

consumptive recreational activities) and 2) the ability to explicitly
address multiple objectives (e.g. conservation and socioeconomic)
in a systematic way. This is the ﬁrst land-use zoning software with
a particular focus on conservation.
First, we describe the mathematical formulation of the problem
for which Marxan ﬁnds good and feasible solutions as well as the
new decision problem addressed by Marxan with Zones. Next, we
discuss additional data requirements and example applications
that illustrate the new functions of the software. We conclude by
discussing some challenges and potential applications of Marxan
with Zones in conservation planning. The software should be of
interest to systematic conservation planning practitioners, policy
makers and natural resource managers.
2. Mathematical formulation of Marxan
The original Marxan software aims to minimize the sum of the
site-speciﬁc costs and connectivity costs of the selected planning
units, subject to the conservation features reaching predetermined
targets in the reserve system. The Marxan minimum representation
problem is:

minimize

m

ci xi þ b

xi1 ð1  xi2 Þcvi1;i2

(1)

i1 ¼ 1 i2 ¼ 1

aij xi  tj cj:

(2)

i¼1

where there are m planning units under consideration. The ﬁrst
term of equation (1) is the sum of the selected planning unit costs,
where the control variable xi ¼ 1 if planning unit i is selected and
0 if planning unit i is not selected. The planning unit dependent
parameter, ci, is the cost of selecting planning unit i. The second
term of equation (1) is the weighted connectivity cost of the reserve
system conﬁguration, where b is the connectivity weighting factor
that controls the relative importance of connectivity in relation to
the cost and target objectives and cvi1,i2 is the connectivity cost
associated with having planning unit i1 selected and planning unit
i2 not selected. In other words, the connectivity cost describes the
connections between planning units and a cost is paid if only one of
the pair is selected, but not if both or neither is selected. This can be
the monetary, distance or other value associated with a connection
or adjacent boundary between a planning unit within the conﬁguration and one without, and can also be applied to more general
ideas of connectivity (Klein et al., 2008b). The parameter b is
referred to as the boundary length modiﬁer: it can be varied for
more or less connected reserve systems. In equation (2), aij is the
amount of each feature j held in each planning unit i, and tj is the
amount of each feature j that must be reserved.
We use a representation shortfall penalty equation to implement the target constraint in the Marxan objective function:
n

where there are n features under consideration. This penalty is zero
if every feature j has met its representation target in the selected
reserve system. It is greater than zero if the targets are not met, and
gets larger as the gap between the target and the conserved amount
increases. The terms FPFj and FRj are the feature penalty factor and
feature representation respectively, which are the scaling factors
used when a featu
