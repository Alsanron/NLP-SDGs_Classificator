Electricity is an important asset that inuences not only the economy, but political or social security of
a country. Reliable and accurate planning and prediction of electricity demand for a country are therefore
vital. In this paper, electricity demand in Ontario province of Canada from the year 1976e2005 is
modeled by using an (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) ANFIS. A neuro fuzzy structure can be
dened as an ANN (articial neural network) which is trained by experimental data to nd the
parameters of (fuzzy inference system) FIS. Inputs for the model include number of employment, (gross
domestic product) GDP, population, dwelling count and two meteorological parameters related to annual
weather temperature. The data were collected and screened using statistical methods. Then, based on the
data, a neuro-fuzzy model for the electricity demand is built. It was found that electricity demand is most
sensitive to employment.

1. Introduction
Several investigations have been carried out to nd important
parameters affecting electricity demand and also the interaction
between these parameters. Designed and calculated model will
help us to manage energy consumption and distribution efciently.
Most studies have focused on the relationship between electricity
demand and economical parameters such as (gross domestic
product) GDP, (gross national product) GNP, national income, and
the rate of employment as well as unemployment. Sari and Soytas
[1] studied the relationship between different sources of electricity
consumption, employment and national income growth in Turkey.
Narayan and Smyth [2] carried out the same study in Australia.
They evaluated both long and short term relationship between
electricity consumption, employment and real income. Relationships between GDP and electricity consumption in ten newly
industrialized Asian countries were estimated by Chen et al. [3].
They studied long run relationship in China, Hong Kong, India,
Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and
Thailand. In another attempt, German Institute for Economic

Research (DIW) was commissioned by German Advisory Group on
Economic Reform in Ukraine in 1998 to predict electricity demand
in Ukraine until the year 2010. A comparison of the relationship
between renewable and non-renewable electricity consumption
and real GDP in the US using annual data from 1949 to 2006 was
done by Payne [4]. Bowden and Payne [5] used these data in 2008
to check the causal relationship between electricity consumption
and real GDP. Studying the time series properties of electricity
consumption of G-7 countries was the subject of Soytas and Sari [6].
In Pakistan, Aqeel and Butt [7] found out that economic
growth affects the total electricity consumption. They also discovered that economic growth leads to growth in petroleum
consumption but however electricity consumption leads to
economic growth without feedback. De Vita et al. [8] found the
same results for Namibia. Their research for the period between the
year 1980e2002 showed that electricity consumption respond
positively to changes in GDP and negatively to changes in electricity
price and air temperature. Hainoun et al. [9] found that both
electricity and electricity demand growth rates are lower than the
corresponding GDP growth rates in Syria. In some literature, other
parameters which are not economical are also selected. For
example Valor et al. [10] tried to analyze the relationship between
electricity load and daily air temperature in Spain. More recently
many studies have been conducted on short/long term electricity
demand/load forecasting [11e25], but application of neuro fuzzy

logic for forecasting electricity demand is still unexplored. In this
paper, an ANFIS network (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system)
was designed to map six parameters as input data (i.e. employment,
GDP, dwelling, population, HDD and CDD) to electricity demand as
output variable.

1.1. Problem statement
All of the referred literature have applied classical methods and
statistical techniques to predict electricity demand, but this paper
employs a new approach (neuro-fuzzy) in order to achieve a model
which can present more accurate prediction. Some researchers like
Abraham and Nath [26] and Beccali et al. [27] have also used new
approaches, which have been applied in many branches of science
and are becoming more popular than classical methods. Abraham
and Nath [26] have applied a neuro fuzzy approach to model the
electricity demand in Victoria. They found that even by using auto
regressive integrated moving average model and an (articial
neural network) ANN in their paper, neuro fuzzy network provides
a more accurate prediction.
In this paper, a neuro fuzzy network has been designed to model
the electricity demand of Ontario province in Canada based on six
input variables. These variables are employment, GDP, population,
dwelling and two other variables to indicate how hot or cold the
weather is. All these data were collected from CANSIM II, Statistics
Canadas key socio-economic database, and Environment Canada
(2005), with statistical analysis. Electricity demand data from 1976
to 2004 is obtained from IESO (Independent Electricity System
Operators).
In the literature review, the neuro-fuzzy modeling is described.
The section is divided into three sub-sections i.e. description of
ANN, fuzzy logic inference systems, and adaptive neuro fuzzy
inference system description. In research methodology section,
Ontario electricity demand forecasting is presented followed by the
designed and validation of ANFIS model in the next section. In the
last section, the sensitivity analysis of the designed network is
evaluated.
2. Neuro fuzzy system: ANFIS
Fuzzy logic is a system that can be applied to transform
linguistic concepts to mathematical and computational structure
for many purposes. But fuzzy systems do not have good ability to
learn and adapt to changing the conditions [28,29]. Combination of
ANN and fuzzy logic methods can overcome this drawback [29,30].
A combined fuzzy logic systems and neural network helps
researchers to choose and design parameters of fuzzy logic inferences [31]. Not having a systematic procedure for choosing
membership function type and parameters leads us to use an
(adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) ANFIS [32].
ANFIS applies a combination of error back propagation algorithm and least squares method as a hybrid algorithm to adjust the
membership functions of a fuzzy logic system optimally [33]. After
determining nal error (difference between results and targets) of
the system, derivative of squared error with respect to each nodes
output as error signals are fed back to the system to be used to alter
membership function parameters [34,35].
There are two fuzzy style inferences which are mostly used,
Mamdani-style inference and Sugeno-style inference. Mamdanistyle is based on Lot Zadehs 1973 paper [33] while Sugeno-style
is based on Takagi-Sugeno-Kang method of fuzzy inference [36,37].
In Fig. 1, a typical structure of an ANFIS based on Sugeno fuzzy
modeling is shown. Two inputs x, y and one output z were
considered for simplicity. Two membership functions were
considered for each input in this network.

3. Research methodology
In this paper, an ANFIS has been employed to estimate electricity
demand in Ontario, Canada. A statistical study has been carried out
on available data to nd the affecting factors and prepare data for
model building.
3.1. Statistical preprocessing
3.1.1. Available data
Seven parameters in the period from 1976 to 2011 were available. These data included the number of employment, GDP, population, dwelling count, (degree days) DD,1 number of new housing
and bank of Canada interest rate. The rst ve parameters are obtained from CANSIM II, Statistics Canadas key Socio-economic
database, and Environment Canada and two others are obtained
from Ref. [38].

For a particular year, DD is summation of temperatures of days during the year.

3.1.2. Data analysis using Pearson coefcient
Francis Galton in the 1880s introduced a factor to show
measure of correlation or linear dependence between two variables X and Y [36,39]. This factor, named after Karl Pearson as
Pearson correlation coefcient, is typically denoted by r and
can be a value between 1 and 1. Being more close to 1 or 1
shows more correlation between X and Y. Positive sign means that
data have direct relationship, but negative measures means indirect relationship between data. r can be calculated by using
equation (8).

P
X  X 0 Y  Y 0 
r  q
P
P
X  X 0 2 Y  Y 0 2

(8)

where X0 and Y0 are average of variables X and Y respectively.
Pearson correlation factor is widely used in sciences as
a measure of strength of linear dependence between two variables.
Measure of this coefcient between each seven parameters and
electricity demand was calculated. The results are listed in Table 1.
It is obviously that employment; GDP, population and dwelling
count have high correlation with electricity demand. But the
remaining parameters do not have good correlation to be selected
as an independent variable for model building.
All these four parameters are social or economic and none of
them are climatic variables. Environmental conditions that affect
electricity demand is described by Rodgers [36], where the hottest
temperature and the coldest temperature of a day were selected as
environmental temperature effect (one for showing how cold the
weather has been, (HDDd) and the other for showing how hot the
weather has been (CDDd)). These two new parameters are dened
as below:

HDDd  maxf0; Tb1  Tdg

(9)

CDDd  maxf0; Td  Tb2 g

(10)

where Tb1 is the base temperature, which was set as 10  C Tb2 is
another base temperature which was chosen to be 20  C. Td is the
mean temperature of a given day and d is the number of days in the
year (365 or 366).
In this study, summation of HDDd during a year (HDD) and
summation of CDDd during a year (CDD) were selected as new
parameters for model development. Measure of correlation
between these new variables and electricity demand was calculated. The results are listed in Table 2 which shows that HDD and
CDD have higher correlation than DD.
4. ANFIS model results
4.1. Designed network structure
As mentioned in the previous section, six parameters that had
the most important effects on the actual electricity demand were

selected for input variables (i.e. employment, GDP, dwelling, population, HDD and CDD). Based on these data, an ANFIS network
with Sugeno-style inference system has been designed which maps
six independent variables as input data to electricity demand as
output. MATLAB 7.6 was employed for model building. Three
Gaussian membership functions have been considered for each
input data. Fig. 2 shows the nal and best obtained membership
functions.
From 36 available data sets, 30 sets were selected to train the
network. Six remaining data sets were applied to validate the
trained network. The procedure ensures that the designed network
produces good results for any range of data.
After training the network, a (mean square error) MSE of
8.9251  1013 was obtained for training the data. The low training
error enabled the trained network to estimate unseen data with
high precision. The best obtained network MSE is 0.0016 for test
data.
4.2. Model validation
Censuses in Canada are conducted in a ve-yearly interval. The
latest census run by IESO provides exact data for employment, GDP,
population and dwelling count. In order to build a forecasting
model to the year 2015, a linear trend was assumed (Table 3).
These equations can be used to nd the average values for the
next 15 years period from 2012 to 2026. Having the values of all
input parameters for the year 2006 the electricity demand for the
year can be predicted. The calculated value is 165.46 TWh where
the actual data reported by IESO, is 151 TWh. It means a good
validation for the model and conrms its power to predict electricity demand in future years.
4.3. Prediction of electricity demand until 2015
After validating the model, it can be used to forecast the electricity demand in future. Linear lines were tted to the data based
on the linear trend of the data. Table 4 provides the linear equation
form.
By using these equations, it is possible to predict the values of
these parameters in the future (in this paper 2012e2015). The trend
of change for HDD and CDD is not liner. In this case, the average
values for every 5 years have been calculated to nd out whether
they have a special trend. To compare the annual changes of
parameters, changes of these parameters needs to be performed
step by step.
In this case, using the tted equations, all six independent
variables for future (2012e2015) were obtained (Table 5). Using
these inputs, ANFIS network can provide estimations. Fig. 3 depicts
electricity demand value from 1976 to 2015.
5. Sensitivity analysis
One of the important benets of having a forecasting model is to
nd the effects of independent parameters (in this study:
employment, GDP, dwelling, population, HDD and CDD) on electricity demand.

To investigate sensitivity of employment, amount of GDP,
dwelling population and also HDD and CDD were xed in their
2005 values. Amount of employment changed based on trend obtained in previous section (equation of employment in Table 4) and
its value for the next 100 years was calculated. Fig. 4 illustrates the
results.
The GDP, amount of employment, dwelling, population, HDD
and CDD were xed at 2005 value and GDP was varied using the
second equation in Table 4.
Sudden fall and rise in energy demand have been experienced in
year 1980 as shown in Fig. 4. So the predictions follow the same
pattern. Another reason for observing this sudden fall and rise is
that only one parameter is varied and the amount of other variables
are constant. In real situation, these input parameters vary and can
give us accurate value. In sensitivity analysis, it is obvious that the
similar trend is followed in Fig. 5.

The dwelling, amount of employment GDP, population, HDD
and CDD were xed at 2005 value and the dwelling was varied
using the third equation in Table 4.
Finally, the population, amount of employment, GDP, dwelling,
HDD and CDD were set at the year 2005 value and the population

calculated to be 0.0643242 for Employment and 4.39  105 for
GDP. These slopes are listed in Table 6.
It is clear that employment yields the biggest slope and it
conrms our conclusion that it is the most important parameter
affecting electricity demand.
6. Conclusion and remarks

Fig. 4. Effect of employment on electricity demand.

In this paper, an ANFIS network (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference
system) was designed to map six parameters as input data (i.e.
employment, GDP, dwelling, population, HDD and CDD) to electricity demand as output variable. To reduce the number of independent variables, input parameters were selected using statistical
analysis in order to determine the parameter that has the highest
impact on electricity demand. The network had excellent forecasting capacity with MSE of 0.0016.
Electricity demand until 2015 was predicted. By analyzing
sensitivity of electricity demand based on changes of independent
parameters, it was found out that employment affects electricity
demand the most.
In term of econometric systems, euro fuzzy systems are more
accurate than regression models. Compared to neural network
models the neuro fuzzy models are robust in future energy estimations while ANN models fail in such extrapolations. Also neuro
fuzzy models require less data compared to ANN models. Developing neuro fuzzy models are time consuming which is a drawback
of this method compared to regression methods or Fourier series.
Also for operators and technicians it is easy and understandable to
work with regressions which are feasible. If the system is not nonlinear it is recommended the regression models be employed in
demand predictions. For non-linear systems, neuro fuzzy, Fourier
or semi empirical models can be used for forecasting.
In this paper, all inputs were considered as independent variables. The inputs can be further improved by using hybrid models
such as the use of fuzzy inference systems or neural networks (or
even statistical methods like regression or time series) to nd
values of these parameters before entering them into the ANFIS
network. It is suggested that this case to be studied by using hybrid
methods in future researches.

was changed was varied using the last equation in Table 4. Fig. 5
illustrates the sensitivity results.
For the purpose of comparison, all sensitivity analysis results
have been plotted in Fig. 5. It can be seen that employment has the
most important effect on electricity demand. Comparing the slopes
conrm this conclusion. As shown in Fig. 5, the slopes of electricity
demand due to changes in dwelling and population are 0.005268
and 0.002596 respectively. But for employment and GDP, there are
three regions with three different slopes. If the slope of the
decreasing regions i.e. the second region are ignored to compare
the effect of parameters on increasing electricity demand, the
average slope of increasing regions (rst and third regions) is
