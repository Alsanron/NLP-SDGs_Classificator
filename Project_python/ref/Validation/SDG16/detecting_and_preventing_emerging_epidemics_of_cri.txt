Detecting and Preventing Emerging Epidemics of Crime

OBJECTIVE
We apply recently developed spatial biosurveillance
techniques to the law enforcement domain, with the
goal of helping local police departments to rapidly
detect and respond to (or better yet, to predict and
prevent) emerging spatial patterns of crime.
BACKGROUND
Geographic surveillance techniques have become
increasingly important in law enforcement and crime
prevention. New methods for mapping crime [1] and
for automatically detecting crime hot spots [2] using electronic case reports have increased situational
awareness and enabled more rapid police response to
emerging high crime areas. Additionally, recent work
in crime forecasting [3-4] has enabled law enforcement officials to predict and prevent rises in crime
using a variety of leading indicator data.
However, current crime detection and forecasting
methods require a coarse aggregation of cases (e.g.
by month, by square mile), due to both computational
considerations and the relatively small number of
serious crimes. These limitations reduce the spatial
and temporal precision with which departments can
pinpoint clusters of crime, as well as their ability to
rapidly respond to these clusters. Thus we propose
the use of expectation-based spatial scan statistic
methods [5-6] originally developed for the biosurveillance domain, which can use a finer aggregation
of data and can efficiently search for emerging spacetime clusters of varying size and duration. We will
use these methods both for detection of clusters of
violent crime, and for prediction of such clusters by
detecting clusters of leading indicator crimes.
METHODS
We collected two datasets of crime offense reports
from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, one reporting
violent crimes (VC) such as murder and armed robbery, and one reporting leading indicator (LI)
crimes such as simple assault and disorderly conduct.
Total crime counts from 1990-1999 were aggregated
by week and mapped spatially to a 52 x 64 grid of
1000 x 1000 foot cells. For each dataset, we used the
expectation-based Poisson scan statistic [6] to predict
the expected crime count of each cell for each week,
and to detect space-time clusters (1-4 weeks duration,
radius  20) with higher than expected counts. Statistical significance of each detected cluster was computed by randomization testing, and all significant
primary and secondary clusters were reported.

The detected VC clusters were then used as a gold
standard, and we examined how many of these clusters could be predicted by the LI data. A VC cluster
was counted as successfully predicted if one of the
100 highest scoring LI clusters was spatially close
(centers within distance 10) and 1-3 weeks prior.
RESULTS
For the 477 weeks of violent crime data from 19911999, we found 93 clusters (81 primary + 12 secondary) significant at  = .01, within the 15-20% alert
rate expected by domain users. Computation time
was 8 minutes per week, including 100 randomizations. Of the 93 significant VC clusters, 19 were
successfully predicted by the LI data, significantly
more than the 10.7 expected by chance (p < .02). Of
the 60 highest scoring VC clusters, 18 were successfully predicted, nearly triple the 6.7 expected by
chance (p < .003). Using only 50 LI clusters instead
of 100, we were able to predict 12 of 60 VC clusters,
as compared to 3.6 expected by chance (p < .005).
CONCLUSIONS
Our analysis of the violent crime and leading indicator data demonstrates that expectation-based scan
statistics can efficiently and accurately detect significant spatial clusters of crime, at a higher spatial and
temporal resolution than previously proposed crime
detection techniques. Moreover, we demonstrated
that detected clusters of leading indicator crimes can
be used to predict significant clusters of violent crime
1-3 weeks in advance, allowing police departments to
dynamically allocate patrols to these areas and carry
out other interventions to prevent crime.
