Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive review of 179 studies which employ operational
research (O.R.) and Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) techniques in the assessment of bank
performance. We first discuss numerous applications of data envelopment analysis
which is the most widely applied O.R. technique in the field. Then we discuss
applications of other techniques such as neural networks, support vector machines,
and multicriteria decision aid that have also been used in recent years, in bank failure
prediction studies and the assessment of bank creditworthiness and underperformance.

1. Introduction
Banks play a central role in the economy. They keep the savings of the public and
finance the development of business and trade. Furthermore, numerous studies argue
that the efficiency of financial intermediation affects economic growth while others
indicate that bank insolvencies can result in systemic crises which have adverse
consequences for the economy as a whole.1
Thus, the performance of banks has been an issue of major interest for various
stakeholders such as depositors, regulators, customers, and investors. While bank
performance has been traditionally evaluated on the basis of financial ratios, advances
in operational research (O.R.) and artificial intelligence (A.I.) have resulted in a shift
towards the use of such state-of-the-art techniques. Of course, this is not surprising,
since O.R. has been extensively applied to finance during the last half century (Board
et al., 2003). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the use of OR and AI
techniques in the assessment of bank performance.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 positions the survey
within the existing literature and discusses our framework. Section 3 discusses
applications of data envelopment analysis (DEA) in the estimation of bank efficiency
and productivity growth. Section 4 presents applications of other O.R. and A.I.
techniques in the prediction of bank failure and the assessment of bank
creditworthiness and underperformance. Section 5 summarizes our conclusions.

2. Scopus and framework
There are several interesting reviews that are related to our survey. For example,
Cook and Seiford (2009) review the methodological developments of DEA over the
last thirty years. However, they do not discuss applications of DEA. Zhou and Poh
(2008) provide a recent survey of DEA applications but they focus on energy and
environmental studies. Dimitras et al. (1996) discuss applications of various
techniques in the prediction of business failures but they focus on industrial firms.
Smith and Gupta (2000) provide a discussion of the application of neural networks in
business problems. Board et al. (2003) survey O.R. applications in the financial
markets. Thus, the above surveys are either quite general or they do not focus on
applications in banking.

finance and growth. See Caprio and Klingebiel (2003) for banking crises and the associated costs.

Berger and Humphrey (1997) review studies that examine the efficiency of
financial institutions. However, their coverage is limited to efficient frontier
techniques (e.g. DEA, stochastic frontier analysis). Furthermore, the survey is now
more than ten years old and since that time, numerous papers have been published.
Berger (2007) discusses more recent applications of frontier techniques but his survey
focuses only on studies that provide international comparisons of bank efficiency.
Finally, Ravi Kumar and Ravi (2008) discuss applications of statistical and A.I.
techniques in bankruptcy prediction. The applications that they survey were published
until 2005, and although a few of them focus on the banking sector most of the studies
deal with non-financial firms.
We differentiate our review from the above surveys by discussing applications
of O.R. and A.I. techniques over the period 1998-2008 while focusing on bank
performance.2 We searched for papers in Scopus, which is considered to be one of the
largest abstract and citation databases. We consider only journal articles and we do
not include working papers, monographs, dissertations, or other publication outcomes.
Furthermore, our search is limited to articles written in English. We use a
combination of various keywords such as bank efficiency, bank and data
envelopment analysis, bank performance, bank and neural networks, bank and
artificial intelligence, bank and operational (or operations) research. A few
additional studies were identified from cross-referencing and were manually
collected.
We reviewed a total of 179 studies. DEA is by far the most commonly used
O.R./A.I. technique in assessing bank performance and we identified 136 studies that
use DEA-like techniques to estimate various measures of bank efficiency and
productivity growth, and 28 studies that provide similar estimates at the branch level.3
We also identified 15 studies that use classification techniques such as neural
networks, support vector machines, multicriteria decision aid, decision trees, nearest
neighbours to predict bank failure or assess bank creditworthiness, and bank
underperformance. These studies were published in a total of 67 journals, however,
around 56% of them appeared in just eleven journals. As shown in Table 1, the most

Some of the studies were still in press at the time of the writing of this review, but we included them
in our discussion as they were already publicly available since 2008 (i.e. 2008 DOI).

Our survey focuses on studies that examine banking institutions as a whole; however, we also discuss
studies on branch efficiency in section 3.2.7 as one could argue that the efficiency of individual
branches can influence the performance of banks as a whole.

frequent sources of publication are the European Journal of Operational Research
(18) and the Journal of Banking and Finance (15), followed by Applied Financial
Economics (13), Applied Economics (9), Expert Systems with Applications (9), and
the Journal of Productivity Analysis (9). In the sections that follow we discuss various
issues surrounding these studies, while additional information is available in
Appendices I to III.

3. DEA and bank-efficiency
DEA is a mathematical programming technique for the development of production
frontiers and the measurement of efficiency relative to these frontiers (Charnes et al.,
1978). The best-practice production frontier for a sample of banks is constructed
through a piecewise linear combination of actual input-output correspondence set that
envelops the input-output correspondence of all banks in the sample (Thanassoulis,
2001). Each bank is assigned an efficiency score between 0 and 1. The scores are only
relative to the banks in the sample, with higher scores indicating a more efficient
bank.
One of the well-known advantages of DEA is that it works relatively well with
small samples. Other advantages of DEA are that it does not require any assumptions
to be made about the distribution of inefficiency and it does not require a particular
functional form on the data in determining the most efficiency banks. However, DEA
is also subject to few limitations. Two of the best known shortcomings are that DEA
assumes data to be free of measurement error, and that it is sensitive to outliers. Coelli
et al. (2005) also point out that: (i) having few observations and many inputs and/or
outputs will result in many firms appearing on the DEA frontier, (ii) treating
inputs/outputs as homogenous commodities when they are heterogeneous may bias
the results, (iii) not accounting for differences in the environment may give
misleading results, (iv) standard DEA does not control for multi-period optimization
or risk managerial decision making.
Our survey shows that recent DEA studies have examined almost all the
banking sectors around the world. A few recent studies provide cross-country
evidence. Most of them examine banks from the large EU banking sectors (Pastor,
2002; Casu and Molyneux, 2003; Beccalli et al., 2006). Lozano-Vivas et al. (2002)
6

examine ten EU countries, Bergendahl (1998) focuses on Nordic countries, while
Pasiouras (2008a) examines an international dataset.

3.1. Methodological issues
3.1.1. Efficiency measures
Most of the studies focus on the technical efficiency of banks (e.g. Lozano-Vivas et
al., 2002; Drake et al., 2006; Pasiouras, 2008a,b). This efficiency measure indicates
whether a bank uses the minimum quantity of inputs to produce a given quantity of
outputs or maximizes the output quantity given a certain quantity of inputs.
However, when price data for the inputs and/or outputs are available one can
also estimate cost and/or profit efficiency measures.4 Cost efficiency is the product of
technical efficiency and allocative efficiency. The latter refers to the ability of a bank
to use the optimum mix of inputs given their respective prices. Consequently, cost
efficiency shows the ability of a bank to provide services without wasting resources as
a result of technical or allocative inefficiency. Appendix I shows that around 35
studies present measures of DEA cost efficiency (e.g. Tortosa-Ausina, 2002a,b,c; Isik
and Hassan, 2002, 2003a).
Pastor and Serrano (2006) propose the decomposition of cost inefficiency into
composition inefficiency and intra-specialisation inefficiency. The first component
indicates the part of inefficiency due to the composition of specialisations of the
banks in each banking sector. The second component reveals the inefficient use of
resources within each of the specialisation selected. Prior (2003) also deviates from
the above studies by calculating measures of short and long-run cost inefficiency as
well as capacity inefficiency for Spanish banks. The first refers to the case that a
subset of inputs are fixed and impossible to modify in the short-run. Long-run
inefficiency estimates are obtained under the assumption that inputs are variable and
under the control of the company. Finally, capacity inefficiency, obtained by the ratio
of long-run to short-run inefficiency, refers to excess in costs as a result of
inappropriate level in fixed inputs. Similar concepts along with an application in the
Indian banking sector are discussed in Sahoo and Tone (2008).
4

One can also estimate revenue efficiency which is similar to profit efficiency. In both cases, both
inputs and output prices are required. The difference is that in the former measure the aim is to
maximize revenues rather than profits (i.e. revenues minus costs). We are no aware of DEA studies
focusing on revenue efficiency so we do not discuss this issue further. Readers interesting in revenue
efficiency could see Coelli et al. (2005) for further details.

7

Estimations of profit efficiency with DEA are rather limited in the literature.
One potential reason is the difficulty in collecting reliable and transparent information
for output prices. Furthermore, the decomposition of profit efficiency into technical
and allocative efficiency is not straightforward (Coelli et al., 2005). Fare et al. (2004)
propose the solution of two sets of linear programmes. In the first, a profit maximising
DEA is solved to measure profit efficiency. In the second DEA problem, technical
efficiency is measured on the basis of a directional distance function that allows the
simultaneous adjustment of inputs and outputs. Kirkwood and Nahm (2006) also
estimate profit efficiency, although they use input prices only. Therefore, in a sense
they calculate a measure of efficiency that is similar to Berger and Mesters (1997)
alternative profit efficiency which is commonly used in the stochastic frontier
analysis literature. The studies of Maudos and Pastor (2003) and Ariff and Can (2008)
provide estimates of both standard and alternative profit efficiency.
Finally, around 30% of the studies obtain estimates of total factor productivity
(TFP) growth (e.g. Sathye, 2002; Casu et al., 2004).5 This measure is usually
decomposed further into technological change (i.e. shift in the best practice frontier)
and technical efficiency change. Furthermore, in most cases, technical efficiency
change is disaggregated into pure technical efficiency change and scale efficiency
change under the variable returns to scale assumption discussed below.

3.1.2. Constant vs Variable Returns to scale
DEA can be implemented by assuming either constant returns to scale (CRS) or
variable returns to scale (VRS). In their seminal study, Charnes et al. (1978) proposed
a model that had an input orientation and assumed CRS. This model returns a score
that indicates the overall technical efficiency (OTE) of each bank. Banker et al.
(1984) suggested the use of variable returns to scale (VRS) that decomposes OTE into
product of two components, pure technical efficiency (PTE) and scale efficiency (SE).
The former relates to the ability of managers to utilize firms given resources, while
the latter refers to exploiting scale economies by operating at a point where the
production frontier exhibits CRS.

5

Almost all the studies use the DEA-like Malmquist index. Zen and Baldan (2008) use the Luenberger
Indicator that is a generalization of the Malmquist Index.

8

In most of the recent papers, DEA models are estimated using the assumption
of VRS, while arguing that CRS is only appropriate when all firms are operating at an
optimal scale.6 Nevertheless, other studies argue in favour of CRS rather than VRS.
For example, Noulas (1997) points out that the assumption of CRS allows the
comparison between small and large banks. He claims that in a sample where a few
large banks are present, the use of VRS framework raises the possibility that these
large banks will appear as being efficient for the simple reason that there are no truly
efficient banks (Berg et al., 1991). Avkiran (1999) also mentions that under VRS each
unit is compared only against other units of similar size, instead of against all units.
Hence, the assumption of VRS may be more suitable for large samples. Soteriou and
Zenios (1999a) argue that caution is necessary when using the VRS formulation. First,
because the model orientation (i.e. input minimization or output maximization)
becomes important. Second, because the use of the weights restriction in the VRS
assessment may lead to some other problematic results (Allen, 1997). Consequently,
many studies report the results obtained under both CRS and VRS assumptions (e.g.
Canhoto and Dermine, 2003; Casu and Molyneux, 2003).

3.1.3. Output-input orientation
Technical Efficiency can be estimated under either an input-oriented or outputoriented approach.7 As Coelli et al. (2005) point out, the input-oriented technical
efficiency measures address the question: By how much can input quantities be
proportionally reduced without changing the output quantities produced? (p. 137).
In contrast, the output-oriented measures of technical efficiency address the question:
By how much can output quantities be proportionally expanded without altering the
input quantities used? (p. 137).
By far, studies in banking obtain efficiency estimates under the input-oriented
approach.8 This is most likely due to the assumption that bank managers have higher

6

Reasons that may not allow a firm to operate at optimal scale include among others imperfect
competition, government regulations, constrains on finance, etc. (Coelli et al., 2005).
7
If price data are available, then under the under cost minimization objective (i.e. cost efficiency) one
obtains input-oriented measures of technical efficiency and input-mix allocate efficiency. Revenue
maximization (i.e. revenue efficiency), results is output-oriented technical efficiency and output-mix
allocative efficiency measures. In the case of profit maximization (profit efficiency), technical
efficiency can be obtained under either the input or output-oriented assumption (Coelli et al., 2005)
8
Additional information is available in Appendix I. In contrast to efficiency estimates, productivity
measures are in several cases obtained using an output-oriented Malmquist index. However, as
discussed in Coelli et al. (2005, p. 80), although the values of the components, and consequently their

9

control over inputs (e.g. personnel, expenses) rather than outputs (e.g. loans, income,
etc). However, there are also some studies that adopt the output-oriented approach
(e.g. Ataullah et al., 2004; Ataullah and Le, 2006) or report the results from both (e.g.
Casu and Molyneux, 2003; Beccalli et al., 2006). It should be mentioned that the
input-oriented and output-oriented measures always provide the same value under
CRS but they are unequal when VRS is assumed. However, Coelli et al. (2005)
mention that since linear programming does not suffer from statistical problems the
choice of an appropriate orientation is not as important as in the case of econometric
approaches. Furthermore, in many instances, the choice of orientation has only a
minor influence upon the scores obtained (Coelli and Perelman, 1996).

3.1.4. Selection of Inputs and Outputs
There is an on-going discussion in the banking literature regarding the proper
definition of inputs and outputs. In the words of Bergendahl (1998): There have been
almost as many assumptions of inputs and outputs as there have been applications of
DEA (p. 235).
Berger and Humphrey (1997) identify two main approaches for the selection
of inputs and outputs. These are the production approach and the intermediation
approach. The first assumes that banks produce loans and deposits account services,
using labour and capital as inputs, and that the number and type of transactions or
documents processed measure outputs. The second approach perceives banks as
financial intermediaries between savers and investors. Berger and Humphrey (1997)
argue that neither of these two approaches is perfect because they cannot fully capture
the dual role of financial institutions as providers of transactions/document processing
services and also being financial intermediaries. They point out that the production
approach may be somewhat better for evaluating the efficiencies of bank branches and
the intermediation approach may be more appropriate for evaluating financial
institutions as a whole. Furthermore, there are difficulties in collecting the detailed
transaction flow information required in the production approach. As a result, the
intermediation approach is the one favoured in the literature.
However, there is a controversy even within this approach concerning the role
of deposits (Berger and Humphrey, 1997). Consequently, some studies use only
contribution to overall productivity change may differ, the overall TFP change measure will be the
same regardless of the orientation (i.e. input or output) that is imposed.

10

earning assets as outputs, a selection that is in line with the asset approach of Sealey
and Lindley (1977) while others consider deposits as an additional output, a selection
that is more closely related to the so-called value-added approach. We find around
eighty applications in bank efficiency where the monetary value of deposits is part of
the input vector and twenty applications where deposits are part of the output vector.9
Around thirty studies use interest expenses as an input without using the stock of
deposits (e.g. Sathey, 2002; Weill, 2004). In another eight applications, the stock of
deposits is used as an output and the interest expense paid on deposits constitutes an
input (e.g. Maudos et al., 2002; Saha and Ravisankar, 2000; Chen et al., 2005).
Furthermore, around five studies use time deposits and saving deposits as input and
demand deposits as output (e.g. Bauer et al., 1998; Gilbert and Wilson, 1998; Sathye,
2001). Finally, in a few applications the deposits are included as both an input and an
output (e.g. Tortosa-Ausina, 2002a).
More recently, some studies have adopted another variation of the
intermediation approach. This is the so-called profit-oriented (or operating) approach
which defines revenue components (e.g. interest income, non-interest income, etc.) as
outputs and cost components (e.g. personnel expenses, interest expenses, etc.) as
inputs.10 Drake et al. (2006) mention that from the perspective of an input-oriented
DEA relative efficiency analysis, the more efficient units will be better at minimizing
the various costs incurred in generating the various revenue streams and,
consequently, better at maximizing profits (p. 1451). They also argue that this
approach can be more appropriate in capturing the diversity of strategic responses by
financial firms in the face of dynamic changes in competitive and environmental
conditions. Furthermore, Luo (2003) calculates a measure of marketability
efficiency in an attempt to capture the value of the bank in the stock market. In this
case, revenue and profits are considered inputs whereas market value, earnings per
share, and stock price are outputs.
As discussed before, with the exception of deposits there is a general
agreement about the main categories of inputs and outputs, however, this does not
9

This discussion refers to banks as a whole and not branches. The number of applications does not
match the number of studies as in several cases there are numerous models developed in each study.
Furthermore, in some cases deposits or non interest expenses are not considered in the analysis. In one
case (Prior, 2003), the output was the number of current and saving accounts rather than the monetary
value of deposits (i.e. stock).
10
See Chu and Lim (1998), Avkiran (1999), Sturm and Williams (2004), Das and Ghosh (2006), Drake
et al. (2006), Ataullah and Le (2006), Pasiouras (2008b), Pasiouras et al. (2008).

11

necessarily imply that there is consistency with respect to the specific inputs/outputs
used in various studies. For instance, the traditional inputs are fixed assets,
personnel11, and in many cases deposits (e.g. Isik and Hassan, 2002; Maudos and
Pastor, 2003; Casu and Girardone, 2004; Havrylchyk, 2006). However, some studies
use branches (e.g. Chen, 2001), loan loss provisions (e.g. Drake, 2001; Drake et al.,
2006; Pasiouras, 2008b) and equity (e.g. Chu and Lim, 1998; Mukherjee et al., 2001;
Sturm and Williams, 2004; Pasiouras, 2008a) as additional or alternative inputs. Chen
(2001) disaggregates deposits into current deposits and time deposits, while Das and
Ghosh (2006) use demand, savings and fixed deposits. Casu and Girardone (2006)
and Beccalli et al. (2006) use total costs as a single input while Casu and Molyneux
(2003) use two inputs namely total costs, and total deposits (i.e. customers and short
term funding).
Several studies use two outputs, usually, loans and other earning assets (e.g.
Casu and Molyneux, 2003; Casu and Girardone, 2004; 2006).12 However, some
studies disaggregate loans into various categories such as housing loans, and other
loans (e.g. Sturm and Williams, 2004), real estate loans, commercial loans and
personal loans (e.g. Mukherjee et al., 2001; Fare et al., 2004) or short-term and longterm loans (Isik and Hassan, 2002). Others disaggregate other earning assets into
investments and liquid assets (Tsionas et al., 2003) or investment in government
securities and investments in public and private enterprises (e.g. Chen, 2001).
Canhoto and Dermine (2003) use the number of branches as an additional output
under the assumption that it represents an additional value for retail customers.
Finally, recent studies include non-interest income or off-balance-sheet items as
additional outputs (e.g. Isik and Hassan, 2002, 2003a; Sturm and Williams, 2004;
Tortosa-Ausina, 2003, Havrylchyk, 2006; Pasiouras, 2008b).13
Finally, Halkos and Salamouris (2004) propose an approach that deviates from
the above literature. They use an output vector that consists of five financial ratios and
no inputs. Their underlying hypothesis is that inputs are considered similar and equal
11

Some studies use the number of personnel (e.g. Drake, 1999; Sathye, 2001; Maudos and Pastor,
2003; Pasiouras, 2008b). However, due to data unavailability others rely on personnel expenses (e.g.
Bergendahl, 1998; Tortosa-Ausina, 2002; Lozano-Vivas et al., 2002; Drake et al., 2006).
12
Other earning assets normally include various items such as government securities, investment
securities, trading securities, other securities, equity investments, and other investments.
13
Isik and Hassan (2003a) mention among others that ignoring such non-traditional outputs may
penalize banks that are heavily involved in these activities. The reason is that while the resources used
to produce these non-traditional outputs are part of the input vector, the outputs generated using these
inputs are not included in the output vector.

12

for all banks as they operate in the same markets for money and service. The
comparison with standard DEA models developed under either CRS or VRS
assumptions shows that the DEA ratio model has the highest discrimination power.

3.1.5. Adjusting for the environment
Coelli et al. (2005) discuss four approaches that can be used to incorporate
environmental variables in DEA applications.14 The first method, by Banker and
Morey (1986), requires the environmental variables to be ordered from the least to the
most harmful ones for efficiency. Then, the efficiency of a given firm is compared
with those firms in the sample that have a value of the environmental variable which
is less than or equal to the given firm. This ensures that banks are not compared with
peers operating in a more favourable environment. The second method, by Charnes et
al. (1981), requires the investigator to: (i) divide the sample into sub-samples and
solve DEA problems for each sub-sample, (ii) project all observed data points into
their prospective frontiers, and (iii) solve a single DEA using the projected points and
assess any difference in the mean efficiency of the two sub-samples. According to
Coelli et al. (2005) the following two problems are common in both methods: (i) by
splitting up the sample they reduce the comparison set, and (ii) only one
environmental variable can be considered in each case thereby limiting the scope of
the analysis.
Under the third method, the environmental variables are included directly into
the DEA problem as non-discretionary inputs (if it is believed to have a positive effect
on efficiency) or outputs (if they have a negative effect on efficiency). The
disadvantage of this approach is that one must know a priori the direction of the
influence, a shortcoming that is also applicable in the case of the first method.
Alternatively, the environmental variables can be included as non-discretionary
neutral variables using an equality form. The shortcoming of this approach is that it
can reduce the reference set for each firm. Recent applications of the above
approaches in banking can be found in Pastor (1999) and Lozano-Vivas et al. (2001,
2002).

14

According to Coelli et al. (2005) environmental variables can include ownership differences, location
characteristics, labour union power and government regulations and in a sense any factors that can
influence the efficiency of the firm without being traditional inputs or under the control of managers.

13

The fourth method that is discussed in Coelli et al. (2005) is the two-stage
approach. This involves a DEA problem with traditional inputs and outputs in the first
stage. In the second stage, the efficiency scores obtained are regressed on the
environmental variables. While this approach has been frequently used in the banking
literature with numerous applications, it fails to adjust the efficiency measures.
Therefore, it is more suitable when the objective is to examine the correlations of
efficiency with various factors (see Section 3.2.1.) rather than provide the basis for
absolute comparisons across different environments.
Finally, Pastor (2002) and Drake et al. (2006) adjust the bank efficiency scores
for risk and external environmental factors respectively, using a multi-stage DEA (see
Fried et al, 1999, 2002). In this case, the application starts with the estimation of a
DEA model with traditional inputs and outputs. Then, using the slacks from the DEA
model they quantify the effect of the operating environment, and adjust the initial
dataset inputs and/or outputs. Finally, they re-run the initial DEA model using the
adjusted data.

3.2. Topics of interest
3.2.1. Determinants of efficiency
Several studies attempt to investigate the factors that influence the efficiency of
banks. Some studies examine only bank-specific factors and others examine both
bank-specific attributes and environmental determinants.
Commonly found bank-specific factors are size, profitability, capitalisation,
loans to assets (Casu and Molyneux, 2003; Casu and Girardone, 2004; Ataullah and
Le, 2006; Ariff and Can, 2008). Isik and Hassan (2003a) examine additional
characteristics such as the educational profile of bank personnel and CEO-Chairman
affiliation. Some studies examine whether age is related to efficiency (e.g. Isik and
Hassan, 2003a; Canhoto and Dermine, 2003; Isik, 2008). Furthermore, Isik and
Hassan (2002), Casu and Girardone (2004) and Pasiouras (2008b) examine the
international presence of Turkish, Italian, and Greek banks, respectively.
Country-specific factors include market concentration, presence of foreign
banks, ratio of private investments to GDP, fiscal deficits to GDP, GDP growth,
(Hauner, 2005; Ataullah and Le, 2006). More recently, Pasiouras (2008a) examined
the relationship between technical efficiency and regulations related to capital

14

adequacy, private monitoring, banks activities, deposit insurance schemes,
supervisory power and bank entry into the industry.
These studies use the two-stage approach discussed above. First, they use
DEA to obtain efficiency estimates. Then, in a second stage, the DEA scores are
regressed on a number of explanatory variables using Tobit (e.g. Hauner, 2005), OLS
(Ataullah and Le, 2006), GMM (Ataullah and Le, 2006), or GLS (Isik and Hassan,
2003a) regression. The rationale to use Tobit lies on the fact that the efficiency scores
are bounded between 0 and 1, and hence non-censored estimates will be biased.
Ataullah and Le (2006) among others, mention that it is not necessary to use Tobit as
long as the efficiency scores can be transformed by taking the natural logarithm of
[efficiency score / (1-efficiency score)].
Whether or not censored regression is used, the most important argument
comes from Simar and Wilson (2007) who pont out that the covariates in the secondstep regression are obviously correlated with the one side error terms from the firststep as otherwise there would be no need for the second step-regression. Furthermore,
the covariates in the second-step are likely to be (highly) correlated with the
covariates in the first-step. This means that the errors and the covariates in the firststep cannot be independent. Thus, Simar and Wilson conclude that the likelihood that
is maximized is not the correct one, unless one takes account of the correlation
structure. Casu and Molyneux (2003) present an early attempt to account for the
problems that can emerge in the two-stage DEA method using a bootstrap approach.
However, Simar and Wilson (2007) mention that the simple bootstrap is not enough to
overcome the drawbacks pointed out above. They propose an algorithm that uses a
double bootstrap procedure, and they present an application to U.S. banks. Brissimis
et al. (2008) adopt this approach to examine the determinants of efficiency in the new
EU banking sectors.

3.2.2. Stock returns and efficiency
Following the work of Ball and Brown (1968) the relationship between stock returns
and publicly available information has attracted considerable attention in the
accounting and finance literature. Whilst most of the studies examine whether
earnings reflect some of the information in stock prices, recent research has, however,
shifted towards the use of additional data such as accruals, revenues, economic value
added and efficiency to understand how they affect stock prices and returns. DEA
15

applications that were published over the period of our survey and investigate the
relationship between bank efficiency and stock returns examine Australia (Kirkwood
and Nahm, 2006), Greece (Pasiouras et al., 2008), Malaysia (Sufian and Majid, 2006),
Singapore (Chu and Lim, 1998; Sufian and Majid, 2007), Turkey (Erdem and Erdem,
2008), and Spain (Guzman et al., 2008). Furthermore, in a cross-country setting,
Beccalli et al. (2006) provide evidence from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, that
is, the five principal EU banking sectors. In most cases, the results of these studies
indicate a positive relationship between stock returns and efficiency changes.
Furthermore, Becalli et al. (2006) reveal that the explanatory power of the model with
DEA scores is higher than that of a model that uses the return on equity (ROE) as a
measure of performance.

3.2.3. Bank ownership
A number of studies compare the efficiency of banks across different ownership
types. One approach used in the literature is to split the sample and compare the
means of the different ownership groups. Another approach is to incorporate dummy
variables in a second stage analysis as the one described in Section 3.2.1.
Some studies compare domestic and foreign banks. Havrylchyk (2006) finds
that greenfield banks are more efficient than domestic banks in Poland, whereas
foreign banks that acquired domestic ones have not successfully increased their
efficiency. Sturm and Williams (2004) report that foreign banks in Australia are more
efficient than domestic ones. Isik and Hassan (2003a) find that foreign banks are more
efficient than private domestic Turkish banks while Isik (2008) reports similar results
for TFP growth estimates. However, Ataullah and Le (2004) find that prior to the
financial liberalization of 1991-1992, foreign banks where less efficient than domestic
ones in India and Pakistan; nevertheless, the opposite picture emerged after this
period.
Other studies examine the efficiency of state-owned banks. Many of them find
that state-owned banks are less efficient than other banks. For instance, GarciaCestona and Surroca (2008) find that Spanish banks controlled by insiders (i.e.
managers and workers) are more efficient than the ones controlled by public
administrations. Ariff and Can (2008) find that joint-stock banks in China are more
cost- and profit-efficient than state-owned banks. Chen (1998) in Taiwan, and Mercan
et al. (2003) in Turkey also report that the efficiency of privately-owned banks is
16

higher than that of state-owned banks. Similarly, Isik (2008) focuses on TFP growth
and finds that the growth of private banks is more than double that of state banks. In
contrast, other studies report that the efficiency of private banks is lower than that of
state-owned banks in Turkey (Isik and Hassan, 2003a), India (Sathye, 2003), and
Austria and Germany (Hauner, 2005).

3.2.4. Corporate events and efficiency
Another part of the literature relates DEA efficiency estimates to corporate events
such as mergers and acquisitions and/or bankruptcy. Some of the studies compare the
efficiency of acquirers and their targets and examine whether mergers improve
efficiency. Avkiran (1999) reports that acquiring banks are more efficient than
acquired Australian banks. However, the results of this study also indicate that
acquiring banks do not always maintain their pre-merger efficiency and there is mixed
evidence on the extent to which the benefits of efficiency are passed to the public. The
results of Al-Sharkhas et al. (2008) indicate that merged U.S. banks are on average
more technically efficient and that they experience higher productivity growth than
non-merged banks. Hahn (2007a) finds evidence that Austrian banks, which engaged
in domestic merger deals, achieved a higher productive efficiency level than banks
which did not participate in such deals. The results also show that merger gains
remain significant over a longer period of time (more than five years) but there is
slight tendency to level off. Sherman and Rupert (2006) also focus on the efficiency
gains from bank mergers but they concentrate on the branch rather than the banklevel. They find that there are opportunities to reduce operating costs. Such benefits,
however, are not realised until four years after the merger.
Kohers et al. (2000) follow a different approach to test whether X-efficiencies
influence the markets assessment of bank mergers. They find that that the abnormal
returns of bidders around the announcement period were associated with both the
target banks profit efficiency and cost efficiency as well as the difference between
the average peer cost efficiency score and the corresponding targets cost.15 Wheelock
and Wilson (2000) also relate efficiency with bank acquisitions. However, in their
15

Only cost efficiency was estimated with DEA in this study. Profit efficiency was estimated using
stochastic frontier analysis. As in previous studies, Kohers et al. (2000) also provide comparisons of
efficiency across different groups. They find that acquiring U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs) are
less cost-efficient compared to their targets. Also industry peers operate with greater cost efficiencies
that then bidder and target BHCs.

17

case DEA efficiency scores are used as an input in hazard models that capture the
acquisition and failure likelihood. They find that inefficiency increases the risk of
failure while reducing the probability of a U.S. banks being acquired. Using a sample
of 245 U.S. banks, Luo (2003) also reports that overall technical efficiency can be
useful in predicting bank failures.

3.2.5. Regulatory reform/liberalization and efficiency
A number of studies examine the impact of regulatory reform and liberalization
initiatives on bank efficiency and productivity. The studies that we review seem to
indicate a positive relationship in most countries including India and Pakistan
(Ataullah et al., 2004), Australia (Avkiran, 1999; Sturn and Williams, 2004), US
(Mukherjee et al., 2001), China (Chen et al., 2005), Greece (Tsionas et al., 2003;
Rezitis, 2006), Taiwan (Wang and Huang, 2007), Korea (Gilbert and Wilson, 1998),
Turkey (Isik and Hassan, 2003b), and the new EU countries (Brissimis et al., 2008).
However, Hauner (2005) finds no evidence that productivity is related to deregulation
in Germany and Austria, while Sathye (2002) argues that there can be a limit of
deregulation after which no further productivity gains could be possible due to
deregulation.
Some other interesting observations can be summarized as follows. The
banking sector reform in the newly acceded EU countries had a positive impact on
bank efficiency, while the effect of reform on TFP growth was significantly only
toward the end of the reform process (Brissimis et al., 2008). The implementation of
financial liberalization programmes may enable foreign banks to overcome the
liability of foreignness and enhance their resource utilization (Ataullah and Le,
2004). The impact of deregulation will not necessarily be the same across different
bank ownerships such as state, domestic, foreign (Isik and Hassan, 2003b).

3.2.6. Comparison of frontier techniques
A few studies compare alternative frontier techniques over the period of our
survey. Bauer et al. (1998) use a sample of US banks to compare DEA, SFA, TFA
(thick frontier approach), and DFA (distribution-free approach) over six consistency
criteria. They find that DEA yields much lower average efficiencies, ranks the banks
differently, and identifies the best and worst banks differently from parametric
methods. Furthermore, compared to DEA the parametric measures were more highly
18

correlated with the traditional (non-frontier) performance measures. Huang and Wang
(2002) provide another comparison of SFA, DFA and DEA using data from
Taiwanese banks. They also argue that the choice of the frontier approach can result
in different conclusions. Weill (2004) provides more recent evidence using a sample
from five European countries. However, this cross-country setting does not alter the
main conclusion of lack of robustness across different approaches, confirming the
results of the previous two studies. Delis et al. (2008) provide further support to these
findings using a dataset of Greek banks. The study of Beccalli et al. (2006) also
provides useful insights for the differences of SFA and DEA. While this study does
not focus on the comparison between these two methods, it finds that while changes
in the stock prices of banks reflect percentage changes in DEA cost efficiency scores,
this trend is less clear with SFA efficiency estimates. In contrast, Fiordelisi (2008)
reports that SFA cost efficiency estimates explain better the variations in shareholder
value creation than those derived from DEA.
Casu et al. (2004) compare productivity growth estimates obtained through
parametric and non-parametric approaches. Their study seems to indicate that in this
case the differences are not as large as in the efficiency studies. They conclude that
although the alternative methodologies produce, in some cases, opposing findings, as
for the sources of productivity for individual years, in general they do not yield
noticeably different results in terms of identifying the components of the productivity
growth of EU banks during the period of their study.

3.2.7. Efficiency of bank branches
While most of the above studies focus on the efficiency of banking institutions as a
whole, a related strand of the literature examines the efficiency of bank branches.16 In
general, branches are predominantly regarded as production units (see Camanho and
Dyson (1999, 2005, 2006), Zenios et al. (1999), Soteriou and Zenios (1999b), Golany
and Storbeck (1999), Athanassopoulos and Giokas (2000) and Hartman et al. (2001))
where output is measured by the number of various accounts and/or transactions as
contrast to the intermediation approach employed by Portela and Thanassoulis (2005,
2007), Portela et al. (2003), Giokas (2008a) where branches are seen as
intermediaries, and thus outputs are measured in monetary terms.

16

See Appendix II for information on branch efficiency studies.

19

There are studies which consider the changing role of bank branches from a
predominantly transaction-based one to a sales-oriented role. Cook et al. (2000) and
Cook and Hababou (2001) distinguish sales and services (transactions) functions of
bank branches in a Canadian Bank where inputs are usually shared between these two
functions. To model the shared resources, Cook et al. (2000) extend the usual
methodology to develop a model which incorporates the best resource split and
optimises the aggregate efficiency score. Further, Cook and Hababou (2001) model
the shared resources concept by adopting the Additive DEA model. In a recent novel
application, Portela and Thannasoulis (2007) assess the branches of a Portuguese bank
in terms of their performance in their new roles by specifying efficiency measures
which consider sales, transactional activities as well as bank branch profit efficiency.
Service quality is also a significant dimension of bank branches performance.
Two different ways are developed in empirical applications to consider service
quality. For instance, Soteriou and Zenios (1999b), Golany and Storbeck (1999);
Athanassopoulos and Giokas (2000) include quality variables in efficiency analysis
whereas Portela and Thannasoulis (2007) use a post-hoc analysis to compare service
quality index with efficiency measures. They find that service quality is positively
related with operational and profit efficiency.
The diversity of environments in which the branches are operating is also
considered in the literature. Paradi and Schaffnit (2004) considered the role of the
environmental parameters that are outside the management control in the commercial
branches of a large Canadian bank and incorporated risk and economic growth rate of
the region, as two non-discretionary factors. On the other hand, Camanho and Dyson
(2006) assess the impact of environmental factors and regional managerial policies on
branches productivity through the construction of an index that reflects the relative
performance of bank branches operating in four different regions in Portugal. Das et
al (2007) introduce the concept of spatial efficiency for each region relative to the
nation and thus, measure the effects of differences in the regional characteristics on
the efficiency of bank branches across four metropolitan regions in India.
Some interesting observations can be summarised as follows. In general, the
existing studies of bank branch efficiency use data on a small number of branches of
non-US banks and mostly employ DEA. There are studies however, which evaluate
bank branch performance with DEA and compare the results with other
methodologies, i.e. FDH (Portela et al. 2003), Malmquist indices (Camanho and
20

Dyson, 2006), log-linear frontier method (Giokas 2008b), ABC Plus (Kantor and
Maital, 1999), OCRA (Parkan and Wu, 1999), Neural Network Model (Wu et al.
2006), Quasi-concave DEA, FDH, and Parametric Frontier models (Dekker and Post,
2001). Most of the studies which were reviewed use technical and operational
efficiencies as estimated measures. Recent studies examine the allocative profit
efficiency (see Portela and Thanassoulis, 2005, 2008), and cost efficiency (Camanho
and Dyson, 2005, 2008) aspects of bank branches.

4. Other O.R. and A.I. techniques and bank performance
In this section, we review 15 recent studies that develop classification models used in
the prediction of bank failure (9), bank underperformance (2), and credit ratings (4).
Canbas et al. (2005) point out that the study of bank failure is important for at least
two reasons. First, an understanding of the reasons beyond the failure allows
regulatory authorities to manage and supervise banks more efficiently. Second, the
ability to differentiate between healthy and troubled banks can reduce the expected
cost of bank failure, either by taking actions to prevent failure or by minimizing the
costs to the public (Thomson, 1991). As discussed in Gaganis et al. (2006) while
many of the failure prediction models achieve very promising classification
accuracies, one common drawback is that they concentrate on the assignment of
banks in two groups, failed and non-failed. However, the classification of banks as
bad or good reduces the usefulness of the model. Obviously, the classification
into more groups relates to another strand of the literature that deals with credit risk
modelling and attempts to replicate the ratings assigned by the credit agencies. In the
following sub-sections, we provide a brief description of the methodologies, the
employed variables, and the classification results.17 A summary of the main
characteristics of these studies is available in Appendix III.

4.1. Methodologies
Neural network (NN) modelling is an intelligence technique that follows a
process similar to the human brain. As in other classification models, the parameters
of a NN model need to be estimated before the network can be used for prediction
purposes. There are numerous NN architectures, learning methods, and parameters.
17

To conserve space we keep our discussion on methodologies short. Detailed information is available
in the corresponding applications and/or devoted textbooks.

21

Generally speaking, NN architectures can be either feedback or feedforward. In a
feedback network, nodes can receive inputs from nodes in any other layer in the
network, whereas in a feedforward network inputs are only received from previous
layers. The multi-layer preceptor (MLP-NN), competitive learning neural networks
(CL-NN), self-organizing map neural networks (SOM-NN), back-propagation neural
networks (BP-NN), and probabilistic neural networks (PNN) are alternative
approaches employed in the studies under review (e.g. Chen and Shih, 2006;
Boyacioglu et al, 2008).
The approach of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), used in Boyacioglu et al.
(2008), Chen and Shih (2006) and Huang et al. (2004), was introduced by Vapnik
(1995). It is based on the Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) principle from
computational learning theory. This seeks to minimise an upper bound of the
generalisation error rather than minimise the training error. SVMs use a linear
structure to implement nonlinear class boundaries through extremely non-linear
mapping of the input vectors into the high-dimensional space. If the data are linearly
separated, SVM uses a special kind of linear model, the optimal separating
hyperplane, that provides the maximum separation between the classes. The training
points that are closest to the maximum margin hyperplane are called support vectors.
All other training examples are irrelevant for determining the binary class boundaries.
From the implementation point of view, Vapnik (1995) showed how training a SVM
and finding the parameters leads to a quadratic optimisation problem with bound
constraints and one linear equality constraint. This means that the solution of SVMs is
unique, optimal and absent from local minima (Tay and Cao, 2001).
Nearest Neighbours is a non-parametric estimation method that has been
applied in various problems in finance. The nearest neighbour rule classifies an object
(i.e. bank) to the class of its nearest neighbour in the measurement space using some
kind of distance measure like the local metrics, the global metrics, the Mahalanobis or
the Euclidean distance. The modification of the nearest neighbour rule, the k-nearest
neighbour (k-NN) method that is employed in Zhao et al. (2008), classifies an object
(i.e. bank) to the class (i.e. failed or non-failed) more heavily represented among its knearest neighbours.
In the case of decision trees that originate from machine learning, instead of
developing classification functions or network architectures, a binary decision tree is
developed. This can be accomplished through a set of if-then split conditions that lead
22

to the accurate classification of cases (e.g. banks). Commonly used algorithms are
CART (e.g. Ravi et al., 2008), and C4.5 (e.g. Zhao et al., 2008).
The UTilits Additives DIScriminantes (UTADIS) multicriteria decision aid
(MCDA) method, used in Gaganis et al. (2006), employs the framework of preference
disaggregation analysis for the development of an additive utility function that is used
to score the firms and decide upon their classification. The estimation of the additive
utility model is performed through mathematical programming techniques.
The Multi-Group Hierarchical Discrimination (MHDIS) method, used in
Pasiouras et al. (2007), is another MCDA approach that uses utility functions for
discrimination purposes. MHDIS distinguishes the groups progressively, starting by
discriminating the first group from all the others, and then proceeds to the
discrimination between the alternatives belonging to the other groups. To accomplish
this task, instead of developing a single additive utility function that describes all
alternatives (as in UTADIS), two additive utility functions are developed in each one
of the n-1 steps, where n is the number of groups. At each stage of the hierarchical
discrimination procedure, two linear, and a mixed-integer, programming problems are
solved to estimate the utility thresholds and the two additive utility functions in order
to minimise the classification error.
As discussed in Kolari et al. (2002) and Lanine and Vander Vennet (2006)
trait recognition is another non-parametric approach, under which individual traits are
initially developed from different segments of the distribution of each variable and the
interactions of these segments with one or more other variables segmented
distributions. When all possible traits of the variables are tabulated for all banks, trait
recognition uses a search routine to cull traits that do not discriminate between failed
and non-failed banks. Trait recognition uses two sets of discriminators, the safe traits
(associated with non-failed banks) and the unsafe traits (failed banks), known as
features. Then these features are used to vote on each bank and classify it as failed or
non-failed. Lanine and Vander Vennet (2006) argue that the general rule of
classifying safe and unsafe cells and assigning default probabilities works poorly
when the number of banks falling into mixed cells is high. To avoid this problem they
suggest a formula to compute the probability of default directly without preliminary
classification of cells as safe or unsafe.
Some researchers use soft computing approaches with the aim of synthesizing
the human ability to tolerate and process uncertain, imprecise and incomplete
23

information during the decision-making (Tung et al., 2004). Soft computing usually
integrates various techniques that may originate from different disciplines such as
fuzzy logic18, neural networks, machine learning, etc. in various combinations that
will allow the researcher to exploit the strengths of individual techniques (Ravi
Kumar and Ravi, 2008). A popular approach is the integration of neural network and
fuzzy sets to develop a neural fuzzy network. For example, Tung et al. (2004) propose
a Generic Self-organizing Fuzzy Neural Network (GenSoFNN) based on the
compositional rule of inference (CRI) to predict bank failure.
Multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) and logistic regression analysis (LRA)
are two traditional techniques that are commonly used as benchmarks in classification
studies (e.g. Swicegood and Clark, 2001; Pasiouras et al., 2007; Kosmidou and
Zopounidis, 2008). In contrast, Tung et al. (2004) benchmark their models against
Cox regression which estimates the dependence of the risk of failure on banks
characteristics and of the evolution of that risk over time.

4.2. Variables
In most of the cases, the variables are selected on the basis of the CAMEL model and
include measures for Capital strength, Asset quality, Earnings, and Liquidity.19 The
number of variables differs significantly among studies. Some researchers start from a
large list of variables and then use statistical screening (e.g. Kruskal-Wallis) or
dimension reduction (e.g. factor analysis) to end up with a reduced set of variables. In
addition to the financial variables, some studies include additional characteristics
related to ownership (e.g. % of shares held by the government), market information
(e.g. stock price in previous year), auditing, and country (e.g. Heritage index).

4.3. Classification results
Many of the studies in Appendix III report quite satisfactory classification accuracies,
and in several cases, the proposed O.R. and A.I. methods outperform the traditional
techniques (i.e. MDA, LRA, Cox regression). Furthermore, the studies that focus on
bankruptcy prediction, in general, perform more accurately than those that deal with
18

The theory of fuzzy sets, proposed by Zadeh (1965) provides a mathematical approach to emulate
human cognitive process. The fuzzy set theory aims to classify subjective reasoning and assign degrees
of possibilities in reaching conclusions. Fuzzy logic can also be used to obtain fuzzy if-then rules.
19
M in CAMEL refers to management quality, and it is rarely used in empirical studies due to
difficulties in assessing management quality.

24

credit ratings. However, this is not surprising for two reasons. First, while classifying
the banks in more groups is more informative, it becomes more difficult to
discriminate among groups in the intermediate categories. Second, credit ratings may
incorporate additional qualitative information and human judgment that cannot be
captured by the conventional variables used in most studies.
In any case, comparisons across different studies should be treated with
extreme caution. One reason is that different studies make different assumptions about
the prior probabilities of group membership as well as misclassification costs. A
second reason is that different studies use different approaches to validate the
developed models. For instance, some researchers simply split the total sample in
training and holdout datasets without accounting for the stability of models over time;
others use resampling techniques (e.g. k-fold cross-validation), and others use a
holdout sample from a future period. However, it should kept in mind that
classification ability is likely to overstate predictive ability. Thus, a superior approach
would require that the model be validated against a future period, as this approach
more closely reflects a real world setting.

5. Concluding remarks
We have presented a comprehensive review of applications of operational research
and artificial intelligence techniques in the assessment of bank performance, by
discussing a total of 179 studies published between 1998 and 2008. We have
classified the studies in two main categories.
The first uses DEA and the DEA-like Malmquist index to estimate the
efficiency and productivity growth of banks and bank branches. We have discussed
various methodological issues such as the estimated measures of efficiency, the
underlying assumptions of the estimated models, and the selection of inputs and
outputs. We also discussed the main topics of interest including the relationship
between ownership and efficiency, stock returns and efficiency, the determinants of
efficiency, the efficiency of bank branches, amongst others. Three of the main
conclusions are that: (i) profit efficiency and capacity efficiency have received quite
limited attention in DEA studies in banking (ii) most studies that use a two-stage DEA
do not employ appropriate bootstrapping techniques, and their results may be biased
(iii) there is much diversity among studies with respect to the selection of input and
25

outputs. As in the case banks as a whole, cost and profit efficiency has received
considerably less attention in branch efficiency studies. Furthermore, an area of
research deserving attention would be the estimation of bank branches efficiency over
successive time periods.
Studies falling into the second category, attempt to develop classification
models to predict failure, the credit ratings of banks, and identify underperformers.
We have found both country-specific and cross-country studies and applications of
techniques that originate from various disciplines. Most of the studies rely heavily on
financial information although in some cases non-financial variables are also used.
Given the differences in the approaches employed to validate the models,
comparisons of classification accuracies across studies should be treated with caution.
We find only a few studies that propose the combination of the predictions of
individual models into integrated meta-classifiers, and we believe that this is an area
of research that is worthy of further attention.

Notes: ** Classified in 2008 on the basis of doi; OTE = Overall Technical Efficiency (i.e. CRS), PTE = Pure Technical Efficiency (i.e. VRS), SE = Scale Efficiency, AE=
Allocative Efficiency, CE = Cost Efficiency, APE = Alternative Profit Efficiency, SPE = Standard Profit Efficiency, Productivity = Various Productivity Growth Measures, SRCE =
Short-run cost efficiency, LRCE = Long-run cost efficiency; CAPE = Capacity efficiency, PCU = Physical capacity utilization, RECU = Ray economic capacity utilization, OCI =
Optimal capacity idleness, IP = Performance index of PTE (result of private negotiations among stakeholders), AE* = A proxy of Allocative Efficiency (calculated without including
input prices), IPR = Index of Efficiency with preferences revealed by the legislator (IPR = AE* x IP), COMPE = Composition efficiency, ISPE = Intra-specialization efficiency,
OCE = Operating cost efficiency, ICE = Interest cost efficiency, OTE-QFI = OTE in the presence of quasi-fixed inputs, SZE = Size efficiency, PTE* & OTE* = these studies report
measures which they label as P-efficiency or cost efficiency simply on the basis of some inputs/outputs that they use but they do not include inputs/output price inputs so in a sense
they present measures of technical efficiency.
