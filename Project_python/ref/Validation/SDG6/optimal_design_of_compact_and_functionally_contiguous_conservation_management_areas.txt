Compactness and landscape connectivity are essential properties for effective functioning of conservation
reserves. In this article we introduce a linear integer programming model to determine optimal conguration
of a conservation reserve with such properties. Connectivity can be dened either as structural (physical)
connectivity or functional connectivity; the model developed here addresses both properties. We apply the
model to identify the optimal conservation management areas for protection of Gopher Tortoise (GT) in a
military installation, Ft. Benning, Georgia, which serves as a safe refuge for this at risk species. The recent
expansion in the military mission of the installation increases the pressure on scarce GT habitat areas, which
requires moving some of the existent populations in those areas to suitably chosen new conservation management areas within the boundaries of the installation. Using the model, we nd the most suitable and
spatially coherent management areas outside the heavily used training areas.

1. Introduction
In many parts of the world conservation reserves are established
to protect critical habitat areas from agricultural/urban development
and managed to maintain or enhance species survival chances. Due
to the scarcity of nancial resources, determination of the optimal
amount and location of those areas is an important issue. Typically,
this is done by dividing the landscape into discrete land units (sites)
and selecting an optimal subset of them assuming that each site provides measurable habitat services to the targeted species. This problem is often stated as minimization of the cost of selected sites while
meeting the conservation goals (e.g., minimum occurrence of each
species in selected sites), or maximization of a conservation objective (e.g. number of species protected) subject to the available resource constraints (Moilanen, Wilson, and Possingham 2009). These
problems were addressed initially by using heuristic approaches (e.g.,
Pressey, Humphries, Margules, Vane-Wright, & Williams, 1993, 1997).
Later, they were formulated as linear mixed-integer programs (MIP)
in the framework of the set covering problem (SCP) and maximal cov

ering problem (MCP) (Camm, Polasky, Solow, & Csuti, 1996; Church &
ReVelle, 1974; Church et al. 1996; Cocks & Baird, 1989; Kirkpatrick,
1983; Polasky, Camm, & Garber-Yonts, 2001; Possingham, Ball, & Andelman, 2000; Toregas & ReVelle, 1973; Underhill, 1994; Williams &
ReVelle, 1997). Although the optimal solutions of these MIP formulations are economically ecient, they usually lack spatial coherence.
This may limit the chances of inter-site dispersal and long-term survival of species within the conservation reserve areas. Also, managing
a spatially coherent reserve network is more convenient and ecient
than managing many sites scattered over a large area. Therefore, additional mechanisms need to be introduced in the SCP and MCP formulations to take spatial properties into account when determining
the optimal site selection.
Spatial criteria in reserve site selection may take a variety of
forms (Haight & Snyder, 2009; Williams, ReVelle, & Levin, 2005).
Most commonly used criteria include compactness (Fischer & Church,
2003; Jafari & Hearne, 2013; nal and Briers, 2003; Tth & McDill
2008; Wright, ReVelle, & Cohon, 1983), proximity of selected sites
(Briers 2002; Dissanayake, nal, Westervelt, & Balbach, 2012; Miller,
Snyder, Skibbe, & Haight, 2009; Nalle, Arthur, Montgomery, &
Sessions, 2002; nal and Briers, 2002; Rothley, 1999; Snyder, Miller,
Skibbe, & Haight, 2007; Williams, 2008), habitat fragmentation
(nal & Briers, 2005; nal & Wang, 2008), contiguity (Cerdeira &
Pinto, 2005; Cerdeira et al., 2005, 2010; Cova & Church, 2000; Duque

2008; nal & Briers, 2006; Tth et al., 2009; Wang & nal, 2011,
2013; Williams, 2001; Carvajal et al., 2013), existence of buffers
and corridors (Conrad, Gomes, van Hoeve, Sabharwal, & Suter, 2012;
Williams, 1998; Williams & ReVelle, 1996, 1998; Williams & Snyder, 2005), and accessibility (nal & Yanprechaset, 2007; Ruliffson,
Haight, Gobster, & Homans, 2003). Incorporating these criteria in
optimum site selection requires more sophisticated and computationally complex mathematical models than the SCP and MCP formulations. Consideration of multiple attributes together increases
this challenge further. This article presents a linear integer programming model to incorporate compactness and connectivity criteria
simultaneously.
Connectivity is an important factor for ecient functioning of
conservation reserves. A well-connected reserve network1 allows the
species to utilize all the resources available in the reserve and increases the likelihood of species survival and ability to colonize suitable habitat areas. This depends not only on the habitat characteristics of an individual reserve site, but also on the characteristics of the
neighboring reserve sites (Van Teeffelen et al., 2006). Connectivity is
approached in different ways. Metapopulation connectivity deals with
spatially separated but interacting local populations in the reserve
network (Hanski, 1999; Moilanen & Hanski, 1998; Moilanen & Hanski
2001). Landscape connectivity, on the other hand, deals with the degree to which the landscape facilitates movement of species within
reserves. Landscape connectivity can be achieved either by structural
connectivity (or physical contiguity) that allows species to dwell in
the reserve without having to get out of the protected area, or functional connectivity which deals with the degree to which a reserve facilitates species capability to move within the reserve (Bunn, Urban,
& Keitt, 2000; Taylor, Fahrig, & With, 2006; Taylor, Fahrig, Henein,
& Merriam, 1993; Tischendorf & Fahrig, 2000; Urban & Keitt 2001).
A structurally connected reserve may not necessarily be functionally
connected if physical characteristics of some sites impede movement
within or between the reserved areas (e.g. presence of steep rocky
terrains or water bodies, lack of sucient vegetation or forest cover).
Although the importance of functional connectivity has been widely
acknowledged, a generally agreed upon operational denition of the
concept is not yet available (Blisle, 2005; Kadoya, 2009). Incorporating these two connectivity criteria in site selection may lead to dramatically different congurations. For instance, minimization of the
reserve size along with the physical contiguity requirement may lead
to an elongated, narrow and winding reserve conguration containing the best available but spatially dispersed sites (see, for instance,
Cerdeira, Gaston, & Pinto, 2005; nal & Briers, 2006; Williams & Snyder, 2005 ). This would increase the likelihood of species exposure to
unfavorable conditions within and outside the reserve area and may
not work effectively if the individuals tend to roam around or move in
random directions. A contiguous reserve conguration may include
poor quality sites just to obtain physical connections (bridges) between good habitats. Such a reserve would not be functionally connected if the targeted species do not have the capability to cross those
bridging sites. Therefore, in essence the reserve would consist of multiple functionally detached sub-reserves some of which may not be
large enough to provide adequate habitat services for a minimum
viable population of the target species. On the other hand, a functionally connected reserve may not be structurally connected if the
species (e.g. birds, butteries) can crossover between closest, but not
necessarily adjacent areas in the reserve. In many cases a network of
multiple connected reserves is a preferred conguration than a single large connected reserve to safeguard against catastrophic events

Throughout the paper we use the term reserve for a collection of sites that work
together to serve a viable population of one or more targeted species. A reserve network consists of multiple reserves that collectively serve a suciently large total population of each targeted species.

such as re, diseases, etc.2 In this article we address these issues and
present a linear integer programming model to determine an optimal
compact and connected reserve network conguration where connectivity can be enforced in the form of structural connectivity and/or
functional connectivity. We apply this approach to the protection of
a ground-bound species where compactness, structural connectivity,
and functional connectivity must be enforced together.
2. Problem description
Many rare, threatened, and endangered species in the U.S. are
found within the boundaries or in the vicinity of military installations (Flather, Joyce, & Bloomgarden, 1994; Flather, Knowles, &
Kendall, 1998; Stein, Scott, & Benton, 2008).3 The Department of
Defense (DoD) allocates a signicant amount of capital, human resources and land for conservation efforts toward protecting and managing wildlife habitat in and around military installations.4 Ft. Benning, Georgia, is one of those installations where several endangered,
threatened, and at-risk species are under protection. In this article
we consider a particular keystone species, Gopher Tortoise (Gopherus
polyphemus), which has an at risk status and currently has an extensive population in Ft. Benning. The installation is currently undergoing an expansion of its military mission that requires converting
more lands into military training areas. Therefore, managing those
lands in the best possible way as an alternative to costly arrangements, such as purchasing additional land or acquisition of property
rights for lands around the installation, is an important issue. The
land managers plan to identify lands outside of the current and future
military training areas for maintaining sustainable GT populations
(including the relocated populations and populations that might be
brought from outside the installation). These areas, called Conservation Management Areas (CMA), will be used less for military training
purposes or assigned to appropriate training exercises to the extent
possible. Since GT is a ground-bound species, a selected CMA should
be as compact as possible and connected both structurally and functionally in order to facilitate movement of GTs in those areas. In addition, if multiple CMAs are to be congured, each CMA must be large
enough to sustain a minimum viable GT population in it. We note that
interaction of the protected GT populations in different CMAs is not
an issue, which means that two CMAs can be located at distant parts
of the installation. Thus, connectivity (both structural and functional)
is required at local (landscape) level, not at the entire CMA network
level.
3. The model
To address the issues described above we rst partition the area
considered for development of a conservation reserve5 into disjoint
spatial units (e.g., a uniform square grid cover6 ). Each spatial unit
(site) is either selected and becomes part of a reserve in the network or is left out. When selecting sites the spatial locations of indi2

For the merits of establishing multiple reserves see Zhou and Wang (2006).
Although the total amount of land controlled by the DoD is only 3.4 percent of
the federally administered lands, 26 percent of the threatened and endangered species
occurs on the military lands (Flather et al., 1994).
4
In 2006, for instance, the DoD spent $4.1 billion on environment related expenses
of which $1.4 billion was for environment restoration and $204.1 million was for conservation (Benton et al., 2008). The DoD also implements various management policies
on military lands including protection of endangered, threatened and at-risk species
(Diersing et al., 1992; DoD (2011, p.12).
5
Here we use the term reserve to refer to the protected areas in general. In the
empirical application we use the term CMA instead of reserve because the military
does not really view these areas as reserves; the conservation objectives are always
secondary and subject to the military objectives.
6
The cover may consist of triangles, rectangles, polygons, or irregular shapes. Thus,
the square grid assumption is not restrictive. Throughout the paper we will use the
terms cell and site interchangeably.

vidual sites relative to other selected sites and their contributions to
the conservation objectives are both taken into account. For reasons
that will be explained later, we represent each reserve by a central
site to which other selected sites are assigned. Both the central site
and assignment of sites to the center are determined by the model
simultaneously.
The algebraic notation used in the model is as follows: n  1 denotes the number of reserves in the network. L is the set of all sites
where individual sites are denoted by symbols i, j, k  L. Site selection and assignment to a reserve is represented by a binary variable
Xki , where Xki = 1if site i is selected and belongs to the reserve centered at site k and Xki = 0 otherwise. If Xkk = 1, then site k is selected
as a central site to form a reserve around it. The symbol dki denotes
the distance between the centroids of sites k and i, and hi denotes the
habitat quality of site i. Each reserve is required to provide a minimum amount of habitat quality, denoted by vh, in order to support
a viable population of the targeted species. Finally, the total habitat
quality provided by all reserves must exceed a specied level denoted
by th.
3.1. Modeling compactness
Compactness is considered as a measure of shape simplicity and
equated to near circular or square shapes. Although the concept may
seem obvious, there is no universally agreed upon denition of compactness in the spatial analysis literature (see Young, 1988, for various
denitions and why none is fully satisfactory). In the present analysis
we use the total distance between all sites that form a reserve and
the central site of the reserve as a measure of compactness. If the total distance associated with a reserve is smaller than that of another
reserve of the same size, the former is considered as more compact.
Thus, to congure a compact reserve, the model selects an optimal
central site and assigns sites to the center in such a way that the total distance between the assigned sites and the central site is minimized. This approach promotes circular reserve congurations. If a
reserve network including multiple compact reserves is to be congured the compactness measures of individual reserves are summed
across all reserves and the sum is optimized. This is an instance of
the p-median problem (Christodes, 1975). An algebraic representation of the model is given below.

The objective function (1) is the sum of distances from individual

In (2), the number of reserves is specied exogenously. Alternatively, we may state
constraint (2) as a  type inequality, specify n as a reasonably large integer, and let the

(3) states that each site can belong to at most one reserve. Constraint
(4) implies that if site k is selected as a central site, i.e., Xkk = 1, then
up to m sites can be assigned to the reserve formed around site k,
where m is an arbitrarily selected large integer. Otherwise, Xkk = 0
and no site can be assigned to it, i.e. Xki = 0 for all i. Conversely, if site
i is selected and assigned to a central site k, i.e. Xki = 1, then a reserve
must be formed around (centered at) site k, i.e. Xkk = 1.8 Constraint
(5) requires that each reserve provides the minimum habitat quality
required from individual reserves, while constraint (6) ensures that
all reserves collectively provide the desired aggregate level of habitat
quality.
3.2. Modeling connectivity
In the landscape ecology literature a distinction has been made
between structural connectivity and functional connectivity (Bunn
et al., 2000; Tischendorf & Fahrig, 2000). Structural connectivity
refers to the spatial arrangement of sites in a reserve and can be
achieved if the closest sites in the reserve are within a specied
threshold crossable distance d  0 from each other. This property is
often stated as physical contiguity where the closest sites are adjacent (d = 0). In this case any two spatial units in the protected
area are connected through a path of mutually adjacent spatial units.
Functional connectivity reects the degree to which the connecting sites that make up those paths are traversable by the targeted
species. Therefore, reserving an inhospitable site between two goodquality sites may satisfy the spatial contiguity requirement, but if that
site cannot be crossed easily by the targeted species, the path would
not actually serve as a functional connection. On the other hand, a
chain of disconnected sites in a reserve may allow the movement of
targeted species through those sites where the nearest sites can be
used as stepping stones for crossing inhospitable areas (Williams &
Snyder, 2005). Such a reserve would be functionally connected although it is not structurally connected (contiguous). Therefore, the
two forms of connectivity may not always imply each other and may
lead to dramatically different reserve congurations. Here, we consider both physical contiguity and functional connectivity as desirable reserve attributes.
In general, the model described by (1)(7) results in spatially contiguous reserve selections, but this is not always guaranteed. The
optimal solution may exhibit a fragmented reserve if a set of highquality sites detached from all other selected sites makes sucient
contribution to the habitat quality at a lower cost or the total distance of those sites from the center is less than the summed distances
of multiple alternative sites all attached to the rest of the reserve.
Therefore, an additional explicit mechanism needs to be introduced
to ensure spatial contiguity. This is done by adding the following constraint to the model:

Xk j 



Xki

for all k, j that are not adjacent

(8)

iN j ,
dki <dk j

where N j denotes the set of immediate neighbors of site j. Constraint
(8) implies that if a reserve is congured around site k and site j belongs to that reserve, thus Xk j = 1, at least one of the neighbors of
site j that is closer to site k must be selected and belong to the same
reserve, i.e. Xki = 1 for some i. By applying the same argument to the
latter site and repeating this procedure iteratively until reaching site
k, one can generate a chain of mutually adjacent sites, i.e. a path, all
contained in that reserve (see Fig. 1 for a graphical illustration). Thus,
every selected site is spatially connected to the central site k. Furthermore, for any pair of sites j and i in the same reserve there is a path
8
An equivalent formulation of constraint (4) is Xki  Xkk for all i, k. Although this
formulation implies a substantially larger number of constraints, our computational
experience shows that it performs better than the one given in (4). We cannot generalize this, however, due to the limited computational evidence.

Fig. 1. An illustration of the workings of constraint (8). Cell C is a central site, the horizontal striped cells are the cells that are selected and assigned to C. In (1a) and (1b), the cross
diagonal (light-shaded) cells are the neighbors of the last selected site that are closer to C (in terms of linear distances) and eligible for selection. A connecting path is shown in 1c.
In 1d, the dot-bordered cells are excluded in site selection due to the lack of suitable habitat. Cell X cannot be assigned to a reserve centered at C since there is no eligible adjacent
cell that is closer to C. Dening the distance as the length of the shortest eligible path allows assigning X to C through the horizontal striped cells.

that connects the two sites, namely the union of the paths connecting
those sites to the common center. Therefore, constraint (8) ensures
that each reserve is spatially connected.9
The strategy employed in the contiguity constraint (8) was introduced earlier by Zoltners and Sinha (1983) in the context of
a sales territory alignment problem with known distribution centers (roots) and later by Cova and Church (2000) when determining a contiguous region around a given central unit. This problem
is termed as the rooted regionalization problem. Duque, Church, and
Middleton (2011) present alternative linear integer programming formulations to congure a specied number of spatially contiguous regions around given centers while minimizing heterogeneity within
each region. They formulate the objective function as minimization
of the sum of spatial dissimilarity. If the dissimilarity is measured
in terms of distances to the roots, as in (1), their models promote
clustering (compactness) as well. The model presented by Cova and
Church (2000) includes additional variables and constraints to minimize the reserve boundary. A smaller boundary size is an indicator of
higher compactness.The problem we address here is the unrooted version of the problem described above where the centers are not available beforehand. Rather, they are determined by the model together
with the assignment of sites to the selected centers. This problem was
addressed by employing graph theoretic concepts in mixed integer
programming (Cerdeira et al. 2005; Shirabe, 2005; Williams, 2001;
and nal & Briers, 2006). In this approach a graph is overlaid on the
region where each site corresponds to a node and a directed arc is dened for each pair of adjacent nodes (sites). The selected sites correspond to a sub-graph where one of the nodes serves as a sink to which
each node is connected through a set of mutually adjacent nodes and
arcs between them (thus forming a tree). The problem is then stated
as determining a minimal tree that satises specied regionalization
targets. Contiguity is ensured by eliminating the possibility of cycle
(or sub-tour) formation in the sub-graph when selecting nodes and
arcs. The sub-tour elimination problem is not a straight forward matter, however, because a large number of cycle-breaking constraints
is needed even in problems with moderately large number of nodes
(Miller, Tucker, & Zemlin, 1960). Shirabe (2005) and nal and Briers
(2006) introduced ow-based graph theoretic models, formulated as
MIPs, for the contiguous regionalization and conservation reserve design problems. None of these studies incorporated compactness as
an explicit criterion, however. Duque et al. (2011) presented a similar
graph theoretic formulation coupled with the p-region formulation

9

Constraint (8) can be modied to allow tolerable discontinuities by dening N j =

where the dissimilarity of the areas within each region is minimized.
If dissimilarity is measured by pairwise distances, the model solves
the unrooted and compact regionalization problem. More recently,
Jafari and Hearne (2013) presented a graph theoretic transshipment
model where the ow of capital through the network is optimized.
In the model budget ows from an initial source node to one of the
nodes or between adjacent nodes, where the demand at a node is
met when the corresponding site is selected and the purchase cost
is paid (thus determining the capital outow). The model considers
ows only between adjacent nodes and the outows decrease monotonically, therefore reserve contiguity is ensured automatically. Jafari
and Hearne also introduce a variant of their model to promote compactness of the reserve by minimizing the perimeter of the selected
sites excluding the shared boundaries. For this, additional constraints
are introduced and the objective function is stated as a weighted sum
of the utility from conservation and perimeter of the selected area.
The graph-theoretic formulations employing cycle-breaking constraints lead to large and computationally dicult MIP models. The
computational disadvantage is exacerbated and can be fatal particularly when multiple reserves are to be congured from a large number of sites.10 In the next section we test and compare the computational eciency of the model described by (1)(8) vis--vis the above
graph theoretic models using various randomly generated data sets.
In the model (1)(8) Euclidean or other simple distance measures
may work well in most practical applications. However, there may be
instances where constraint (8) is not satised and an otherwise favorable site may not be part of a feasible solution. An illustrative example
is given in Fig. 1d where the horizontal striped sites are allowed for
selection while the diagonal striped sites are ineligible due to lack
of habitat. Suppose the distance between a pair of sites is dened as
the sum of center-to-center distances traveled through the minimum
number of sites that connect those sites disregarding the eligibility
of the intermediate sites. Constraint (8) would not allow selection of
the site labeled with X because it has no immediate neighbor that is
closer to the central site labeled with C. To overcome this anomaly we
dene the distance between any two sites as the length of the shortest path formed by eligible sites only. According to this denition the
distance between X and C is 6 (the minimal path is comprised by the
horizontal striped sites). Since the distance between C and the site
just below X is 5, constraint (8) becomes feasible and selection of X is
now allowed.
When functional connectivity is of concern, the degree to which a
connecting path facilitates or impedes movement of species would
depend not only on the distance but also on the habitat quality
of the individual sites in that path. This is not taken into account

{i : di j  d}, where d > 0 denotes the maximum crossable distance. The solution may
now include sites that serve as stepping stones instead of fully contiguous paths.
Also, functional distances can be used instead of ordinary distances when dening the
neighborhood N j in (8).

10
For example, Duque et al. (2011) report that problems containing up to 49 units and
10 regions could not be solved to optimality within three hours of processing time.

H. nal et al. / European Journal of Operational Research 251 (2016) 957968

in constraint (8). Therefore, an optimal solution may include some
sites with poor habitat quality just because their selection provides
bridges to physically connect high-quality habitat patches. Instead, a
longer path formed by sites with moderately good habitat may be
a preferred alternative if this offers a more convenient movement
across the protected areas. This leads to the concept of functional distance (or habitat-adjusted distance), di j , dened by:



di j =

di j /[0.5(hi + h j )], if hi , h j > l
m otherwise



(9)

where i and j are adjacent sites (have a common edge), l is a threshold
habitat level required by the species to dwell in or cross those sites,
and m>0 is an arbitrarily selected large number. All other symbols
are as dened earlier. The functional distance between any two sites
(not necessarily adjacent) is then dened as the length of the shortest
path with respect to functional distances between mutually adjacent
sites in that path. When both hi and h j are larger than the threshold
habitat level l, the denominator term represents the average habitat level of sites i and j. Therefore, the value of di j is small (large) if
both sites have good (poor) habitat. If one of the two sites has less
than the threshold habitat level, then di j becomes very large (namely
equal to m). This would drive out such pairs of sites when identifying the best functional connections (routes), which is consistent with
the movement behavior of species that do not generally venture into
poor quality areas.11
The functional distance and shortest path approach described
above is similar to the least-cost path method used in spatial analysis where the purpose is to nd a path which links a given origin and
destination and minimizes the transportation cost between them. If
we interpret the inverse of the average habitat quality used in (9) as
the travel cost of moving from site i to site j, the model incorporating di j in the objective function determines the least-cost network
including multiple origins and destinations and the least-cost paths
between them to minimize the total cost associated with the entire
network. In the ecological context, di j can be considered as a measure of movement resistance, thus minimizing the objective function (1) expressed in this distance measure determines the optimal
habitat areas to facilitate movement of species within those areas to
the extent possible.12 The concept of movement resistance measured
by the total travel cost has been discussed extensively in the ecology literature (Adriaensen et al., 2003; Pinto & Keitt, 2009; see Zeller,
McGarigal, & Whiteley, 2012, for a review). The least-cost path length
is considered as a good operational measure of functional connectivity (Blisle, 2005).
To explain the concept of habitat-adjusted distances and functional connectivity, consider the example given in Fig. 2 which shows
a section of a potential conservation area from which a reserve is
to be congured. Suppose cell 3c is a highly favorable site, and cell
1a is the central site of the reserve. There are several paths connecting 3c to 1a, namely P1={1a,1b,1c,2c,3c}, P2={1a,1b,2b,2c,3c},
P3={1a,1b,2b,3b,3c}, P4={1a,2a,2b,2c,3c}, P5={1a,2a,2b,3b,3c}, and
P6={1a,2a,3a,3b,3c}. Suppose the distance between all adjacent sites
is 1.0. Therefore, all six paths have the same length, namely 4. The total habitat qualities associated with the six paths (sum of the habitat
qualities of the selected sites, denoted by TH in the gure) are 10.0,
11
Alternatively, the below-threshold habitat sites can be excluded during model generation. However, in some cases the large-m formulation may be useful. It allows including some non-traversable sites in the optimal solution if their inclusion connects
high quality habitat patches. This may provide valuable information to conservation
managers in terms of habitat restoration.
12
Using Euclidean distances in the objective function promotes circular reserve
shapes, but this may leave out some functionally well-connected sites. On the other
hand, using functional distances promotes the selection of well-connected sites, but
this may compromise compactness and lead to skewed/stretched shapes instead of
circular congurations. Etherington and Holland (2013) argue that least-cost paths explain species movement patterns better and should be preferred to shortest paths.

9.1, 8.2, 11.6, 10.7, and 11.1, respectively. Therefore, if we consider plain
distances only, path P4 is the most preferred spatially connected selection since it has the highest total habitat quality (followed by P6
which has the second highest TH). However, when functional distances are of concern, the optimal selection becomes quite different.
Using (9), the habitat-adjusted lengths of P1-P6 are calculated as 2.74,
4.00, 12.26, 3.00, 11.26 and 4.55, respectively (denoted by HAD in the
gure). In this case, P1 would be the preferred selection because of
the improved functional connectivity. The second best path, P6, provides more habitat quality than P1, but its functional connectivity is
worse compared to that of P1 (4.55 versus 2.74). This is because of
the inclusion of poor sites in P4 and P6 (cells 2b and 3b, respectively).
Note that the order of sites in a given path affects the functional connectivity although the total habitat value remains the same. For instance, presence of two side by side poor habitats may reduce functional connectivity substantially, as in the case of P3 and P5. The latter path is particularly noteworthy. Although its total habitat value is
signicantly higher than that of P1, the functional connectivity of P5
is four times less because of the presence of two poor adjacent sites
(namely cells 2b and 3b).
When working with functional distances, constraint (8) can be
used in a similar way to using ordinary distances, i.e. if a site is to be
selected a neighboring site that has a shorter functional distance to
the central site must also be selected. However, unlike the ordinary
distances, functional distances may restrict the eligibility of neighbors in site selection. Fig. 2 displays an example. Since the functional
distance between 3c and 1a is 2.74, one of the neighbors of 3c that has
a smaller functional distance to 1a must also be selected. The functional distance between 2c and 1a is 2.37 (minimum of the lengths
of paths {1a,1b,1c,2c}, {1a,1b,2b,2c} and {1a,2a,2b,2c}), therefore 2c
meets this requirement and can be included in a connecting path.
The other neighbor 3b is ineligible, however, because its functional
distance to 1a is 4.11 (minimum of the lengths of paths {1a,1b,2b,3b},
{1a,2a,2b,3b} and {1a,2a,3a,3b}), which is greater than the functional
distance of 3c. This rules out the possibility of connecting 3c to 1a
through 3b. Once 2c is selected, both of its neighbors (1c and 2b)
are eligible for selection because their functional distances to 1a (1.37
and 0.82, respectively) are less than the distance of 2c. Selecting 2b
adds a larger habitat adjusted distance than selecting 1c, however, because of the larger habitat adjusted distance between 2b and 2c. Once
1c is selected, 1b is the only choice, completing the shortest path P1.
Note that the selection of P1 does not preclude the selection of 2a,
which is a habitat rich site. If more habitat is needed after selecting
the entire path P1, 2a may be selected and connected to 1a to acquire
more quality habitat. This generates another connecting path from a
selected site to the central site.
We note two important characteristics of the optimal solutions
obtained from the model with the use of habitat adjusted distances.
First, the optimal reserve conguration is always structurally contiguous. This is because constraint (8) enforces the selection of an immediately adjacent neighbor when selecting a reserve site. Second, selection of a particular site does not necessarily require selection of
the entire shortest path connecting that site to the associated central
site. Although this would happen in most cases, there is no explicit
mechanism in the model that enforces this property.
To investigate the merits of the approaches described above in
terms of compactness and functional contiguity of the resulting reserve conguration, we generated several synthetic data sets and
solved the model. Fig. 3 displays the results of one of those runs
where two compact and connected reserves are generated. The optimal conguration considering linear distances is depicted in Fig. 3a
while Fig. 3b shows the solution considering the habitat-adjusted distances. Although both reserves in Fig. 3a are structurally connected,
neither of them is functionally connected since they have two and
one gap sites, respectively (the diagonal-striped cells). These gap sites
are needed to pack a few habitat-rich isolated sites (such as the

of the selected areas (shaded), and HAD is the habitat-adjusted distance of the associated path between cells 3c and 1a. Due to their low habitat quality values, selection of the
dot-bordered cells (2b and 3b) reduces functional connectivity of 1a and 3c.

the leftmost site with 4.5 units of habitat in the lower reserve) and
connect them to the remaining sites in each reserve. Fig. 3b displays
two reserve congurations obtained with the same data but using the
habitat adjusted distances instead of ordinary distances. In this case,
the two reserves are both structurally and functionally connected.
Note that this occurs at the expense of increased reserve size (24 sites
versus 22 sites)

formulation presented above may be an issue in large-scale reserve
selection models. In this section, we test the computational eciency
of our formulation against two alternative contiguity and compactness formulations presented by Duque et al. (2011) and Jafari and
Hearne (2013). In the comparisons, we use only the third formulation of Duque et al. because they report that it is their most ecient
model.13 The test problems involved grid partitions containing 25
1600 cells (sites). To eliminate possible bias due to the input data,
the three models were solved using 50 randomly generated data sets,

4. Computational eciency
In general, discrete optimization models are dicult to solve,
even in the linear MIP case, when a large number of constraints and
discrete variables is involved. Therefore, the usefulness of the MIP

That formulation could solve 50 percent of the test problems under two hours of
processing time, while the other two models solved only 30 percent and 40 percent.
The JafariHearne model does not incorporate site quality, therefore we considered
only spatial contiguity when testing our model against JafariHearne.

each having a different species distribution across the sites and obtained with the same specications of parameters n, vh and th. The
processing time limit for each run was specied as one hour and the
solver was terminated after completing 50 runs or after running for
two hours (whichever occurs rst). We use the problems that are
solved successfully by each model and report the average solution
times of the completed runs as indicators of the models computational performance. The test runs were carried out using GUROBI 5.0
on an Intel Pentium computer with a CPU of 2.80 gigahertz and 8 gigabyte RAM.
The model statistics are displayed in Table 1. The number of equations in the Duque et al. model increases almost proportionally with
the number of reserves to be congured (due to the inclusion of the
reserve index in the variable and constraint denitions). In contrast,
the size of the model (1)(8) remains the same regardless of the number of reserves in the network. Although our model is larger than the
Duque et al. model for the cases including less than three reserves, the
situation is reversed when four or more reserves are to be congured.
A more important point is the size of the actual MIP model solved by
GUROBI after performing a preliminary heuristic procedure, Presolve,
which eliminates redundant rows and columns. Our model benets
substantially from Presolve whereas the Duque et al. model is almost
unaffected. As seen in the table, the reduced size of our model is always smaller than the size of the Duque et al. model in terms of both
rows and columns if more than one reserve is to be congured (except one case, with 25 sites and k=2).

Table 2 reports the computational performance of the three models. The rst observation is that the model presented here could
solve many more test problems than the alternative formulations.
The Duque et al. model performed poorly and could solve only the
smallest test problems including 25 sites. This is consistent with their
computational experience using CPLEX. The JafariHearne model performed well only in the test problems including up to 100 sites
and failed to solve most of the problems including 400 sites within
the processing time limit. None of the problems including 900 or
more sites could be solved to optimality by the Duque et al. and
JafariHearne models, whereas our model could solve all of the problems with 900 sites (each within two minutes) and most of the
problems including 1600 sites. The second observation is the substantial reduction in solution times particularly when a large number of sites is considered. For the 400-site case (the largest problem that could be solved by the JafariHearne model), our model
was nearly thirty times faster and could solve all of the test problems under one minute whereas the JafariHearne model took more
than 15 minutes (on average). Model size is not the only factor
that determines computational eciency of MIP models. In many
cases the model structure can be equally important. Although the
JafariHearne model is always smaller than our model (even after Presolve), our computational experience with randomly generated data sets shows that the JafariHarne model is computationally
less ecient. This can be attributed to the structure of the p-median
formulation.

Fig. 4. Locations of the current (a) and planned (b) training areas, known GT burrows (c), and suitable habitat areas (d) (the darker the shade the higher the suitability).

In the test runs with our model, all possible pairs were considered
when dening the Xki variables. The model sizes and solution times
could be reduced substantially by eliminating distant pairs of sites
during model generation without affecting the optimality of numerical solutions obtained after pruning (due to the compactness consideration, a site would not belong to a reserve centered at a faraway
site). This is another important computational advantage of the pmedian formulation, which we have not exploited in the test runs.
The graph-theoretic formulations are not suitable for such pruning.
5. An empirical application
We present an empirical application of the model described by
(1)(8), with and without incorporation of the habitat-adjusted distances given by (9), to select the best conservation management areas
(CMA) for a keystone species, the Gopher Tortoise (GT), in Ft. Benning, Georgia. Over the past decades, the GT population in several
southeastern states declined substantially (estimated as 80 percent)
due to the loss of suitable habitats resulting from agricultural and urban development (BenDor, Westervelt, Aurambout, & Meyer, 2009).
Ft. Benning manages a signicant amount of GT habitat areas within
the boundaries of the installation. Currently, the installation is undergoing an expansion of its training mission, which requires using some
of those lands more intensively for military training. The purpose of
the analysis here is to determine the most suitable habitat areas that
would support a targeted GT population without sacricing the military training objectives. We address the problem as conguring a desired number (n) of compact and connected CMAs, each providing a
minimum habitat suitability index (vh) while collectively providing
the targeted total habitat suitability (th). Fig. 4 displays the nature of
the problem. The current and planned intensive military training areas, shown in Fig. 4a and b, contain a large number of GT burrows,
shown in Fig. 4c. The new CMAs will be selected from among the
suitable areas, shown by the shaded cells in Fig. 4d, which are also
outside the training areas.
The current and future military training areas were obtained as
raster les from Ft. Benning. The habitat areas suitable for GT were
obtained as raster les from the national biological information infrastructure (Elliott, Anderson, Bumback, Schmidt, & Kramer, 2003).
The two raster les were converted to ESRI shape les using ARC GIS
9.2. A 60  60 grid le, where each grid was 600 m  600 m, was created using GEODA and the grid shape le was spatially joined with
the above shape les using spatial join tool in ARC GIS. Based on the
carrying capacity of each cell (derived from the habitat suitability index) and the existing number of observed GT burrows in that cell,
the number of additional GTs that can be placed in each cell is calculated (hi in constraints 5 and 6). Finally, the shortest paths and distances between pairs of sites are generated using Dijkstras algorithm
(Dijkstra, 1959).
The management of the GT populations within the installation
can be conducted using a single large reserve or multiple smaller reserves. The reasons for considering multiple reserves are three-fold.

First, dividing the total GT population into smaller populations, each
to be located in a different part of the installation, may safeguard
each of them against potential diseases that may occur in other protected areas. Second, the habitat density in the southeast and northeast of the installation (see Fig. 4) suggests having at least two separate CMAs, one in each of those areas. Otherwise, either the single CMA would stretch over a large area and compactness would be
compromised or some most suitable habitat areas would be left out.
Third, conguring multiple CMAs allows more exibility for the military when further expansion of training areas is needed in future. A
single large CMA would limit the choices for placing a large chunk of
military training area without sacricing part of the large CMA. In the
results presented below the model is solved for one and two reserves,
namely n=1 and n=2, for a minimum habitat suitability index of 6000
for each CMA and the aggregate habitat suitability index ranging between10,000 and 20,000. When a single CMA is congured the target habitat suitability index was varied in the range of 800012,000.
For computational convenience we limited the maximum radius of
each cluster to 10 cells by excluding the site pairs that are more than
10 cells apart when dening the Xki variables.
6. Results and discussion
We rst found the optimum spatially unrestricted selection of GT
habitat sites, namely the minimum number of sites that collectively
provide 20,000 units of habitat suitability.14 This solution is displayed
in Fig. 5a. As expected and stated at the outset, this selection includes
a highly scattered subset of sites which have highest habitat suitability. Clearly this selection is not a meaningful CMA conguration since
it would not allow movement of GTs from one protected site to another without traversing long distances between them through unsuitable or unprotected areas. Fig. 5b and c shows the selection of one
and two CMAs, respectively, with maximum overall compactness (but
ignoring contiguity). Although these solutions include tightly clustered habitat patches and display a spatially improved conguration
compared to the selection in Fig. 5a, they are still not satisfactory congurations because of the serious fragmentation (some of the habitat
patches include single cells only).
Imposing constraint (8) establishes spatial connectivity, as shown
in Fig. 6ad. The largest single contiguous CMA (obtained with parameters n=1, th=12,000) would be located in the southeast section of the installation where there are many moderately good sites
(Fig. 6a). A functionally connected CMA with the same parameter
specications is also located in the same area (Fig. 6b). These reserves are substantially larger than both the spatially unconstrained
case (specically including 83 and 82 sites, as opposed to 39 sites;
compare rows C1 and D1 against row A1 in Table 3) and the compact
but not connected reserve conguration (comprised by 54 sites, row

vh = 6000).

B1 in Table 3). These ndings highlight the trade-off between ecological and economic considerations in conservation site selection.
When two separate reserves are to be congured, each connected in
itself and supporting a minimum viable GT population while together
meeting the overall conservation target, the model selects one of the
reserves again in the southeast section and the other in the northeast section of the installation. Fig. 6c and d displays those reserves
obtained with the parameter specications n = 2, th = 20,000, and
vh = 6000. Although these reserves have similar habitat characteristics, the total number of selected sites is increased when functional
connectivity is imposed, specically from 119 to 126 sites. This is due
to the replacement of some poor quality sites, which connect high
quality sites in the contiguous conguration, with a few additional
higher quality sites to establish better connections (functionally improved routes).

Both structural and functional contiguity requirements led to
larger CMAs, which increased the total distances from the reserve
centers (thus, decreased compactness). Instead of the total distance
(plain or habitat-adjusted) a more representative measure of compactness can be the average distance obtained by dividing the total
distance from the reserve center(s) by the number of sites included
in the reserve(s). Fig. 7 displays the relationships between the ordinary and functional average distances versus the size of the optimal
reserves for the case of n = 2, vh = 6000 and th = 10,00020,000. It is
evident from the graphs that an expansion in the total habitat quality
increases the average distance proportionally, both for ordinary distances and functional distances, thus reducing the overall compactness of the reserve. This is because of having to select more marginal
areas farther from the centers to achieve the targeted habitat quality, thus having to travel a larger distance to benet from the habitat

services provided by those areas. Another important observation is
the declining average habitat quality as a larger reserve is congured,
which is again expected for the same reasons. A perplexing result is
the slightly higher average habitat quality when structural contiguity
is imposed (Fig. 7a) compared to the case when functional contiguity
is imposed (Fig. 7b). This happens because poor short cuts are eliminated when functional distances are considered, therefore more sites
are needed to connect good habitat patches, which in turn reduces
the average habitat quality. Although the average habitat quality is
worsened, the average movement resistance is improved (indicated
by the lower average functional distances in Fig. 7b than in 7a). This
is consistent with the objective stated at the outset, namely enhancement of functional connectivity of the reserved areas by identifying
better routes.
Table 3 displays some summary statistics associated with two sets
of model solutions that assume alternative compactness and connectivity criteria. Rows C1-E1 are associated with one large reserve
while rows C2-E2 assume two smaller reserves, both obtained with
th=12,000. Compactness and connectivity are formulated in three
different ways in each block (see the notes in Table 3). The rst important nding is the reduced size of the reserve, namely 63 selected
sites versus 82 and 83, when two reserves are congured instead of
one large reserve. This is an expected result because of the selection
of fewer habitat-rich core areas in C2-E2, whereas many more poorquality sites have to be selected in C1-E1 in order to build a connected
reserve. The second important observation is the trade-off between
compactness and connectivity when functional distances are used instead of ordinary distances in the objective function and the connectivity constraints. Specically, when compactness is measured using
physical distances, functional connectivity is compromised because
of the selection of poor quality sites that provide short-cuts and reduce the total distances from the reserve centers. This increases the
total functional distance, however (poorer functional connectivity).
In contrast, maximizing functional connectivity (minimizing the total
functional distance) reduces the geometric compactness (increases
the total physical distance from the reserve centers).
7. Concluding remarks
This article presented a linear integer programming formulation
to incorporate reserve compactness and landscape connectivity as
spatial criteria in reserve site selection. Compactness is achieved by
minimizing the sum of pairwise distances between all sites assigned
to a reserve and a central site of that reserve, both determined by the
model simultaneously. The model includes an explicit constraint to
achieve spatial contiguity, namely if a site is to be selected an adjacent
site closer to the central site must also be selected. Landscape connectivity is dened in two different ways: structural contiguity and
functional connectivity. In the rst case, we use ordinary distances
between selected sites and the central sites they are associated with,
while in the second case we use habitat adjusted distances to reect
the diculty of species movement within the protected areas. We
presented a case study involving the protection of a keystone species
at risk. The results show that the optimal reserves become less compact and include more sites with lower quality as the targeted habitat
quality is increased.
The model and the empirical example presented here focus on one
species only. With appropriate modications, the model can be extended to the case of multiple species. This requires additional index
sets, more variables and more constraints (as in Dissanayake, nal, &
Westervelt, 2011). For the sake of space and readability, we did not
present the details of the multi-species extension here.
The present analysis focuses on spatial properties of the reserved
areas only, ignoring the properties of the remaining landscape. In
some cases, islands or thin deep bays of non-reserve areas may be
placed within the reserved areas (Fig. 6d). Such areas may not be

967

suitable for alternative uses, thus they have to be managed as part
of the reserve. In the particular case study presented here this was
not an issue because the land is already owned by the military, but
in general this means additional cost that must be accounted for. Finally, spatial layout of the non-reserve areas can often be equally important as that of the reserved areas (e.g., they may have to be contiguous). Incorporating spatial considerations for both reserved and
non-reserved areas can be done by using a multiple land use model,
as in Dissanayake et al. (2011) or by including additional variables and
constraints in the model to achieve the desired properties. We note,
however, that this may adversely affect the size and computational
eciency of the model.
