A

Executive summary
rtificial intelligence (AI) applications will profoundly impact societies in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs), both positively and negatively. AI is an emerging
class of technologies upon which other technologies and applications are being built.
Fuelled by the increasing availability of computational power, improved connectivity,
and data, AI applications offer intriguing possibilities for promoting economic growth
and tackling a wide variety of longstanding problems in the Global South. The
resulting disruptive impact will be massive and could well be revolutionary.
The introduction of AI applications in the Global South brings tremendous
potential for both good and harm. AI makes possible innovative, data-driven,
technical innovations to help address pressing social problems. AI can facilitate
scientific breakthroughs, improve medical diagnoses, increase agricultural
productivity, optimize supply chains, and equalize access to education through
highly personalized learning. However, like most new technologies, AI also has
the potential to exacerbate existing problems and create new ones. Contributing
to social ills, AI might reinforce structural inequalities and bias, perpetuate gender
imbalances, threaten jobs, and introduce other unknown risks and unintended
consequences.
Consequently, the roll-out of future AI applications requires a healthy critical
perspective and an ongoing public dialogue. Concerted efforts are warranted to
ensure the equitable and inclusive development and deployment of AI in LMICs.
These efforts should focus on enabling these countries to take advantage of AI
so they can benefit from the immense value the technology can bring. At the

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

same time, care and vigilance will be required to mitigate risks and to identify
and respond to unintended harmful consequences. Such an approach is critical
so as not to exacerbate inequalities and social instability.

Agriculture: AI is being employed to address the various threats that can
compromise a successful harvest. For example, AI systems are being used to
support water management in Palestine and drought monitoring in Uganda.

This paper proposes a proactive research agenda for the ethical and equitable
application of AI in the Global South. Undergirding this agenda is a broad
overview of the technologies associated with AI and the opportunities and
challenges they present.

Education: AI can move educational offerings beyond an industrial, one-sizefits-all delivery model toward quality personalized learning opportunities at
scale. For example, efforts in India are employing AI to develop intelligent
tutoring systems.

WHAT IS AI?
AI is an area of computer science devoted to developing systems that can be
taught or learn to make decisions and predictions within specific contexts. AI
applications can perform a wide range of intelligent behaviours: optimization
(e.g., supply chains); pattern recognition and detection (e.g., facial recognition);
prediction and hypothesis testing (e.g., predicting disease outbreaks); natural
language processing; and machine translation.
AI technologies are poised to have a significant impact on society because they
leverage existing infrastructure (the internet, large datasets) to dramatically
reduce the costs of activities (both new and old, good and bad) on a large scale.

POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF AI IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES
Health care: AI can play a crucial role in augmenting health care capacity by
filling gaps in human expertise, improving productivity, and enhancing disease
surveillance. For example, an NGO in Brazil has partnered with an AI start-up
to develop a system to predict upcoming incidences of disease.
Delivery of government services and information: Groups around the world
are exploring ways to use AI to help countries improve their e-government
efforts by automating complex assessments that take account of a range of
technical, organizational, and social factors. For example, a machine learning
system has been developed to help predict mass grave locations of Mexican
drug cartel victims.

10

Economy and business: AI offers the potential for higher productivity and offers
a means of growth in the form of new business development, innovation, and
optimization of economic building blocks. For example, several companies are
working to extend access to standard financial services to the hundreds of
millions of Africans who either do not use them or do not currently have access.

POTENTIAL RISKS
Fairness, bias and accountability: AI systems have the potential to reflect and
exacerbate societal bias and produce results that can disadvantage individuals
and groups, especially those already marginalized. For example, a computer
program used in the U.S. to assess the risk of re-offense by individuals in the
criminal justice system flagged black defendants as high risk nearly twice as
often as white defendants.
Surveillance and loss of privacy: AI algorithms supercharge surveillance and
threaten privacy. For example, AI-powered facial recognition software gives
closed-circuit TV systems the capacity to track individuals as they move through
the urban landscape. This is concerning both socially and politically, as privacy is
key to other fundamental rights such as freedom of expression and association.
Job and tax revenue loss through automation: With the growing use
of machine learning and AI systems in nearly all sectors of the economy,
widespread automation will extend beyond manufacturing to impact higherskilled knowledge-based roles. Many of these jobs can be partly or entirely
automated, reducing the need for human workers. However, a counterargument has also been made: AI may shift the nature and scope of work
and jobs, for instance through robots complementing human labour, and an
increased focus on higher-skilled and higher-paid tasks.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Undermining democracy and political self-determination: In a world
increasingly connected and reliant on the free flow of information,
misinformation is a genuine and growing threat to stability and democracy.
For example, by piggybacking on highly personal data collected on social
media campaigns, AI applications facilitate more efficient propaganda and
behavioural manipulation campaigns. The 2016 U.S. presidential election
has become a notorious example of the role of targeted misinformation over
Facebook.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the conclusions of this paper and the broader literature, we have
identified three areas in which action can be taken: policies and regulations,
inclusive and ethical AI applications, and infrastructure and skills. Within each
area, the paper makes a series of recommendations for research necessary to
make concrete progress. Note that this is not intended to be a comprehensive
list, but rather an overview of the most pressing interventions.

POLICY AND REGULATORY STRUCTURES

THE FUTURE OF AI IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH

FOSTER THE DESIGN OF POLICIES AND REGULATIONS THAT ENABLE
INCLUSIVE AND RIGHTS-BASED AI

There is little doubt that AI technologies will be transformational. Breathtaking
advances will be made, extraordinary wealth will be created, and many of
our social and institutional structures will be transformed. However, we must
ask: whose lives will be improved (or harmed) by these technologies? A key
assertion of this paper is that, if we continue blindly forward, we should expect
to see increased inequality alongside economic disruption, social unrest, and
in some cases, political instability, with the technologically disadvantaged and
underrepresented faring the worst.

Conduct baseline research on the prevalence of AI applications and policies
in countries of the Global South. Despite pockets of AI activity in the Global
South, there are no systematic overviews of the level of this activity. Baseline
data collection should include the sets of AI policies, regulations, applications,
existing open datasets, and skill levels. This research should be conducted
on an annual or, minimally, a bi-annual basis to support continued activities,
policy development, and the research agenda.

This prediction stems from the interweaving of two elements: the nature of AI
applications, and projections of the impacts of AI applications in the current
global context. What is worrisome is the dynamic of how our current set of
institutions and cultures shapes the evolution of technologies, and how, in
turn, these technologies shape these institutions and cultures. One important
element of this context is that it is characterized by what can be called an
“AI divide” – that is, a gap between those who have the ability to design and
deploy AI applications, and those who do not. Furthermore, both the digital
(e.g., infrastructure) and analogue (e.g., regulations) foundations required for
an ethical and equitable application of AI technologies in many countries in the
Global South are largely absent, and salient power asymmetries persist.
This situation makes it all the more important to address the challenges posed
by AI so that we can avoid or mitigate these adverse outcomes while enabling
developing countries to take full advantage of AI’s positive potential. The
promise of AI is too alluring, and its potential too great to avoid an AI future.
The question is whether or not we will be ready.

12

Learn about effective regulatory models. Document and assess AI regulatory
models developed to deal with the emergence of new AI-driven activities such
as predictive policing, autonomous vehicles, and chatbots. Determine whether
the potential risks of AI applications are adequately addressed by existing
regulation, or if existing regulation needs to be adapted or new regulation
developed. Identify regulatory responses to given AI use cases and risk levels
that are appropriate for settings with low institutional capacity. While lessons
learned in the Global North are useful, it is critical not to directly import
institutional and regulatory approaches into Global South contexts where
institutional and cultural forms differ.
Track the impact of AI on employment and work. Conduct social and
economic policy research to understand the effects of AI on employment, the
nature of work, and labour markets. To what extent is AI-enabled automation
altering employment patterns and transforming the workplace? What are
alternative models of income and resource distribution, education, and job
retraining in different contexts?

13

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Explore approaches to addressing liability, accountability, and redress for
AI decision-making. Design regulatory systems and frameworks to determine
liability and accountability for AI decision-making that is erroneous, biased, or
discriminatory, and establish mechanisms for redress. Measures may include
policies that stipulate transparency for automated decision-making, evaluative
procedures to determine the competency of AI systems, and certification of AI
systems that engage in tasks requiring a degree of skill or training. The need
for action is particularly urgent in the case of decision-making systems that
affect people’s well-being or freedom, such as those that involve the use of
force or incarceration. Research is critical here to uncover and document which
systems for accountability and redress are effective and in what contexts.
Study the impact of AI on human rights. At a broad level, the UN recognizes
that offline rights apply online, testifying to the relevance of analog rights
in digitally mediated environments. Professional bodies specifically call for
full consideration of human rights in the context of AI design and operation.
Tailoring impact assessments to the risks of AI would help encourage
development programs to incorporate AI technology in ways that respect and
promote human rights, including privacy, equality, and freedom of expression.

APPLICATIONS
CATALYZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF INCLUSIVE AND ETHICAL AI APPLICATIONS
Support the development and deployment of innovative AI applications
for social good. Invest in developing, deploying, and using applications for
education, health, the environment, food security, etc., and and ensure that
these applications are ethical and inclusive. As with regulatory innovations,
while it is important to draw inspiration from examples around the world, AI
applications will often require homegrown solutions to be effective.

Test and monitor bias in AI applications. AI systems that make or inform
decision-making that affects humans’ well-being (e.g., medical diagnosis,
providing a judge with an assessment of potential recidivism) should be tested
and monitored for bias and errors across different contexts and communities,
both before release and continuously.
Explore models of participatory design for AI. Conduct research into
practices that support the development of inclusive AI applications. What
techniques are effective for truly participatory processes that engage diverse
populations in the design and deployment of AI applications? How and in
what contexts do these practices counter design and learned bias and make
AI relevant to marginalized communities? AI stakeholders in the field should
release data on diversity of participation in design and development.
Action research to deepen understanding of how to effectively and
equitably scale proven AI applications. Research on the process of scaling
AI applications in a cost-effective and equitable manner, both vertically
to encompass additional functionality and horizontally to expand to new
locations, is critical to extending the benefits of these applications. Successful
transfer of an AI application across contexts requires an understanding of why
an application worked well in a particular context and an appreciation that the
application may need to be altered in order to succeed in a new environment.
Particular challenges related to data will include scaling beyond the scope of
existing datasets and developing means to rapidly generate datasets.

Research the social impact of AI innovations. Research is needed to better
understand which AI applications work (or do not work), for whom, and in
what contexts. We need to know who benefits from AI applications and
how, as well as who is excluded or harmed. Special emphasis must be placed
on exploring the differential impacts on various groups, particularly those
resulting from gender, social and economic status, race, etc. This research
should go beyond first-order effects, such as increased efficiencies or accuracy
of diagnosis, to include broader social effects. New methodologies for impact
assessment and evaluation may be required.
