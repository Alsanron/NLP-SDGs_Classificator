Machine learning has had fruitful applications in finance well before the advent
of mobile banking apps, proficient chatbots, or search engines. Given the high
volume, accurate historical records, and quantitative nature of the finance
world, few industries are better suited for artificial intelligence. There are more
uses cases of machine learning in finance than ever before, a trend
perpetuated by more accessible computing power and more accessible
machine learning tools (such as Googles Tensorflow).
Today, machine learning has come to play an integral role in many parts of
the financial ecosystem, from approving loans, to credit scores, to managing
assets, and assessing risks. But few technically-savvy financial services
professionals have an accurate view of where machine learning can play a
role at their companies.
At Emerj, the AI Research and Advisory Company, we work with large
financial services firms that want to assess where AI could drive value at their
companies. We provide our clients this resource as a foundation for
understanding the broad possibilities of machine learning in their industry as
part of our more extensive AI Opportunity Landscape service.
In this resource, we explore:

Note that this article is intended as an executive overview rather than a
granular look at all applications in this field. Ive done my best to distill some of
the most used and most promising use cases, with reference for your
additional investigation.
Well begin by looking at currently running applications within certain financial
institutions:

Current AI Applications in Finance, Banking, and Insurance
Below are examples of machine learning being put to use actively today. Bear
in mind that some of these applications leverage multiple AI approaches  not
exclusively machine learning.
Portfolio Management
The term robo-advisor was essentially unheard-of just five years ago, but it
is now commonplace in the financial landscape. The term is misleading and
doesnt involve robots at all. Rather, robo-advisors (companies such
as Betterment, Wealthfront, and others) are algorithms built to calibrate a
financial portfolio to the goals and risk tolerance of the user.
Users enter their goals (for example, retiring at age 65 with $250,000.00 in
savings), age, income, and current financial assets. The advisor (which would
more accurately be referred to as an allocator) then spreads investments
across asset classes and financial instruments in order to reach the users
goals.
The system then calibrates to changes in the users goals and to real-time
changes in the market, aiming always to find the best fit for the users original
goals. Robo-advisors have gained significant traction with millennial
consumers who dont need a physical advisor to feel comfortable investing,
and who are less able to validate the fees paid to human advisors.
Algorithmic Trading
With origins going back to the 1970s, algorithmic trading (sometimes called
Automated Trading Systems, which is arguably a more accurate description)
involves the use of complex AI systems to make extremely fast trading
decisions.

Algorithmic systems often making thousands or millions of trades in a day,
hence the term high-frequency trading (HFT), which is considered to be a
subset of algorithmic trading. Most hedge funds and financial institutions do
not openly disclose their AI approaches to trading (for good reason), but it is
believed that machine learning and deep learning are playing an increasingly
important role in calibrating trading decisions in real time.
There some noted limitations to the exclusive use of machine learning in
trading stocks, currencies (ForEx) and commodities, see this Quora thread for
a good background on machine learnings role in HFT today.
Fraud Detection
Combine more accessible computing power, internet becoming more
commonly used, and an increasing amount of valuable company data being
stored online, and you have a perfect storm for data security risk. While
previous financial fraud detection systems depended heavily on complex and
robust sets of rules, modern fraud detection goes beyond following a checklist
of risk factors  it actively learns and calibrates to new potential (or real)
security threats.
This is the place of machine learning in finance for fraud  but the same
principles hold true for other data security problems. Using machine learning,
systems can detect unique activities or behaviors (anomalies) and flag them
for security teams. The challenge for these systems is to avoid false-positives
 situations where risks are flagged that were never risks in the first place.
Here at Emerj weve interviewed half a dozen fraud and security AI
executives, all of whom seem convinced that given the incalculably high
number of ways that security can be breached, genuinely learning systems
will be a necessity in the five to ten years ahead.
Loan/Insurance Underwriting
Underwriting could be described as a perfect job for machine learning in
finance, and indeed there is a great deal of worry in the industry that
machines will replace a large swath of the underwriting positions that exist
today (see page 2 of this Ernst & Young executive brief).
Especially at large companies (big banks and publicly traded insurance firms),
machine learning algorithms can be trained on millions of examples of
consumer data (age, job, marital status) and financial lending or insurance

results, such as whether or not a person defaulted or paid back their loans on
time.
The underlying trends that can be assessed with algorithms, and continuously
analyzed to detect trends that might influence lending and ensuring into the
future (are more and more young people in a certain state getting in car
accidents? Are there increasing rates of default among a specific
demographic population over the last 15 years)?
These results have a tremendous tangible yield for companies  but at
present are primarily reserved for larger companies with the resources to hire
data scientists and the massive volumes of past and present data to train their
algorithms.
Weve compared the AI investments of insurance giants like State Farm,
Liberty Mutual, and others  in our complete article on AI insurance
applications.

Future Value of Machine Learning in Finance
Some of our readers who work in banking or finance may find it difficult to
convince their team members or upper management to consider an AI
solution to a current problem within their business. It is important to note that
while AI is beginning to create waves of disruption across these industries, not
all companies may have the insight required to consider how AI might help
them in the future. Some experts, such as Ian Wilson, former head of AI at
HSBC, consider this lack of information to be an important challenge to
overcome when trying to find the right AI solution. He considers education and
innovation to be the most effective ways of disseminating this information to
other members of ones business.
We spoke to Wilson about how one can rethink banking as a business in the
age of AI on our podcast, AI in Banking. When asked about how to encourage
banking leadership to move forward with ideas about AI, Wilson said,
Within your organization you must have an AI function that can educate.  A
lot of people when they think about rolling AI into an enterprise or into a bank,
they think about it from a technical perspective. For me the number one
element for a running AI in a bank is education. That process of flowing out
the understanding of what those capabilities can do into the bank to make it

part of the DNA. And so thats where you start enabling these people that
have these ideas to realize that now there might be a capability to [manifest
them.] 
Innovation becomes a structure through which you can start developing these
ideas. A lot of people within each business line may have an idea, but
because theyre not technical they have no way of knowing how to get the ball
rolling. To even test that out and see whether its feasible. So I think its also
important to have that structure in place  so if you have an idea you can
hand it over to a team that knows how to pick it up and test it out.
The applications below are those that we consider promising. Some have
relatively active applications today (though not as active as the more
established use cases listed above), and others are still relatively nascent.
Customer Service
Chat bots and conversational interfaces are a rapidly expanding area of
venture investment and customer service budget (our 2016 AI executive
consensus ranked them as the most promising short-term AI consumer
application). Companies like Kasisto are already building finance-specific
chatbots to help customers ask questions via chat such as How much did I
spend on groceries last month? and What was the balance of my personal
savings account 60 days ago?
These assistants have had to be built with robust natural language processing
engines as well as reams of finance-specific customer interactions. Banks and
financial institutions that allow for such swift querying and interaction might
pick up customers from stodgy banks that require people to log onto a
traditional online banking portal and do the digging themselves.
This kind of chat (or in the future  voice) experience is not the norm today in
banking or finance, but may be a viable option for millions in the coming five
years. This application goes beyond machine learning in finance, and is likely
to manifest itself as specialized chat bots in a variety of fields and industries.
Security 2.0
Usernames, passwords, and security questions may no longer be the norm for
user security in five years. User security in banking and finance is a

particularly high stakes game (youd probably rather your Facebook login to
the world than release your bank account information to a small group of
strangers, and for good reason). In addition to anomaly-detection applications
like those currently being developed and used in fraud, future security
measures might require facial recognition, voice recognition, or other
biometric data.
Sentiment/News Analysis
Hedge funds hold their cards tight to their chest, and we can expect to hear
very little by way of how sentiment analysis is being used specifically.
However, it is supposed that much of the future applications of machine
learning will be in understanding social media, news trends, and other data
sources, not just stock prices and trades.
The stock market moves in response to myriad human-related factors that
have nothing to do with ticker symbols, and the hope is that machine learning
will be able to replicate and enhance human intuition of financial activity by
discovering new trends and telling signals.
Ben Goertzel provides some interesting insight into the world of AI hedge
funds in this recent WIRED article. Goertzel shares the belief of many others
that machine learning in finance will be far from limited to stock and
commodity data  and that the AI hedge funds who come out of top will need
to do much more than study ticker symbols alone.
Sales/Recommendations of Financial Products
Applications of automated financial product sales exist today, some of which
may not involve machine learning (but rather, other rule-based systems). A
robo-advisor might suggest portfolio changes, and there are plenty of
insurance recommendation sites this might use some degree of AI to suggest
a particular car or home insurance plan. In the future, increasingly
personalized and calibrated apps and personal assistants may be perceived
(not just by millennials) as more trustworthy, objective, and reliable than inperson advisors.
Just as Amazon and Netflix can recommend books and movies better than
any living human expert, ongoing conversations with financial personal
assistants might do the same for financial products, as we see beginning to
happen in the insurance industry.
