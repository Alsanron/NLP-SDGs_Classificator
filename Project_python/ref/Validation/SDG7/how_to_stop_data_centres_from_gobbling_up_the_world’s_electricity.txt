Data centres are chewing up vast amounts of energy

a small town where the firm has built
three giant data centres and is planning two
more. Inside these vast factories, bigger than
aircraft carriers, tens of thousands of circuit
boards are racked row upon row, stretching
down windowless halls so long that staff ride
through the corridors on scooters.

These huge buildings are the treasuries
of the new industrial kings: the information
traders. The five biggest global companies
by market capitalization this year are currently Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft
and Facebook, replacing titans such as Shell
and ExxonMobil. Although information
factories might not spew out black smoke or
grind greasy cogs, they are not bereft of environmental impact. As demand for Internet

and mobile-phone traffic skyrockets, the
information industry could lead to an explosion in energy use (see Energy forecast).
Already, data centres use an estimated
200 terawatt hours (TWh) each year. That is
more than the national energy consumption
of some countries, including Iran, but half of
the electricity used for transport worldwide,
and just 1% of global electricity demand (see
Energy scale). Data centres contribute around

With the spectre of an energy-hungry
future looming, scientists in academic labs
and engineers at some of the worlds wealthiest companies are exploring ways to keep the
industrys environmental impact in check.
They are streamlining computing processes,
switching to renewables and investigating better ways to cool data centres and to recycle their
waste heat. ICTs energy use must be vigilantly
managed, says Eric Masanet, an engineer at
Northeastern University in Evanston, Illinois,
who co-authored an International Energy
Agency (IEA) report2 last year on digitalization
and energy  but if we stay on top of it, he says,
we should keep future energy demand in check.

0.3% to overall carbon emissions, whereas the
information and communications technology
(ICT) ecosystem as a whole  under a sweeping definition that encompasses personal
digital devices, mobile-phone networks and
televisions  accounts for more than 2% of
global emissions. That puts ICTs carbon
footprint on a par with the aviation industrys
emissions from fuel. What could happen in the
future is hard to forecast. But one of the most
worrying models predicts that electricity use
by ICT could exceed 20% of the global total by
the time a child born today reaches her teens,
with data centres using more than one-third
of that (see Energy forecast)1. If the computationally intensive cryptocurrency Bitcoin

continues to grow, a sharp rise in energy
demand could come sooner rather than later
(see The Bitcoin bite).
For now, despite rising demand for data,
ICTs electricity consumption is staying nearly
flat, as increased Internet traffic and data loads
are countered by increased efficiencies 
including shuttering older facilities in favour of
ultra-efficient centres such as Prinevilles. But
those easy wins could end within a decade. The
trend is good right now, but its questionable
what its going to look like in 510 years, says
Dale Sartor, who oversees the Center of Expertise for Energy Efficiency in Data Centers at the
US Department of Energys Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory in Berkeley, California.

Perhaps the most startling forecast of ICTs
future energy demand comes from Anders
Andrae, who works on sustainable ICT at
Huawei Technologies Sweden in Kista; he predicts that data-centre electricity use is likely to
increase about 15-fold by 2030, to 8% of projected global demand1. Such dire numbers are
controversial. There have been many alarmist predictions of growing ICT energy use over
the years, and all have proven to be bunk, says
Masanet. Last years IEA report estimated that
although data-centre workloads will shoot
up  tripling 2014 levels by 2020  efficiency
gains mean that their electricity demand might
sneak up only by 3% (ref. 2). ICTs carbon footprint as a whole might even drift downwards
by 2020, as smartphones take over from larger
devices, researchers have suggested3.
Data-centre electricity demand has remained
roughly level over the past half-decade, in part
because of the hyperscale shift  the rise of
super-efficient information factories that use
an organized, uniform computing architecture
that easily scales up to hundreds of thousands
of servers. Hyperscale data centres emerged
about a decade ago when companies such as
Amazon and Google began to need fleets of
a quarter of a million servers or more, says
Bill Carter, chief technical officer at the Open
Compute Project. It was started by Facebook in
2011 to share hardware and software solutions
to make computing more energy-efficient. At
that point, it made no sense to use off-the-shelf
hardware from a computing firm, as companies
had typically done.
You had the opportunity to strip things
down to just what you need, and make it
specific to your application, Carter says. The
new hyperscalers made bare-bones servers
designed for purpose. We stripped out video
connectors, because theres no video monitor.
Theres no blinking lights because theres no
one walking the racks. Theres no screws, says
Carter. On average, one server in a hyperscale
centre is said to be able to replace 3.75 servers
in a conventional centre.
The savings made by hyperscale centres can
be seen in their power usage efficiency (PUE),
defined as the total energy needed for everything, including lights and cooling, divided

by the energy used for computing (a PUE of
1.0 would be a perfect score). Conventional
data centres typically have a PUE of about 2.0;
for hyperscale facilities, thats been whittled
down to about 1.2. Google, for one, boasts
a PUE of 1.12 on average for all its centres.
Older or less technologically adept data
centres can contain a mix of equipment that is
hard to optimize  and some that is even useless. In 2017, Jonathan Koomey, a Californiabased consultant and leading international
expert on IT, surveyed with a colleague more
than 16,000 servers tucked into corporate closets and basements and found that about onequarter of them were zombies, sucking up
power without doing any useful work  perhaps because someone simply forgot to turn
them off. These are servers sitting around
doing nothing except using electricity, and
thats outrageous, says Koomey.
In a 2016 report, the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory estimated that if 80% of
servers in small US data centres were moved
over to hyperscale facilities, this would result in
a 25% drop in energy use4. That move is under
way. Today, the world has around 400 hyperscale data centres, many of them mopping up
services for small corporations or universities
that in the past would have had their own servers. Already they account for 20% of the worlds
data-centre electricity usage. By 2020, hyperscale centres will account for almost half of it,
the IEA says (see Hyperscale shift).

RUNNING HOT AND COLD

Once the hyperscalers have taken as much of
the load as they can, further efficiencies will
be harder to find. But corporations are trying. One emerging management technique is
to make sure that servers are at full throttle as
much of the time as possible, whereas others
are turned off rather than being left idle. Facebook invented a system called Autoscale that
reduces the number of servers that need to be
on during low-traffic hours; in trials, this led to
power savings of about 1015%, the company
reported in 2014.
One big way the hyperscalers have whittled
down their PUE is by tackling cooling. In a conventional data centre, standard air conditioning
can soak up 40% of the energy bill. The use of
cooling towers, which evaporate water to drive
the cooling of air, causes another environmental
problem: US data centres are estimated to have
used about 100 billion litres of water in 2014.
Getting rid of compression chillers and cooling
towers helps to save both energy and water.
One popular solution is to simply locate data
centres in cool climes and blow the outside air
into them. Such centres dont have to be in
icy regions: Prineville is cool enough to take
advantage of so-called free air cooling, and
so are many other data-centre locations, says
Ingmar Meijer, a physicist at IBM Research in
Zurich, Switzerland.
Piped water is an even better conductor of
heat, allowing centres to be cooled using warm

HYPERSCALE SHIFT

Efficient hyperscale data centres are predicted to swallow up half of data-centre electricity demand
by 2020, as smaller, less-efficient centres shut down.

water, which is less energy intensive to produce
and recycle in the cooling system. Even in
temperate climates, warm-water cooling has
become the de facto solution for managing
high-performance computers that are run fast
and hot, including those in US Department
of Energy labs and the Bavarian Academy
of Sciences SuperMUC supercomputer in
Garching, Germany. Commercial centres in
warm climates sometimes also invest in these
systems, such as eBays Project Mercury data
centre in Phoenix, Arizona.
For high-density, high-power computing,
the most efficient thing to do is to immerse
servers in a non-conductive oil or mineral bath.
Facebook trialled that in 2012 as a way to run
its servers at higher speeds without overheating
them. For now, immersion cooling is a specialist area with tricky maintenance, says Meijer.
In 2016, Google turned its DeepMind
artificial intelligence (AI) research team to the
task of tuning its data centres cooling system to
match the weather and other factors. Google
says that, in tests, the team reduced its cooling
energy bill by 40% and produced the lowest
PUE the site had ever seen. This August, the
company announced it had turned cooling
control at some data centres over to its AI
algorithm.
Exploring innovative cooling solutions and
making existing ones cheaper will become
more important in coming years, says Carter.
As we connect the world, theres areas that
wont be able to use free air cooling, he notes,
pointing to Africa and southern Asia. And
other developments will tax IT infrastructure
in new ways. If self-driving cars flood onto the
roads, for example, small server installations
at the base of mobile-phone towers, used to
help those cars communicate and process data,

will need high-power devices that can handle
real-time AI workloads  and better cooling
options. This year, the Open Compute Project
launched a project on advanced cooling, with
the aim of making efficient cooling systems
more accessible. The hyperscalers have it
figured out; theyre extremely efficient, says
Carter. Were trying to help the other guys.
Hand-in-hand with better cooling is the idea
of using the heat coming off the servers, thus

POWER PLAY

At their core, data centres are only as good as
the processors theyre made of  and theres
scope for improvement there, too. Since the
1940s, the number of operations a computer
can perform with each kilowatt hour (KWh) of
energy has doubled about once every 1.6 years
for peak performance and every 2.6 years for
average performance. Thats a 10-billion-fold
improvement over 50 years. By some measures,
the rate of improvement has slowed since 2000,
and the current generation of computing will
run up against a physical barrier that limits the
function of transistors in just a few decades,
according to Koomeys calculations5.
Were up against the limits of shrinkage,
says Koomey. Making comparable efficiency gains after that, he says, will require

Cryptocurrency mining could push up energy demand
Since the cryptocurrency Bitcoin was born in
2008, concerns have grown that the energy
demand of its production will escalate
rapidly. Virtual coins are minted by miners
who buy specialized servers to crunch
time-intensive computations in a growing
blockchain that proves the validity of the
new cryptocoins. By mid-2018, says Alex
de Vries, a data consultant for international
professional-services company PwC in
Amsterdam, Bitcoin miners were probably
using about 20 terawatt hours of electricity
per year globally  less than 10% that of
data centres, and less than 0.1% of total
electricity use6. But estimates of how fast
their usage is going up are contentious.
De Vries estimates that, by now, Bitcoin
is gobbling up at least 0.33% of global
electricity. Including other cryptocurrencies
such as Ethereum bumps that up to 0.5%.
I think its shocking, he says. But others,
including Marc Bevand, a cryptocurrency
researcher in San Diego, California, say
that those numbers are inflated and based
on gross assumptions. Bevand estimates

a revolution in how hardware is built and
computing is done: perhaps through a switch
to quantum computing. Its basically impossible to predict, he says.
Although the core focus is on reducing ICTs
energy usage, its worth remembering that the
information industry could also make our
power use elsewhere smarter and more efficient.
The IEA notes that if all vehicles become automated, for example, there is a utopian possibility
that smoother traffic flow and easier carpooling
would reduce the total energy demand of the
transport industry by 60%. Buildings, which
have accounted for 60% of the increased global
electricity demand over the past 25 years, have
huge scope for energy-efficiency improvements: smart heating and cooling, hooked up
to building sensors and weather reports, could
save 10% of their future energy demand. Chiara
Venturini, director of the Global e-Sustainability
Initiative, a Brussels-based industry association,
estimates that the IT industry currently abates
1.5 times its own carbon footprint, and that
could go up to almost 10 times by 2030.
ICT might also help to reduce global emissions by giving renewables a leg-up over fossil
fuels. In 2010, the environmental group Greenpeace published its first ClickClean report,
which ranked major companies and threw a
spotlight on the environmental burden of IT. In
2011, Facebook made a commitment to using
100% renewable energy. Google and Apple
followed in 2012. As of 2017, nearly 20 Internet companies had done the same. (Chinese

that energy use might be as low as half
of de Vries current numbers by January
2019. There is growth, but people are
hyping this, says Jonathan Koomey, a
California-based IT consultant, who is
gathering data on cryptocurrency electricity
consumption.
For now, Bitcoin mining is only profitable
in places where electricity is cheap (about
half the global average, says Bevand), which
include China, Iceland and areas along the
Columbia River in North America where
hydroelectric power is plentiful. As Bitcoin
miners dig in to an area and stress the grid,
energy companies respond by raising their
fees. That might prompt miners either to
shut down or to take steps to drastically
improve the energy efficiency of their
hardware or system cooling.
Bitcoin could possibly be migrated to a
less-energy-intensive blockchain system,
says Bevand (as Ethereum is planning).
Or, notes Koomey, Say Bitcoin collapses
for some reason; all those facilities will just
go away. N.J.

Internet giants such as Baidu, Tencent and
Alibaba, however, have not followed suit.)
Back in 2010, IT companies were a negligible
contributor to renewable-power purchase
agreements with energy companies; by 2015,
they accounted for more than half of such
agreements (see Green growth). Google is
the largest corporate purchaser of renewable
energy on the planet.
Cutting back our thirst for data might be the
ultimate way to prevent energy use going into
hyperdrive. But its hard to see anyone agreeing
to, say, limit their Netflix use, which accounts
for more than one-third of Internet traffic in
the United States. Banning high-definition
colour cameras on phones alone could reduce
data traffic in Europe by 40%, says Ian Bitterlin,
a consulting engineer and data-centre expert in
Cheltenham, UK. But, he adds, no one seems
likely to dare to institute such rules. We cant
put the lid back on Pandoras box, he says. But
we could reduce data-centre power.

saving electricity demand elsewhere. Its like
a free resource, says IBM researcher Patrick
Ruch in Zurich. There are a few examples: the
Condorcet data centre in Paris sends its waste
heat directly into a neighbouring Climate
Change Arboretum, where scientists study the
impacts of high temperatures on vegetation.
An IBM data centre in Switzerland warms a
nearby swimming pool. But heat doesnt travel
well, so waste-heat use tends to be limited to
data centres located next to a convenient customer, or in a city that already uses piped hot
water to heat homes.
A scattering of players are aiming to make
waste heat more generally usable, including
preliminary efforts to turn it into electricity.
Others aim to use the waste heat to run cooling devices  IBMs US$2-million project
THRIVE, for instance, is developing new
materials that can better soak up water vapour
and release it when exposed to heat, to make
more efficient sorption heat pumps to keep
data centres cool.
