Objectives

The EuResist expert system is a novel data-driven online system for computing the probability of
8-week success for any given pair of HIV-1 genotype and combination antiretroviral therapy
regimen plus optional patient information. The objective of this study was to compare the EuResist
system vs. human experts (EVE) for the ability to predict response to treatment.
Methods

The EuResist system was compared with 10 HIV-1 drug resistance experts for the ability to predict
8-week response to 25 treatment cases derived from the EuResist database validation data set. All
current and past patient data were made available to simulate clinical practice. The experts were
asked to provide a qualitative and quantitative estimate of the probability of treatment success.
Results

There were 15 treatment successes and 10 treatment failures. In the classification task, the number
of mislabelled cases was six for EuResist and 613 for the human experts [mean  standard
deviation (SD) 9.1  1.9]. The accuracy of EuResist was higher than the average for the experts (0.76
vs. 0.64, respectively). The quantitative estimates computed by EuResist were significantly correlated
(Pearson r 5 0.695, Po0.0001) with the mean quantitative estimates provided by the experts.
However, the agreement among experts was only moderate (for the classification task, inter-rater
k 5 0.355; for the quantitative estimation, mean  SD coefficient of variation 5 55.9  22.4%).
Conclusions

With this limited data set, the EuResist engine performed comparably to or better than human experts.
The system warrants further investigation as a treatment-decision support tool in clinical practice.

Introduction
Monitoring the development and evolution of antiretroviral drug resistance is an integral part of the clinical
management of HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients [1].
Although novel classes of anti-HIV-1 compounds have
been made available recently, most of the treatment
regimens are still based on combinations of nucleoside/
nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and
protease inhibitors (PIs). These drugs have been used for
many years and there is extensive information on the
correlation between mutations in the HIV-1 pol gene and
changes in susceptibility to the individual NRTIs, NNRTIs
and PIs [2]. This knowledge has been translated into expertbased algorithms whereby a specific pattern of HIV-1
pol mutations can be interpreted as conferring complete,
intermediate or no resistance to each of the available drugs
[3]. Such systems are regularly updated by expert panels
periodically reviewing the latest in vitro and in vivo
antiretroviral resistance data and accordingly adjusting the
algorithm rules. Indeed, the most widely used rule-based
algorithms have been shown to be helpful in predicting
response to treatment in patients harbouring drug-resistant
virus [4]. However, given the complexity of HIV-1 drug
resistance, the inferred drug susceptibilities derived by
different systems may diverge [57]. Moreover, HIV-1 drug
resistance experts agree that selection of a treatment
regimen must also be based on additional factors including
patient clinical status and commitment to therapy, previous
exposure to antiretroviral drugs, and past HIV-1 genotype
information. In fact, interpretation of HIV-1 genotype by
one or more experts in the field can improve virological
treatment outcome with respect to simple indication of the
susceptibility to individual drugs shown in a resistance test
report [810]. Thus, HIV-1 genotyping complemented by
expert advice is considered the best procedure to take into
account HIV-1 drug resistance when building an antiretroviral regimen.
More recently, data-driven drug susceptibility prediction
systems have started to be explored through different
statistical learning methods. Large genotype-to-phenotype
and/or genotype-to-virological response correlation data
sets are required to train such systems. The derived model is
typically applied to predict drug activity against a given
HIV-1 genotype. For instance, the proprietary VircoType
system was trained on tens of thousands of genotype
phenotype pairs and can reliably estimate in vitro
resistance to individual drugs for any specific set of
mutations based on multiple linear regression [11]. Clinical
cut-off values derived from statistical learning are applied
to estimate the in vivo activity of each drug against the

virus [12]. Using a large genotype-to-virological response
training data set, researchers of the Resistance Response
Database Initiative (RDI) group have developed an artificial
neural network method to predict the change in viral load
caused by a given therapy in the presence of a specific
HIV-1 mutant [13]. The same group has also shown that the
model can use additional data such as the patient CD4 cell
count and summary indicators of previous treatment
exposure to increase the accuracy of the prediction [13].
Finally, the EuResist consortium has developed a novel
system based on a combination of three statistical learning
models to predict the probability of short-term treatment
success based on HIV-1 genotype and, when available,
supplementary patient data [14]. In contrast to the
VircoType and all rule-based algorithms, the RDI system
and the EuResist engine are intended to predict the
virological success of a combination regimen, rather
than the activity of the individual drugs, thus providing
more clinically oriented guidance for building an antiretroviral therapy regimen.
The aim of this study was to compare the performance of
the EuResist system with that of human experts predicting
short-term virological outcomes in a set of 25 past treatment
cases with complete clinical and virological information.

Methods
The EuResist engine (http://engine.euresist.org/) has been
trained and validated on around 3000 treatment change
episodes (TCEs) extracted from the EuResist integrated
database (EIDB), a collection of HIV-1 resistance data from
four European nationwide study cohorts (Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg and Sweden). Briefly, a TCE was defined as a
treatment switch with baseline genotype and viral load
obtained at maximum 12 weeks before the therapy change
and a follow-up viral load measured after 8 (412) weeks
of the same uninterrupted treatment. Success was defined
as a decrease of baseline viral load by at least 2 log10 HIV-1
RNA copies/mL or suppression of viral load to undetectable
levels. The prediction system combines three independent
models into a classification of the treatment as a success or
failure at 8 weeks [14]. A number of different ensemble
methods were explored with the aim of finding the optimal
way to combine the different models [15]. The EuResist
system output is the mean of the three probability values
returned by the three individual engines and varies
between 0 and 1; a value of 40.5 indicates success and
a value of  0.5 indicates failure. Based on validation
studies carried out on historical cases, the combined engine
predicts the correct outcome in 76% of cases [14] and is
more stable than any single engine [15]. The system accepts
as input the HIV-1 genotype (mandatory) as a list of

mutations or as a whole sequence and any of the following
information when available: patient age and sex, route of
infection, baseline viral load and CD4 cell count, the
number of previous treatment lines, and binary indicators
of previous use of the individual NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs.
These optional input variables have been shown to increase
the accuracy of at least one of the three individual engines.
For the EuResist system vs. expert (EVE) comparison, 12
top-level international HIV-1 drug resistance experts were
invited to take part in the study, and enrolment was closed
when the first 10 declared their availability. Experts were
recruited among scientists with highly documented activity
in the field based on long-standing and relevant visibility
as authors of peer-reviewed articles and presentations at
HIV-specific international conferences. All of the EuResist
data come from patients treated in Europe. Six of the experts
contacted were chosen from Europe and, in order to
determine whether working in a different region with
possibly different drug prescription attitudes could have an
impact on predicting treatment outcome for European
patient cases, six experts from non-European countries were
invited to participate. The 10 experts composing the final
panel are listed as coauthors of the study (C.A.B, F.B.-V.,
P.R.H., L.M., M.O., C.F.P., P.P., D.P, R.W.S. and A.-M.V.). A
total of 25 TCEs were randomly extracted from a subset of
the EIDB validation data set (i.e. the cases were excluded
from training the EuResist system) for which the treatment
regimen consisted of exactly three drugs (a ritonavir-boosted
PI being considered a single drug), the baseline viral load was
at least 10 000 copies/mL and the baseline genotype included
at least one major resistance mutation according to the
contemporary International AIDS Society (IAS) definition [2].
The TCEs were provided via an online interactive questionnaire that could be partially filled in and saved for later
completion. Each of the experts received a private username
and password that could be used to view and fill in the
questionnaire anonymously. Only European or non-European
origin was retained by the system; the identities of the
individual experts could not be determined. Upon completing
and closing the questionnaire, the expert was given a result
page where she/he could see her/his own choices together
with the actual outcomes and the EuResist predictions.
For each TCE, the web interface showed the baseline HIV-1
viral load and genotype (both as a list of mutations
with respect to consensus B and as a fasta file), the treatment
applied and summary indicators of patient history including
the number of previous treatment lines, the months of
cumulative previous use of each antiretroviral drug, and
past genotypes. In addition, the full history was available as a
Microsoft Excel file reporting all available CD4 cell counts,
viral load measurements and treatment changes over time. Of
note, there was no available information about patient

adherence to treatment, although treatment records originally labelled with poor adherence had been removed when
building the EIDB.
Experts were instructed to categorically label each of the
25 treatments as a success or a failure; and provide a quantitative estimate for this prediction expressed as probability of
success in the range 0100%, with values higher than 50%
indicating success. This estimate was requested so that the
evaluation data could be used to make a quantitative
comparison between the expert opinion and the EuResist
system output. In addition, experts were asked if they had
used any of the following expert systems while completing
the evaluation: Stanford HIVdb (http://hivdb.stanford.
edu/pages/algs/HIVdb.html), Agence Nationale de Recherche
sur le SIDA (ANRS) rules (www.hivfrenchresistance.org/
table.html), Rega rules (www.rega.kuleuven.be/cev/index.
php?id=30), the IAS reference mutation list (http://iasusa.
org/resistance_mutations/index.html), geno2pheno (www.
geno2pheno.org/) and HIV-Grade (www.hiv-grade.de/cms/
grade/homepage.html).
The agreement among experts was evaluated by computing the multirater free-marginal kappa statistics for the
qualitative prediction [16] and the coefficient of variation for
the quantitative prediction. The trade-off between specificity
and sensitivity for labelling a treatment as successful was
evaluated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis
[17], where the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used as
an indicator of the performance of a binary classifier
(success/failure), with AUC values up to 1. The agreement
between human experts and the expert system for the
quantitative prediction was evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients. The absence of systematic error was
checked on a BlandAltman plot with the limit of agreement
set as mean  1.96 SD.

Results
Data set and expert panel
The 25 TCEs randomly chosen from the EIDB included 16
PI-based and four NNRTI-based treatments all coupled with
two NRTIs. The remaining therapies included four cases of
concurrent use of one PI and one NNRTI with one NRTI and
a single treatment of four NRTIs. The year of therapy
spanned 20012006 with the single exception of the fourNRTI treatment, which was administered in 1998. Of the 20
therapies including a PI, 17 had a boosted PI, two had
unboosted atazanavir and one had nelfinavir.

load measurements, 14 (1030) CD4 cell counts and 1 (03)
genotype were available from past patient histories.
Six and four of the 10 experts participating in the study
were from European and non-European countries, respectively. Eight of the experts declared the use of one to four
rule-based expert systems while two declared the use of none.

Prediction of treatment response
Figure 1 shows the predictions made by the 10 experts and
by the EuResist engine for each of the individual TCEs.
Overall, 15 of the 25 TCEs met the criteria for definition of
virological success. The EuResist engine mislabelled six
cases; three successes and three failures (accuracy 0.76).
The mean  SD number of incorrect calls made by the
human experts was 9.1  1.9 (mean  SD accuracy 0.64 
0.07), with only one expert making the same number of
errors as EuResist and all the others making more (range 8
13). Overall, there were apparently more failures mislabelled
as successes than the opposite (mean  SD 5.3  2.7 vs.
3.8  1.6, respectively) but the difference was not significant and reflected the uneven distribution of failures and
successes in the data set (Table 2). Also, European and nonEuropean experts did not differ in their performance
(mean  SD number of wrong calls 9.8  1.7 vs. 8.0  1.6,
respectively), nor did they show different use of the expert
systems. There was no correlation between the number of
expert systems consulted and the number of errors made.
When ROC analysis was applied to determine the
sensitivity and specificity of prediction of treatment
success, EuResist was found to be not significantly better
than the mean prediction computed by the human experts,
nor was it better than any of the individual experts
(Fig. 2). The only significant difference in performance
was between the best and worst experts, as measured by the
area under the ROC curve (P 5 0.011).
The agreement among the experts in terms of binary
classification of success and failure was only fair, as

revealed by the relatively low kappa multirater agreement
value (0.355). There were only five (20%) cases where all
the experts made the same prediction. In all of these, the
outcome was as predicted and the EuResist system
prediction agreed with the opinion of the experts.
The mean  SD coefficient of variation for the quantitative prediction made by the experts for the individual
TCEs was also relatively high (55.9  22.4%). However, the
significant correlation between the quantitative prediction
generated by EuResist and the average quantitative
prediction provided by the experts showed a strong
positive relationship (Pearson r 5 0.695, Po0.0001), with
considerable inter-individual variation.
According to the BlandAltman plot (Fig. 3), the difference
between the quantitative predictions given by the experts
and by the EuResist engine is independent of the mean of the
two values, indicating that there was no systematic error
related to the magnitude of the predicted probability.

Analysis of cases mislabelled by the EuResist engine and
by most human experts
A closer look at the individual TCEs revealed four cases where
the EuResist engine as well as eight or nine of the human
experts made incorrect calls. Two patients had an unexpectedly successful response to treatment. TCE case number
12843 had an HIV-1 genotype showing NNRTI resistance, the
key PI mutations G48V, V82A and L90M and thymidine
analogue mutation (TAM) pattern 1 with a T215C revertant
variant. The patient was treated with stavudine, abacavir
and lopinavir/ritonavir and had a partial response, with a
reduction in HIV-1 RNA load from 72 300 to 314 copies/mL,
representing a 2.36 log10 copies/mL reduction, which met the
definition of success. TCE case number 14503 referred to a
patient treated with stavudine, efavirenz and lopinavir/
ritonavir who had a very low CD4 count nadir (8 cells/mL)
and a high baseline viral load (794 328 copies/mL). The HIV-1
genotype included the PI mutations G48V, V82C and I84V,
the NNRTI mutation Y181C and the NRTI mutations M41L,
D67N, L74V, L210W and K219E, and again a revertant T215C
codon. Similar to the previous case, viral load decreased by
2.90 log10 copies/mL but was still detectable at follow-up.
Notably, viraemia rebounded to 14 900 copies/mL at a later
time during the same therapy. The other two cases mislabelled by the EuResist system and by most of the experts
were failures predicted as successes. Case 25745 referred to a
patient treated with tenofovir and lamivudine with boosted
atazanavir. Although multiple NRTI (TAMs plus L74I and
M184V) and NNRTI (Y181I) mutations were present, the
baseline protease was wild type. However, there was a past
genotype record showing I84V. The viral load did not
decrease at all. Case 43708 referred to a patient treated with

of agreement [1.96 standard deviation (SD)].

clinical practice, genotype interpretation systems have
gradually evolved into more clinically oriented tools
designed to predict response to treatment in vivo. Accordingly, currently available rule-based systems have been
partly derived from statistical learning based on virological
response data. Next-generation, fully data-driven engines,
including the RDI system [13] and EuResist [14], have been
developed to predict response to a combination of drugs
rather than to the individual drugs, thus moving a step
further towards clinical needs. The EuResist model
computes an input that consists of HIV-1 genotype and
therapy information, complemented by several optional
patient and virus features, and returns the probability of
short-term success for any given combination treatment.

We were able to make a retrospective comparison of the
performance of the EuResist engine with 10 HIV drug
resistance experts opinions on a set of 25 cases derived
from patients harbouring drug-resistant virus. The number
of cases was deliberately limited so that it would take a
reasonable amount of time for the participants to complete
the study. As a cautionary note, it must be taken into
account that the cases were selected from the EIDB rather
than from an external source, although these cases have
never been used during the development of the EuResist
model. Moreover, the EIDB, including data from more than
100 different clinics in four countries, is likely to represent
great diversification in drug prescription attitudes and
patient populations.

EuResist vs. experts (EVE) study 217

Overall, the EuResist engine performed at least as well as
the human experts. The lowest number of incorrect calls in
the binary classification of success and failure was in fact
made by EuResist and by only one of the experts. To mimic
clinical practice, the experts had access to the entire
available patient history, including all CD4 cell counts and
viral load measurements, past treatments and HIV-1
genotypes. It should be noted that the current version of
EuResist does not include past viraemia levels and only
simple surrogate markers of previous drug exposure, less
detailed than those made available to the experts, are taken
into account. Thus, the experts could consider some extra
information over and above that considered by the expert
system. However, it could be argued that the experts did
not have any familiarity with the patients and the design
thus failed to reproduce the real scenario where doctor
patient interaction plays a key role, particularly in
assessing patient commitment to therapy. A prospective
study comparing standard of care supplemented or not by
the EuResist system is required to evaluate appropriately
the potential role of the engine in clinical practice. By
design, this study did not allow assessment of whether (and
by how much) taking into account the patient and virus
data not included in the minimal TCE definition increased
the accuracy of the prediction. However, such additional
information has been consistently found to increase
accuracy in several recent studies using rule-based or
data-driven systems [13,18,19].
The correlation between the average quantitative prediction made by the experts and the quantitative prediction
computed by EuResist was statistically significant. However, the agreement among the individual experts was
rather low, both in the binary classification and in the
quantitative score. This highlights the complexity of
choosing an antiretroviral treatment in patients harbouring
drug-resistant virus which results in frequent discordances
in experts opinions. Consistent with this complexity, it
should also be emphasized that the best result achieved in
this study still labelled incorrectly as much as one-quarter
of the treatment cases. Unknown adherence issues and the
possibility that hidden drug-resistant minority species
impaired response to treatment are among the most likely,
although not verified, reasons for prediction errors.
The inclusion of some currently obsolete therapies (e.g. use
of nelfinavir or stavudine in five cases) and the lack of novel
antiretroviral drug classes in the test data set may have been
a limitation of the study. However, most of the therapies were
not outdated and in addition are clearly relevant for most of
the low- to middle-income areas where antiretroviral coverage has recently expanded. The free web service provided by
the EuResist network may be particularly effective in these
settings. Several high-genetic-barrier drugs such as daruna-

r

vir, tipranavir and etravirine could not be considered for
training the EuResist engine because of a shortage of data
and thus could not be included in the study data set. The
updated version of the EuResist engine recently made
available online (version 2.0) can now also compute the
response to these three drugs. It remains to be established
how the expert system would perform with respect to human
experts for these high-genetic-barrier drugs. This is clearly
relevant because predicting the activity of such drugs is
crucial in the current antiretroviral therapy situation, at least
in Western countries. Also, drugs belonging to novel classes
such as integrase inhibitors and coreceptor antagonists
cannot be included in the computations because of the
scarcity of available treatment cases and/or a lack of virus
genotype information.
The TCE definition itself had its own limitations. First, a
short follow-up time was employed because EuResist was
trained to predict response at 8 weeks. Short-term response is
directly related to antiviral activity on the majority virus
population and is usually less complicated by confounding
factors, such as adherence or toxicity, than long-term
response. However, with the availability of novel welltolerated long-lasting therapies, the goal shifts to prediction
of longer-term response. While the aim of the study was to
predict the 8-week response because the EuResist engine had
been trained on that follow-up time, post hoc intention-totreat analysis at 24 weeks (not shown) confirmed an accuracy
of 0.78 for EuResist compared with an average accuracy of
0.71 for the human experts. The next update of the EuResist
engine is also planned to focus on the 24-week response.
Secondly, the definition of virological success was based on a
single follow-up viral load measurement. In some cases,
treatment success was reached at a later time-point under the
same therapy (data not shown), making definition of the case
as a failure questionable [15].
Despite the limitations, this study suggests that a datadriven and clinically oriented expert system can predict the
response to antiretroviral therapy as accurately as, and in
most cases better than, HIV drug resistance experts. The
engine is not intended to replace the HIV specialist but
rather to be an advisory tool. Updates and upgrades are
required to exploit the full potential of this and other datadriven expert systems. Treatment response data from
patients treated with the novel drugs are critically needed
to enable new regimens to be included in the engine set.
Integrating new drugs into the system has required more
than 1 year because of the need to collect a sufficient
amount of training data and retrain and validate the
system. Clearly, early access to drug resistance data derived
from Phase III clinical trials, once the drugs have been
licensed, is a critical step for reducing this delay. Also, the
TCE collection must include instances from patients

infected with all the different HIV-1 clades to weight a
possible impact of HIV-1 natural variability on treatment.
An expanded, publicly available TCE repository could be
the best way of providing a common source for training
and testing treatment decision support tools. It is hoped
that the scientific community and regulatory bodies will
endorse such an initiative to further improve clinical
management of HIV-1 drug resistance.
