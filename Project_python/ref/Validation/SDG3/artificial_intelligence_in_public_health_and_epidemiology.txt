Summary

Objectives: To introduce and summarize current research in the
field of Public Health and Epidemiology Informatics.
Methods: The 2017 literature concerning public health and
epidemiology informatics was searched in PubMed and Web of
Science, and the returned references were reviewed by the two
section editors to select 14 candidate best papers. These papers
were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers to provide the editorial team with an enlightened vision to select the best papers.
Results: Among the 843 references retrieved from PubMed and
Web of Science, two were finally selected as best papers. The
first one analyzes the relationship between the disease, social/
mass media, and public emotions to understand public overreaction (leading to a noticeable reduction of social and economic
activities) in the context of a nation-wide outbreak of Middle
East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Korea in 2015. The second
paper concerns a new methodology to de-identify patient notes in
electronic health records based on artificial neural networks that
outperformed existing methods.
Conclusions: Surveillance is still a productive topic in public
health informatics but other very important topics in Public
Health are appearing. For example, the use of artificial intelligence approaches is increasing.

Introduction
As quoted in the synopsis of the Public
Health and Epidemiology Informatics
section of the 2017 IMIA Yearbook [1],
precision public/global health and digital
epidemiology are terms that are still in
use in 2018 [2,3]. The first term is about
providing the right intervention to the
right population at the right time [2]. The
second term is about the use of digital data,
especially those that were not collected on
purpose, to answer epidemiologic questions
[3]. Both refer to the unforeseen opportunities provided by our digital world and
new technologies. Although genomics (and
more broadly any -omics) data continue
to contribute, as it is the case for precision
medicine, there are many other sources of
information that can be used: social networks, internet search engines, cell phone
data, electronic health data, and more. The
challenge today is to analyze these big
data in a meaningful way. One recently
improved method that showed very nice
success especially in image analysis is deep
learning [4]. Applications of this method
appear to be only limited by the quantity
of information available. Predicting the unplanned readmission at the hospital within
6 months based on electronic health data
[5], de-identifying electronic health records
(EHRs) [6], analyzing social media [79]
are various types of applications relevant
in epidemiology and public health. But
artificial intelligence covers many other
techniques, such as machine learning
approaches and statistical learning that

offer a panel of methods which usefulness
is only limited by pairing them with the
right question; the two best papers of this
year section are very good examples [6,7].
Navely mining any large dataset will not
give immediate answers. Epidemiologic
approaches start with clever and appropriate
questions, careful collection of relevant
data with the most appropriate design, and
validation of the results.

Paper Selection
A comprehensive literature search was performed using two bibliographic databases,
Pubmed/Medline (from NCBI, National
Center for Biotechnology Information), and
Web of Science (from Thomson Reuters).
The search was targeted at public health and
epidemiology papers that involve computer
science or the massive amount of web-generated data. References addressing the
topics of the other sections of the Yearbook,
such as those related to interoperability
between data providers were excluded from
our search. The study was performed at the
beginning of January 2018, and the search
over the year 2017 returned a total of 843
references.
Articles were separately reviewed by the
two section editors, and were first classified into three categories: keep, discard, or
leave pending. Then, the keep and leave
pending lists of references built by the two
section editors were merged, yielding 97
references. The two section editors jointly

Thiebaut et al.

reviewed the 97 references and drafted a
consensual list of 14 candidate best papers.
All pre-selected 14 papers were then peer-reviewed by Yearbook editors and external
reviewers (at least four reviewers per paper).
Two papers were finally selected as best papers (Table 1). A content summary of these
selected papers can be found in the appendix
of this synopsis. Lamy et al. [10] describe
the whole selection process.

Outlook and Conclusion

The other topic covered by several of the
papers selected by the review process concerned the analysis of online social media
to better understand the attitudes and beliefs
toward a given topic, such as vaccination. A
social network analysis of Twitter messages
(tweets) revealed a semantic network
for positive, negative, and neutral vaccine
sentiment [9]. Beyond this type of analysis, it is fruitful to predict and understand
the dynamics of vaccinating behavior. In
another paper, Pananos et al. modeled the
interaction between vaccination decisions
and disease dynamics where one influences
another in a nonlinear feedback loop [17].
They used the theory of critical transitions to
derive indicators that may help public health
officials anticipate when resistance to vaccination might develop and intensify. They
applied their approach to data from tweets
and Google searches around the Disneyland
measles outbreak that occurred in 2015 in
California [17]. One of the two best papers
described below, analyzed the relationship
between Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS), mass media, and public emotions
during an outbreak in 2015 in Korea [7].
Digital materials such as tweets are also
a potential tool for communication in public
health [18, 19] with hopefully an improvement of knowledge and attitudes. However,
the indicators and the methods to be used for
evaluating social media must be adapted to
this specific context. Digital tools used in
epidemiology need to be validated as any
other measure [20].
Last but not least, it is important to question how interventions and new knowledge
generate corresponding changes in public
health performance. This is where indicators,
measures are needed [21].

As expected in this section of the Yearbook,
the use of digital sources for infectious diseases surveillance leads to many research
reports [11]. The originality here is the use
of data coming from the EHR [12], Twitter
[8], or the climate data produced by the US
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with software [13] dedicated
to following the occurrence of infectious
disease epidemics of either influenza [8,12]
or malaria [13]. All these studies demonstrating the feasibility of new approaches
for the surveillance of infectious diseases
still need to be validated for confirming
their predictive accuracy and generalizability. Interestingly, we also found studies
reporting the results of the surveillance of
non-infectious diseases, e.g., road traffic
crashes [14] and elevated blood pressure
[15]. Road traffic injuries represent a public
health issue in low-income countries [16].
Therefore, improvement of surveillance
systems is required. Bonnet et al. [14] have
experimented a simple affordable approach
based on the citys National Police road
crash intervention service equipped with
geotracers that geolocalized the crash sites
and sent their positions by short message
service (SMS) to a surveillance platform
developed by using the open-source tool,
Ushahidi. This system implemented in
partnership with the National Police in the
city of Ouagadougou required acceptance by
officers and authorities. In the other study,
the authors showed a new validation of the
use of EHR for public health purposes. Here
they reproduced the seasonability of blood
pressure variations (with a peak in summer)
based on the data extracted from EHRs [15].

Large-scale machine learning of media
outlets for understanding public reactions
to nation-wide viral infection outbreaks
Methods Inf Med 2017;129:509
Analyzing digital media for understanding
public reaction is a current hot topic in Public
Health informatics. In this paper, Choi et al.
studied, in the context of a nation-wide outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS) in Korea in 2015, the relationship
between the disease, social/mass media, and
public emotions. They used a sophisticated ap-

IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2018

proach collecting data from 153 news media in
Korea (articles and comments representing 86
millions words), generating a dictionary, and
performing data analysis based on statistical
learning methods (including latent Dirichlet
allocation). Then, they analyzed the interplay
of public reaction with the epidemics using
transfer entropy. The methodological approach
and the results are very interesting with the
proposition of a positive feedback loop created
between the mass media and public emotion
variables. The first result is an objectivation
of the high levels of fear and worries when
mining social media. The second result is the
causal interpretation starting by an overestimation of the lethal rate of MERS that led to
a high number of articles in the media which
triggered fear in the public. This public reaction likely motivated reporters to write poor
papers leading to the positive loop.

De-identification of patient notes with
recurrent neural networks

J Am Med Inform Assoc 2017;24:596606
The paper presents a new methodology
to de-identify Electronic Health Record
(EHR) based on artificial neural networks.
EHRs are representing a fabulous opportunity for researchers and investigators but
their use needs de-identification, that is
leaving out any information about name,
address, coordinates... Manual approaches
are time-consuming and present a poor
reproducibility. Statistical approaches have
been tried and compared among which
decision trees, support vector machines,
conditional random fields. This last method
has been compared in the present paper
with a completely new approach based
on artificial neural network (Long Short
Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks)
through an i2b2 challenge. The artificial
neural network approach out-performed the
previous ones being better at incorporating
context and being more flexible to variations inherent in human languages.
