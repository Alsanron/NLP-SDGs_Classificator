Critical Reasons for Crashes Investigated in the
National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey
Summary

The National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey (NMVCCS),
conducted from 2005 to 2007, was aimed at collecting on-scene
information about the events and associated factors leading up
to crashes involving light vehicles. Several facets of crash occurrence were investigated during data collection, namely the precrash movement, critical pre-crash event, critical reason, and the
associated factors. A weighted sample of 5,470 crashes was investigated over a period of two and a half years, which represents an
estimated 2,189,000 crashes nationwide. About 4,031,000 vehicles,
3,945,000 drivers, and 1,982,000 passengers were estimated to have
been involved in these crashes. The critical reason, which is the
last event in the crash causal chain, was assigned to the driver in
94 percent (2.2%) of the crashes. In about 2 percent (0.7%) of the
crashes, the critical reason was assigned to a vehicle components
failure or degradation, and in 2 percent (1.3%) of crashes, it was
attributed to the environment (slick roads, weather, etc.). Among
an estimated 2,046,000 drivers who were assigned critical reasons,
recognition errors accounted for about 41 percent (2.1%), decision errors 33 percent (3.7%), and performance errors 11 percent
(2.7%) of the crashes.

Introduction

Databases such as the National Automotive Sampling System
(NASS) Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) do not provide information on pre-crash scenarios and the reason underlying the critical pre-crash events. In 2005, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) was authorized under Section 2003(c)
of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation Equity
Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to conduct a national survey to collect on-scene data pertaining to events and associated
factors that possibly contributed to crash occurrence. NHTSAs
National Center for Statistics and Analysis (NCSA) conducted
NMVCCS from July 3, 2005, to December 31, 2007. Crashes were
investigated at the crash scene to collect driver, vehicle, and environment-related information pertaining to crash occurrence, with
a focus on drivers role. The targeted information was captured
mainly through four data elements: (i) movement prior to critical pre-crash event (i.e., the movement of the vehicle immediately
before the occurrence of the critical event); (ii) critical pre-crash
event (i.e., the circumstance that led to vehicles first impact); (iii)
critical reason for the critical pre-crash event (i.e., the immediate
reason for the critical event, which is often the last failure in the
causal chain of events leading up to the crash); and (iv) the crashassociated factors (i.e., the factors that are likely to add to the probability of crash occurrence). This was done with reference to the
95% conf. limits:  t/2; deg. freedom  Std. Dev. ( = 0.05, t-value = 2.179)

crash envelope that comprises of a sequence of events, referring to
the above data elements, which eventually led to the crash.
This CrashStats presents some statistics related to one of the
four data elements, namely critical reason for the critical precrash event. The data obtained through the sample of 5,470
NMVCCS crashes and the weights associated with them were
used to obtain national estimates of frequencies and percentages
along with their 95-percent confidence limits, as presented in the
following sections.

Critical Reasons for the Critical PreCrash Event

The critical reason is the immediate reason for the critical pre-crash event
and is often the last failure in the causal chain of events leading up to the
crash. Although the critical reason is an important part of the description
of events leading up to the crash, it is not intended to be interpreted as the
cause of the crash nor as the assignment of the fault to the driver, vehicle,
or environment.
A critical reason can be assigned to a driver, vehicle, or environment. Normally, one critical reason was assigned per crash, based
upon NMVCCS researchers crash assessment. The critical reason
was assigned to the driver in an estimated 94 percent (2.2%) of
the crashes (Table 1). In addition, the critical reason was assigned
to the vehicle in an estimated 2 percent (0.7%) and to the environment in about 2 percent (1.3%) of the crashes.

Critical reason attributed to drivers

The critical reason was assigned to drivers in an estimated 2,046,000
crashes that comprise 94 percent of the NMVCCS crashes at the
national level. However, in none of these cases was the assignment
intended to blame the driver for causing the crash. The driver1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20590

related critical reasons are broadly classified into recognition
errors, decision errors, performance errors, and non-performance
errors. Statistics in Table 2 show that the recognition error, which
included drivers inattention, internal and external distractions,
and inadequate surveillance, was the most (41% 2.2%) frequently
assigned critical reason. Decision error such as driving too fast
for conditions, too fast for the curve, false assumption of others
actions, illegal maneuver and misjudgment of gap or others speed
accounted for about 33 percent (3.7%) of the crashes. In about 11
percent (2.7%) of the crashes, the critical reason was performance
error such as overcompensation, poor directional control, etc.
Sleep was the most common critical reason among non-performance errors that accounted for 7 percent (1.0%) of the crashes.
Other driver errors were recorded as critical reasons for about 8
percent (1.9%) of the drivers.

Critical reason attributed to environment

The critical reason was assigned to about 2 percent of the estimated 2,189,000 NMVCCS crashes. However, none of these is
suggestive of the cause of the crash. Table 4 presents statistics
related to crashes in which the critical reason was attributed
to roadway and atmospheric conditions. In about 50 percent
(14.5%) of the 52,000 crashes the critical reason was attributed
to slick roads. Glare as a critical reason accounted for about 17
percent (16.7%) of the environment-related crashes, and view
obstruction was assigned in 11 percent (7.2%) of the crashes.
Signs and signals accounted for 3 percent (2.5%) of such
crashes. In addition, in 52,000 of the crashes with a critical reason attributed to the environment, the weather condition (fog/
rain/snow) was cited in 4 percent (2.9%) of the crashes.

Table 4. Environment-Related Critical Reasons

Critical reason attributed to vehicles

The critical reason was assigned to vehicles in an estimated
44,000 crashes comprising about 2 percent of the NMVCCS
crashes, though none of these reasons implied a vehicle causing the crash. There were no detailed inspections of vehicles
during the NMVCCS on-scene crash investigation; the vehiclerelated critical reasons were mainly inferred through external
visual inspection of the vehicle components. This resulted in
only mostly external, easily visible factors (tires, brakes, steering
column, etc.) that were cited as the few vehicle-related critical
reasons. The related statistics may not, therefore, be representative of the role of other internal vehicle related problems that
might have led to the crash. Of the small percentage (2%) of the
crashes in which the critical reason was assigned to the vehicle,
the tire problem accounted for about 35 percent (11.4%) of the
crashes. Brake related problems as critical reasons accounted for
about 22 percent (15.4%) of such crashes. Steering/suspension/
transmission/engine-related problems were assigned as critical reasons in 3 percent (3.3%) of such crashes. Other vehicle-
related problems coded as critical reasons were assigned in
about 40 percent (24.0%) percent of such crashes.
