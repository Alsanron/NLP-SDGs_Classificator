Abstract
Background and Objective: Machine learning has been widely accepted and applied in different fields to analyze data, but it is still novel
in the field of neonatal diseases, especially neonatal apnea prediction. Apnea is a breathing problem associated with pathological changes
in heart rate and oxygen saturation and is a common occurrence in neonates especially those who are born preterm. This study is focused
on prediction of apnea episodes during the first week of childs birth using machine learning algorithms. Materials and Methods: The
data consists of 229 examples of neonates admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Kasturba hospital, Manipal, Karnataka, India.
This data is preprocessed and used to develop classification model using machine learning techniques such as decision tree (C5.0),
Support Vector Machine (SVM) and ensemble approach, which includes random forest for prediction of apnea episodes. Results: The
study compares models (decision tree, SVM and ensemble approach such as random forest) for accuracy. Among the results
obtained, an accuracy of 0.88 and kappa of 0.72 using random forest algorithm for mtry three is found to be the most accurate model.
Conclusion: The research work provides an automated machine learning based solution that helps clinicians predict apnea in neonates
during the first week of their life. Inclusion of contextual information and preprocessing technique along with heterogeneous ensemble
approach may further improve the models performance.
Key words: Machine learning, neonatal apnea, resampling techniques, support vector machine ensemble approach, bagging, boosting, random forest

(C5.0) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for
classifying neonates with presence or absence of apnea
episodes. In order to solve the Class imbalance problem
discussed in Zeng and Gao15, the study uses concepts such as
under and oversampling of data. Lastly to achieve better
diversity and improve accuracy ensemble approach has been

INTRODUCTION
A child in his first hundred days of life is called a neonate.
Babies born prior to 37 weeks of gestation are considered
premature or preterm1. Nearly 80% of neonatal death occurs
within first week of birth and as many as 2.9 million children
die in the first month of their birth in India every year,
according to World Health Organization (WHO) survey2.
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is a place where neonates

such as heart rate, respiration rate and blood oxygen levels are
vital for monitoring neonatal health which needs to be
checked at regular intervals.

from Institutional Ethics committee of Manipal University. The
data includes 229 examples of neonatal apnea, each with
23 features. The class label is defined with yes as presence of
apnea episodes and no as absence. The 22 numeric features
consist of (a) Demographic such as gestation age, growth
categorization, birth cry, birth weight, (b) Maternal covariates
includes delivery mode, surfactant and steroids etc. and
(c) Physiological such as heart rate on 24, 48 and 72 h time
frame etc.

pathological changes in heart rate and oxygen saturation, is
common occurrence in sick neonates3. Apnea in preterm is
related to immaturity of the central nervous system and is
called Apnea Of Prematurity (AOP). The most widely used
definition of AOP specifies a pause in breathing for more than
15-20 sec, or accompanied by oxygen desaturation (blood
oxygen saturation (SpO2) #80% for $4 sec) and bradycardia
(heart rate <100 per minute for $4 sec), in infants born less
than 37 weeks of gestation4. Neonates born less than 34 weeks
of gestation should be monitored for the first week of life
till the absence of all apneic episodes. Whereas, for the
neonates born with more than 34 weeks gestation continuous

a combination of summary statistics such as mean, median,
variance, counts and visualization techniques. Problems
revealed by data summaries in the apnea data set includes
missing values, invalid values or outliers, range and units. In
fact visualization and graphical techniques are used to identify
these problems in the data. Visualization techniques identify
the problems within the data and further examines the
distribution of numeric variables. Preprocessing steps
include data cleaning, transformation, normalization, feature
selection and sampling for modelling and validation.

Machine learning has been widely used in health domain

been used in neonatal disease diagnosis and prediction of

study which is nothing but presence of rare positive examples
and numerous negative ones in the dataset. Techniques which
are used to handle the problem include resampling of positive
class called over sampling, random elimination of tuples
from negative class called under sampling and ensemble
techniques. Ensemble techniques used in this study
are: (a) Bagged decision tree with default 25 decision trees

Filter approach was used to estimate variable importance
based on ROC curve. Importance values in Fig. 2 revealed
that heart rate on day 1, gestation age and delivery mode
attributes were the top three most important attributes in the
dataset and the head circumference and echo attributes were
the least important ones. Once the feature selection was done
and data being preprocessed, it was given as input to the
classification model. The data set was divided into two
different randomized sets called training set and testing set
with 70:30 representative ratio. Next section describes the
algorithms used for the prediction of apnea episodes with its

RESULTS

Decision tree (C5.0) algorithm and SVM using radial kernel:

For the purpose of this study, all algorithms were
developed using R, a statistical computing and data analysis
tool. Based on the exploring and preprocessing process
described in the previous section, collected data from NICU
was preprocessed as per the requirement of the algorithm. As
apnea data set consists of features having fewer percentage
of missing values, the columns had not been dropped and the
missing values were not replaced with mean of the column
total. However, for categorical features, a new category with
value 0 was added for missing values. For features wherein
the relationship between input and output is not linear,
discretization techniques were applied for continuous
variables. This study had used normalization techniques such
as min max normalization and Z score normalization since
data distribution is roughly symmetrical. Feature selection was

Evaluation was on training data using C5.0 includes 152 cases
with 22 predictors. The model correctly classified all but 19 of
the 152 training instances for an error rate of 12.5%. Decision
trees are known to over fit the model to the training data. For
this reason, the error rate reported on the training data may be
overly optimistic and it is especially important to evaluate
decision trees on the test data set. Table 1 represents the
confusion matrix where out of 76 test records, model correctly
predicted that 54 have no apnea episodes and 3 have apnea,
resulting in an accuracy of 0.75 and error rate of 0.25.
Sensitivity of the model was 0.20 which means model could
not predict a true positive rate efficiently, i.e. the presence of
apnea in neonates. Figure 3 represents visualization of
decision tree with relevant features such as gestation age,
heart rate, feeding intolerance, echo, birth weight and
maternal covariates (surfactant and dexa2).

Fig. 3: Representing resulting decision tree
Building a model using SVM deals with right choice of
kernel with its best parameter values and C a user predefined
cost penalty parameter function. Choice of user defined
penalty parameter C has an impact on the accuracy of the
classifier. Here we had used radial kernel with 10 fold cross
validation method to select the best parameter values. Model
was trained with randomized training set using radial kernel
with parameter values of gamma (0.01) and cost (10). Based
on the confusion matrix represented in Table 2 accuracy of the
model found was 0.75, with sensitivity of 0.28 and specificity
of 0.72.
To improve the accuracy further, the apnea data set was
resampled for effective generation of relatively balanced class
distribution. Resampling techniques such as Under sampling
and over sampling methods were used for the comparison
of decision trees and SVM as shown in Table 3. The resampled
data set consists of: (a) Under sampled method which creates
a subset of the original dataset by randomly or selectively
deleting some of the samples of the majority class while

sensitivity and specificity remains to be moderate. From the
results it is inferred that a large data set containing a balanced
sample improves the utility of the model. Further the result of
random forest method with mtry = 3 is found to be the most
accurate model on the apnea data set used in this study. The
current work is compared with the work of Williamson et al.13,14

uses a voting technique to create an ensemble. With Kappa
statistics of 0.69 and with accuracy of 0.85, the bagged tree
model performs better than C5.0 decision tree. The random
forest by default creates an ensemble of 500 trees that
consider square root of feature at each split. After the
ensemble of trees is generated the model uses a voting
technique to combine the tree predictions. To get the most
accurate comparison of model performance, 10 fold cross
validation was used with a tuning grid for the random forest.
The only tuning parameter for this model was mtry, which is
an integer specifying the number of features randomly
selected at each split. The random forest uses square root
feature function to select the mtry with a grid values of 3, 6, 11
and 22. Kappa was used to select the optimal model using the
largest value. The final value used for the model was mtry = 3
as shown in Table 4. Lastly the results of random forest were
compared with boosted C5.0 decision tree with 10, 20, 30, 40
trials shown in Table 5. Accuracy was used to select the
optimal model using the largest Kappa value. Among all
8 models with accuracy = 0.88 and kappa = 0.72, random
forest with mtry = 3 was found to be the most accurate model.

CONCLUSION
Currently in the field of health care, clinicians manually
diagnose apnea in neonates and subsequently administer
treatment. The study provides an automated machine
learning-based solution that helps clinicians Predict apnea
in neonates during the first week of their life. Furthermore the
use of ensemble techniques to improve the prediction
accuracy has also been demonstrated. Class imbalance
problem is found to be the major issue in the dataset used for
predicting apnea. In fact resampling, under sampling, over
sampling and ensemble approaches can lead to higher
accuracy of the algorithms in the case of class imbalance.
Indeed bagging stabilizes decision trees and improves
accuracy by reducing variance and further it can reduce
generalization errors. Random forest improves decision tree
performance by de-correlating individual trees in the bagging
ensembles and also with variable importance measure it can
help in determining which variables are contributing the most
strongly to the model. Future study includes: (a) Applying
heterogeneous ensemble approaches on the apnea data set

DISCUSSION
Accuracy of the apnea data set with SVM as well as
decision tree is found to be moderate but sensitivity is low as
data being highly imbalanced. With under sampled data the
accuracy and specificity decreases with slight increase in
sensitivity. Further with oversampled data the accuracy,

and subsequently compare with current study results and

other neonatal diseases such as jaundice, respiratory distress
