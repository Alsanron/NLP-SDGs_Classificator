Abstract Hypertension is the main cause of maternal death.
Preeclampsia can affect pregnant women before or during
pregnancy. Identification of patients with higher risk for
preeclampsia allows some precautions that are taken to prevent
its severe disease and subsequent complications. In medicine,
there are different situations that deal with a large range of
information, which needs a thorough assessment to be able to
help experts in the decision-making process. Smart decision
support systems allow grouping all existing information and
finding pertinent information from it. Bayesian networks offer
models that allow the information capture and handle situations
of uncertainty. This paper proposes the construction of a system
to support intelligent decision applied to the diagnosis of
preeclampsia using Bayesian networks to help experts in the
pregnants care. The processes of qualitative and quantitative
modeling to the construction of a network are also presented. The
main contribution of this work includes the presentation of a
Bayesian network built to help decision makers in moments of
uncertainty in care of pregnant women.

INTRODUCTION

The quality of care provided by health services for pregnant
women is the most important action to control maternal
mortality. Access to these services presents a major impact on
these reductions, since they have enough quality to identify
risks. Information systems offer the ability to monitor and
evaluate the pregnant health notifying the experts in good time
about a given complication that can occur during pregnancy.
This allows the physicians make better decisions on diagnosis
and establish better medical procedures and treatment.
The most frequently diseases during pregnancy are
infectious, especially those that reach the urinary tract. These
diseases can cause severe complications like increasing the risk
of miscarriage and anticipation of the birth labor. However, the
main concerns of obstetricians are related to metabolic
syndromes such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes,
which are more fatal for both mothers and babies.
Preeclampsia occurs when a pregnant woman has high
blood pressure (above 140/90 mmHg) at any time after the 20th
pregnancy week and disappears before 12 weeks postpartum

[1]. Besides high blood pressure, other complications such as
excessive protein in the urine should occur in a diagnosis of
preeclampsia. In [2], the authors identify high-risk pregnancy
complaints and propose a method that analyses the Doppler
signal to identify these conditions. Conclusions show that
complications with pregnancy are associated with hypertensive
disorders (preeclampsia), intra-uterine growth restriction of
fetus, and gestational diabetes mellitus. In [3], the importance
of a reliable diagnosis with accurate measurement of blood
pressure and proteinuria is discussed. The authors also present
cases where preeclampsia goes undiagnosed due to lack of
appropriate equipment and limited resources in laboratories.
Cheng et al. [4] analyze the relationship between the blood
pressure and risk factors of pregnant women. To determine the
effects over gestational age a varying coefficient model was
established. Results show that effects of known risk factors
change with gestational age. This result is an important
knowledge for understanding the causes of gestational
hypertension. In [5] the authors investigate the alterations in
the progress of a normal pregnancy and pregnancy disorders
associated with hypertension. This research work uses the Joint
Symbolic Dynamics method. Mukherjee et al. [6] use
Discriminant Analysis and k-means clustering to predict
preeclampsia based on lipid parameters. This technique is used
to separate the pregnant women in two groups named
preeclampsia and control, so that a new patient can be
classified into any of these groups according to estimated
values of the parameters. In this context, several efforts have
been performed in order to develop a system for giving support
to experts in pregnants care. Then, this work aims to
investigate how Bayesian networks can support clinicians to
identify high-risk pregnancy. It proposes the use of a statistical
model based on Bayesian networks to better classify the
seriousness of a problem helping the decision-makers in
uncertainty moments. These systems applied to healthcare offer
the possibility to monitor and evaluate pregnants health and
notify any complications that can occur during the pregnancy
in a due time. The main contribution of this work includes a
proposal of a smart system based on Bayesian networks to
support decision makers in pregnant women monitoring using
the Noisy-or classifier.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section
II describes the use of Bayesian networks on healthcare, while
Section III shows the network modeling and the construction of
the tables of probabilities. Performance comparison of the
proposed method, in comparison with other available
approaches, and results analysis are considered in Section IV.
Finally, Section V provides the conclusion and suggestions for
future works.
II. BAYESIAN NETWORKS ON HEALTHCARE
This section addresses the use Bayesian networks in
healthcare. The use of this technique on the proposal presented
in this paper is also considered.
Bayesian networks are a methodology for the construction
of systems that rely on probabilistic knowledge. These systems
function with uncertain and incomplete knowledge through of
Bayesian Probability Theory. Teles et al. [7] propose the use of
a context-aware platform based on Bayesian networks to
support the experts decision-making in public health systems.
This study is focused on scenarios of dengue. Results show that
the use of ontologies together with a Bayesian networks
approach makes the prediction more refined. Bobba et al. [8]
present a data based DSS that uses a Bayesian approach to
merge gene expression data into prognostic models. This
system integrates information from earlier experiments to
predict the disease state. Future works proposes the
implementation of this research on other pathologies for
prevention and treatment. Huang et al. [9] use data mining
techniques to extract rules and relationships between diseases
using patient medical records. This study used an ensemble of
classifiers like Nave Bayes and J-48 to try to improve the
prediction performance of several diseases. Results showed a
small improvement of the accuracy, sensitivity, and F-measure.
Hannan et al. [10] describe an intelligent DSS built with
artificial intelligence mechanisms. This system uses a Bayesian
inference mechanism to identify the confidence level for each
possible cause. The preliminary results show that this system is
able to assist people in decision-making process.
Kachroo et al. [11] compared three classifiers using
machine-learning techniques to project cancer incidence and
mortality. This research evaluates the performance of these
classifiers, examining the accuracy of each method. The results
show that Nave Bayes classifier provides the best results.
Researchers plan advances in developing nonlinear models for
projection of future cancer occurrences. Qian et al. [12]
developed a framework that uses the naive Bayesian classifier
to measure the risk probability caused by lesions in the
coronary artery. Results show a potential to reduce medical
expenses avoiding unnecessary test and treatment. In [13], the
authors propose a computational model to classify stages of
heart failure. They evaluate the best classifier like Nave
Bayesian, Support Vector Machine, and Radial Basis Function
Network to offer a quantitative tool to facilitate the early
diagnosis. Authors proposed that further works should analyze
other intelligent algorithms to keep improving the best found
classifier. In [14], the authors use Bayesian networks to assist
the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. This approach is
modeled using conditional probability tables. Results show the
model can be efficient for diagnosis of anxiety disorder.

Based on the related literature analysis, next section will
describe a mathematical model based on Bayesian networks
that can assist decision makers in uncertain times to diagnose
and evaluate the gravity of hypertension in pregnant women.
III. BAYESIAN NETWORKS MODELING OF HYPERTENSION
Information about the diagnosis of hypertension in pregnant
women is essential to create a smart system designed to support
the decision-making in healthcare. In this proposed model the
network nodes three groups can be considered: i) Risk factors 
variables that activate physiological mechanisms; ii)
Physiological mechanisms  functioning model of diseases
related to preeclampsia; and iii) Symptoms/exams  physical
manifestations of disease and test results. The network nodes
are presented in Table I.

The expert can put (or not) nodes in the network according
to the amount of the available information. After realization of
the inference process, the expert will obtain the conditional
probability of the other network nodes. Proteinuria and
Hypertension nodes will provide the biggest contribution for
decision-making process. Nevertheless, the other nodes may
also be useful in the evaluation of the pregnant woman.
A subsequent stage of a Bayesian network structure
creation is the specification of their probabilities. These
probabilities can be obtained in two ways: from specialists or
from an automatic learning process from a database. It is also
possible to combine the two alternatives. Marginal probabilities
are the easiest way to find and correspond to nodes without
parents. These probabilities correspond to the prevalence of
diseases in pregnant seeking medical assistance. Graphically,

these nodes are represented in the upper part of the network.
Based on the research of Kumar et al. [15] tables of conditional
and marginal probabilities were built in Tables II and III.

Many network nodes have conditional probability in
relation to their parents. Diagnostic tests correspond that may
or may not be observed, depending on the available equipment.
The physiological nodes group represents disease
characteristics that may be difficult to measure but are
important variables for the modeling.

and

Fig. 1 illustrates an example of the application of Noisy-or
to a binary node D. Initial values for the calculation are
conditional probabilities using (2). Last step is to calculate the
joint probabilities for D, using for this the connection
probabilities.

A Bayesian network is defined by its structure and the
corresponding probabilistic model. It determines unequivocally
the joint distribution for the variables describing as mentioned
in Eq. 1.

For certain types of nodes, the conditional probabilities can
be calculated from other probabilities instead of being specified
directly. The classifier Noisy-or allows such calculation. For
medical problems, such representation is appropriate when
there is a disease with several risk factors/causes or a symptom
caused by various diseases. Using a node D with  (true) and 
(false) representing a disease, its causes are        , the
probabilities for D are given by the joint table conditional
probabilities (Eq. 2).

The Noisy-or model allows the calculation of the joint table
of conditional probabilities from probability given in (2) for
each parent node  , whilst respecting the restriction on
relatives laid earlier. Table III represents the distribution of
some conditional probability of patients with preeclampsia
given particular symptom occurring.

Fig. 1. Network with the symptoms of preeclampsia.

The use of this Bayesian network simulates various
situations that may happen during the care of pregnant in a
clinic. A physician inserts the pregnant symptoms on the
network and analyzes the values of the conditional
probabilities. At the last step, it is observed the joint probability
for preeclampsia calculated by conditional probabilities. The
result gives to the expert the percentage that a pregnant woman
has in order to develop the disease. Figure 2 shows an example
that contains the main observations and the results of the
network.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED
METHOD

For the evaluation and validation of the proposed method a
case study is performed. It will use information about
symptoms of patients in different hypertension severity.

Fig. 2. Bayesian network to support physicians in the process of decision-making of preeclampsia.

For the study 20 pregnant women were recruited. Fig. 2
shows the final model network, which is used as a basis for
inference of new cases. For evaluation of this approach the
networks generation based in information about symptoms
given by the health specialist were considered. Two cases
sample were randomly chosen for validate the proposed
system, observing the highest probability of each degree of
severity in gestational hypertension.

Patient

with

preeclampsia/eclampsia

In this case, the pregnant woman had high blood pressure
(BP > 140/90 mmHg), pulmonary edema, hyperflexia,
headache, nausea or vomiting, giddiness and proteinuria
(>3,5g/24h).

Fig. 3. Model of network giving to the experts a probability for each severity
of hypertension.

The network presented in Fig. 3 shows a chance of 66.7%
to this patient to present preeclampsia or eclampsia during
pregnancy.
B. Case 2: Patient with chronic hypertension with
superimposed preeclampsia.
The chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia
presents i) emergence of proteinuria (> 0,3g/24h) after the
gestational age of 20 weeks in a patient with chronic
hypertension; ii) an additional increase in proteinuria in those
who have had increase previously; iii) a sudden increase in
blood pressure in who had previously controlled levels; or iv)
clinical or laboratory abnormality characteristic of
preeclampsia. In this case the pregnant woman presented high
blood pressure (BP > 140/90 mmHg), hyperflexia, headache,
giddiness, oliguria, and traces of proteinuria.

Fig 4. Model of network preseting a probability of 66,7% for chronic
hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia.

Fig 4. also presents a probability of 66,7% for chronic
hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. This probability
can be improved with the inclusion of new data. The presented
model helps to better understand the patient's condition,
assisting the diagnostic or prognostic decisions in order to
reduce the uncertainty of current or future condition of the
patient. This approach also requires varied sources as medical
knowledge and experience. This approach requires more
clinical data to be better evaluated and compared with other
systems. However, with a large volume of data another type of
probabilistic approach is required. Considering all these
conditions, data mining can be a way to improve certainty in
the moment of decision-making.
Preeclampsia is very difficult to diagnose because it can
occur even without an increase of blood pressure and without
the presence of protein in the urine, but research is advancing
and the joint cooperation including technology, knowledge and
experience of health experts is an important path to tread.

V.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

This work focused on the construction of a smart system
designed to support a medical decision for pregnant healthcare.
The proposed decision support system used probabilistic
concepts for decision-making. A Bayesian network for the
diagnosis of preeclampsia was presented. The network
structure was obtained from medical references. Noisy-or
model was also considered in this work. The operation of the
network shows that, in certain cases, this type of modeling can
be used profitably, especially when it has a large number of
parents, and when parents have characteristics in common.
Further research work will consider other Bayesian
classifiers and evaluate the network using real cases and the
corresponding experts evaluation. This evaluation will provide
different views regarding parts of the network and will
contribute for further deployments. It is also proposed to carry
out practical experiments with the network, sensitivity analysis,
and development of a user interface and corresponding
application.
