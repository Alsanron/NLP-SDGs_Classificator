ABSTRACT Over the past decade we have witnessed the
increasing sophistication of machine learning algorithms applied in daily use from internet searches, voice recognition,
social network software to machine vision software in cameras,
phones, robots and self-driving cars. Pharmaceutical research
has also seen its fair share of machine learning developments.
For example, applying such methods to mine the growing
datasets that are created in drug discovery not only enables
us to learn from the past but to predict a molecules properties
and behavior in future. The latest machine learning algorithm
garnering significant attention is deep learning, which is an
artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers.
Publications over the last 3 years suggest that this algorithm
may have advantages over previous machine learning
methods and offer a slight but discernable edge in predictive
performance. The time has come for a balanced review of this
technique but also to apply machine learning methods such as
deep learning across a wider array of endpoints relevant to
pharmaceutical research for which the datasets are growing
such as physicochemical property prediction, formulation prediction, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and
toxicity (ADME/Tox), target prediction and skin permeation,
etc. We also show that there are many potential applications
of deep learning beyond cheminformatics. It will be important
to perform prospective testing (which has been carried out
rarely to date) in order to convince skeptics that there will be
benefits from investing in this technique.

INTRODUCTION
We have previously suggested that cheminformatics should
look to other industries that use high performance computing
approaches for inspiration (1). Six years on what is surprising is
that we may not have to look to industries but instead we
already have used the algorithms which we should be considering for cheminformatics (and other areas) in our everyday
transactions, work or social-life online. Every time we use our
smartphones with voice recognition software like Siri or read
the news on them, make a purchase on the internet via
Amazon or use our social network software, we take for
granted that we are confronted with suggestions of other products we might like to buy or friends to connect too. Large
companies such as Baidu, Google, Facebook etc. all use deep
learning in facial recognition algorithms alone. We also live in
an age in which self-driving cars and robot assistants are
emerging rapidly after decades of research. Therefore we
are literally surrounded by artificial intelligence software that
use machine learning (2) that can in many ways now predict
our needs before we know what they are. Perhaps for the first

time we may also be directly seeing a preview of how such
software tools could assist us in healthcare related research
and development. We just did not know it until now.
In the area of pharmaceutical research and development
and specifically that of cheminformatics there are many machine learning methods such as support vector machines
(SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors, Nave Bayesian, Decision
Trees etc. (3) which have seen increasing use as our datasets
have grown to become big data (47). These methods are
equally applicable in other areas and come with their own
pros and cons (3) that can be used for binary classification,
multiple classes or continuous data. The application of different computational approaches and machine learning algorithms to problems tends to follow the growth of datasets (8).
As pharmaceutical datasets started out quite small, the
methods initially used would focus on local models like
pharmacophores and quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR). In more recent years the biological data
amassed from high throughput screening and high content
screens has called for different tools to be used that can account for some of the issues with this bigger data (6). The
power of computer processing has also increased so that more
complex non-linear problems can be solved in real time with
relatively inexpensive compute resources. Many of these
resulting machine learning models can also be implemented
on a mobile phone (9,10). In recent years, there has been
increasing use of one approach called deep learning (DL),
(which builds on many years of artificial neural network research) (11), that has shown powerful advantages in learning
from images and languages (12). This may represent the next
era of cheminformatics and pharmaceutical research in general that is focused on mining the heterogeneous big data
which is accumulating using more sophisticated algorithms
such as DL.

DELVING INTO DEEP LEARNING
Standard artificial neural networks (ANN) approaches use an
input layer, hidden layer and output layer where each connection has a weight and these vary during training in order to
connect input to output data. This method has been used
widely but suffers from overfitting of data, and a poor ability
to generalize with an external dataset (3), although more recent versions such as Bayesian regularized artificial neural
networks are more difficult to overtrain (13). DL or deep neural networks (3) in many ways is similar to ANN in that it
mimics how the brain works and takes information in an
input layer but unlike ANN has many hidden layers (14) to
combine signals with different weights, passes the results successively deeper in the network until an output layer (Fig. 1).
The DL model is trained with a dataset by adjusting the
weights to give the response expected for a certain input (e.g.

if a compound is active or inactive or the level of activity/
inactivity). The ability to have multiple learnable stages makes
this approach more useful for tackling more complex problems. Deep learning can be used for unsupervised learning
and appears to work well with noisy data. However it still
suffers from the potential to over fit data, the black box problem, as well as higher computational cost than ANN or other
methods (15). There has been relatively limited application of
DL to pharmaceutical problems to date and very few in the
area of cheminformatics compared with other machine learning methods (11). DL tools are available in popular open
source statistical software such as R (16). In addition there is
TensorFlow (17), Deeplearning4j (18) while Facebook made
their deep learning software (Torch) open source (19,20)
followed a year later by Microsoft (CNTK) (21). Some of these
methods have been summarized in a recent review (22). It
should be noted that these deep learning toolkits are likely
far from plug and play type software tools for the average
scientist which they can input their molecules and data to train
a model (or for that matter any training or test datasets) and
then generate predictions. It is likely that expertise in using
these software toolkits is needed as well as integrating with
molecular descriptor software. It is more likely that a specialized programmer / statistician / cheminformatician will be
needed with knowledge of the software tools in order to generate the models which can then be made available for others
to use. Existing cheminformatics and other software companies could facilitate making deep learning more accessible to
non-expert users by developing accessible fully integrated
tools which they can use for any dataset.

APPLICATIONS OF DEEP LEARNING IN
BIOINFORMATICS
DL has seen a rapid increase in the number of publications
associated with bioinformatics (23) and computational biology
(22) and has been used in diverse applications (15) such as
protein disorder prediction (24). This resulted in a fast approach which was comparable to other machine learning approaches based on area under the curve (AUC) and recall
statistics for test datasets. While it did not out-perform the
other disorder methods it had the advantage of being fast
(24) (Table I). DL has also been used to refine docked protein
complexes (42) based on 35,000 unbound docking complexes
generated by RosettaDock and tested on 25 docking complexes not in the training set. Although this model was not
compared to other methods it resulted in RMSD of 1.40 
indicating accurate predictions (42). DL has also been used to
model structural features of RNA-binding protein targets
using CLIP-seq datasets and testing on 24 datasets using the
area under the receiver operator characteristic to evaluate the
performance which was found to be close to the state of the art

(Table I) (32). DL has been applied and compared with other
methods for mechanism of action prediction from high
content image analysis data (33) and it was found to be superior to SVM with (87.62 vs 20.95% accuracy). Although it
should be noted that the processing time was ten times longer
for DL which is likely a major limitation for learning versus
other methods (33). The preprocessing time can likely be offset
by parallelization of calculation processes.

PHARMACEUTICAL APPLICATIONS OF DEEP
LEARNING
One of the earliest applications of DL to a pharmaceutically
relevant problem was to predict aqueous solubility using four
published datasets and was shown to compare favorably to
other machine learning methods using 10 fold cross
validation (25) (Table I). DL has been used to predict the site
of epoxidation in molecules with average AUC > 94.0% for
cross validation, although this method was not compared to
additional machine learning methods (34) or used for prospective prediction. DL has been put to use with gene expression
data to learn from drugs and therapeutic categories using

pathway level or landmark gene level as data reduction
methods. In both cases after 10 fold cross validation deep
neural networks surpassed SVM used internal testing, suggesting this as a drug repurposing approach (Table I) (37). In the
area of drug formulation, predicting drug release from polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) microspheres showed deep learning to be comparable to random forest, single tree and genetic
algorithms after 10 fold cross validation (43). At Merck, deep
neural networks have been compared to random forests for
use with large QSAR datasets and out-performed random
forests for 11 out of 15 datasets (used in a Kaggle
crowdsourcing competition) and 13 of 15 datasets in a second
evaluation using time-split test sets (27). This utilization by a
major pharmaceutical company suggests there is serious interest in the approach and it is likely other companies may have
already performed similar evaluations. More frequently DL is
applied to a single dataset such as drug induced liver injury. In
this case multiple training and testing sets were used and comparison with normal neural networks was performed showing
slight improvement with DL (26). In addition, one model was
tested with 6 datasets as a form of external validation. The
accuracy of DL with DILI data was around 60% for these test
sets which is comparable to what has been seen elsewhere

Many of these datasets could likely utilize and benefit
from DL and it would be of interest to see for how
many an improvement in predictions could be obtained.

THE FUTURE OF DEEP LEARNING
While there has been recent exhaustive analysis of artificial
intelligence and its impact on jobs, ethical considerations
and geopolitical impact (82) there have been very few discussions of the potential for using DL in pharmaceutical research
(14,15). Based on the results obtained to date which admittedly have focused on internal validation with little prospective
testing as seen with other machine learning methods (Table I)
(83,84), DL appears promising and will likely see greater
application in the years ahead. Perhaps the largest example
of validation of DL models alongside other machine learning
approaches is in the case of the Tox21 Challenge. DL with
multitask learning (35) slightly outperformed the closest consensus artificial neural network method (36) across nuclear
receptor and stress response datasets (Table I).
It is yet to be seen if DL could facilitate the ultimate robot
scientist (85), as we see application to different datasets, it or
other machine learning methods may become an invisible research assistant, a tool that we take for granted to perform the
predictions we need before performing the experiments. This

data for generating deep learning

numbers of endpoints whether
quantitative or qualitative
(classification models).

may come with challenges such as how much power do we
provide to the software to make the decisions for us. Which
raises the question of whether the experiments need human
involvement at all? The rapid development of DL outside science suggests it is far from a new fad, and the impact is already
being felt in numerous areas from fraud detection to internet
search engines. So how long before DL is widespread in
pharmaceutical research (14) and what can we expect? It is
possible that DL could be the source of more predictive models
but hurdles remain on the implementation and accessibility of
models. What is clearly needed is software that is tightly integrated with the data to be modeled. This data would most
frequently reside in private or public databases and could represent many different endpoints both quantitative and qualitative (Fig. 2). Therefore any efforts to bring the molecules,
sources of data and DL algorithms together would greatly
streamline model generation and make it more accessible to
other scientists. But as with other computational modeling
approaches we may also want to consider the applicability
domain (86) and various factors such as the quality of the underlying data (87,88) which may determine the utility and relevance of a DL model for making a prediction (89).
A major concern would be how could DL shape research
and the future of science and biomedical research in particular? It is possible that DL or any machine learning method
might be able to assist by increasing the efficiency of research

Deep Learning

and perhaps rule out likely less successful avenues of research.
This is especially important in areas where research funding is
tight like rare (90) and neglected diseases (91). Any advantage
that DL could provide would be welcome in these and other
resource constrained areas as a side effect. Clearly we should
be educating the next generation of pharmaceutical researchers to use a wide array of machine learning approaches
as well as assessing the likely impact and application of DL.
Developing scientists that can generate predictions in silico and
test them in vitro or in vivo would also be welcomed. It may be
only a short time before we have vice presidents of machine
learning or DL in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. There are of course still many criticisms of these black
box machine learning approaches but it is probably now accepted that with greater accuracy in prediction will come limitations in transparency.
While we have only just seen the beginning of the era of
DL, we should be prepared for how it will be used and its
potential impact on a wide array of potential pharmaceutically relevant endpoints (Table II). Already comparisons of DL
with additional machine learning algorithms have shown that
it frequently improves upon the state of the art using predominantly cross validation as the form of evaluation. We will
likely see improvements in DL and maybe even alternative
approaches that are superior by combining with other machine learning or other methods or data as consensus approaches. This in particular is an area we have yet to see
developed for pharmaceutical applications. If we are to imagine machine learning models being ubiquitous in the pharmaceutical industry, DL may facilitate that. We predict the near
future will likely see an increase in studies published in this and
other journals applying DL and comparing it prospectively
and retrospectively to other machine learning methods for
predicting various molecule properties important for pharmaceutical research.
While at the time of writing there are over 100 DL startup
companies globally, few are focused on pharmaceutical applications (92,93). We anticipate that this will be an active area as
the DL connection will be one way to attract technology investors who would normally steer clear of drug discovery and
pharmaceuticals as an investment. It is likely that researchers
in academia and industry could immediately apply DL if it
was more accessible in software and they could plug their data
into it. In the interim it may require some collaboration with
those more experienced data scientists using R and the various
available DL toolkits. There are several areas that could perhaps see an immediate benefit, for example in the areas of
predicting metabolism, interactions with P450s and transporters as well as other ADME/Tox properties there has been
an increasing number of large datasets and computational
machine learning models published (Table II) some of which
are non-proprietary. Big datasets like melting point with over
300,000 compounds (94), DMSO solubility with over 163,000

compounds (95), all of the ChEMBL (5) datasets and of course
data in PubChem (96), would represent BBig Data^ (14) that
could be used with DL. The data from PubChem and to a
lesser extent ChEMBL, may need curation and organization
prior to use in DL models. While the focus of this perspective
has been predominantly molecule centric, clearly the application of DL outside the pharmaceutical industry attests to the
broad array of applications and potential for impact, there is
likely overlap in these domains. For example could we learn
from social media data using DL methods what might be
potential side effects of drugs or even new uses identified by
the population. DL could be applied not only to adverse event
prediction but also formulation properties, pharmacokinetic
simulation, cost effectiveness and even clinical trial simulation
and design. How far DL will take us and how quickly it will
have an impact on research and the industry remains to be
seen, but there is considerable opportunity to develop user
accessible tools and apply them now to the accumulating public datasets. DL is already off to a good start in many areas and
pharmaceutical researchers would do well to take a closer look
and embrace it faster than they have other computational
technologies in the past.
