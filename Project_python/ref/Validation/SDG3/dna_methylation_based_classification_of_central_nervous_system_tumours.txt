DNA methylation-based classification of
central nervous system tumours
A list of authors and their affiliations appears in the online version of the paper.

Accurate pathological diagnosis is crucial for optimal management of patients with cancer. For the approximately 100
known tumour types of the central nervous system, standardization of the diagnostic process has been shown to be
particularly challengingwith substantial inter-observer variability in the histopathological diagnosis of many tumour
types. Here we present a comprehensive approach for the DNA methylation-based classification of central nervous
system tumours across all entities and age groups, and demonstrate its application in a routine diagnostic setting. We
show that the availability of this method may have a substantial impact on diagnostic precision compared to standard
methods, resulting in a change of diagnosis in up to 12% of prospective cases. For broader accessibility, we have designed
a free online classifier tool, the use of which does not require any additional onsite data processing. Our results provide a
blueprint for the generation of machine-learning-based tumour classifiers across other cancer entities, with the potential
to fundamentally transform tumour pathology.
The developmental complexity of the brain is reflected by the vast array
of distinct brain tumour entities defined in the current WHO (World
Health Organization) classification of central nervous system (CNS)
tumours1. These tumours are clinically and biologically highly diverse,
encompassing a wide spectrum from benign neoplasms, which can
frequently be cured by surgery alone (for example, pilocytic astrocytoma), to highly malignant tumours that respond poorly to any therapy
(for example, glioblastoma). Previous studies have reported substantial inter-observer variability in the histopathological diagnosis of
many CNS tumours, for example, in diffuse gliomas2, ependymomas3
and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumours4. To address
this, some molecular grouping has been introduced into the update
of the WHO classification, but only for selected entities such as
medulloblastoma. Furthermore, several single-gene tests based on
DNA methylation analysis (for example, MGMT promoter methylation
status), fluorescence in situ hybridization (for example, 1p/19q codeletion, EGFR, MYC, MYCN, PDGFRA, 19q13.42) or immunohisto
chemistry (for example, CTNNB1 and LIN28A) that are required to
cover the most important differential diagnoses have been shown to be
difficult to standardize. Such diagnostic discordance and uncertainty
may confound decision-making in clinical practice as well as the interpretation and validity of clinical trial results.
The cancer methylome is a combination of both somatically acquired
DNA methylation changes and characteristics that reflect the cell of
origin5,6. The latter property enables, for example, the tracing of the primary site of highly dedifferentiated metastases of cancers of unknown
origin7. It has been convincingly shown that DNA methylation profiling is highly robust and reproducible even from small samples and
poor quality material8, and such profiles have been widely used to subclassify CNS tumours that were previously considered homogeneous
diseases4,916. On the basis of this previous work within single entities,
we present a comprehensive approach for the DNA methylation-based
classification of all CNS tumour entities across age groups.

CNS tumour reference cohort

To establish a comprehensive CNS tumour reference cohort, we
generated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles using Infinium
HumanMethylation450K BeadChip arrays (minimum of eight cases

per group) representing almost all WHO-defined neuroectodermal
and sellar region tumours1. We further profiled mesenchymal tumours,
melanoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, plasmacytoma and six types
of pituitary adenomas, in total comprising 76 histopathological entities
and seven entity variants that occur in the CNS. All histopathological
entities and variants were analysed by unsupervised clustering both
within each entity and across histologically similar tumour entities,
aiming to identify (i) distinct DNA methylation classes within one
histopathological entity and (ii) DNA methylation classes c omprising
tumours displaying a varied histological phenotype. This iterative
process led to the designation of 82 CNS tumour classes characterized by distinct DNA methylation profiles (Fig. 1a). Of these,
29 classes were equivalent to a single WHO entity (category 1);
29 classes r epresented subclasses within a WHO entity (category 2);
in 8 classes, WHO g rading was not fully recapitulated (category 3)
and in 11 classes, the boundaries of methylation classes were not
identical to the entity boundaries of WHO (category 4) (Fig. 1a).
The remaining five represented DNA methylation classes that have
not been defined by the WHO classification (category 5), three of
which were recently described4 as well as the not yet well-defined
class of astrocytoma and one new subclass of infantile hemispheric
glioma. There was evidence for several additional classes of rare
tumours, with too few cases to be included at present. Taking the
impact of the tumour microenvironment on the methylation profile into consideration, we included 47 tumour samples with a pronounced inflammatory or reactive tumour microenvironment,
both of which have distinct methylation profiles. We additionally
selected 72 samples that represent seven non-neoplastic CNS regions,
resulting in a combined reference cohort of 2,801 samples from 91
classes (Fig. 1a) that was visualized using t-distributed stochastic
neighbour embedding (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction17 (Fig. 1b).
This analysis further supported the separation of samples into
the defined DNA methylation classes (see also Extended Data
Fig. 1a, b; unprocessed IDAT files can be downloaded from the
NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), under accession number
GSE109381). Supplementary Table 1 gives an overview of methylation
class characteristics and Supplementary Table 2 shows case-by-case
information of the reference samples.

The stability of separation of methylation classes by t-SNE was
analysed by iterative random down-sampling of the reference cohort
and indicated a high stability of the groups (Extended Data Fig. 1c, d).
Testing for confounding batch effects within our reference cohort did
not reveal unexpected confounding factors (Extended Data Figs 2,
3ac). For reference astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas, we performed additional classification according to The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-glioma DNA methylation model18, which
indicated a strong association between the TCGA classes LGm16 and
specific classes that are defined in our reference cohort (Extended Data
Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 2).

be used to guide diagnostic decision-making, we fitted a multinomial
logistic regression calibration model that transforms the raw score into
a probability that measures the confidence in the class assignment (the
calibrated score). The calibration enables the comparison of classifier results between classes despite a different raw score distribution
(Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). Cross-validation of the random forest classifier resulted in an estimated error rate of 4.89% for raw scores and
4.28% for calibrated scores and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.99, indicating a high discriminating power (Fig. 2b
and Extended Data Fig. 5c). The vast majority of cross-validation
misclassifications occurred within eight groups of histologically and
biologically closely related tumour classes, the distinction of which is
currently without clinical impact (with the possible exception of choroid plexus tumours13; Fig. 2b). We therefore defined eight methylation
class families, for which calibrated scores are summed up to a single
score. This reduced the cross-validated error rate for the clinically relevant groupings to 1.14% (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5c). Taking the
maximum score for class assignment and using a multiclass approach20,
overall sensitivity and specificity was 0.989 and 0.999, respectively
(Extended Data Fig. 5c).
For application to diagnostic tumour samples, a threshold value for
the prediction of a matching class is required. Using receiver operating
characteristic curve analysis of the maximum calibrated scores we

Classifier development

Application in routine diagnostics requires fast and reproducible classification of samples as well as a measure of confidence for the specific
call. To this end, we used the random forest algorithm, which is a
so-called ensemble method that combines the predictions of several
weak classifiers to achieve improved prediction accuracy19. Using this
algorithm, we generated 10,000 binary decision trees, incorporating
genome-wide information from all 2,801 reference samples and 91
methylation classes (Extended Data Fig. 4). Each of these trees assigns
a given diagnostic sample to one of the 91 classes, resulting in an aggregate raw score (Fig. 2a). To obtain class probability estimates that can

devised an optimal common calibrated score threshold of 0.9
(Extended Data Fig. 5d, e). For subclasses within methylation class
families, we defined a threshold value of 0.5 as sufficient for a valid

performed blinded to DNA methylation profiling results and included
standard molecular testing.
In total, 88% of profiled samples (n =977 out of 1,104) matched to
an established DNA methylation class with a calibrated classifier score
0.9 (Fig. 3b). For 838 of these (838 out of 1,104; 76%), results obtained
by pathology and DNA methylation profiling were concordant. In 171
of the cases, an unambiguous molecular subgroup could be assigned,
which would not have been available based on histopathology evaluation only (for example, molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma and
ependymoma, many of which were included in the latest version of the
WHO classification of CNS tumours1).
For the remaining 139 samples with a calibrated classifier score
0 .9, the DNA methylation class was not in accordance with
the pathological diagnosis. These cases were histologically and
molecularly re-evaluated, including additional molecular d
 iagnostics
(DNA copy-number p
 rofiling, targeted gene sequencing, gene
panel sequencing21 and gene-fusion analysis of a subset of cases,
see Supplementary Table 5). This resulted in a revision of the initial
h istopathological diagnosis in 129 of the 139 cases (12% of all
cases; Fig. 4) in favour of the predicted m
 ethylation class. In agreement with s everal recent reports16,22,23, several of these were IDHwild-type astrocytomas and anaplastic astrocytomas reclassified

Clinical implementation

For evaluation of clinical utility, we prospectively analysed a
series of 1,155 diagnostic CNS tumours in parallel with standard
histopathological analyses (Fig. 3a, b). For 51 cases (4%) the material
was not suitable for methylation profiling, mostly because the
tumour cell content was too low or because of limited total m
 aterial.
Methylation profiling was performed for the remaining 1,104 s amples
and the cases were assigned as either matching to a defined DNA
methylation class (calibrated score 0.9) or as no match cases ( highest
score <0.9) (for a case-by-case list, see Supplementary Table 4).
The investigated cases comprised 64 different histopathological e ntities
from both adult (71%) and paediatric patients (29%). The spectrum of
entities was enriched for rare and difficult to diagnose cases received
for referral, and therefore did not exactly match the distribution seen
in daily routine diagnostic practice. Histopathological evaluation was

Figure 4 | Reassessment of discrepant cases and establishment of
new diagnosis. Discrepancy between pathological diagnosis (left) and
methylation profiling (middle) was observed for 139 cases. For 129 cases,
histological and molecular reassessment (Supplementary Table 5) resulted
in a change in the initial diagnosis with formulation of a new integrated
diagnosis (right). For 92 cases, this involved a change in the WHO grading,
with both down- (blue) and upgrading (red). Integrated diagnoses in

as IDH-wild-type g lioblastomas. Establishing a new diagnosis
had a profound clinical impact: a change in WHO grading was
observed in 71% of these cases (92 out of 129), and both upgrading
(41%, 53 out of 129) and downgrading (30%, 39 out of 129; Fig. 4).
Discrepant results could not be resolved in only 10 cases (<1% of
profiled cases), and the histopathological diagnosis was therefore
retained.
To substantiate the impact in clinical practice, we contacted five
external centres that have started to implement methylation profiling
for diagnostic cases using our algorithm. In total, these centres analysed
401 diagnostic cases and in 50 cases (12%) a new diagnosis was established after methylation profiling, very closely recapitulating our rate
of reclassification (Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 6).
For individual centres, the rate of reclassification varied between 6%
and 25%, which was most likely due to differences in the spectrum of
investigated cases and more upfront molecular testing by some centres
(Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 6).
Twelve per cent of tumours from the prospective cohort (127 out of
1,104) could not be assigned to a DNA methylation class using the rigid
calibrated classifier score cutoff of 0.9 (Fig. 3b). To further clarify
the role of these non-classifiable cases, we performed an unsupervised
t-SNE analysis of the reference cohort together with the diagnostic
cohort (Fig. 5a). Using this analysis, we found a high overlap of the
classifiable cases with the reference cohort, whereas non-classifiable
cases frequently fell in the periphery of the reference classes or were
even completely separate from these and frequently grouped with
other non-classifiable cases (Fig. 5a). This may indicate that such cases
represent rare novel molecular entities that have not been recognized
previously. An example for a likely novel CNS tumour entity is shown
in Fig. 5b, c.

Technical and inter-laboratory testing

The technical robustness of the random forest classifier was investigated
by inter-laboratory comparison. Results of two independent laboratories (starting from DNA extraction) were highly correlated, with only 2
out of 53 samples (4%) showing a classifier score slightly lower than 0.9
in one of the centres, whereas all other cases were classified identically
(Extended Data Fig. 7a). Calculation of copy-number profiles was also
stable across laboratories (Extended Data Fig. 7b). To ascertain forward
compatibility with developing technologies, we further used the random forest classifier to investigate newer Infinium MethylationEPIC
BeadChip DNA methylation arrays and high-coverage whole-
genome bisulphite sequencing data. For all 16 samples from different
CNS tumours that were profiled on both array platforms, raw scores
(Extended Data Fig. 7c) and calibrated scores (data not shown) were
highly correlated and running them through the classifying algorithm
resulted in identical class-assignment for each case. Furthermore,
for all 50 high-coverage whole-genome bisulphite sequencing samples (11 different CNS tumour entities), the highest prediction score
was for the same class as with the Infinium HumanMethylation450K
BeadChip array, suggesting that our approach is applicable to different
DNA methylation profiling techniques with only slight adaptations
(Extended Data Fig. 7d).

Global dissemination of the platform

To ensure unrestricted community access to our classification system, we created a free web platform for data upload, automatic normalization, random forest classification and PDF report generation
(https://www.molecularneuropathology.org). DNA copy-number
profiles 24 and O 6 -methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase
(MGMT) promoter methylation status25 are additionally provided,
since they can be generated from the same data sourcethus having
the potential of replacing several time- and cost-intensive single-gene
tests. A representative website report is shown in Extended Data
Fig. 8. When data are uploaded, the data provider can chose to give consent that the data are allowed to be used for further classifier development. We expect that this web platform can therefore act as a hub for a
worldwide cooperative network to continuously identify and track rare
tumour classes so that they can eventually be added to the catalogue
of known human cancers. In the first year after launch in December
2016, over 4,500 cases have been uploaded from over 15 participating
centres. New b
 iological insights are also likely to be gained based on
the interrelationships of tumour classes, and by closer examination of
how differential DNA methylation affects tumour biology.

Discussion

We here demonstrate that DNA methylation-based CNS tumour
classification using a comprehensive machine-learning approach is
a valuable asset for clinical decision-making. In particular, the high
level of standardization has great promise to reduce the substantial
inter-observer variability observed in current CNS tumour diagnostics.
Furthermore, in contrast to traditional pathology, where there is a
pressure to assign all tumours to a described entity even for atypical or
challenging cases, the objective measure that we provide here allows for
no match to a defined class. This information can also be of substantial value to highlight that a tumour is not a typical example of a given
differential diagnosis, and may rather belong to a rarer, currently undefined class. We defined five categories of methylation classes that have
different clinical implications. Category 1 can be directly translated
to WHO entities. Category 2 represents subclasses of WHO e ntities.
For all but ependymal tumours, subclassification currently has little
clinical consequence and a translation back to the WHO class may
be appropriate for clinical purposes. Category 3 reflects the fact that
WHO grading cannot be fully recapitulated by methylation profiling for
several classes. Further data are required to assess whether the methy
lation classes of this category may provide a more robust means of
prognostication than histology alone, as has been demonstrated for

Figure 5 | DNA methylation-based identification of potential new CNS
tumour entities. a, Unsupervised clustering of the combined reference
(n =2,801, grey) and diagnostic cohort (n =1,104, coloured) using
t-SNE dimensionality reduction. Abbreviated names indicate the reference
cohort classes as in Fig. 1. The diagnostic samples are colour-coded as
confirmation of diagnosis (n =838, green), establishing new diagnosis
(n =129, blue), misleading profile (n =10, red) and no match to defined
class (n =127, dark grey). The matching (green) and reclassified (blue)
cases show high overlap with the reference cases. The non-classifiable
(black) and the misleading (red) cases frequently fall in the periphery of
the reference classes or are completely separate of these. The magnified
area (right) highlights two non-classifiable cases (here in magenta for
easier identification) that group together in the t-SNE representation.

b, Both highlighted non-classifiable cases occurred in female children, and
had primitive neuroectodermal histology (glioblastoma- or embryonal
tumour-like characteristics). Histology was assessed by three independent
pathologists with similar results. Scale bars, 200 m. c, Both cases shared
a high-level amplification of chromosome 6q24.2 (common amplified
region chr6:144,149,293144,649,987). The common region includes
only 5 protein-coding genes: LTV1 (LTV1 ribosome biogenesis factor),
ZC2HC1B (zinc finger C2HC-type containing 1B), PLAGL1 (PLAG1
like zinc finger 1), SF3B5 (splicing factor 3b subunit 5) and STX11
(syntaxin 11). This amplification was not observed in any of the other
tumours from the reference or diagnostic cohort. Copy-number analysis
was performed once using copy-number information derived from the
methylation array data.

several other classes4,9,11. In category 4, the WHO entity boundaries
are not identical to the boundaries of the methylation classes. Until
additional data on the exact boundaries become available, this category
should be critically discussed in the clinical context and orthogonal
testing should be undertaken whenever possible. Category 5 represents
putative new entities that are currently not recognized by the WHO,
and although limited data on these cases are currently available, the
biological rationale for a novel class was considered to be strong.
A study in which reference pathology and molecular diagnostics,
including DNA methylation profiling, are blinded for each others
results is currently ongoing for all childhood brain tumours diagnosed
in Germany to objectivize the potential effect of re-classification on
patient outcome (Molecular Neuropathology 2.0; http://www.kitz-heidelberg.de/molecular-diagnostics), with results due over the next few
years.
A uniform implementation of the classification algorithm holds great
promise for standardization of tumour diagnostics across centres and
across clinical trials. Furthermore, the digital nature of methylation data
facilitates easy exchange and will allow aggregation of extensive tumour
libraries. This will probably result in the detection of exceptionally rare
tumour classes and a continued refinement of classifiers. Inclusion of
new classes will allow a prompt translation into diagnostic practice,
almost certainly resulting in a more dynamic tumour classification. In
our experience, adaptation of this technique in diagnostic laboratories

is relatively straightforward. Extended Data Fig. 9 summarizes a sample
workflow for diagnostic implementation. We expect that the principle
of using DNA methylation signatures as part of a combined histology
and molecular tumour classification will improve diagnostic accuracy
not only in neuropathology, but will also serve as a blueprint in other
fields of tumour pathology.

Methods

Data reporting. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.
The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to
allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
Patient material. Patient material and clinical data of the retrospective
reference cohort (total, n =2,801) were obtained from the National Center for
Tumour Diseases (NCT) in Heidelberg and supplemented with samples from additional centres (Supplementary Table 2) according to protocols approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of the appropriate centres with written consent obtained
from each patient. Tumours were histopathologically re-assessed according
to the current WHO classification1. Areas with highest tumour cell content
(70%) were selected for DNA extraction. Subsets of the reference cohort have
been previously published4,6,916,2633. Additional patient characteristics can be
found in Supplementary Table 2. The prospectively assessed clinical cohort was
analysed as part of the National Center for Tumour Diseases Precision Oncology
Program according to procedures approved by the Institutional Review Board at
the Medical Faculty Heidelberg. All patients gave written consent for diagnostic
procedures, comprising molecular testing, including methylation profiling. For
all the above human research participants, all relevant ethical regulations were
followed. Additional patient characteristics can be found in Supplementary
Table 4. Details of the online-analysed cohort of the five additional centres can
be found in Supplementary Table 6. Usage of the data was according to protocols
approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Basel, Frankfurt
am Main University Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht and Princess
Mxima Center for Paediatric Oncology Utrecht, Giessen University Hospital and
University College London Hospitals.
Data generation, processing and random forest classifier generation. Samples
were analysed using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450k)
arrays according to the manufacturers instructions. To investigate stability across
platforms a selection of samples were additionally assessed using the successor
Methylation BeadChip (EPIC) array or whole-genome bisulphite sequencing
(WGBS, generated and analysed as described6). Array data analysis was performed
using R v.3.2.034, using a number of packages from Bioconductor35 and other
repositories. A random forest19 classifier compatible with both 450k and EPIC
platforms was trained, and a calibration model that calculates class probabilities
from random forest scores was devised.
Methylation array processing. The 450k array was used to obtain genome-wide
DNA methylation profiles for tumour samples and normal control tissues, according
to the manufacturers instructions (Illumina). DNA methylation data were
generated at the Genomics and Proteomics Core Facility of the DKFZ (Heidelberg,
Germany) and the NYU Langone Medical Center (New York, USA). Data were
generated from both freshly frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue samples. For most freshly frozen samples, >500 ng of DNA was used as
input material, whereas 250 ng of DNA was used for most FFPE tissues. On-chip
quality metrics of all samples were carefully controlled. Copy-number variation analysis from 450k methylation array data was performed using the conumee24 Bioconductor package v.1.3.0. Two sets of 50 control samples displaying a
balanced copy-number profile from both male and female donors were used for
normalization.
Raw signal intensities were obtained from IDAT files using the minfi
Bioconductor package v.1.14.036. Each sample was individually normalized by
performing a background correction (shifting of the 5% percentile of negative
control probe intensities to 0) and a dye-bias correction (scaling of the mean
of normalization control probe intensities to 10,000) for both colour channels.
Subsequently, a correction for the type of material tissue (FFPE or frozen) was
performed by fitting univariate, linear models to the log2-transformed intensity
values (removeBatchEffect function, limma package v.3.24.15). The methylated
and unmethylated signals were corrected individually. Estimated batch effects were
also used to adjust diagnostic samples or test samples within the cross-validation.
Beta values were calculated from the retransformed intensities using an offset of
100 (as recommended by Illumina). To test for possible confounding batch effects
within our pre-processed reference cohort dataset (after adjusting for FFPE versus
frozen material) we applied the sva algorithm37,38. We found no significant surrogate variable (data not shown).
The following filtering criteria were applied: removal of probes targeting the
X and Y chromosomes (n =11,551), removal of probes containing a single-
nucleotide polymorphism (dbSNP132 Common) within five base pairs of and
including the targeted CpG site (n =7,998), probes not mapping uniquely to the
human reference genome (hg19) allowing for one mismatch (n = 3,965), and
probes not included on the Illumina EPIC array (n =32,260). In total, 428,799
probes targeting CpG sites were kept for further analysis.
Unsupervised analysis. Pairwise Pearson correlation was calculated for all
2,801 reference samples by selecting the 32,000 most variably methylated probes

(s.d. > 0.228; Extended Data Fig. 1a). The same probes were used for principal
component analysis (PCA). For PCA, pairwise probe covariances of centred beta
values were calculated. Eigenvalue decomposition was performed using the eigs
function of the RSpectra package version 0.12. The number of non-trivial components was determined by comparing eigenvalues to the maximum eigenvalue
of a PCA using randomized beta values (shuffling of sample labels per probe)
(Extended Data Fig. 1b). Principal component scores for all non-trivial components (n =94) were used for t-SNE analysis17 (Rtsne package v.0.11, Fig. 1b). The
following non-default parameters were used: theta = 0, pca = F, max_iter = 2500.
A similar approach was used for the combined analysis of reference and diagnostic
cases (Fig. 5a).
The random forest algorithm. The random forest19 algorithm is a so-called
ensemble method that combines the predictions of several weak classifiers to
achieve improved prediction accuracy. The random forest algorithm uses binary
decision trees (classification and regression trees, CART39) as weak classifiers
(Extended Data Fig. 4). Each of these trees is a sequence of binary splitting rules
that are learned by recursive binary splitting. The CART algorithm starts with
all samples assigned to a root node and tries to find the variable, for example, a
measured CpG probe, and a corresponding cutoff that results in the purest split into
the different classes. To measure this gain in class purity, the Gini index is used.
To fit a tree, the CART algorithm iteratively repeats these steps until no further
improvements can be made. To predict the class of a new diagnostic case, the binary
splitting rules are compared with the new data starting in the root node down
to one of the leaf nodes. The tree then predicts or votes for the class of that leaf
node. Decision trees have the advantage that they are non-parametric and do not
rely on any distributional assumptions. The main disadvantages of decision trees
are that they often tend to overfit the data and that they have a weak prediction
performance. To improve the prediction accuracy, the random forest algorithm
combines thousands of trees by bootstrap aggregation (bagging). In brief, each tree
is fitted using training datasets that are generated by drawing bootstrap samples.
In addition, at each node only a random subset of the available variables is used
to find an optimal splitting rule. This additional source of randomization allows
selecting variables with lower predictive value. This feature guarantees that the
resulting trees are decorrelated, that is, they use different variables to find an
optimal prediction rule. Taking the majority vote over thousands of bootstrapaggregated and decorrelated trees greatly improves the prediction accuracy of the
random forest.
Classifier development. To train the random forest classifier, the randomForest
R package40 was used. First, the most important features (probes) were selected
by applying the random forest algorithm to the beta values of all filtered 428,799
probes. For efficient computation, the probes were split into 43 sets of approxi
mately 10,000 probes. For each set, 100 trees were fitted using 654 randomly
sampled candidate features at each split (mtry parameter, square root of 428,799,
as would be used by default when not splitting into sets). To take the imbalanced
methylation class sizes into account, a down-sampling strategy was followed that
ensures an identical number of samples per class (parameter sampsize = rep(8, 91)),
eight reflecting the minimum number of cases in the 91 classes)41. For all other
parameters the default settings were used. This procedure was repeated 100
times, essentially fitting 10,000 trees per probe. Finally, features are selected
by the permutation-based variable importance measure as implemented in the
randomForest R package40. The importance measure is the class-specific mean
decrease in classification accuracy when the feature is permutated. We selected
features by ranking them using the minimal rank of the variable importance measures across all classes.
The final random forest classifier was trained by fitting 10,000 trees with the
parameter mtry =100 using beta values of the 10,000 probes selected during
feature selection. Imbalanced class sizes were accounted for by down-sampling
(as described above), and for all other parameters the default settings were used.
An overview of the processes is given in Extended Data Fig. 4.
Classifier cross-validation. Overfitting of the training data is a typical problem
expected when training classifiers on high-dimensional data. As it often cannot be
avoided, the typical strategy to deal with this problem is to evaluate the model accuracy on an independent test dataset or apply cross-validation methods42. Because
some of the newly defined methylation groups presented in this work cannot be
diagnosed by classical histopathological methods or other established molecular
assays, an independent test set to assess model accuracy is not available. Therefore,
the accuracy of the presented random forest model with the accompanying calibration model was evaluated by a threefold, nested cross-validation. For this, the
reference dataset was split into three equally sized parts. In each cross-validation
iteration, two-thirds of the data were used to train a random forest classifier in the
same way as the random forest classifier for the complete dataset was trained. Then,
the remaining one-third of the data were used for predictions using this random
forest classifier. After the third iteration of the cross-validation is completed, each

of the 2,801 reference samples has been predicted by an independent random
forest classifier, that is, where the sample was not used for estimating batch effects,
performing variable selection, or training of the classifier.
Classifier score calibration. The classification scores generated by our multiclass
random forest model (that is, the proportion of trees voting for a class) performed
well when they were used to assign the correct class labels, but they do not reflect
well calibrated class probabilities43. Furthermore, the distribution of the random
forest scores varied between classes, which made inter-class comparisons difficult.
Moreover, to evaluate a diagnostic classification, the uncertainties associated with
an individual prediction in terms of confidence scores or estimated class probabilities are needed.
To obtain scores that are comparable between classes and that are improved
estimates of the certainty of individual predictions, we performed a classification score recalibration by mapping the original scores to more accurate class
probabilities44,45. To find such a mapping, an L2-penalized, multinomial, logistic
regression model was fitted, which takes the methylation class as response variable
and the random forest scores as explanatory variables. The R package glmnet46 was
used to fit this model. In addition, the model was fitted by incorporating a small
ridge-penalty (L2) on the likelihood to prevent overfitting, as well as to stabilize
estimation in situations in which classes are perfectly separable. The amount of
this regularization, that is, the penalization parameter, is determined by running a
tenfold cross-validation and choosing the largest value that lies within one standard
error of the minimum cross-validation error. Independent random forest scores are
needed to fit this model, that is, the scores need to be generated by a random forest
classifier that was not trained using the same samples, otherwise the random forest
scores will be systematically biased and not comparable to scores of unseen cases.
As such, random forest scores generated by the threefold cross-validation are used.
To validate the class predictions generated by using the recalibrated scores of
the calibration model, a nested threefold cross-validation loop is incorporated
into the main threefold cross-validation that validated the random forest classifier
(Extended Data Fig. 4). Within each cross-validation run this nested threefold
cross-validation is applied to generate independent random forest scores, which are
then used to train a calibration model. The predicted random forest scores resulting
from predicting the one-third test data of the outer cross-validation loop are then
recalibrated by applying the calibration model that was fitted on the random forest
scores generated during the nested cross-validation. A similar cross-validation
scheme was used previously47 to validate estimated classification probabilities.
Classifier performance measures. Performances of the resulting classifier
predictions and scores generated by the cross-validation were assessed by the
misclassification error, multiclass. area under receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve (AUC) and the multiclass Brier score. The misclassification error
measures the frequency of falsely assigned class labels when using the maximum
of the random forest scores or re-calibrated scores as a cutoff to determine the
predicted class, that is, the majority vote. To measure the AUC for our multiclass random forest the generalization of the AUC for multiclass classification
problems48 was used. To measure how well the resulting random forest scores and
recalibrated scores perform when used as class probabilities, the multiclass Brier
score42,43,49 was used. The Brier score is the mean-squared difference between the
actual and the predicted class probability and thus measures the same characteristic
as the mean squared error measures for a continuous forecast.
Methylation class families. We observed that the majority of misclassification
errors occurred within eight groups of histologically and biologically closely related
tumour classes. We therefore defined eight methylation class families (MCF). Since
calibrated scores represent class probabilities, it is possible to apply the addition
rule of well calibrated class probability estimates43 within one MCF to get a class
probability for the MCF.
Threshold analysis. Finding an optimal cutoff for diagnostic tests usually involves
finding an optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. If there are no
preferences regarding specificity or sensitivity, the optimal cutoff is chosen by
the upper left corner of the ROC curve or by maximizing the Youden index
(specificity + sensitivty 1). In an application like the one described here, where
the cost of false negative is that a tumour cannot be classified and the cost of a false
positive is a falsely predicted methylation class, a threshold with high specificity
is preferred. ROC analysis is typically defined for binary classification problems.
Finding a threshold for multiclass classifiers either involves performing a ROC
analysis for each class resulting in class-wise individual thresholds or finding some
common threshold for all classes.
The calibrated MC/MCF scores (here referring to MCF and methylation classes
(MC) that are not assigned to a MCF) are already validated probability estimates
for the methylation class with a direct interpretation, that is, we expect among all
samples with scores of approximately 0.9 that 10% are falsely predicted. Applying
an additional threshold is not required from a statistical point of view, but is desired
in clinical practice. In addition, owing to calibration, scores are comparable across

classes and it is thus reasonable to define a common threshold for all classes instead
of finding the optimal cutoff for each individual methylation class.
To determine a common threshold for the calibrated MC/MCF scores, we performed a ROC analysis of the maximum calibrated MC/MCF scores calculated
via cross-validation. For this ROC analysis, we defined a new binary class, that
is, samples correctly classified during the cross-validation using the maximum
calibrated MC/MCF score for classification were considered as classifiable and
samples falsely classified using this score were considered non-classifiable.
Following this ROC analysis approach, we determined a cutoff of 0.836 that
maximizes the Youden index with a specificity of 93.8% and sensitivity of 93.4%
(Extended Data Fig. 5d, e). A maximum specificity of 100% with a sensitivity of
82.7% can be achieved with a threshold of 0.958. Bootstrapped 95% confidence
intervals (grey area in Extended Data Fig. 5d) demonstrate the uncertainty of
sensitivity and specificity estimates, especially in the upper left corner of the ROC
figure, where the considered thresholds are located.
Both thresholds have been determined by cross-validation on our training data
of high quality, but real life diagnostic samples were found to achieve slightly lower
scores, due to a number of factors that we cannot control, such as lower overall
sample quality and lower tumour purity compared to the samples in our reference
cohort. Therefore, we decided to lower the maximum specificity threshold to allow
a wider spectrum of samples to become a match. For this, we chose a threshold of
0.9, which lies in the middle between the Youden index and the threshold for
maximum specificity.
Comparison to TCGA pan-glioma methylation classes. To compare our
methylation-based classification of CNS tumours with described methylation
classes of brain tumours by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, we downloaded the pre-processed methylation dataset that has previously been published18,
including methylation data of 418 low-grade glioma and 377 glioblastoma samples,
which had been analysed using the Illumina 450k array or 27k array platforms.
To classify our samples according to the TCGA pan-glioma DNA methylation
classification, we trained a random forest classifier on this dataset using the 1,300
CpG probe signature provided by the authors and using the default settings of the
random forest algorithms implemented in the R package randomForest. The results
of this classification for astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas
are shown in Extended Data Fig. 3d and are provided on a case-by-case basis in
Supplementary Tables 2, 4.
Estimating tumour purity from DNA methylation data. Because of the subjective
nature of histological assessment of tumour purity, we additionally used the previously published dataset18 to train a random forest regression (continuous response
variable) model to predict tumour purity51. This random forest was trained on the
1,000 most important CpG probes for purity estimation selected also by a random
forest (similar to the variable selection described for the random forest classifier).
The out-of-bag (that is, random forest trees in which the respective sample, for
which purity is predicted, was not used for training) mean squared error of the final
model was 0.015, indicating that this model was able to yield reasonable predictions
of tumour purity from methylation data (Extended Data Fig. 3ac). The estimated
tumour purities for individual cases are given in Supplementary Tables 2, 4.

Extended Data Figure 3 | Estimation of tumour purity and relation to
TCGA pan-glioma methylation classes. a, A random forest model was
trained to predict absolute tumour purity estimates50 using the TCGA
pan-glioma dataset (795 biologically independent samples)18. The plot
shows absolute purity estimates and out-of-bag random forest tumour
purity predictions (that is, using only random forest trees for which the

categories indicated by different shades of blue. The exact case-by-case
values are provided in Supplementary Table 2. The median estimated
purity in the reference cohort is 66% (range 42% to 87%) and 78% of
samples have an estimated purity of at least 60%. c, t-SNE representation
of the reference cohort (2,801 biologically independent samples) overlaid

generally composed of mixed tumour purity categories. Tumour purity
shows some association with the WHO grade (WHO I median tumour
purity 60%, range 3977%; WHO II median 66%, range 4380%; WHO

III median 68%, range 5484%; WHO IV median 69%, range 4987%).
A further association of tumour purity with the composition of classes in
the unsupervised t-SNE analysis was not evident. d, t-SNE representation
of the reference cohort (2,801 biologically independent samples) overlaid
with predicted TCGA pan-glioma DNA methylation classes according
to the previously published dataset18. Pan-glioma methylation classes
were predicted by training a random forest on the previously published
dataset18, which included methylation data of 418 low-grade glioma and
377 glioblastoma samples that were acquired using the Illumina 450k and
27k platforms. The random forest algorithm was trained using the 1,300
CpG signature as described in ref. 18 and using the default settings of the
random forest algorithm implemented in the R package randomForest.
Pan-glioma class prediction was only performed for subsets of mostly
adult astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas (magnified
areas) included in the previously published dataset18. LGm1, LGm2 and
LGm3 show a high overlap with the methylation classes A IDH HG, A
IDH and O IDH, respectively. LGm4 shows the highest overlap with

Extended Data Figure 4 | Development of the random forest classifier.
a, The random forest training consists of four steps. First, basic filtering
of probes that were not included on the EPIC array, probes located
on the X and Y chromosomes, probes affected by single nucleotide
polymorphisms, and probes not mapping uniquely to the genome was
performed. In the second step, the probe-wise batch effects between
samples from FFPE and frozen material were estimated and adjusted by a
linear model approach. In the third step, feature selection was performed
by training a random forest algorithm using all probes and selecting the
10,000 probes with highest variable importance measure. In the last step,
the final random forest is trained using only the 10,000 selected probes.
The validation of the random forest classifier involves a threefold nested
cross-validation. In the outer loop of the cross-validation, the complete
random forest training procedure consisting of four steps as described
above are applied to the training data and the resulting random forest
is used to predict the test data to generate random forest scores. In the
inner loop of the cross-validation a threefold cross-validation is applied to

training data of the outer loop in order to generate random forest scores
independent of the test data in the outer loop. These scores are then used
to fit a calibration model, that is, a L2-penalized, multinomial, logistic
regression that takes the random forest scores of the test data in the
outer cross-validation loop to estimate tumour class probabilities (P1,
P2, P3). To fit a calibration model to estimate class probabilities of
diagnostic samples using all data in the reference set, the random
forest scores generated in the outer cross-validation loop were used.
b, Schematic depiction of three example binary decision trees of the
random forest classifier (left), and magnification on five example decisions
nodes relevant for glioblastoma classification (right). For prediction, a
diagnostic sample enters the root node of each of the 10,000 trees. At
every decision node, the decision path is determined on the methylation
level of a single CpG, until it reaches a terminal node that provides the
class prediction. The joint class prediction of all trees represents the raw
prediction score. The colour code and abbreviations are identical to
Fig. 1a.

Extended Data Figure 5 | Comparison of raw and calibrated classifier
scores and threshold definition. a, Density plots illustrating the
distribution of raw and calibrated classifier scores for samples correctly
classified during cross-validation (n =2,701 independent biological
samples for raw and n =2,769 independent biological samples for
calibrated), depicted for each methylation class or methylation class
family. Score calibration results in a harmonization of score distribution
and allows the establishment of a shared classification threshold. Three
thresholds for maximizing specificity (0.958), maximizing the Youden
index (0.836), and the cutoff used in this study (0.9) are indicated by red
lines (see also d and e). b, Multivariate score calibration illustrated as a
ternary plot showing scores of the three ATRT subclasses (MYC, SHH and
TYR; together n =112 independent biological samples). Arrows indicate
transformation of the scores for individual samples by the calibration
model, which increases the discrimination between the three subclasses.
c, The accuracy of prediction of the random forest classifier constructed of
n =2,801 biologically independent samples (measured by misclassification
error, AUC, Brier score, multiclass sensitivity and specificity) is improved
by score calibration and by combining classes into MCF). d, To determine

a common threshold for the calibrated MCF scores, we performed a
ROC analysis of the maximum calibrated MCF scores of all n = 2,801
biologically independent samples calculated via cross-validation. For this
ROC analysis, we defined a new binary class, that is, samples correctly
classified during the cross-validation using the maximum calibrated
MCF score for classification were considered as classifiable (n = 2,769)
and samples that got falsely classified using this score were considered
non-classifiable (n =32). Three thresholds for different sensitivity
and specificity are highlighted in the ROC curve: a threshold of 0.958
achieving a maximum specificity of 1 with a sensitivity of 0.827, a
threshold of 0.836 obtaining a maximum Youden index with specificity
0.938 and sensitivity 0.934, and our recommended threshold of 0.9 that
results in a specificity of 0.938 and a sensitivity of 0.9. Bootstrapped
95% confidence intervals for estimated sensitivity and specificity are
indicated in grey. e, Sensitivity and specificity for all possible thresholds
applied to cross-validated maximum MCF classifier scores of all n = 2,801
biologically independent samples. Three thresholds for maximizing
specificity (0.958), maximizing the Youden index (0.836) and 0.9 are
highlighted by red lines.

reproducibility of the DNA methylation-based classification.
a, Calibrated scores of 53 independent biological samples representing
diagnostic CNS tumour cases analysed at the University of Heidelberg
and at the New York University pathology department. Both laboratories
performed independent DNA extraction, array hybridization and data
analysis. Cases falling into green areas were classified identically in both
centres (96%); cases in the red area were non-classifiable in one centre
(4%). None of the 53 samples was assigned to a different methylation
class by the two centres. b, Copy-number profiles calculated from the
array data generated at both centres were highly comparable and allowed
identification of chromosomal gains, losses, amplifications and deletions.

Calculations and interpretation were performed once at each centre.
c, Plot of maximum raw classification scores of 16 different tumour
samples generated using both 450k and EPIC arrays. All cases fall close
to the bisecting line (red) indicating a high concordance of the scores.
Further, the methylation class prediction was identical for all samples.
d, The CNS tumour classifier also performs well with data generated by
WGBS. The plot shows classifier scores calculated from WGBS and 450k
arrays of 50 cases comprising 11 different brain tumour entities (bisecting
line in red). Methylation beta values were calculated from high-coverage
WGBS data (>10 fold average coverage) and run through the CNS tumour
classifier and plotted against the same case analysed using 450k arrays. The
highest class prediction score was identical in all cases.

Experimental design

1. Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.

The present work focuses on predictive modelling and no inferential statistic was
performed. The minimal sample size to include a tumor class into the model was
determined empirically by training and testing models with different sample sizes.
The minimal class size of 8 allowed us to include rare tumor classes without losing
prediction performance.

2. Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions.

Tumor content was required to be above 70% (as described in the Methods),
otherwise data was not generated. This criteria was pre-established.

3. Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were
reliably reproduced.

The separation of samples into the defined DNA methylation classes was reliably
reproduced by iterative random downsampling of the reference cohort.
The rate of establishment of a new diagnosis by methylation profiling was
confirmed by the data of the external centres. The interlaboratory comparison
demonstrated a reliable reproduction of the results of the original laboratory.

4. Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were
allocated into experimental groups.

The construction of the methylation classifier reference cohort was done in a
supervised fashion to recapitulate the entities established in the WHO classification
of tumours of the central nervous system, no randomization was performed. For
the clinical implementation in the prospective samples also no randomization was
performed as all cases with sufficient material were subjected to the analysis. For
the technical validation samples were also not randomized, instead 51 samples of a
wide selection of histological classes were chosen to increase the validity for a
broader range of tumours.

5. Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.

The initial pathological diagnosis of the prospective series was done fully blinded as
the methylation data was not generated before the finalisation of pathological
diagnosis of a given case (usually two weeks after the pathological diagnosis).

Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.
