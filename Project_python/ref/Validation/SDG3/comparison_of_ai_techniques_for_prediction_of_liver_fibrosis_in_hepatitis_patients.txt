ABSTRACT
Globally one in twelve people have the Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C virus. Diagnosis and treatment
of this disease is guided by liver biopsies where a small amount of tissue is removed by a surgeon
and examined by a pathologist to determine the fibrosis stage from F0 (no damage) to F4
(cirrhosis). Biopsies are costly and carry some risk for the patient. Non-invasive techniques for
determining fibrosis stage have been developed and evaluated since 2003. Non-invasive methods
have utilized serum markers, imaging test, and genetic studies. The accuracy of these noninvasive techniques has not achieved sufficient acceptance and so the invasive biopsy is still
considered the gold standard.
Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) use decision support system theory and

technology to assist clinicians in the evaluation and treatment process. Using historical
clinical data and the relationship processed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to
aid physicians in their decision making process is the goal of CDSS. The CDSS provides
a large number of medical support functions to help clinicians make the most reasonable
diagnosis and choose the best treatment measures.
This paper applies four artificial intelligence predictive techniques (decision trees, neural
networks, naive bayes algorithms, and logistics regression) to publicly available data on
424 Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C patients. Demographic and standard serum markers are
utilized to predict fibrosis stage and compare these predictions to known biopsy results.
A final decision tree evaluation is applied to make a final prediction. We have also have
developed a publically available web application that can be used as a prototype for
presenting AI predictive results in a CDSS environment based on these models. This
technique along with others could mitigate the need for some liver biopsies in the more
than 500 million Hepatitis B and C patients worldwide with additional validation and
verification.

1. INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C virus is a common disease throughout the world. Diagnosis and
treatment of this disease is guided by liver biopsies where a small amount of tissue is removed by
a surgeon and examined by a pathologist to determine the fibrosis stage from F0 (no damage) to
F4 (cirrhosis) [1][2]. This disease goes largely untreated in developing countries. Biopsies are
costly and carry some risk for the patient. Non-invasive techniques for determining fibrosis stage
have been developed and evaluated since 2003. Non-invasive methods have utilized serum
markers, imaging test, and genetic studies. The accuracy of these non-invasive techniques has
not achieved sufficient acceptance and so the invasive biopsy is still considered the gold standard
[3].

Knowledge of the level of liver damage in a patient with liver disease (particularly
Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C) is a critical factor in determining the optimal course of
treatment and to measure the effectiveness of alternative treatments in patients. The effort
here expands on earlier work [4] by adding three additional artificial intelligence
techniques to predict the degree of liver damage from blood serum results rather than
determination from an invasive biopsy [5].
Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) provide cost/effective solutions by correlating
historical data to assist clinicians in treatment of disease. In this case we are developing a
CDSS focused on predicting Fibrosis Stage from blood serum information. It is an
information system which uses expert systems and artificial intelligence (AI) technology
to support clinical decision. It makes integrated diagnostic and medical advice bases on
the collected patients information, providing reference for the clinical medical physician
[6]. Clinical Decision Support Systems are "active knowledge systems which use two or
more items of patient data to generate case-specific advice"[7].
Clinical decision support systems vary greatly in their complexity, function, and
application. This effort builds on earlier work [4] and will focus on function and in

particular utilization of historical data laboratory and outcome data processed through
artificial intelligence tools. The combination of historical data and predictive tools
provides valuable information in the hands of physicians as they develop a course of
treatment for a patient.

2. BACKGROUND: AI and CDSS
Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining techniques have proven themselves useful in a
wide variety of medical and health information systems [1]. The most direct application
has been in medical and clinical diagnostic systems but has included productive work in
signal processing for example in ECG diagnosis [8]. Commonly applied techniques
include Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, Decision Trees, Bayesian Classifiers, Support
Vector Machines, Genetic Algorithms, and Hybrid Systems. In Clinical and Medical
Decision Support Systems these techniques have been successfully applied to support the
process of discovering useful information in large clinical repositories [8].

Future

challenges are to increase the routine use of these techniques in the clinical setting [7].
We have done the system designed with neural networks and decision tree methods
because of their successful application in similar problem domains [4] [9] [10]. In this
paper we use two more techniques Nave Bayes Classifier and Logistics Regression to
strengthen the system and use Cross Validation to pick up the optimum technique to get
the best prediction result.
2.1 Nave Bayes Classifier
In machine learning and pattern recognition, classification refers to an algorithmic
procedure for assigning a given piece of input data into one of a given number of
categories. The term "classifier" sometimes also refers to the mathematical function,
implemented by a classification algorithm, that maps input data to a category [11].
Support we have the data consist of fruits described by their color and shape. If we see a
fruit is red and round then based on the data sample, which type of fruit is it most likely
to be? The classifier would classify the red and round fruit as that type of fruits.

Nave Bayes classifier has 2 assumptions. NBC assumes that the attributes are
independent of each other in each class and the importance of the attributes is equal. It is
made to simplify the computation and in this sense considered to be Nave. Studies
comparing classification algorithms have found the Nave Bayesian classifier to be
comparable in performance with classification trees and with neural network classifiers.
They have exhibited high accuracy and speed when applied to large databases [12]. And
also it has the decision-making process continued according to the specific cases which is
really significant for our project. It is effective and simple algorithm but the two central
assumptions may not represent the facts.
2.2 Logistics Regression
Binary (or binomial) logistic regression is a form of regression which is used when the
dependent is a dichotomy and the independents are of any type. Multinomial logistic
regression exists to handle the case of dependents with more classes than two, though it is
sometimes used for binary dependents also since it generates somewhat different output
[13]. Logistic regression is used for prediction of the probability of occurrence of an
event by fitting data to a logistic curve. A logistic regression model does not involve
decision trees and is more akin to nonlinear regression such as fitting a polynomial to a
set of data values. Logistic regression can be used only with two types of target variables:
1.

A categorical target variable that has exactly two categories (i.e., a binary or

dichotomous variable).
2. A continuous target variable that has values in the range 0.0 to 1.0 representing
probability values or proportions [1].
It is a stable algorithm and doesnt require the variables to be a normal distribution. But
the precision of the algorithm is limited.
2.3 Hepatitis and Fibrosis Stage
One in 12 people worldwide are living with wither chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C. This
equates to an estimated 350 million people with hepatitis B and 170 million people with
Heapatitis C [3] [14][15]. A liver biopsy is a procedure whereby small pieces of liver
tissue are removed in order to be sent to a laboratory for examination. It is very helpful in

the diagnosis of diseases that affect the liver [16]. But it is also cost and carries risk for
the patients. Biopsy is an expensive procedure ranging from $1,500 to $3,000.
Complications are rare (<3%) but include internal bleeding, infection, air in chest cavity,
internal organ puncture and so on. Fibrosis Stage [17] guides treatment of Hepatitis
patients. Stages F0 and F1 are typically categorized as insignificant fibrosis and stages
greater than F1 are categorized as significant fibrosis. Fibrosis stages are shown in Table
1. Although hepatitis is a chronic disease, fibrosis is reversible if identified in the early
stages.

The database utilized for this study was collected at Chiba University hospital in Japan,
and is a Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases 2005 Discovery Challenge
dataset [20]. The data set contains patient data, laboratory, and liver fibrosis biopsy data
on 771 hepatitis B and C patients. Data was processed to limit serum data within one
week of biopsy data, reducing the evaluation dataset to 424 patients. The objective is to
evaluate whether laboratory examinations can be used to estimate the stage of liver
fibrosis.

3. AI ASSISTEDCLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM
Another objective of this research is to define an interface that might be useful to
clinicians and identify what type of web-based tools would be most useful to represent
the results of AI predictions in a CDSS environment. A beta version of the software
(CDSS-AI) was developed utilizing the models in this study. We have utilized Visual

Studio

for

our

beta

version

which

available

at

http://h202276.dreamsparkhosting.com/Default.aspx . Additionally we are utilizing two
open source analytic tools for the AI component of our project. Namely, we are using
Neuro 3 a Visual Basic application for the neural network application and Weka for
the decision tree portion of our project.
The methodology and approach of processing data, applying AI techniques, and
development of the resulting knowledge base can be utilized as a pattern for other
medical treatment needs represented in a CDSS. The current architectural of the beta
system is shown in Figure 1.

3.1 Previous Work
The objective is to use the four algorithms to predict fibrosis stage from patient data and
laboratory data. The paper Advanced Decision Support for Complex Clinical Decisions
[4] presents two of the techniques which are Decision Tree and Neural Network. This
paper adds two other methods which are Nave Bayes Classifier and Logistics Regression.
We have a data set of 424 historical that will be use to train and validate four kinds of
models. Table 2 is a map of the data elements utilized in this study.
Table 2: Data Utilized for Model Building

3.2 Nave Bayes Classifier
The Nave Bayes classifier assigns an instance sk with attribute values (A1=v1, A2=v2, ,
Am=vm ) to class Ci with maximum Prob(Ci|(v1, v2, , vm)) for all i. The naive Bayes
classifier exploits the Bayess rule and assumes independence of attributes.
Likelihood of sk belonging to Ci
= Prob(Ci | (v1 , v 2 ,..., v m )) =

P ((v1 , v 2 ,..., v m ) | Ci )P (Ci )
P ((v1 , v 2 ,..., v m ))

Likelihood of sk belonging to Cj
= Prob(C j | (v1 , v 2 ,..., v m )) =

P ((v1 , v 2 ,..., v m ) | C j )P (C j )
P((v1 , v 2 ,..., v m ))

Therefore, when comparing Prob(Ci| (v1, v2, , vm)) and P(Cj |(v1, v2, , vm)), we only
need to compute P((v1, v2, , vm)|Ci)P(Ci) and P((v1, v2, , vm)|Cj)P(Cj)
Under the assumption of independent attributes
P ((v1 , v 2 ,..., v m ) | C j )
= P ( A1 = v1 | C j )  P ( A2 = v 2 | C j )  K  P ( Am = v m | C j )
m

=  P ( Ah = v h | C j )
h =1

Furthermore, P(Cj) can be computed by [14]

number of training samples belonging to C j
total number of training samples

By using WEKA [21], the model classifies the Fibrosis Stage into 5 classes which
represent the 5 stages. There are 8 attributes in each class. The model calculates the mean
value and Stand Deviation value for each attribute. According to the definition of Nave
Bayes Classifier [22], we can get the probability of Fibrosis Stage in each class base
formula:
P(FS1 | Yes) = P(ALB = FS1 | Yes) * P(ALP = FS1 | Yes) * .* P(Heap B = FS1 | Yes)
(FS1 means Fibrosis stage 1). We assume the 7 Continuous Variables are all Gaussian


Distribution. For example, for the ALB: P(ALB | FS1) =  

(

 )


And for the

categorical variable (Hepatitis Type), use the actual number of occurrences. For example,
P(HeapB | FS1) = 59/204. Figure 2 shows the Nave Bayes Classifier model. Classes 0 to
4 means the Fibrosis stage 0 to 4.

Figure 2. Nave Bayes Classifier model
With this model, we can calculate the probability of each fibrosis stage then pick up the
highest one as our predict result.

3.3 Logistics Regression
A graph of the Logistic Regression function is shown in Figure 3 [23]. The input is z and
the output is (z). Whereas the output is confined to values between 0 and 1, the function
can take as an input any value from negative infinity to positive infinity. A represents the
exposure to some set of independent variables while f(z) represents the probability of a
particular outcome, given that set of explanatory variables [16]. The definition of
Logistics Regression can be written as: F(z) =


 

and z = 0 + 1x1 + 2x2 +  + nxn

[21]. By using WEKA, obtained the model shown in Figure 4. We know that Base on the
coefficient of the model, we can calculate the probability of the Fibrosis Stage in each
class then select the highest as the final prediction. Let us take class 0 as the example.
The probability of fibrosis stage 1 is
F(z) =


 

the z =-1.35+1.22(ALB) -0.28(G_GL) -0.08(AGE) +3.03(TYPE)

3.4 Cross Validation
Cross Validation is a technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will
generalize to an independent data set [24].. We did the cross validation on each of the four
techniques in the prototype which includes Decision Tree, Neural Network, Nave Bayes
Classifier and Logistics Regression. The data set is divided int
into
o two parts, the training set
and test data sets. We trained multiple models on the training set then picked up the
model with the smallest classification error. We divided the data set into 4 parts and cross
validation will randomly pick 3 parts as the tr
training
aining set to predict the 4th part which
looked as test set. In the end, we can accurate sum of the test sets to improve our
prediction. The illustration showed
howed in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Cross Validation

3.5 Decision Tree Averaging
After using the four different techniques for prediction we applied a final model which
was simply a decision tree which was trained on the four model fibrosis stage predictions,
and the biopsy fibrosis stage in hopes of improving the accuracy of the models. As
showed in Figure 6, the final decision tree increases the accuracy of the four techniques.
However, it should be noted that this prediction was not cross-validated, making the
increased accuracy less valuable.

Figure 6. Decision Tree Averaging

3.6 Results and Diagnostic Accuracy
Several methods were used to predict the accuracy of the predictive models. For each
model a consistency matrix was prepared, which counts the number of biopsy fibrosis
stage values vs. the predicted fibrosis stage. The table for the neural network model is
shown in Table 3.

From each of these tables counts of the prediction accuracy can be made for correct
predictions, high predictions, low predictions, and predictions within plus or minus on
fibrosis stage. Table 4 shows the counts for each model.

In addition the results can be grouped by Insignificant Fibrosis (F0 and F1) and
Significant Fibrosis (F2, F3, and F4) to evaluate the accuracy of models to discriminate
diseased cases from normal cases. These results are shown in Table 5.

These values show where significant disease correctly classified as positive (True
Positive fraction), and the percent of cases with the disease will be classified negative
(False Negative fraction). For those cases without the disease some will be correctly

classified as negative (True Negative fraction), but some cases without the disease will be
classified as positive (False Positive fraction). The Sensitivity provides the probability
that a test result will be positive when the disease is present. Specificity provides the
probability that a test result will be negative when the disease is not present. Positive
predictive value indicates the probability that the disease is present when the test is
positive. Negative predictive value provides the probability that the disease is not present
when the test is negative [25].

4. CONCLUSION
The four artificial intelligence methods presented showed significant variability in their
accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in predicting fibrosis stage in data on 424 hepatitis
patients. Neural network methods show the highest sensitivity and specificity, but were
relatively poor at predicting the exact fibrosis stage. Logistic regression and nave bayes
methods were the best a identifying the exact fibrosis stage. Logistic regression had the
highest Positive Predictive Value, and neural network methods had the highest Negative
Predictive Value.
We have completed the development of a web based beta system that utilizes publically
available patient data to address a single clinical decision  the prediction of fibrosis
stage for hepatitis patients. The CDSS-AI beta interface is shown in Figure 7. The
CDSS-AI system presents the four model outputs and the final decisions tree average in a
thermometer type output showing each prediction as a tick mark on the fibrosis scale
from 0 to 4. A blue line marks the biopsy value on the output if it is available. In the
patient example in Figure 7, fibrosis stage reported in the biopsy was F3. The correct
fibrosis stage was reported by the neural network model, the decision tree model, and the
decision tree summary model.
Study results suggest future work in expansion of the patient dataset and inclusion of
more specific serum markers, and comparison with other commercial non-invasive tests
including FibroScan, FIBROSpect II , FibroTest, FibroTest-ActiTest, and HCVFibroSure [26]. Also, additional serum markers should be considered such as viral load,

platelet count as well as patient history parameters such as alcohol use and body mass
index.
