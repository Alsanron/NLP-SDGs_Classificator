context of adult learning because they are usually involved in
both their study and job at the same time; therefore, a successful
completion of an online course depends on the efficient use of a
given amount of time. To a considerable degree, it is reported
that failure in an online course for adult learners results from
poor time management [11, 19].

ABSTRACT
In this paper, we describe a process of constructing proxy
variables that represent adult learners time management
strategies in an online course. Based upon previous research,
three values were selected from a data set. According to the
result of empirical validation, an (ir)regularity of the learning
interval was proven to be correlative with and predict learning
performance. As indicated in previous research, regularity of
learning is a strong indicator to explain learners consistent
endeavors. This study demonstrates the possibility of using
learning analytics to address a learners specific competence on
the basis of a theoretical background. Implications for the
learning analytics field seeking a pedagogical theory-driven
approach are discussed.

By analyzing adult learners online activity based on
educational data mining, instructors can detect the status of their
learning processes in an earlier stage. Given that most activities
of learners enrolled in online courses occur in a Learning
Management System (LMS), utilizing the log data within the
LMS could provide crucial insight into the learning analytics
field. If we can distinguish the learning patterns in the early
stage of an online course, it will be conducive to encouraging or
guiding learners by providing them with an appropriate
instructional intervention [4].

Categories and Subject Descriptors

Log data, which is saved as an unstructured data set, contains
users log information within online systems, and it can be used
to represent how the learning processes occur on the web
throughout the login duration. Furthermore, this information
might be more genuine when compared to the data from
surveys, which rely highly on learners recall and subjective
interpretations; thus, we do not have to consider the possibility
of distortion or low reliability [1, 12]. However, log data alone
cannot be transferred to the learning processes without a
sophisticated interpretation in regards to theoretical aspects. Our
contribution is to suggest an effective way to convert users log
data into predictive indicators of learning performance based on
theoretical background.

1. INTRODUCTION
There are high demands within e-learning for adult learners.
Over the past years, there have been an increase in online course
enrollment among adult learners in order to obtain knowledge or
develop professional skills [6, 17, 38]. However, difficulties
have also been posed by adult learners in taking online courses
due to their lack of time management skills [22].

The focuses of this study are twofold. First, we elicit
candidates for proxy variables from the log data set that
represent learners time management strategies as conceptual
constructs which have long been considered to be a vital factor
to their performances[2, 26, 31, 34, 42]. Second, we determine
whether the elicited proxy variables predict learner performance
in terms of verifying the empirical validity. If so, the proxy
variables can be used to detect the status of learners time
management and predict performance in other data sets from
similar contexts.

Time management strategies are increasingly required in the

2. PROXY VARIABLES TO REPRESENT
TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IN
LMS
Converting a gigantic data set into proxy variables involves the
following steps (see Fig. 1). First, the targeted conceptual
construct should be discussed based on previous research.
Theories addressed in previous research should dictate the
manipulation of data; further, necessary values, such as learning

183

Fig. 2 presents the relationship between each potential proxy
variable and sub-element of the time management strategy as a
targeted conceptual construct. As learners are required to invest
their time on their study in order to obtain an expected score for
completing the course while still having to work, the amount of
the total login time and the login frequency is regarded, to some
extent, as prioritization of the course over their work. The
assumption is in accordance with previous studies, which regard
time management as a technique for having sufficient time to
accomplish the required tasks [33, 39]. Likewise, the
relationship between regularity of login interval and prioritizing
tasks can be posited if we consider that learners who value the
course are likely to access the LMS regularly in order to obtain
updated information as well as not to get left behind.

time range, clicking point, login and logout time calculated from
data set, are selected in order to be used as the construct
variables. Then, proxy variables are elicited through the process.
In essence, by considering the theoretical aspect, we can
determine what should be included from the manipulated values.
The proxy variable, which is not identical to the targeted
conceptual construct but is optimally processed, can be applied
to other data sets. In this study, three variables are chosen on the
basis of previous studies.

2.2 Total login time
The degree to which learners invest their time has been
recognized as a powerful factor correlative with performance;
moreover, much research has reported a strong relationship
existent between the total studying time and performance [37].
In this study, total studying time is represented by the term
total login time, to measure the actual learning time. To
support the significance of the variable, Cotton and Savards
conception of learning time was adopted [7] (see Fig. 3). In the
study, learning time can be categorized into three parts:
Allocated Time (AT), Time-on-Task (TOT) and Academic
learning time (ALT); this conception is illustrated as follows.

Figure 1. A conceptual framework for the construction of a
proxy variable

2.1 Time management strategy
A large body of research argued that time management strategy
is deeply associated with the ability to prioritize tasks [18, 26].
In the study to determine whether time management strategy
attenuate adult learners' strain, Kaufman-Scarborough and
Lindquist [18] perceived prioritizing tasks as an essential factor,
which leads an individual to a value judgment. Jex and Elacqua
[21] reported that the prioritization of tasks is one of key factors
that comprises time management competence of those who well
organize their work. Meanwhile, within the perspective that
regards it as a sub-element of self-regulated learning,
researchers have emphasized the efficient use of time [15, 31,
32, 42]. The concept of the efficient use of time has
incorporated a series of sub-factors, such as sufficient amount of
time investment on tasks and active participation [9, 29, 39]. On
the other hand, a long-range planning has been considered to be
a crucial factor for explaining time management strategy [2, 11].
By sustaining an appropriate amount of time and efforts based
on a well-planned schedule, learners are able to maintain the
expected conditions over the long-term as well as achieve their
expected learning outcome more effectively. In essence, time
management strategy in learning can be defined as an effective
use of time by prioritizing the given tasks while sustaining the
consistent endeavors.

Figure 3. Three types of studying time
In this study, the author argued that the three different types of
time mentioned above are significantly correlated with learning
performance. Of course, it is hard to regard login time as
genuine academic learning time because merely logging into
LMS does not necessarily denote meaningful learning in itself.
However, we can easily assume that recorded login time
belongs with the allocated time or time-on-task when
considering that the greatest proportion of learning-related
activities occur within LMS, such as observing lectures,
gathering information, interacting with peers or submitting
assignments.
Therefore, we decided to use the login time to construct the
proxy variable as an indicator standing for the allocated time,
which is an extended concept in which two other types of time
are inherent.

2.3 Login frequency
How frequently learners participate in an online course has been
regarded as an important factor that predicts higher levels of
performance. Piccoli, Ahmad, and Ives [30] reported that
learners login frequency into LMS is highly correlated with
course satisfaction in online learning. Davies and Graff [8]
argued that participation frequency within online activities is
significantly associated with their grades. Kang, Kim, and Park
[20] demonstrated that total login frequency into LMS is
directly connected with not only learning performance, but also
attendance rate.

full-time job. This course is operated 100% online over a month.
At the end of the course, all participants were required to take a
test.

In this study, we assume that the more frequently learners log
into LMS, the more newly updated and shared information they
shall obtain, which is a factor that leads to their better
understanding of the learning content as well as what they must
prepare for classes. The login frequency was calculated by
adding up the number of individual students login time into
LMS.

4.2 Measures and Variables
4.2.1 Suggested independent variables
Log data was collected from the LMS by an automatic
collection module embedded within the system. The Total login
time, Login frequency and (ir)regularity of learning interval
were extracted as independent variables.

In this study, we assume that the more frequently learners log
into LMS, the more newly updated and shared information they
shall obtain, a factor which shall lead to their better
understanding of learning content and of what they must
prepare for classes.

4.2.2 Dependent variable
Learning performance, a dependent variable in this study, is
defined as a score of the final test, which consisted of 20
multiple choice items. The scores from each question were
collected and added together in order to obtain the total score.
The total score was graded on a scale of one hundred points.

2.4 (Ir)regularity of learning interval
Regularity of learning is defined as the extent to which learners
regularly engage in learning, and has been recognized as one of
the time management strategies [10]. Many researchers have
found that the regularity of learning positively predicts learning
performance [28, 35].

Table 2. Means, standard deviations of variables (n=200)

In this study, data is calculated into a standard deviation of the
login interval. Thus, it basically indicates the irregularity of
learning interval. To be specific, in the following (see Fig. 4),
the gap between A and B indicates the total course period, and
 t1,2 is an interval between the first and second login time
calculated by subtracting t1 from t2. In the same way, we can
obtain nth, the interval which is presented as tn-1, n.
Consequently, the mean of the learners login interval can be
calculated, and the standard deviation is subsequently elicited
from the mean, as indicated in Fig. 5.

4.3 Multiple Linear Regression Analysis
A multiple regression analysis was conducted in order to
determine whether the three suggested values, which serve as
proxy indicators of time management strategy, predict learning
performance. The results are presented in Table 3.

Figure 4. Concept of learning interval

It is shown that the suggested three variables account for 20.8%
of the variance in learning performance (F=36.267, p < .01).
Of these three proxy variables, only (ir)regularity of learning
interval was found to predict learning performance (=-4.343,
t=-10.115, p < .01).

5. DISCUSSION
The result reveals that only the (ir)regularity of learning interval
factor is proven to predict learning performance.

7. REFERENCES

Indeed, some of the research reported a limited relation between
studying time and learning performance. Ha and colleagues [14],
insisted that total studying time is not related to learning
performance, and Lee [23] highlighted the fact that learning
performance can be increased only when learners are fully
concentrated on what they do, regardless of the total amount of
available time. Similarly, login frequency cannot fully explain
learners meaningful learning. Although learners access LMS
frequently, learners actual studying time might be relatively
short. It is also likely that they intensively log into LMS at a
certain point rather than constantly participating in academic
activities. Such a tendency has been reported to hinder wellplanned learning, resulting in either procrastination or a lack of
effective time use [16].

The regularity of the learning interval, meanwhile, can provide
critical evidence as to the fact that learners who more steadily
log into LMS from the beginning of a study to the end show
better performance. This involves neither a temporal access at a
certain point nor merely a one long time visit, but rather a wellintended and conscious learning over a relatively long term. As
a matter of fact, several articles recognize regular participation
as a vital key to success in learning [3, 25, 26, 41]. Given that
the time management strategy has been considered to involve
the learners self-regulation, long-term planning and sustaining
efforts, the regularity of learning is expected to be a strong
indicator of time management strategy.

6. CONCLUSION
This study has made a contribution to learning analytics, within
the context of an adult learners time management strategy
which has been considered to be an essential factor for
successful learning in andragogy [5].

This study shows a process of converting complex log patterns
into elaborated proxy variables based on both a ripe
theoretical foundation and well-intended manipulation. It
demonstrates a possibility of further research regarding the
formation of more sophisticated proxy variables that represent
certain conceptual constructs drawn from an enormous database.
Until now, much research in the learning analytics field has
been conducted in a data-driven way and frequently with scarce
theoretical background [13]. Recently, however, the learning
analytics field has constantly maintained its emphasis on the
learning and teaching areas as well in contrast to its strong root
as a data-driven approach [40]. The social and pedagogical
usage of learning analytics is being actively discussed now, as
researchers search to define it as a separate field by which to
improve learning opportunities away from business area [13, 24].
Along this line, an abundant theoretical foundation is required
for the extensive application of research findings into the real
world context.

This study has limitations as well. We could not track the
specific time use of the learners. With log data which better
mapped a variety of time use on different menus and web pages,
a more accurate analysis to catch real studying time could have
been made possible. If we can track the learners specific time
use in LMS and thus extract actual studying time from log data
at every moment, it would be possible to more clearly
