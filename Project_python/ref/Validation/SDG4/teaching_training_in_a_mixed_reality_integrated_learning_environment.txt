In this mixed-method study, we examined the design and potential impact of a mixed-reality integrated
learning environment (MILE) in providing the simulated and immersive teaching practice for university
teaching assistants. A virtual-reality-based learning platform integrating a Kinect-enabled sensorimotor
interface was developed and used by twenty three university teaching assistants. Qualitative and
quantitative data on the participants' participation behaviors, engagement, and perceptions were
collected via video/screen recording, interview, surveys on teaching self-efcacy and sense of presence,
and eye tracking. Results indicated that the MILE reinforced sense of presence and supported the performance of an ample range of virtual teaching tasks/actions with avatar-embodied live gesturing. The
environmental delity in the mixed-reality learning spaces, the design and arrangement of virtual agents
and avatars, and the affordance of embodied gesturing and walking are salient MILE design features that
affected participants' sense of presence and their virtual teaching performance.

1. Introduction
The recent development of computer hardware and software
has made it feasible to incorporate Internet-based, 3D virtual reality (VR) in innovative applications of teaching, learning, and
training (Abulrub, Attridge, & Williams, 2011; Gregory et al., 2013;
Jou & Wang, 2013). Virtual reality (VR) or virtual world is a
computer-generated 3D representation of real-life environments. A
user can autonomously navigate around a VR (in the form of avatars) and interact with simulated objects and other avatars in real
time at the same pace one would experience events in the real
world (Mitchell, Parsons, & Leonard, 2007). In comparison with
other computerized programs, virtual reality supports realistic,
immersive simulation to enable the transfer of skills between
taught and real contexts, and provides a multi-user, embodied, and
interactive space for real time active learning (Cheng & Wang,
2011). It is speculated that VR can act as a promising tool for
training skill application and complex problem solving that requires weighing multiple variables and situational decision making

The emerging 3D body sensory technology, such as Microsoft
Kinect, can be used as an intuitive interface to create a naturalistic,
augmented interaction between users and a VR-based simulation,
thus merging real and virtual worlds to support the mixed reality
(Ohta & Tamura, 2014). A Kinect captures a user's body gestures and
replicates them in a computer application, which offers new ways
of human-computer interaction in educational settings. In a Kinectenabled, mixed-reality environment, a user can use physical body
movements to interact with the virtual characters and objects in
the virtual reality. Kinect-based applications in a VR setting may
help to enhance the sense of presence and immersion, and facilitate
embodied and situated cognition of learners.
The use of a mixed-reality integrated learning environment
(MILE) is just emerging (Hayes, Straub, Dieker, Hughes, & Hynes,
2013; Liarokapis & Anderson, 2010; Staub, Dieker, Hynes, &
Hughes, 2014), and is in need of empirical research on its design,
implementation, and educational effectiveness. In this study, we
examined the design and application of a mixed-reality integrated
learning environment e a virtual reality learning platform that
integrates a Kinect-enabled sensorimotor interface e in the setting
of teaching training for university teaching assistants. Teaching is a
complex problem solving task that requires contextualized and
adaptive implementation of content representation and (both
verbal and embodied) interpersonal interaction. Learning to teach
is a challenging and important area of inquiry for educational

practice and research (Quintana & Ferna
implementation of MILE for teaching training will help to inform
the role of this emerging platform in providing embodied,
immersive interactions for learning a complex task, and to test its
implementation feasibility via the lens of future teachers. Specifically, this exploratory study aimed to address two research questions: (1) What is the effectiveness of the mixed-reality integrated
learning environment for teaching training? (2) What features of
this learning environment inuence participants' perceptions and
teaching-training experiences?

Kermarrec, Buche, & Tisseau, 2008; Park et al., 2007). The unique
affordances of an immersive VR learning environment include: (a)
virtual agents and avatars that act as personalized and interactive
learning partners that cannot be easily arranged in a physical
setting, (b) the open-endedness in creating and customizing the 3D
VR environment that enables the provision of multiple perspectives
and scenarios for the targeted concepts and skills, and (c) the potential to transform sensory representations to enhance virtual
learning actions (Bailenson et al., 2008; Dede, 2009).
2.2. Embodied and situated cognition

2. Theoretical framework
2.1. Sense of presence and immersion in a virtual learning
environment
Sense of presence refers to a state of consciousness and the
psychological sense of being in the virtual place (Bareld &
Hendrix, 1995; Heeter, 1992; Lee, 2004; Slater & Wilbur, 1997, p.
1; Witmer, Jerome, & Singer, 2005). Previous studies reported that
sense of presence reduces the social distance between learners, and
enhances skills acquisition and knowledge transfer by allowing
multiple perspectives and situated performance (Dede, 2009;
Mantovani & Castelnuovo, 2003; Palloff & Pratt, 1999; Slater &
Wilbur, 1997). It was found that sense of presence in virtual
learning environments foster learners' motivation, learning
engagement, and potentially learning outcomes, by enabling
focused and naturalistic interactions with learning materials and
activities (Mikropoulos, 2006; Persky et al., 2009; Selverian &
Hwang, 2003).
A design construct closely related to sense of presence is immersion e the extent of the subjective impression that one is
participating in a comprehensive, realistic experience and the
semi-voluntary experience of being transported into an alternate
context for an extended duration (Buchanan, 2006, p. 10; Dede,
2005, p. 10). Prior research suggested that the higher level of immersion is associated with the higher level of presence (Bystrom,
Bareld, & Hendrix, 1999; Faiola, Newlon, Pfaff, & Smyslova,
2013; Slater & Wilbur, 1997). Experience of immersion can be
created via the sensory and environmental delity in the threedimensional virtual space, engagement with the virtual actions,
and emotional experience activated by the archetypical scenarios in
the virtual space (Dede, 2009).
The recent development of computer hardware and software
has made it feasible to incorporate Internet-based, 3D virtual reality (VR) to create an immersive learning environment (Abulrub
et al., 2011; Gregory et al., 2013). In fact, VR has been implemented as a promising learning platform to support a variety of
education activities in both formal and informal learning settings
(Hew & Cheung, 2010; Jou & Wang, 2013). In a qualitative, obserndez (2015) reported that
vatory study, Quintana and Ferna
immersive virtual reality can provide a virtual space to simulate
teaching challenges and hence act as a pedagogical tool for the
collaborative teaching training program. In comparison with other
computerized programs, VR is characterized with representational
delity and learner interaction, supports a psychological sense of
presence and an immersive practice to facilitate experiential
learning, and provides a multi-user space for embodied interactions (Dalgarno & Lee, 2010). Previous studies suggested that
the immersive VR learning environment also fosters situated
learning through simulating authentic contexts and providing
contextualized learning activities (Bailenson et al., 2008; Barab,
Sadler, Heiselt, Hickey, & Zuiker, 2007; Ketelhut, Dede, Clarke,
Nelson, & Bowman, 2007), thus improving performance transfer
from the learning context to the real-world setting (Bossard,

Situated and embodied cognition theories hold that cognition is
not abstract or centralized but a situated activity that takes place in
active and continuous interactions with the environment, vastly via
perceptual and motor activities (Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989).
Motor functions are traditionally considered only peripheral input
and output devices for the central cognitive processes. But the
evolving perspective of embodied cognition argues that cognitive
processes are deeply rooted and should be understood in the
context of the body's interactions with the environment (Anderson,
2003; Shapiro, 2010; Wilson, 2002). Sensorimotor processing, thus,
becomes a meaningful context and a necessary part of cognitive
processing. Another perspective of embodied and situated cognition is that cognitive processing can be off-loaded onto the external
environment, via either real-time, task-relevant actions or off-line,
mental simulations of sensorimotor experiences. The emergence
and development of 3D motion sensing technology, such as
Microsoft Kinect, has provided a valuable and exciting avenue for
implementing and examining the propositions of the embodied
and situated cognition when designing an active and meaningful
learning environment.
Schubert, Friedmann, and Regenbrecht (1999) framed presence
as the consequence of embodied cognition e presence emerges
when bodily actions in a virtual environment are mentally represented and the virtual environment is actively interpreted. The
central interactions with the virtual environment that foster
embodied presence are the representation of navigation and
movement of one's own body as an action in the virtual world
(Bailenson et al., 2008; Schubert et al., 1999). Prior research on
learning in virtual learning environment typically examined
embodied agents (driven by computer algorithms) as opposed to
avatars (driven by humans in real time). It is due to the lack of
readily available commercial technology that allows the creation of
digital avatars who track and render users' gestures in a collaborative virtual learning environment (Bailenson et al., 2008). Hence
it is necessary to conduct an empirical investigation to explore the
implications of the behavioral realism (i.e., embodied presence) of
the avatar enabled by the body sensory technologies in the VR
environment for learners' sense of presence and engagement.
2.3. Mixed-reality integrated teaching training for graduate
teaching assistants
Teaching is a complex problem-solving task that requires
weighing many variables and adaptively implementing principles
of instruction, communication, and content representation in a
highly situated context (Dick, Carey, & Carey, 2011). Rather than
mechanically executing a preset sequence of instructional events,
teaching involves dynamic and complex interpersonal interaction
skills. Graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) participate extensively
in class, laboratory, and recitation teaching in higher education.
Teaching training for GTAs, then, is critical for supporting curriculum reforms, bolstering college teaching and learning, and training
future faculty members (Marincovich, Prostko, & Stout, 1998; Park,

214

F. Ke et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 62 (2016) 212e220

2004; Pentecost, Langdon, Asirvatham, Robus, & Parson, 2012). In
spite of the important role of GTAs in higher education, few receive
formal training in teaching (DeChenne, Enochs, & Needham, 2012;
Meyers, Lansu, Hundal, Lekkos, & Prieto, 2007; Prieto & Scheel,
2008).
The research on GTA training is limited and fragmentary
(DeChenne et al., 2012). Innovative efforts to bridge GTA teaching
training and research gaps are essential to promoting quality higher
education, and to preparing highly-qualied future faculty in
different academic disciplines. Feezel and Myers (1997) found that
GTAs experience eight interrelated types of communication
concern that affect these skills: self, task, impact, role conict,
teaching, area knowledge, procedural knowledge, and time management. International teaching assistants face additional challenges because of linguistic differences and cultural diversity and
sensitivity. However, prevalent formal training programs for GTAs
depict mainly administrative orientations and introductory presentations on pedagogy (Pentecost et al., 2012). The opportunity for
problem- or simulation-based training in instruction for GTAs is
scarce.
The recent development of 3D body sensory technology, such as
Microsoft Kinect, can be used as an intuitive interface to create a
naturalistic, augmented interaction between users and a VR-based
simulation. Specically, in a Kinect-integrated VR environment, a
GTA can use physical body movements to control an instructoravatar to perform augmented and active teaching practice in a
simulated class, or he/she can be embodied as a student in the class
to observe, critique, and learn from the teaching performance of
another GTA.
The use of mixed reality for simulated teaching and training is
just emerging, but there is preliminary evidence of its instructional
effectiveness (Hayes, Hardin, & Hughes, 2013; Hayes, Straub et al.,
2013; Liarokapis & Anderson, 2010). For example, Hayes, Hardin
et al. (2013), Hayes, Straub et al. (2013) examined the user experience of a 3D mixed-reality integrated classroom (called TeachLivE
, which uses a group of ve simulated/NPC students) that is used
to facilitate virtual rehearsal of lecturing and classroom management by Ke12 teachers. The descriptive case evidence suggests that
sense of presence and immersion in this mixed-reality integrated
classroom promotes engagement and the targeted teaching practice. It is warranted to further examine the design and potential
effectiveness of the mixed-reality integrated teaching training for
GTAs in the higher education setting.
3. Method
Due to the lack of systematic investigation, and hence, the lack
of design foundation and conceptual distinctions of the mixed reality integrated learning environments (MILE) for the teaching
training with GTAs, this study was structured using the exploratory
research framework. This mixed-method case study (Yin, 2013)
aimed to examine a MILE in its naturalistic implementation context
to delineate salient design factors of the MILE and the potential
explanatory relationship between design features and participants'
learning processes and perceptions. Data were collected via both
qualitative and quantitative methods on the design specications
and potential effectiveness of the VR-based, Kinect-integrated
learning environment.
3.1. Participants and mixed-reality integrated learning environment
Twenty three university teaching assistants were recruited from
the disciplines of education (n  10), engineering (n  5), business
(n  2), and arts and science (n  6) in a land-grant university in
United States. All these participants were international graduate

students from 6 different countries, including 12 females and 11
males. Out of the 23 participants, 7 had less than one-year teaching
experience, 6 had both online and face-to-face teaching experience,
and all were non-native English speakers.
Delivered via OpenSimulator (an open-source VR platform), a
virtual class simulation was designed to simulate the daily classroom setting at the university. Each participant was requested to
practice teaching in this virtual class, including lecturing, mentoring, and classroom management. The simulated audience in the
virtual class were a mixture of non-player characters (NPCs)
controlled by the articial intelligent (AI) script and student avatars
played by peer trainees. Using Kinect and a middleware that connected and interfaced Kinect with the Opensimulator platform, this
3D virtual class (see Fig. 1) enabled participants to project and
embody their real-time body movements and gestures onto their
avatars in the virtual world.
3.2. Data collection
3.2.1. Procedure
All participants were surveyed on their teaching self-efcacy,
demographics, academic background, and teaching experience
before the intervention. They were then provided a pre-study
orientation on the mixed-reality integrated learning environment
(MILE), and requested to participate in two one-hour MILE
teaching-training sessions.
In one session, each participant was requested to teach a selfchosen, domain-specic content topic to a virtual class of students. In the other session, the participant would sit in the virtual
class, act as a student along with other avatars and agents, and
interact with the virtual instructor played by another peer participant. It was speculated that acting as a student and observing how
peers teach a novel topic would award the participant an opportunity to experience, observe, and reect on varied teaching actions
and strategies, and potentially facilitate an interactive learning
experience by having participants challenging and critiquing each
other during the virtual class. The sequence of participating in the
two sessions was selected by each participant and randomized
across all. Right after the rst session, every participant received a
survey on the perceived sense of presence in the virtual class and a
second survey on their teaching self-efcacy. At the end of the
second session, participants were surveyed again on their sense of
presence and teaching self-efcacy.
Every MILE intervention session was screen and video recorded;
the recordings captured both online and ofine behaviors of participants when they interacted with the VR simulation via the
Kinect interface. Every participant received a 30-min, videostimulated, semi-structured recall interview at the end of each
intervention session. The interview focused on exploring participants' perceptions and experiences of the MILE. Six randomly
selected individual participants were also eye-tracked using the kit
of ASL Mobile Eye Tracking during the MILE-based teaching process.
Eye-tracking data would contribute supplementary data, in addition to the observed behaviors of participation, to provide information about the level of engagement and hence sense of
immersion exhibited by the program participants.
3.2.2. Instruments
Pre-, during-, and post-intervention teaching self-efcacy were
measured via a customized version of the Teaching Self Efcacy
Scale (Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk Hoy, 2001; 22 items, 9-point
scale, a  0.89 in this study). Two individual items in the original
scale questioned on the teaching practice that was not applicable in
the current study (e.g., How much can you assist families in
helping their children do well in school?), and hence were

removed. In certain survey items, the phrase of in school in the
original scale was customized to in class to reect the targeted
teaching setting in this study. A customized version of the presence
Questionnaire (Witmer et al., 2005; 24 items, 7-point scale, a  0.97
in this study) was used to measure participants' sense of presence
in the VR-based, Kinect-integrated learning environment. Two
items that questioned on the touchable interface in the original
questionnaire (e.g., How well could you actively survey or search
the virtual environment using touch) were customized and
replaced by two items measuring the sense of presence with the
virtual gesturing (e.g., How well could you communicate using
gestures in the virtual environment?). Both scales' construct validity has been validated by ineld, scale development studies
(Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk Hoy, 2001; Witmer et al., 2005). The
scales were also reviewed and validated by a panel of multimedia
and instructional design experts, comprising faculty members and
doctoral students in the eld of educational psychology and
instructional design, in this current study.
3.3. Data analysis
Descriptive statistics and paired t-tests were conducted with the
survey results to examine whether the sense of presence was
supported and sustained in the VR-based, Kinect-integrated
learning environment, and to investigate the potential changes in
participants' teaching self-efcacy. We conducted a behavior
analysis with the recorded participants' performance in the intervention sessions. Systematically, we coded the recorded virtualparticipation behaviors per 30 seconds and categorized the attributes, contexts, and frequency of salient actions to explore the
nature of the MILE-based lecturing, gesturing, interaction, and
classroom management. We then performed a qualitative thematic
analysis with the interview data, focusing on learners' perceptions

of the MILE for the teaching practice. We triangulated the survey,
behavioral analysis, and thematic analysis ndings to gather the
descriptive evidence on the effects of the MILE and develop propositions on the association between its design features and learning
effectiveness. Eye-tracking data were analyzed to identify patterns
of engagement and potential evidence of sense of presence of
participants during the MILE-based teaching training.
4. Results
4.1. Sense of presence and immersion
The paired t-test comparing the sense-of-presence survey
response at the end of the rst intervention session (M1  108.1 out
of a total of 168, SD1  18.4) with that at the end of the second
session (M2  105.1, SD2  22.6) did not indicate a statistically
signicant difference, t(22)  0.73, p  0.47. Both had a mean value
that was higher than 60% of the maximum scale score. This result
suggested that the sense of presence was fostered and sustained
during MILE-based teaching training and there was no differential
effect of acting as a teacher or a student in the virtual world on the
sense of presence. During the interview when participants were
asked to rate the degree of immersion in the MILE, only 2 out of all
23 participants gave an estimate lower than 60%. Specically, participants' responses to the survey items on live gesturing in VR
indicated a general endorsement of Kinect-based embodied presence, M  8.4 (60% out of 14), SD  3.4.
Via the behavior analysis of participants' actions and reactions in
MILE sessions, we further explored the affordance of the non-player
characters (NPCs), Kinect-enabled virtual gesturing, and the VRbased teaching simulation for fostering learner immersion in the
MILE. The result indicated that around 56% of the NPC-related
participant behaviors portrayed a positive experience of

216

F. Ke et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 62 (2016) 212e220

immersion. Particularly, it was found that participants tried to
interact with an NPC in the same earnest manner as that with a real
student, Mario (an NPC student), is that your leg on the table?
What is that? Put your leg DOWN please! Yet the low voice volume, occasional out-of-context inquiries (e.g., requesting the
extension of assignment deadlines when the instructor was still
giving a lecture), and the lack of reciprocal reactions of NPCs (e.g.,
Mario did not put down the leg as requested) led to the lessening of
realism in NPC-initiated interactions. In the current MILE, NPCs in
the virtual class delivered mainly pre-timed, pre-set behaviors and
utterances; they could not reciprocally interacted with an
instructor or a student avatar. Around 43% of participants reported
that in the virtual class they gradually recognized that these characters, different from avatars, were actually non-human. Consequently, it was observed that those participants attended to
lecturing more than student interaction or classroom management
in the later part of virtual teaching. One of them commented, I just
don't care anymore.
In general, around 78% of observed user interactions evidenced
an immersive engagement of participants in the virtual, simulated
teaching environment. In the remaining 22% enactments, participants were found to interact with items in their physical environment (e.g., self-brought lecturing handouts) or question the
observing researcher about the virtual class simulation. This
observation indicated that the environmental distractions were not
fully suppressed and the experience of immersion in the MILE
might have been interrupted.
All study participants performed a succession of avatarembodied live gesturing during virtual teaching. More than 90%
of gesturing actions portrayed the experience of embodied presence, which comprised beat gestures in conjunction with the
rhythm of speech to emphasize certain phrases, pointing gestures
(i.e., act of pointing as a way of referring to an object or event), and
representational gestures (i.e., gestures used to explain the form or
nature of a concept). The remaining 10% of gesturing and bodymovement behaviors demonstrated insufcient virtual presence.
Particularly, the Kinect equipment captured a xed physical area.
The embodied gesturing would be interrupted when a participant
accidentally stepped out of the capturing zone during lecturing.

4.1.1. Engagement with the virtual teaching simulation
The eye-tracking data in this study (Table 1) have captured the
dwell time (i.e., the continuous time spent by participants looking
at the selected area of interest e the virtual reality display e
regardless of how many individual xations this involved), and the
duration and frequency of xations (i.e., the pause of the eye
movement, for more than 100 ms, on the area of interest). The
output indicated an average of 765.06 s for the dwell time on the
AOI (area of interest e the VR display of the virtual class) in comparison with an average of 205.48 s for the dwell time out of the
AOI, an average of 367.44 s in the xation time on the AOI versus an

average of 66.46 s in the xation time out of the AOI, and an average
of 1601.83 xations on the AOI versus an average of 366.5 xations
out of the AOI. The output suggested that participants portrayed a
high level of attention on the AOI e VR-based teaching simulation,
implying a high degree of immersion and engagement.
A further analysis of the eye-tracking and video/screen
recording data indicated that participants' gazing out of the AOI
(the VR display of the virtual class) occurred mainly in the following
situations: (1) deliberating in reaction to a challenging student
behavior or inquiry, (2) trying to retrieve materials and nd help
from an ofine lecturing aid, (3) being distracted by the unexpected
environmental noise (e.g., coughing or sneezing of the observing
researcher), (4) pondering before answering a question or
continuing the instruction. Among these four situations, the rst
and last ones were responses and signs of cognitive engagement
(e.g., head tilting or lowering as a sign of uncertainty and thinking).
The second and third situations were indicative of physicalenvironment disruptions formed by a conicting object of attention (e.g., the ofine lecturing aids in addition to the virtual ones)
and the lack of exclusiveness in the simulated learning space (e.g.,
the onsite presence of an observing researcher as a diversion from
the virtual presence of VR students).
4.2. Teaching self-efcacy
The paired t-tests with the pre, mid, and post-survey results of
the teaching self-efcacy did not indicate statistically signicant
differences in the teaching self-efcacy before, in between, and
after the two intervention sessions, t(pre-post)  1.50, p  0.15;
t(pre-mid)  0.05, p  0.96. A ceiling effect on teaching selfefcacy may have occurred, due to the nding that before the
intervention study participants had reported an average of 76%
teaching self-efcacy and a median of 17.5-month teaching
experience.
There was actually a numerical decline in teaching self-efcacy
from the pre-intervention (Mpre  150.9 out of a total of 198,
SDpre  28.3) and the mid-intervention conditions (Mmid  151.0,
SDmid  29.9) to the post-intervention condition (Mpost  132.5,
SDpost  44.9). An explanation of such a trend, based on the qualitative data, is that the two-hour MILE intervention helped participants develop a better understanding of the challenges in
managing a heterogeneous learner group during lecturing and
hence increased their awareness of the lack of competence in
classroom management. For the VR-based class simulation, we
purposefully gathered and replicated a variety of disruptive student
scenarios e complaints (e.g., I don't understand you! or This is
boring!), irrelevant questions, non-compliant behaviors (e.g.,
putting legs onto the table, leaving class to pick up a cell phone),
and verbal challenges (e.g, Do you speak English?). Embedded as
incessant disturbances during one's lecturing in the virtual class,
these disruptive student scenarios appeared to challenge most
study participants. They unanimously reported the lack of opportunities to experience and practice on those scenarios in their
conventional teaching practice. As observed, participants
frequently showed disorientation when encountering disruptive
students during virtual lecturing. Some participants ignored or
reacted heatedly towards students' disruptive behaviors, or
appeared defensive with the interruptive, insolent comments made
by NPC students. More participants expressed that the experience
of handling difcult students were thought-provoking, as one of
them explained, Negative comment is more effective, because I am
curious and cautious when getting negative comments. Participants generally expressed discontent with their failure to complete
an intended lecture due to the intermittent classroom-managing
encounters. Frequent comments were, It's hard, I forgot what I

F. Ke et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 62 (2016) 212e220

intended to say, I was busy looking at the classroom, and The
experience made me see the gap (between the expected and current teaching performance).

4.3. VR-based teaching practice
During interviewing, 22 out of 23 participants stated that the
MILE should be very helpful for training novice teaching assistants.
When asked to rate their virtual teaching experience, participants
reported an average of 78% degree of satisfaction. The behavior
analysis with participants' virtual teaching processes showed a
comprehensive portray of the targeted teaching performance by
the participants, supporting the affordance of the VR-based, Kinectintegrated learning environment as an alternative platform for
active teaching practice. Salient teaching tasks, teaching actions,
and componential strategies performed by the participants during
virtual teaching sessions, along with performance frequencies
congregated across all participants, are outlined in Table 2.
Among the teaching actions performed by the study participants, 66% were for instruction (or lecturing), 19% were for classroom management, and only 15% was contributed to student
interaction. Pertinently, more than 80% of participants expressed a
teaching belief that focuses on instruction rather than student
interaction or management, as highlighted by a participant
comment, The importance is to prepare the lecture, not the
classroom. The reduced involvement in interacting with students
may also relate to the difculty of performing reciprocal and dynamic interactions with NPC students and hence a reduced sense of
presence with the instructor-student interaction. Among the
instructor-student interactions, 66% were contributed to question
answering. Notably, participants had managed to verbally and
nonverbally connect to individual students (21% of the instructorstudent interactions) and greet them (13%), demonstrating social
engagement with their virtual students to some extent.
All study participants were able to deliver a comprehensive and
multi-step instruction during the virtual teaching sessions (as
shown by Fig. 2). Their lecturing performance comprised all major
events and actions that are expected for a conventional instruction.

Such a nding further afrmed the potential effectiveness of a VRbased, Kinect-integrated learning environment in promoting an
authentic teaching rehearsal.
Another observation of the Kinect-integrated learning environment was that study participants were able to naturally convey
live gesturing via their avatars during the process of virtual
teaching. Among the teaching gestures performed (a total of 663
gestures coded across participants), 29% were representational
gestures that were used to embody and represent a concept, 18%
were pointing gestures that aimed to obtain or guide the audience's
attention, and 53% were beating gestures that were used with the

rhythm of speech. This nding suggested that integrating Kinect in
the virtual-reality-based training environment enabled the participants to actively practice both verbal and nonverbal teaching
strategies in an integrative manner.
4.4. Salient design features of the MILE
The MILE in this study simulated a conventional teaching
environment and a heterogeneous student group with disruptive
behaviors/requests. The environmental delity of the virtual class,
the selection of domain-specic archetypical teaching scenarios/
tasks, the arrangement of virtual agents and avatars, and the
affordance of Kinect-based embodied gesturing all appeared to
inuence participants' sense of presence and the externalization of
their teaching techniques and beliefs.
4.4.1. Fidelity and design of the mixed-reality learning space
The virtual class, along with the building where it is situated,
was designed to fully simulate a conventional classroom in the
building of college of education at the sampled university. Participants of education and arts and science majors who were used to
such type of classroom all commented the 3D virtual space as real
or authentic. Yet those of other majors criticized that the size,
seating arrangement, or interior design of the classroom were
different from what they experienced or expected, as the
following quotes from participants indicated.
This class was a little small.
I don't think the current seating arrangement will work for
group activities.
I was used to a lab than a teaching station.
The colors of the carpet and wall are too dark.
Those comments indicated the need to customize the classroom
design based on varied teaching settings and disciplinary cultures.
A related observation was the importance of selecting and
designing domain-specic, archetypical teaching scenarios and
tasks. Lecturer-led direct instruction was depicted as the major
teaching method in the intervention. Yet multiple participants of
science, engineering, and business majors reported that in their
academic disciplines, graduate teaching assistants mainly participated in laboratory and recitation teaching that comprised more
discussion facilitation or lab-activity mentoring than lecturing.
Unanimously, participants complained about the difculty of
establishing common reference during virtual lecturing. Although
the shared media boards in the virtual world enabled media
sharing/viewing among the virtual instructor and students,
embodied pointing and gazing onto a reference object (e.g., a line
within a virtual PowerPoint slide) to achieve joint attention and
shared focus during the virtual lecturing was tricky. Particularly, the
instructor had to mirror Kinect-enabled pointing or gazing to an
object in the physical space onto the corresponding virtual reference in the virtual space (as indicated in Fig. 3). Such an action
comprised a uent and simultaneous execution of multiple steps
(e.g., checking on the virtual-reality presentation screen, reading
the virtual media board, reading the physical lecturing aid, and
estimating the reference point to point to) and was in need of much
practice by the teaching trainee. Moreover, certain participants
commented on the lack of embodied scripting during virtual
lecturing. One explained, I'd like to use blackboard when I explain
something. It might relate to my thinking. I'd like to use some chalk,
move my hand, and write something during the lecture.
Another critical design requirement for integrating the virtual

and physical learning spaces to create an immersive MILE is the
suppression of environmental distractions from the physical space.
In this current study, the MILE was set up in a conventional conference room to better evaluate the implementation of such a
learning environment in a low-cost, daily school setting. Researchers stayed in the same room to conduct onsite observation.
Thus the exclusiveness of the space could be comprised. Even with
the headsets, participants might still be distracted by the presence
of the onsite observers. Additionally, some study participants
admitted that they did not fully prepare their lectures before the
teaching session, and had intermittently looked at the lecturing
aids (e.g., papers and slides) in their hands rather than focusing on
their virtual students in the class.
4.4.2. Differential roles of virtual agents and avatars
Students in the virtual class comprised both non-player characters (NPCs) controlled by the articial intelligent (AI) script and
avatars played by peer trainees. As observed, NPC agents presented
initiative prompts that had stimulated reactive teaching behaviors
with emotional experience of participants. Nervous, uncomfortable, upset, and embarrassed described emotional reactions of around 65% of participants toward these NPC prompts.
The prompts also managed to externalize participants' internal
teaching beliefs or preferences. For example, one commented, I
saw him (an NPC student), but I just didn't care. The importance is
to prepare the lecture, not the classroom. Another echoed, I am
kind of shy, so whenever I am dealing with my lecture, I tried to
look at my lecture slides. Correspondingly, participants were
found to be either active or passive in managing student behaviors,
portraying different student-management actions that were
normative, coercive, retreating, or remunerative (as described in
Table 2). On the other hand, participants commented that the
verbal (i.e., voice, tone, and content) and body languages of certain
NPCs were uncharacteristic in comparison to typical university
students in the sampled university. One of them said, They won't
be so rude. Students in high school may be.
The lack of reciprocity and contextualization in NPC-initiated
interactions necessitated the inclusion of avatars to facilitate the
lecture-related instructor-student interaction. For example, a
participant commented on the lack of content-specic queries from
an NPC, He said he didn't understand, but I would need more
details as to why and what he didn't understand. When acting as
virtual students, participants were found to be attentive and proactive in questioning their peers on the content lectured. Viewing
others' teaching performance also stimulated the intent to selfevaluate one's own teaching. Multiple participants had requested
the feedback and the review of their teaching archives after
viewing others' teaching performance.
4.4.3. Embodied gesturing and walking
Kinect-enabled gesturing was well observed and documented
during participants' virtual teaching process (as reported in the
previous sections). Another frequently-mentioned component for
embodied presence in the MILE was walking, which can be illustrated by a participant quote  I like to interact with each individual student. I will walk to them. Walking toward and among
students while talking was reported as a preferred interactive
teaching style by multiple study participants. Yet the scope and
distance of walking was somewhat constrained by the limits of the
Kinect sensor. A walking zone was hence marked out on the ground
of the conference room; participants had to check this physical
boundary while walking and talking. Free movement, thus, was not
a natural occurrence.
Another salient design feature related to the embodied presence
in the MILE is the point of view. In the virtual world, participants

F. Ke et al. / Computers in Human Behavior 62 (2016) 212e220

were able to shift between a zoom-in, rst person view and a zoomout, third-person perspective. Some preferred the former because
they would like to have a close-up view of their virtual students, to
have (simulated) eye contact with students, and to avoid seeing
their own gesturing because it is distractive. Others preferred the
latter so they could better track the whole class. The shifting between the rst-person and third-person views, however, was
controlled via an external Bluetooth mouse, which created another
impediment for the embodied presence.

5. Discussion and conclusions
5.1. Discussion
This current study, supporting the prior research on the mixedreality integrated teaching training for pre-service teachers (Hayes,
Hardin et al., 2013; Hayes, Straub et al., 2013; Liarokapis &
Anderson, 2010), has provided preliminary evidence on the applicability of the mixed-reality integrated teaching training in the
higher education setting. Different from the mixed-reality
arrangement in prior research, the MILE in this study involves
only open-source software, low-cost technology, and a daily conference room set-up. Hence it is fairly accessible and transferrable
to be implemented in other universities or schools.
The nding on study participants' satisfaction with and active
practice of Kinect-based, avatar-embodied live gesturing for
lecturing is particularly encouraging. Creating digital avatars who
track and render users' gestures in a collaborative virtual learning
environment hasn't been reported in prior research (Bailenson
et al., 2008). This study indicated that the emerging, commercial
body sensory technology can be integrated into a virtual-realitybased simulation to create a mixed-reality learning space and
enable embodied presence. In this study, users can naturally convey
live representational, pointing, and beating gesturing via their avatars during the process of virtual instruction. Based on the situated
and embodied cognition perspectives (Anderson, 2003; Brown
et al., 1989; Shapiro, 2010; Wilson, 2002), a potential hypothesis
to be further investigated is that the embodied gesturing during
virtual teaching may reinforce not only embodied presence, but
also the conceptual representation of the content topic and hence
pedagogical content knowledge development for the teaching
trainees. On the other hand, the Kinect sensor cannot fully support
the embodied, free walking/talking, or the gazing-based joint

attention among a virtual class. Hopefully, the forthcoming sensory
and augmented-reality technologies can address these functionality issues to enhance the affordance of a MILE for creating the
embodied presence.
In this study, the prevalence of lecturing-oriented teaching actions may be due to the pre-selected teaching scenario (i.e.,
lecturing on a self-chosen content topic), the prevalent teaching
belief among teaching trainees, and the lack of reciprocity in agentinitiated interactions. Potential design improvements are: (a) taking advantage of the open-endedness of the virtual reality to
develop a variety of teaching scenarios to suit disciplinary and
teaching-style differences, or inviting the participatory design of
the teaching trainees in teaching scenario development; and (b)
customizing the articial intelligence scripts to enhance the reciprocity and adaptiveness of the agent-related interactions, while
arranging a balanced mixture of agents and avatars in the virtual
world.
Overall, our empirical ndings on the salient features and constrains of the current MILE as an immersive teaching-training
platform are in agreement with the claim of Bailenson et al.
(2008) and Dede (2009) that we can create immersion and sense
of presence via the environmental delity in the three-dimensional
virtual space, provision of virtual actions, and emotional experience
activated by the archetypical scenarios in the virtual space.

5.2. Conclusions
The study suggested that a mixed-reality integrated learning
environment (MILE) will reinforce sense of presence and potentially act as an immersive platform for active teaching training.
Presence survey and interviewing responses, user interactions, and
eye-tracking results all indicated that participants were engaged
and immersed in the VR-based, Kinect-integrated teaching practice. In the MILE, participants have accomplished an ample range of
teaching tasks/actions and performed a succession of avatarembodied live gesturing during virtual teaching. Although there
is no enough statistical evidence supporting the effect of the twohour MILE intervention on teaching self-efcacy, participating
GTAs tend to develop a better understanding and awareness of the
challenge of classroom management. Moreover, the study found
that the environmental delity and the integration of the virtual
and physical learning spaces, the design and arrangement of virtual
agents and avatars, and the affordance of embodied gesturing and

220

walking are salient design features that affect participants' sense of
presence and their virtual teaching performance.
5.3. Limitation and future research
This mixed-method study mainly collected behavioral and
qualitative evidence on the potential effectiveness of the MILE with
a relatively small sample. The impacts of the MILE on sense of
presence, teaching competence, and other teaching skills should be
further investigated via an experimental comparison study. Future
research should also examine the ways that other emerging body
sensory technologies can be used to provide a valuable avenue for
the design of an immersive learning environment, and the corresponding design features that promote situated learning and
transfer.
