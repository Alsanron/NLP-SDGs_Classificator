Inadequacy of spatial soil information is one of the limiting factors to making evidence-based decisions to improve food security and land management in the developing countries. Various digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques have been applied in many parts of the world to improve availability and usability of soil data, but less has
been done in Africa, particularly in Tanzania and at the scale necessary to make farm management decisions. The
Kilombero Valley has been identied for intensied rice production. However the valley lacks detailed and up-todate soil information for decision-making. The overall objective of this study was to develop a predictive soil map
of a portion of Kilombero Valley using DSM techniques. Two widely used decision tree algorithms and three
sources of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were evaluated for their predictive ability. Firstly, a numerical classication was performed on the collected soil prole data to arrive at soil taxa. Secondly, the derived taxa were spatially predicted and mapped following SCORPAN framework using Random Forest (RF) and J48 machine learning
algorithms. Datasets to train the model were derived from legacy soil map, RapidEye satellite image and three
DEMs: 1 arc SRTM, 30 m ASTER, and 12 m WorldDEM. Separate predictive models were built using each DEM
source. Mapping showed that RF was less sensitive to the training set sampling intensity. Results also showed
that predictions of soil taxa using 1 arc SRTM and 12 m WordDEM were identical. We suggest the use of RF algorithm and the freely available SRTM DEM combination for mapping the soils for the whole Kilombero Valley. This
combination can be tested and applied in other areas which have relatively at terrain like the Kilombero Valley.

1. Introduction
The Kilombero Valley in Tanzania presents great potential for the expansion and intensication of rice production. This valley, covering an
area of about 11,600 km2 (Kato, 2007), has been identied by the Government of Tanzania for nancial and technological investments to expand and intensify rice production (TIC, 2013). Rice is the second
most important cereal crop in Tanzania after maize (Bucheyeki et al.,
2011), and its demand has been increasing following shift in preference
by local population from traditional staples to rice, and increased market demands from neighboring countries. To develop and promote sustainable rice production intensication; farmers and policy makers need
to identify the most suitable areas and respective management options.
However, updated and detailed soil information to this support decision-making process is currently lacking.

Accurate soil information is crucial for informing management recommendations aimed to increase agricultural productivity and overall
food security, especially in developing countries where the GDP is
heavily dependent on the agricultural sector (Cook et al., 2008;
Msanya et al., 2002). Relatively longer time is required to gather such information through conventional soil inventory and generally, larger
amount of resources are required for such exercises (McBratney et al.,
2003). Recent developments in remote and proximal sensing, computational methods and information technology, have provided means by
which soil information can be collected, shared, communicated and updated more efciently (Malone, 2013; McBratney et al., 2003; Scull et
al., 2003; Vgen et al., 2013; Vgen et al., 2016; Winowiecki et al.,
2016a, 2016b). Predictive soil landscape model frameworks such as
the SCORPAN approach (McBratney et al., 2003) could be used to predict continuous soil classes and soil attributes that better represent
soil spatial variability. The increased availability of high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) that provide predictive variables in digital
soil mapping together with the advances in machine learning techniques add to the ease of generating spatial soil information and
depicting uncertainty (Hansen et al., 2009; Haring et al., 2012;
Subburayalu and Slater, 2013; Subburayalu et al., 2014).

map unit here shown in parentheses were: A (5), C (1), D (4), E (1), F
(5), K (8), P (2), SW (4), U (1) and W (2). The soil units have been described in Fig. 1.
In most cases it was not possible to properly describe the soil proles
below 80 cm depth because of the high water table. The soil prole morphological characteristics recorded for this study included genetic horizon designation, depths, and soil colour. Soil colour determination was
done in the eld by recording the hue, value, and chroma in the Soil
Munsell Colour Charts book (Munsell Colour Co., 1992) corresponding
to a moistened soil clod.

2.1. Legacy soil map

2.3. Laboratory analysis

The base map used to guide soil sampling was a reconnaissance legacy soil map developed in the late 1950s at a scale of 1:125,000 (FAO,
1961). The map was obtained in a scanned format from the World Soil
Survey Archive and Catalog (WOSSAC). The legacy map was prepared
based on aerial photo interpretation. The air photography at a scale of
1:30,000 was done by the British Royal Air Force in years 1948, 1949,
and 1950; Hunting Aerosurveys Ltd. in 1955; Fairey Air Surveys Ltd. in
1956; and Air Survey Division of Tanganyika in 1957. The scanned legacy soil map was georeferenced in QGIS version 2.2 software (QGIS
Development Team, 2014) using World Geodetic Survey 1984 (WGS84) datum and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate
system's zone 37 south. The soil units for the study area portion were
digitized on screen. The legacy map covering the study area included
10 soil groups (Fig. 1).

Soil samples were submitted to the soil analysis lab at Sokoine University of Agriculture for wet chemistry. Soil attributes that were analyzed in the laboratory included: soil pH (McLean, 1986); electrical
conductivity (Rhoades, 1982); soil texture (Gee and Bauder, 1986);
total nitrogen by Kjeldahl method (Bremner and Mulvaney, 1982) and
organic carbon by Walkley and Black wet oxidation method (Nelson
and Sommers, 1982). Available phosphorus was extracted by Bray and
Kurtz-1 method (Bray and Kurtz, 1945) for soils with pHwater less than
7 and Olsen method for soils with pHwater above 7 (Watanabe and
Olsen, 1965). Cation exchange capacity of the soil (CEC) and exchangeable bases were determined by saturating soil with neutral 1 M NH4OAc
(ammonium acetate) and the adsorbed NH+
4 were displaced using 1 M
KCl. The exchangeable bases (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+) were determined
by atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Thomas, 1982) while CEC
was
determined
by
Kjeldahl
distillation
method.
Diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (DTPA) method (Lindsay and
Norvel, 1978) was used to extract four micronutrients: iron, manganese,
copper and zinc.

The overall goal of this study was to develop a predictive soil map for
a portion of Kilombero Valley, Tanzania to serve as a basis for quantitative land evaluation for intensied rice production. Machine learning informed by legacy soil map, new eld data collection, and multiple
sources for environmental correlates were combined and used for mapping of numerically derived soil classes. In this paper we report comparisons of two machine learning algorithms and three sources of terrain
data.

2.2. Field data collection
FAO Guidelines for Soil Description (FAO, 2006) were used to describe and take samples from new 33 soil proles in the study area.
The number of soil proles exceeded the number of soil groups in the
legacy soil base map by 23 because it was necessary to describe and
sample on areas which appeared not to be well represented with the
legacy soil map. There has been some land cover/land use change
since the preparation of the legacy map in the late 1950s due to deforestation and draining of swampy areas for agriculture, grazing and settlements. Terrain data and eld observations were used to locate sites
for additional soil proles. The numbers of soil proles per legacy soil

2.4. Numerical classication
Numerical soil classication techniques have been suggested and
tested by many authors to generate horizon classes, soil classes, and to
dene taxonomic distance between the classes for existing soil classication systems in different studies (Carr and McBratney, 2005; Carr
and Jacobson, 2009; Rayner, 1966; McBratney et al., 2010; Muir et al.,
1970; Odgers et al., 2011a; Odgers et al., 2011b; Rizzo et al., 2014).

The numerical methods have a great potential for use in Africa where
soil information is still in great demand (Cook et al., 2008). Despite
their potential, these methods have not been commonly applied
(McBratney et al., 2010).
Numerical classication of morphological and lab data for soil horizons and proles was performed using a web based application 
OSACA (Jacobson and Carr, 2006).
In preparation for data input Munsell colour notations recorded in
the eld (hue, value and chroma) were converted to red, green, and
blue (RGB) numerical values (0255) using mColorConverter (He,
2013). The raw data were standardized using the equation:
V s  V o  =

1

where Vs is the standardized value of the attribute, Vo is its observed
value,  is sample mean and  is the sample standard deviation.
In the OSACA options, the Euclidean distance metric was chosen for
horizon clustering, while Pedological distance metric was chosen for
soil prole clustering.
2.5. Assembling environmental correlates
The following environmental correlates were used for SCORPAN
(McBratney et al., 2003) prediction of soil classes.
 S- soil classes derived from a 1959 legacy soil map of the area by Anderson (FAO, 1961).
 O- effects of living organisms (vegetation), derived from a 5 m resolution RapidEye satellite image.
 R- terrain parameters derived from three DEMs.
 N- spatial location was recorded for each attribute used in the prediction of soil classes.
Climate (C), lithology (P) and age (A) factors in the SCORPAN formulation were not used in this study.
ERDAS IMAGINE software was used to derive the following vegetation based parameters from the satellite image: land use/cover classes,
normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Gitelson et al., 1999),
optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) (Rondeaux et al.,
1996), and soil enhancement ratio (SER). Soil enhancement ratios are
calculated as band3/band2, band3/band7, and band5/band7. Since
RapidEye image has bands 15, it was only possible to calculate b3/b2.
The three available DEMs for the study area were:
i. 30 m spatial resolution ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal
Emission and Reection Radiometer)
ii. 1 arc sec (approximately 30 m) spatial resolution SRTM (Space

145

Shuttle Radar Topography Mission), and
iii. 12 m spatial resolution WorldDEM
The ASTER and SRTM DEMs are freely available on the internet. On
the other hand, WorldDEM is a new data, ofcially released in 2014,
and commercially available (Airbus Defence and Space, 2014). It is currently the nest spatial resolution terrain data available for the
Kilombero Valley.
The following terrain derivatives were calculated using Whitebox
Geospatial Analysis Tool 3.2 software (Lindsay, 2014): slope gradient,
plan, prole, tangential, and total curvature, relative stream power
index, sediment transport index, wetness index, deviation from mean
elevation, difference from mean elevation, topographic ruggedness
index, and ow accumulation grid. Terrain derivatives were generated
after lling depressions using the Planchon and Darboux (2001) algorithm. Aspect was not used due to the atness of the study area.

2.6. Mapping of soil classes
Machine learning was used to predict the soil taxa. Machine learning
is a type of articial intelligence that provides computers with the ability to automatically learn programs from multi-source data sets and
make predictions (Witten et al., 2011). The technique has been successfully used in DSM to predict soil properties and soil classes (Stum et al.,
2010; Brungard and Boettinger, 2012; Subburayalu and Slater, 2013;
Subburayalu et al., 2014; Brungard et al., 2015; Vgen et al., 2016).
In this study, machine learning was performed in WEKA (Waikato
Environment for Knowledge Analysis) (Witten et al., 2011). Three
data sets, each with different terrain data derived from one of the
three DEMs, were assembled for training and testing. Each dataset also
contained satellite based derivatives and legacy soil map units. To
come up with initial classiers, training sets were developed by
extracting environmental correlate information derived from the
datasets listed in Section 2.5 at the x, y locations of the 33 soil proles
in Whitebox GAT 3.2 (Lindsay, 2014). Test data sets were extracted
from raster centroids of 30 m spatial resolution pixels, where a total of
324,082 points were generated for the entire study area. The test
datasets were then used as training data to generate new classiers
which were used for actual prediction. Two decision tree algorithms:
J48 and RF were run with each training dataset to generate predictive
models. The models were subsequently applied to predict soil classes
across the study area and mapped using QGIS version 2.2 software
(QGIS Development Team, 2014) at a spatial resolution of 30 m. Percent
similarities between all combinations of DEMs and machine learning algorithms were computed by comparing the predicted soil classes at respective 30 m pixel of the predicted maps. Visual comparisons of the
outputs were also done.

3. Results and discussions
3.1. Numerical classication
The numerical classication generated 13 soil classes (clusters).
Classes grouped between one and ve soil proles. The legacy soil
map identied 10 soil classes in the study area. The increased number
of new soil classes identied in this study could be due to the techniques
used to derive the legacy map (e.g., air photo interpretation) and the
limited eld data collection (due to oods and restrictive vegetation at

the time) (FAO, 1961). It is also possible that some soil classes were
not identied in the legacy work but were discriminated in the numerical classication. In addition, signicant land use and land cover changes have occurred, which may also explain these discrepancies. For
example, the legacy map describes some areas as swamps, but current
eld observations conrmed these areas were converted to rice cultivation. In addition, deforestation also has taken place within the Valley.
The sampled pedons with the shortest taxonomic distance to the
modal pedon of each numerically synthesized soil class was classied
to the Soil Taxonomy Subgroup level (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). It was
generally observed that generated soil clusters were represented by different soils at Subgroup level, except for soil clusters S57 and S61 which
were both classied as Fluvaquentic Humaquepts (Table 1). This suggests that clustering process was able to distinguish different soil classes
in the study area.

3.2. Algorithm comparison
The J48 algorithm predicted 8 out of the possible 13 classes for all
three DEMs, 6 of which were common across all three (Table 2). J48 predicted mainly soil clusters which comprised of higher number of sampling points. Prediction of some soil classes varied depending on the
DEM source. Differences in quality between widely used and freely
available DEMs (Nikolakopoulos et al., 2006; Suwandana et al., 2012)
are signicant for mapping specic soil classes.
The RF learner predicted all 13 possible clusters. Unlike J48 which is
a single tree classier, RF is an ensemble (forest) of bagged classication
trees. The classication trees in RF are independent and the classication of samples does not depend upon previous trees in the ensemble
(Kuhn and Johnson, 2013). J48 predicted mainly soil clusters which
comprised of higher sampling points, while RF did not segregate.
In another study by Subburayalu and Slater (2013), RF outperformed
J48 in prediction of minor soil series, in southeastern Ohio, and the authors suggested that RF has potential for digital soil mapping.

3.3. Mapping soil classes
The maps demonstrate that legacy soil class was the dominant predictor variable. There is a strong correspondence between the legacy
soil map and the predicted soil map. Since most of the study area exhibits low slope gradient (15), it was expected that higher resolution
terrain data would be more effective in depicting relevant landscape differences in this environment, and thus terrain data would be stronger
predictors. However, the RF learner produced identical prediction
when used with SRTM (30 m spatial resolution) and WorldDEM
(12 m spatial resolution) terrain predictors (Fig. 2 and Table 3). Terrain
data with a spatial resolution ner than 12 m should also be tested with
RF algorithm, when available for the study area, in order to discern the
micro-topographical variation across the Valley.
Dissimilar outputs were obtained when SRTM and ASTER datasets
were used on both RF and J48 algorithms, despite both DEMs having approximately 30 m spatial resolution. This agrees with some studies suggesting differences in quality between these two widely used and freely
available DEMs in terms of vertical accuracy, and presence of artifacts
and noise (Doumit, 2013; Forkuor and Maathuis, 2012; Nikolakopoulos
et al., 2006; Suwandana et al., 2012).
4. Conclusion
This work used DSM methods to map numerically classied soil
clusters of a portion of Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. In this study, terrain
based predictors derived from 1 arc SRTM DEM results were similar to
that of 12 m WorldDEM despite differences in resolution. It was also
demonstrated that RF algorithm was less sensitive to the training set
sampling intensity compared to J48.
We suggest the use of RF algorithm and SRTM DEM combination for
soil class mapping for the remainder of the Kilombero Valley since RF
was less sensitive to sampling intensity than J48 and a signicantly
lower cost of the SRTM DEM. This will help to generate spatial soil information which will enable decision-makers and farmers to make informed decisions for intensication of rice production in the
Kilombero Valley. The RF and SRTM combination can be tested and applied in other areas which have relatively at terrain like the Kilombero
Valley.
