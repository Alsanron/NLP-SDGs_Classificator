Vector of hope, source of fear

BY ROBERTO BISSIO, SOCIAL WATCH

The 2030 Agenda is enthusiastic about the great potential for accelerating human progress brought by
information and communications technology and global interconnectedness. At the same time, however the
UN now acknowledges the dark side of innovation and the new challenges of cybersecurity threats, the
risks to jobs and privacy unleashed by artificial intelligence and the use of military related cyber operations
and cyber-attacks.
As with climate change, increasing inequalities or power concentration, those challenges cannot be solved
by countries acting in isolation and urgently require strengthened multilateralism.
At the same time, a major technological shift is necessary to implement the global transition - required by the
2030 Agenda - towards less resource-intensive and more resilient economic and social development models.
Most of that technology already exists, but new strategies are needed to generalize it at global level.
