Johns_Hopkins-Wetware:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::OptiYeast: optimizing production in yeast by ethanol regulation and optogenetic gain- and loss-of-function:::Our global community deserves access to healthcare and nutrition currently available to only the most fortunate among us. Thanks to synthetic biology applications exploiting the yeast chassis, valuable compounds such as anti-malarial drugs and specialty chemicals can now be produced inexpensively. Using Golden Gate assembly designed for BioBrick compatibility, we have developed two tools to improve yeast expression of non-native pathways. First, we engineered an ethanol control system that reduces yeast's endogenous stress response and diverts more cellular resources towards product synthesis. Second, we constructed a light-induced system for instantaneous gain- and loss-of-function at the protein level. These tools will allow engineers to optimize heterologous pathways by monitoring toxic intermediates or regulating flux in a controllable, time-dependent manner. We hope our ideas will shape the future of industrial cell-based manufacturing.:::2012
