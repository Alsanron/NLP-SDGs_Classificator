Calgary:::North America:::Canada:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Detect and Destroy: Engineering FRED and OSCAR:::Tailings ponds are concentrated pools of toxic and corrosive compounds resulting from oil and mining extraction. The Calgary iGEM team aims to alleviate this potential environmental and economic threat by developing a detection and bioremediation system for these toxins: FRED (Functional, Robust Electrochemical Detector) and OSCAR (Optimized System for Carboxylic Acid Remediation). FRED detects multiple compounds within one sample using an electrochemical output. We created an open-source hardware and software platform to be used as a biosensor prototype. For OSCAR, we designed and modeled a bioreactor to remove impurities (sulfur, nitrogen, and carboxylic acids) from tailings ponds. Known degradative microbial pathways were combined with unique engineering solutions in a bioreactor model. Furthermore, we developed ‘Ribo-kill-switches’ to prevent antibiotic resistance and disturbing natural flora. Overall, this system aims to detect and convert toxins into clean hydrocarbons in an economical, safe, and self-contained process.:::2012
