Leicester:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Synthetic Biology Solution To Polystyrene Degradation.:::Objective - Naturally occurring organisms using polystyrene as their sole source of carbon have been recently identified, by analysing the occurrence of polystyrene breakdown products. However these metabolites accumulate very slowly, explaining why polystyrene is so persistent in the environment. Polystyrene can currently be recycled, but due to the low density of the majority of polystyrene products it is economically unfavourable, due to the high energy demands. If inexpensive biological degradation can be achieved this would assist recycling, but we also hope to use products of this reaction to make useful organic chemicals. Aim - To construct BioBricks from the genes encoding enzymes involved in this pathway and manipulate their expression and properties to maximise the rate of polystyrene degradation. Hypothesis - genes encoding the enzymes of the polystyrene breakdown pathway can be isolated and expressed in a host microorganism and the rate of the process increased by genetic manipulation.:::2012
