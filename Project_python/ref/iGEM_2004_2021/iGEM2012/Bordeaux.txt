Bordeaux:::Europe:::France:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A bacterial eyespot:::This project aims at creating a regulatory system in the bacteria Escherichia coli. Our main goal is to engineer a single strain of bacteria able produce concentric patterns on the dishes. The challenge is to model a regulatory mechanism which mimics both cell differentiation and cell-to-cell communication observed in eukaryotes. We chose to create four operons (a total of 21 assemblies): three to allow the communication and expression of a visible phenotype, the fourth containing the genes needed for signal transduction. Each of the three first operons will respond to a specific quorum-sensing system (QSS) and trigger another QSS resulting in a chain reaction communicating a unique signal to all bacteria nearby. We also developed our model in silico to run simulation and test parameters that influence pattern propagation on a petri dish.:::2012
