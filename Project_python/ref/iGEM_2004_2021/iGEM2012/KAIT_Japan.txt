KAIT_Japan:::Asia:::Japan:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.coli which has ability to kill the cancer cell.::: We try to make E.coli which has ability to kill the cancer cell. Regulatory T cells move toward to cancer cells by which produced CCL22. Killer T cells and helper T cells are inactivated by reguratory T cells, so, the cancer cells elude from the immune system. We think to make use of this mecanism underhand. We will give E.coli three functions. First,we give E.coli the function to have the chemotaxis to cancer cells by recognision of CCL22 which is a chemokine produced from cancer cells. Second, we give E.coli the function that they combine with cancer cells. Cancer cells express the MICA on their cell membranes. NKG2D recepter from NK cells combine MICA. Third,We give E.coli function that they release the azurin to cancer cells. The azurin induced apoptosis in cancer cells by binding with p53. We would like to be help the treatment of cancer.:::2012
