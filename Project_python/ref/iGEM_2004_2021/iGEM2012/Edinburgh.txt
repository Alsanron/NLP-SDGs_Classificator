Edinburgh:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Tools that make synthetic biology easier and safer - questioning legacy and friendliness:::Edinburghâ€™s 2012 iGEM project focuses on developing tools that expand the range of synthetic biology applications. We are characterizing Citrobacter freundii as a chassis in order to investigate the potential of a new host organism as an alternative to Escherichia coli in synthetic biology. The team is also looking at novel selectable and counter-selectable markers as a substitute for antibiotic based systems which facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment. We seek to implement the MtrCAB electron transfer system from Shewanella oneidensis into E. coli, and test the resulting electron output from the organisms using microbial fuel cells. We are constructing computer models of the electron transfer chain and of cell survival with non-antibiotic markers. This tools-based project responds directly to legislation and safety. We considered how iGEM gives us the freedom to pursue blue-sky research and whether our work is driven by preconceptions of public opinion.:::2012
