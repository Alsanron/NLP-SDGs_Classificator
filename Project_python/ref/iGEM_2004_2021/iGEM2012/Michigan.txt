Michigan:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Utilizing FimE and HBif Recombinases to Tightly Control a Bi-directional and Inheritable Switch:::Recombinases can be used to create responsive, low background, boolean genetic circuits in biological systems. Further, it is theoretically possible to create complex control circuits using combinations of invertible DNA sequences. We utilized the recombinase HbiF to augment an existing system in Escherichia coli that relied on the recombinase FimE. A burst of induced, low level expression of one recombinase will invert the promoter flanked by the recombinase binding sites, triggering a switch from strong expression of one set of proteins to another set. Induced expression of the second recombinase will revert the promoter to its original orientation, triggering the original set of protein expression. The inversion will be sustained across cell divisions with little leaky protein expression and negligible performance degradation after repeated inversions. This is a heritable, binary memory system and can be used as a component in more complex systems.:::2012
