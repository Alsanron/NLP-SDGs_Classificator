SJTU-BioX-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Membrane Magic:::In this yearâ€™s project, we aim at constructing a set of protein systems on the E.coli cell membrane as carriers of enzymes of assorted reactions. Distinct from linear DNA or RNA scaffolds in the traditional sense, the membrane protein system expands the dimension of reaction space, making possible the framework of numerous complex reactions on the two-dimensional plane, for example, switchable or circular reactions. In such a device, the membrane replaces DNA or RNA scaffolds as an extensive surface for proteins to anchor without limitation of expression amount. More importantly, by gathering the downstream enzymes through signal regulation, the reaction can be accelerated sharply. Besides, products can be transported much more efficiently from the inside to the outside of the cell in that the enzymes are tied to the membrane proteins. Hence the membrane is where the magic happens.:::2012
