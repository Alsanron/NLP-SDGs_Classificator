CU-Boulder:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Inhibition of Quorum Sensing and Biofilm Degradation:::The CU-Boulder team aims to manage quorum-sensing and the resulting biofilm that contributes to food rot and general bacterial contamination. We improved the characterization of the pre-existing AHLase, Aiia. Aiia inhibits quorum sensing which is proven to reduce bacterial viability. Additionally, we developed a construct for treatment and submitted a new part to the registry, NucB, which is a nuclease that targets extracellular DNA necessary for biofilm. Future applications of this project include incorporation into plants to naturally prevent food rot as well as the possible development of a probiotic for human consumption to prevent the pathogenesis of bacteria whose toxicity is dependent on quorum sensing. In addition to this project, we isolated and submitted the 6 essential genes in the Lux brick (LuxA,B,C,D,E, and G) from its original source, Vibrio Fisheri, because many teams have been unsuccessful with the previously submitted Lux parts.:::2012
