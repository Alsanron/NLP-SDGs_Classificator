SYSU-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::An Asymmetric Cell Differentiation for maintaining a Stable and Efficient System::: In a specific system composed of two kinds of homologous cells, the cells with higher growth rate could gain the upper hand in numbers and then replace the slower ones. This process will cause the system unstable. But a stable and proper ratio of numbers of the two cells is essential for an efficient system like stem cells and the mature ones. So we are constructing a model of an asymmetric cell differentiation to maintain a stable system. We want to construct a system where the cells with higher growth rate could transform into the slower ones which has a different function. And with this process the system would become efficient and stable. We are constructing the part of regulation with toggle switch and Gene A, which is supposed to slow down the cycle of divisions when transfected successfully, to accomplish an automatic asymmetric cell differentiation.:::2012
