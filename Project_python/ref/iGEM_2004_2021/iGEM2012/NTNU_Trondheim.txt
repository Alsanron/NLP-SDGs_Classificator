NTNU_Trondheim:::Europe:::Norway:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacterial Anti Cancer Kamikaze:::One of the biggest problems with the cancer treatment used today is that normal chemotherapy is harming healthy cells in addition to cancer cells. Our approach for solving this problem has been to develop a genetic circuit that makes E.coli cells able to release toxic molecules only when in presence of cancer cells. As cancer cells grow faster than healthy cells, they also consume more oxygen and release more lactate than a healthy cell would do, so to make the E.coli cells recognize cancer cells we have made a system where the input signals are high lactate concentration and low oxygen concentration. When these criteria are met, the E.coli cells will undergo lysis, and release the toxin colicin, which our cells are producing constitutively. With our project, we want to show that one of the biggest challenges in medicine can be solved by synthetic biology.:::2012
