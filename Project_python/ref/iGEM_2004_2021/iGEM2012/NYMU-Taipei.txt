NYMU-Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Venus Marvel:::Nowadays, pollution spreads through the world and our environment is deteriorating day by day. Our project is mainly about the removal of several pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and carbon oxides, from exhaust air and waste water. We planned to cultivate a special strain of genetically engineered cyanobacteria. With reductases metabolizing nitrogen, sulfur and carbon oxides, our organisms reduce three major pollutants in the modern day. Furthermore, we also focus on the removal of cadmium ions from soil. We tried to engineer E.coli to gain better capability of collecting cadmium ions. In fact, our engineered E.coli could stay inside of Dictyostelium discoideum, which allows us to build a biosafety system to make sure our GMOs won't become another threat to the environment. Combining our engineered cyanobacteria and the concept of endosymbiosis, we grant eukaryotes, ultimately human being, the ability to colonize Venus and expand our territory.:::2012
