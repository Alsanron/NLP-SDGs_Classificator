Bielefeld-Germany:::Europe:::Germany:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::TOXIC COMPOUNDS IN NATURAL WATER - A CASE FOR LACCASE:::The accumulation of endocrine disruptors and toxic substances in wastewater has serious consequences for aquatic life and may lead to severe damages in humans. Especially the use of synthetic estrogen in birth control pills results in increasing the concentrations of this disruptor in wastewater. Therefore, "iGEM Team Bielefeld" is developing a biological filter using immobilized laccases, enzymes able to radicalize and break down a broad range of aromatic substances. For the production of laccases from different bacteria, fungi and plants, two expression systems are used: "Escherichia coli" and the yeast "Pichia pastoris". Immobilization is carried out either by using cpc-silica beads or by fusing the enzymes to cellulose binding domains. The concept could be extended to other toxic pollutants in drinking and wastewater, as well as to industrial applications in paper and textile industries or even for bioremediation of contaminated soil.:::2012
