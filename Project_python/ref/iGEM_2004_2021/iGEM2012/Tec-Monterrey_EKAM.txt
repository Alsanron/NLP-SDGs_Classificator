Tec-Monterrey_EKAM:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Implementation of a Fine-Tuned Modular Expression System in the P. pastoris Yeast:::Pichia pastoris, an alternative expression system for gene products requiring post-translational modification, is hereby utilized to construct an optimized system for producing terpenoids (aromatic hydrocarbons with advantageous biochemical activity: antimicrobial, antineoplastic, and other pharmaceutical properties). Truncating an enzyme previously shown to limit counterproductive metabolic regulation in terpenoid synthesis, together with a genetic construct design enabling the setup of a modular biofactory, potentially poses a foundation for applied interchangeable systems in synthetic biology. The need for reliable promoters for P. pastoris is addressed by characterizing four inducible promoters as standardized parts useful in controlling gene expression, with GFP as a reporter. The functionality of peroxisome-targeting signal PTS1 for use on the C-terminus of gene products is also analyzed. Difficulties in designing laboratory protocols and engineering genetic constructs are approached by developing a multi-purpose software tool to solve methodological obstacles, as well as facilitating implementation of a modular design on future projects.:::2012
