CD-SCU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The construction of engineering E.coli for eliminate hydrocarbone pollution:::The proccess of our work consists of three parts including the sensing system, emulsification system and the degradation system.the emulsification system invovles one gene ,oprf/omp ,which is found the prominent constituent for emulsification of oil.and the the sensing system is about alkane-sensitive. we use the Alks ,a kind of transcription factor which can bind to the alkane.when the binding complex is generated, the E.coli will turn on a subset of gene for degradating alkane.The last system is about degradation of alkane,which involves of two kinds of enzymes ,the P450 for degradation of medium chain alkane and alkb2 for short chain alkane.The purpose of this work is to achieve the function of degradating oil leaking in the sea and eliminate the pollution to the environment.:::2012
