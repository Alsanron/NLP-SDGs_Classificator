Uppsala_University:::Europe:::Sweden:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Combating antibiotic resistance - Resistance is futile!:::Serious infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria are a global healthcare problem. As the discovery of new antibiotics lags behind, we are developing new methods for targeting the resistance itself - making resistant bacteria sensitive to old antibiotics once again. Working with real-world resistance genes from multi-resistant bacteria isolated at hospitals, we are developing anti-resistance systems to strike at three different levels: DNA, transcriptional and translational level. At DNA level, we develop a method for increasing resistance plasmid loss rate. At transcriptional level, we use super-repressors to repress transcription of resistance genes and native defense mechanisms. At translational level, we develop a modular system for high-throughput screening of sRNAs to silence resistance genes. We also provide tools useful for the whole synbio community, such as new standard backbones and methods for scarless gene deletion. With this team on this project, there is no question about it: Resistance is futile!:::2012
