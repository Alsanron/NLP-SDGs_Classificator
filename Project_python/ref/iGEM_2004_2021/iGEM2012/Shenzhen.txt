Shenzhen:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::YAO #1.0 (Yeast Artifical Organell):::Project: Yeast Artifical Organell Synthetic biologists have been engineering genes and pathways in the cell to let it perform functions they desire. However, these man-made pathways incorporated in cytoplasm may suffer inferences from the original genes and pathways within the cell. Eukaryotic cells have organells that separate important pathways from that in the cytoplasm. Thus we want to make our own organells that perform the designed function. There has been some works on man-made organells, however this year the team of Shenzhen plan to create our man-made organell and apply it to organic synthesis by engineering yeast mitochondria, which we call Yeast Artificial Organell, and YAO for short.:::2012
