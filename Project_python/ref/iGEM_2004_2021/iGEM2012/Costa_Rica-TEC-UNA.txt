Costa_Rica-TEC-UNA:::Latin America:::Costa Rica:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cibus 3.0: A novel bacterial system for biodiesel production using whey as feedstock:::Cibus 3.0 takes biodiesel production to a new level. Our idea consists in the modification of two bacteria: Rhodococcus opacus and Escherichia coli, both maintained in whey based medium (which in our country is produced by hundreds of thousands tons per year). Overexpression of the natural TGA producing ability of R. opacus is achieved by inserting an optimized sequence of a DGA acyltransferase gene, constitutively expressed, and an inducible “suicide device” in order to extract them with ease. On the other hand, E. coli is transformed with an optimized sequence of a B. cepacia lipase which is secreted to the medium where we extract it continuously and encapsulate it. Now all what it takes to finish the job is adding our encapsulated enzymes to the extracted TGAs and mixing them with some ethanol to obtain our biodiesel!:::2012
