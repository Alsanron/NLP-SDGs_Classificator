Panama_INDICASAT:::Latin America:::Panama:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genetically Modified E. coli as an Alternative Biosensor of Cyanide and Cyanide Compounds:::Cyanide is considered an extremely harmful toxic for the environment and living organismâ€™s compound, since it inhibits the cellular respiration at the level of electron transport chain. In the industrial sector, cyanide is used to produce paper, paints, textiles, plastics and in the mining industry as a way to recover metals. In this project, we will incorporate genes that will allow the bacteria to become a biosensor with the capacity to detect the presence of cyanide and cyanide compounds by adding the expression of cyanide resistant genes (cioAB) and a reporter gene under the control of an inducible promoter. This new technique will also become a platform so that in the future we could incorporate a gene that allows the bacteria, not only detect, but also to degrade these compounds using a method that is accessible and environmentally friendly through bioremediation.:::2012
