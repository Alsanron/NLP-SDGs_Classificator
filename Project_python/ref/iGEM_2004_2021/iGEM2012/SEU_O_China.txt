SEU_O_China:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Breaking the symmetry:::Our team,SEU_Omega aims to execute a synthetic biology project based on colony of bacteria. An initial idea concerns the control of the pattern of colony, which would be in the shape of a pentagram.Light sensing would be used as a switch to manipulate the differentiation of cells and the qurum sensing system of AHL would govern the holistic pattern with antisense RNA effecting the division rate. Further cellur differentiation would automatically lead aggregating cells with separated division rates and similar phenotype into percific patterns. Available applications may include bacterial quantitive biosensor,logical gates,cellur automata and so on.:::2012
