St_Andrews:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mind-full of Resources: Alternative Omega-3 Production and Novel Metal Recovery Methods:::Omega-3 – known to prevent heart disease – is now causing governments to keep their finger on the pulse... of the fishing industry. Fish stocks are fast depleting and alternative sources of these essential fatty acids are urgently required. Our re-sourcing idea: the creation of an Omega-3 biosynthetic pathway in E. coli, using genes from a Cyanobacterium. Mass spectrometry analysis detected polyunsaturated fatty acids in cells expressing our desaturase enzymes; normal cells have none. Additionally, in seeking modern resource management solutions, specifically designed short peptide chains on the C-terminus of a GST fusion protein were expressed allowing the binding of precious and toxic metals. Such metals are often deposited in the environment. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy was used to demonstrate binding to our novel proteins. Finally, we modelled the impact our ‘Fatty Acid Factory’ could have on total fish biomass before investigating the effect the iGEM Competition has in Science and elsewhere.:::2012
