Clemson:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biphenyl degradation by pollutant targeting, biosurfactant production, and overexpression of catabolic enzymes:::Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are widespread, cancer-causing pollutants left-over mainly from manufacture of capacitors and electric motors. There are over 200 possible PCBs, derivatives of biphenyl, which share the same biodegradation pathways in bacteria. Our team is using a genetic engineering approach to produce a small consortium of E. coli that should efficiently degrade biphenyl, and it is hoped that this same system can be adapted for the bioremediation of PCBs. Natural bioremediation by native bacterial communities is exceedingly slow due to the recalcitrant nature of PCBs and their hydrophobic properties which reduce the bioavailability to potential catabolizers. We are taking a three-pronged approach in an attempt to increase the efficiency of biphenyl bioremediationâ€”attraction of biphenyl-degrading E. coli by other guiding bacteria, overexpression of the biphenyl catabolic enzymes, and production of a biosurfactant to increase the solubility of biphenyl. Together, this system should significantly increase the rate of biphenyl degradation.:::2012
