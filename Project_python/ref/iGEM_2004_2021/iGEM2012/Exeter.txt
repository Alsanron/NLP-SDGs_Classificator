Exeter:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::e-candi: Engineering the Fourth Polymer of Life:::Polysaccharides have a spectacular range of properties and uses, from the structural and medicinal, to foods and glues. These properties stem from the relationships between the chemical nature of the sugars, their arrangement within the polymer and the arrangement of the polymer itself. Scientists rely on chemical modification of polysaccharides or expensive and time-consuming production via synthetic chemistry to understand these relationships. This project, e-candi, asks if synthetic biology could generate designer polysaccharides. We created biobricks for the biosynthesis of useful polysaccharides in Escherichia coli and asked whether we could synthesise a novel polymer sequence in E. coli by targeting endogenous polysaccharide biosynthesis. We developed this work further through the generation of a GTase database with a user-friendly interface to aid polymer construction, and by investigating a GTase donor/acceptor characterization assay alongside mathematical modeling of our biosynthetic system in order to improve system understanding and performance.:::2012
