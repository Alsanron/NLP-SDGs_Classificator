OUC-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::oceanfilm and oceanfeel(a portable ratio sensor that can float)::: Our projects focus on warning and countermeasure against red tide. A precise sensor and an effective processor is coming to solve it. N/P is recognized as the key indicator and floatable E.coli is needed for survival. The second one was successfully solved by means of engineering our E.coli with a brand-new gvp gene clusters that possess far shorter length and better property for bacteria to float. Characterization and analysis of the gene cluster is underway. Phosphate and nitrate sensor have been finished respectively, together with three test devices which facilitate our quantitative analysis. More detailed measurements are underway. Once those sensors work as expected, N/P as input would better match our model. Fine-tuned comparators and ratio sensors with sRNA-mRNA interactions serve as the processor for decision-making. This model-driven part would take advantage of our fine-tuned N/P sensors and synthetical RNA interactions together to accurately alarm red tide.:::2012
