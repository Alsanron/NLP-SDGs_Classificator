Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Flower Fairy E.coli:::A flower fairy had been merely a creature of imagination until October 5 2012, but not more. Our Flower Fairy E.coli are capable of blooming flowers on demand by producing FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein, called Florigen, a kind of plant hormone composed of 175 amino acids. To make it possible for FT protein to access to plant cells directly from E.coli, we established a new protein translocation system, R-TAT. Our R-TAT system can carry proteins from the cytoplasm to plant cells while maintaining appropriate folding of target proteins.　We will show that FT protein induces expression of genes involved in anthesis and functions effectively at low doses by confirming that FT protein activates some key blooming-related genes such as AP1.　We will also provide iGEMers incredible promoters constructed through Golden Gate Assembly. Our Giant Controllable-Promoter, for example, is composed of 5x promoter regions following a Lac repressor element.:::2012
