Tec-Monterrey:::Latin America:::Mexico:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of a freeze resistant E.coli strain and an allergy detection kit produced by P.pastoris.:::The development of synthetic biology has eased the production of innovative materials, two scenarios have come to our attention: the medical/clinical field and the improvement of laboratory protocols. Our team, Tec-Monterrey, decided to develop two projects including a freeze resistant cloning Escherichia coli strain and the harnessing of bioproducts from Pichia pastoris followed by their assembly into a novel standardized allergy detection kit. The aim of our first project is to develop a new strain of E.coli capable of expressing an antifreeze protein from the Rhagium inquisitor (RiAFP), resulting in a cloning strain capable of sustaining its viability over the cryopreservation cycle. The goal of our second project is to develop an affordable, standardized allergy detection kit, integrating components that are both easily manufactured and purified. Moreover, the kitâ€™s components can be produced either in P. pastoris or E. coli thanks to the design of our engineered shuttle-expression sequence.:::2012
