HIT-Harbin:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Staphylococcus aureus Monitor:::Staphylococcus aureus infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality in community and hospital settings. Since bacterial sensors are attracting more and more biologists' attention owing to its' specific, fast and accurate detecting, we plan to construct a E.coli biofilm consisting of two different engineered populations, which are designed to detect and eradicate S.aureus, respectively. The two engineered populations communicate with each other by AHL signal transduction. We hope that compartmentalization of functions can lessen metabolism load and cross-reactions interfere, and achieve the assembly of different functions in bacterial level. The whole system comprises sensing, killing and biofilm formation devices. Detecting device: to detect the existence of S.aureus through sensing the AIPs secreted only from S.aureus. Killing device: to eradicate S.aureus through the production and release of lysostaphin. Biofilm formation device: to enhance biofilm formation by over-expression of yddV, a di-guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes GTP into c-di-GMP.:::2012
