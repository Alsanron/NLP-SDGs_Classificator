Grenoble:::Europe:::France:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::sEnsiColi: A tunable and reliable ultra-sensitive detector:::Multi-resistant bacteria are a worldwide issue which in a very near future will have huge impacts on our societies and ways diagnosis and prevention will be performed. In this optic, the Grenoble iGEM team has built an ultra-sensitive pathogen detector. It consists of three interconnected modules: 1- Detection, 2- Amplification/ Communication and 3- Output. The detection module consists of a recombinant membrane receptor that, once activated, actuates an amplification loop. The amplification system contains a genetic feed forward loop, which filters out false positive outputs. Once amplified and filtered, the signal is transmitted to neighboring bacteria via a diffusible molecule. In turn, the amplification loop is triggered which leads to the production of a measurable fluorescence output. The design of our network is easily adaptable to different input signals by using other receptor domains.:::2012
