TU_Darmstadt:::Europe:::Germany:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::From trash to cash: The PET.erminators are breaking new grounds in biological recycling:::Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has become the most widely manufactured synthetic polymer. With annual production exceeding 100 million tons (2010), it creates an issue of PET waste. In Western countries less than 70% of PET production is recovered by recycling. Biological processes play no role so far, only expensive chemical processes are applicable yet. PET waste left to erosion in the environment creates nanoparticles which tend to accumulate toxic substances. This poses a growing environmental threat and a serious health risk. Thus, developing new methods for PET degradation has become an urgent issue. Team TUD designed a bacterial recycling system that uses PET waste as a resource for synthesis of new chemical compounds. The proposed solution pursues PET decomposition into its monomers, transportation into E. coli and leading via terephthalic acid (TPA) to a high-value end product. The latterâ€™s specification is determined by the inserted enzymes to build new metabolic pathways.:::2012
