Cornell:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SAFE BET: The Shewanella Assay for Extended Biomonitoring of Environmental Toxins:::Cell-based biosensors have potential uses in environmental monitoring for toxins, medical diagnostics, and drug discovery. However, current methods for information output from whole cells (fluorescence, luminescence, pH) are very cumbersome to measure. To overcome this obstacle, the Cornell iGEM team has developed a new generation of biosensors capable of a direct current output which can be recorded easily with high precision. By upregulating the metal-reduction pathway of  Shewanella oneidensis in the presence of a target compound, these sensors can act as a continuos monitoring system. While our system is adaptable to sensing a wide range of analytes, we have focused on the detection of arsenic-containing compounds and naphthalene, which are common contaminants in oil sands tailings. Furthermore, we have integrated these organisms within a field-deployable device capable of wireless data transmission â€“ a fully autonomous electrochemical biosensor.:::2012
