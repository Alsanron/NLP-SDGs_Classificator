NYU_Gallatin:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Aseatobacter (not your mother's chair):::Aseatobacter (A-Seat-Obacter) began as a vision; a vision of fully formed seats and chairs emerging from giant vats of colorful bioengineered bacteria. Acetobacter xylinum naturally produces mats of cellulose that can be used for a variety of purposes. We wanted to create a broader spectrum of materials, so we altered the properties of the cellulose mats by engineering Acetobacter to express enzymes that synthesize N-acetyl glucosamine, a subunit of chitin. The result is a chitin-cellulose copolymer with unique properties. We have also engineered colors into the mats, and demonstrated their use in modern architectural design.:::2012
