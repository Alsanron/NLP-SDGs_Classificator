Warsaw:::Europe:::Poland:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::B. subtilis: supporting actor of the iGEM stage:::The iGEM community is far focused on Escherichia coli as the model organism, and a vast majority of available BioBricks is designed to work in this chassis. We would like to encourage working with another important bacteria, Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis, thus our project aims at obtaining new parts dedicated to this micro-organism. We also design a mammalian BioBrick that opens a new pathway into 'bricking' eucaryotic cells. Our idea is to construct a system enabling us to achieve expression of gene of choice inside a mammalian cell. This system consists of two parts: a shuttle vector, working both in B. subtilis and in eucaryotic cells, and an invasive strain of B. subtilis. Invasiveness would be achieved by expression of listeriolysin.:::2012
