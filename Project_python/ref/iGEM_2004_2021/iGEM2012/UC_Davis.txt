UC_Davis:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering Pathways for Polyethylene Terephthalate Degradation in E. coli:::Current plastic recycling practices successfully reduce the accumulation of non-degradable waste in the environment and landfills. However, they remain surprisingly expensive. Synthetic biology holds the potential to transform the recycling industry by altering the economics of waste processing. To this end, we are engineering a model organism, E. coli, to degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a common plastic found in soda bottles, carpets, clothing, food packaging, and even space blankets. We engineer and express a gene originally found in leaf-branch compost encoding a cutinase enzyme whose product degrades PET into two products: ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid. Through rational and directed evolution of the E. coli chassis, we also create strains that utilize the breakdown product ethylene glycol as their sole carbon source.:::2012
