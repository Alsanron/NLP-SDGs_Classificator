Ciencias-UNAM:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synthetic CO2 biosensor:::Our goal is to generate a bio-brick which indirectly detects atmospheric CO2 by noticing the compounds formed by the CO2 dissociation in water as result of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. This reaction is done almost instantly and it is used as a signal by distinct organisms like E.coli, C.albicans associated in the regulation of emergency signaling. Also, an association of the H+/HCO3- ratio and the signaling pathway of adenilate cyclase has been seen. The employment of these genes with reporter proteins can be used to indirectly calculate the concentration of environmental CO2. The CO2 concentration depends on the partial pressure and the speed with it is assimilated by the liquid. The fastest it gets to the saturation point 5%, the higher is the CO2 concentration.:::2012
