Toronto:::North America:::Canada:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Extracellular secretion of Aspergillus phytase and constitutive expression of Rhagium antifreeze: Genetically Engineering Super-Plants:::This year’s project is two-fold, and it involves engineering Arabidopsis thaliana with two constructs that would be important proof of concepts for further studies of feasibility in crops. The first construct would allow for extracellular secretion of Aspergillus phytase from Arabidopsis roots allowing the plants to utilize the accumulated forms of soil organic phosphorus (primarily, phytate), which otherwise would not be available to the plant. The second construct, building on Yale’s 2011 project, aims to increase the range of tolerance to low temperature stress in A.thaliana by incorporating a Rhagium inquisitor antifreeze protein and ensuring it is constitutively expressed in the plant.:::2012
