Ehime-Japan:::Asia:::Japan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.colingual!:::We are trying to realize three projects below. E.co-mail: We created a mailing system with E.coli and an optical fiber. E.co-Domino: E.co-Domino is domino toppling. We tried to make a timer and a firework by using it. E.colingual: "E.colingual" is a tool to know feelings of E.coli. Our goal is to make E.colingual. E.co-mail functions as a connection part and E.co-Domino is the screen of E.colingual. In addition, we also use quorum sensing system in order to construct E.colingual. Light sensor genes from cyanobacteria are used for E.co-mail and E.co-Domino.:::2012
