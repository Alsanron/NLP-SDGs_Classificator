Tokyo_Tech:::Asia:::Japan:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::"Romeo and Juliet" by E.coli cell-cell communication:::A love story contains several processes. Two people fall in love and their love burning wildly. However, no forever exists in the world, in most occasions, love will eventually burn to only a pile of ashes of the last remaining wind drift away. In our project, we have recreated the story of "Romeo & Juliet" by Shakespeare vividly by two kinds of Escherichia coli. We aim to generate a circuit involving regulatory mechanism of positive feedback rather than commonly-used negative feedback to control the fate of E.coli by signaling between two types of E.coli. Besides, Rose represents love. We will challenge to be the first iGEM group ever to synthesize PHA (a kind of bio-plastics) from glucose using the whole PHA gene sequence to represent rose.:::2012
