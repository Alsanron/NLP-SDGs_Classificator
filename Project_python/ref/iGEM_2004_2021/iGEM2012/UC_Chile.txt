UC_Chile:::Latin America:::Chile:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Luxilla: a light rechargeable and programmable biolamp:::Synchronization of biological processes in populations is essential to achieve strong measurable and functional traits. Circadian rhythms are one of nature's most exquisite mechanisms to regulate and synchronize biological processes over time. Our team has taken advantage of the fine time control offered by the circadian clock machinery to construct a genetic circuit that allows robust oscillatory behavior in a synchronized and predictable manner. We have coupled the expression of genes of a bioluminescent pathway to the endogenous circadian clock of Synechocystis PCC 6803. The benefits of using Synechocystis as our chassis for practical applications include minimal production costs due to its autotrophic growth capacity and precise synchronization to time-dependent events using environmental cues such as light. As a direct application we designed the first self-rechargeable programmable bio-lamp. Secondary projects include a novel secretion system, the first spider-silk biobrick and an optimization of the Gibson assembly reaction for small parts.:::2012
