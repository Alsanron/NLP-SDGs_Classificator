Tsinghua-A:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CPLD: a Cell-based Programmable Logic Device:::The ambitious Tsinghua-A iGEMers are still dedicated to a beautiful combination of biology and engineering, and this year, the realization of a programmable logic device (PLD) on the gene sequence has become the focus of our attention. A series of symmetric logic-toggle modules, or briefly speaking, AND-OR switching gates, are designed to act as the basic parts of this Cell PLD. The idea comes from PLD which is widely used in electronics engineering. Hopefully, the construction of these modules in the cell will be achieved, with the help of the site-specific recombination systems. Feedforward control theory is introduced into the module and mechanism on the behavior has long been under our analysis, all aiming at a better performance of the logic gate. Modeling as well as computer simulation will help to evaluate and thus improve the robustness in this process.:::2012
