SYSU-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BiArkit, A Versatile Toolkit For Synthetic Biology:::BiArkit is a versatile toolkit that integrates different modules together and helps researchers approach information on synthetic biology. The first function is Genome Browser, which visualizes the genomes of some model microorganisms, locates the genes on the genome and make it easy to study the genome. Secondly, Regulator Designer helps the design of regulatory elements, mainly non-coding RNA,in which we firstly develop Riboswitch Designer. Thirdly, we optimize the methods of scanning and output of the existing database of pathways. Fourthly, to analyze the dynamic change in various metabolic networks, we present a simulator that help the researchers analyze the network in silico, with the application of flux balance analysis (FBA). Further, to make it more convenient, the software is localized; that is to say, all functions mentioned above can be achieved without linkage to Internet.:::2012
