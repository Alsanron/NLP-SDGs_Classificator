Osaka:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bio-dosimeter::: It is still sharp in our memory that, on March 11, 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake struck off the coast of Eastern Japan and triggered a series of events that led to the nationwide nuclear crisis. Moved by that accident in iGEM 2011, we have built a synthetic biological dosimeter to detect the radiation. In this year we further develop that "Bio-dosimeter". Our "Bio-dosimeter" consists of two points: damage tolerance and radiation detection. To introduce the tolerance to E. coli, we are trying to put in some radiation resistance genes from Deinococcus radiodurans. For the detection of the radiation, we are trying to connect the native DNA damage response system of E. coli to production of pigment lycopene as a reporter. Now, we are attempting to assess its tolerance to various types of DNA damage and to evaluate DNA damage detection more clearly:::2012
