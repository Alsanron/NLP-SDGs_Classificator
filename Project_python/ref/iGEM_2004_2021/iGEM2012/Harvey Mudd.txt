Harvey Mudd:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Scalable, Orthogonal Buffer Amplifier:::In digital electronics, a buffer amplifier is used to filter noise, isolate parts of a circuit, and make low signals lower/high signals higher. The ability to make many orthogonal buffer amps is critical to scaling up digital information processing in vivo. For our project, we first provide two mathematical proofs: (1) the buffer amp is "equivalent" to a bistable circuit, in that the ability to create one implies the ability to create the other, and (2) inhibitors with first-order binding cannot allow bistability (without other elements). This means that methods such as TALORs and many sRNA strategies cannot build a buffer amp. Thus, we test a new method: sequence-specific formation of a DNA-DNA-RNA triple helix to block a promoter. By using a dimer for the RNA, we can achieve second-order binding, allowing us to build sequence-specific buffer amps.:::2012
