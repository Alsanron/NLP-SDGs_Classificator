Lyon-INSA:::Europe:::France:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biofilm Killer: long-term destruction of biofilms in an industrial context.:::Biofilms are responsible for billions of dollars in production losses and treatment costs in the industry every year. Biofilm-related problems are major concerns in the food industry where it can cause food spoilage or poisoning, in health industry because of pathogens' persistence and dispersal, or in the oil and water industry where it causes corrosion. Assuming that the environment is already over-saturated with harmful chemicals such as biocides, whose long term health effects remains to be elucidated, there is a great need for innovating solutions to reduce detrimental biofilm effects. To reduce the use of biocides, the INSA-Lyon iGEM team aims to engineer a bacterial "torpedo" capable to infiltrate and destroy biofilms formed on industrial equipments, pipes or reservoirs. Industrial surfaces will then be protected from further deleterious contamination by either a surfactant coating, or the establishment of a protective biofilm produced by the torpedo bacteria.:::2012
