USTC-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Reverse Engineering for Biological Regulatory Networks:::Traditional synthetic biological design creates or uses standardized parts such as BioBricks to build the genetic circuits, and uses mathematics to model the behavior. In this approach, biological design guides both experiments and mathematical modeling, but is it possible to use experimental data to reversely engineer the mathematical model and guide backwards the biological design? This project answers the question. We use reverse engineering techniques to get mathematical models such as ordinary differential equations(ODEs), directly from the experimental data and build the feasible designs according to the models. In this sense, we not only fully connect biology, experiments and mathematics, but also get feasible designs that have certain behaviors. To realize this idea, we build a suite of applications that provide researchers with efficient workflows.:::2012
