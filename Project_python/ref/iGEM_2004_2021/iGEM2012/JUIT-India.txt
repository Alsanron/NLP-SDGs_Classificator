JUIT-India:::Asia:::India:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Captain Green - Reducing the Greenhouse gas to increase the soil fertility in paddy fields.:::‘Global warming is too serious for the world any longer to ignore its danger or split into opposing factions on it”, quoted Tony Blair. Rice, which is the staple diet of India and many other countries around the world, is believed to engender many potential greenhouse gases or global warming gases per se like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide, is released due to the inevitable use of nitrogen fertilizers which are added in the paddy fields. We are dealing with the conversion of nitrous oxide into nitrate form using synthetic biology tools to insert two genes into a bacterial cassette along with its detection systems. This nitrate, can be utilized by the plant itself, solving our purpose and adding a new dimension to this diversion and in turn being beneficial for the farmers reducing the compromise factor that would, otherwise, have been done.:::2012
