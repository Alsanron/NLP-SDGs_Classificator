Tsinghua-D:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Designable Thermoswitch:::By creating the term ‘Designable thermoswitch”, we are trying to deliver an idea that metabolic controllers responded to given temperatures can be designed. Besides explanation and prediction, the ultimate goal of science is creation. Here, we create several regulatory RNAs as thermal metabolic controller. Pre-set a ‘switch-on’ temperature and a ‘switch-off’ temperature, in silico simulation will give the sequence of the regulatory RNA that meet the requirement. A step further, we apply our ‘Designable Thermoswitches’ to the field of fermentation industry. For a long time, engineers are trying to find a more economic and more automatic way to extract fermentation product inside the engineered microorganism. We align our ‘Designable Thermoswitches’ and gene of lysozyme together and put them into E.Coli to solve this problem. The reconstructed E.Coli will switch on the procedure of self-lysate at the given temperature. Thus, the fermentation product inside the engineered microorganism can be released.:::2012
