Duke:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A High-Throughput Optogenetic Toolkit for Rapid Screening of Genetic Therapeutic Targets:::Alzheimer’s and other hereditary conditions are caused by small mutations in key genes. Medical genetics focuses on screening and treatment of hereditary genetic disorders. However, current high throughput screening methods are time consuming and extremely limited by cell growth rate and rate of gene activation. In order to address these issues we’ve created an optogenetic tool kit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the CIB1/CRY2 optogenetic system. In this system, the CIB1-VP16AD and CRY2-Gal4BD fusion proteins dimerize in the presence of blue light leading to gene expression at the Gal1 promoter. Using flow cytometry we characterized four different fluorescent proteins for use in our tool kit using a galactose activation assay. After characterizing our network, also using flow cytometry, we developed several protein expression assays for medical genetics. Finally, in order to confirm network success in silico, we utilized the modeling software TinkerCell to generate a stochastic model of our optogenetic network.:::2012
