Minnesota:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Construction of organism-extrinsic synthetic pathways for the biosynthesis of beneficial natural compounds.:::Team Minnesota aims to change the paradigm regarding the synthesis of natural products. Rather than depending upon slow and expensive chemical synthesis, our team has developed two cohesive platforms utilizing the BioBrick strategy and synthetic biology to produce compounds for public health and nutrition using industrially-relevant microorganisms. First, we constructed and optimized designer pathways, using the BioBrick platform, for the production of a suite of sunscreen-like compounds that inhibit the effects of ultraviolet radiation, which we hope to incorporate into bacteria found on the skin microbiome for prolong ultraviolet protection. We also developed a novel and modular BioBrick backbone for expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For demonstration, we constructed a caffeine production pathway in this backbone, generating a yeast strain which produces caffeine. Both of these projects gain impact from their synergistic application of synthetic biology and bioengineering for products that apply to real-world situations for researchers and the general public.:::2012
