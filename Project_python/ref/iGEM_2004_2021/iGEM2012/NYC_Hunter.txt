NYC_Hunter:::North America:::United States:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Developing a bacterial XOR gate and hash function.:::Our team set out to construct a functional XOR gate in e.coli by building on and improving previous designs based on signalling systems. Our ultimate goal was to engineer a system of bacterial logic gates that could be used in combination for higher order computations like hash functions. We approached issues in promoter design and using bioinformatics and devised a plan for site mutagensis to modify promoter activity. We considered and worked with several promoters and considered different approaches to integrating together series of gate components.:::2012
