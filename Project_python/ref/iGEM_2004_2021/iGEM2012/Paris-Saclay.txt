Paris-Saclay:::Europe:::France:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::GEMOTE: a new tool to control gene expression by temperature:::We designed a system that allows controlling the expression of a gene or an operon over a specific temperature interval (between 32 and 42 degrees Celsius). This system consists of an RNA thermometer controlling the translation of a thermosensitive transcriptional repressor, which itself controls the expression of the targeted gene or operon. In our current construction, the crtEBI operon directing lycopene biosynthesis is used as a reporter, allowing us to check our system's performance. However, the possible applications of this system are extremely numerous. For example, controlling the expression of a toxin would allow creating a “suicidal bacterium” that would bring on its own death outside the specified temperature range. This will help preventing its spread in the environment. And this is just one example... The only limit is our imagination!:::2012
