KIT-Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Drosophila Melanogaster Workshop:::Drosophila melanogaster has been used for a genetic study as model organism for a long time and brought us much discovery. And we are sure that the benefit continues from now on. Therefore we KIT-Kyoto team aim at the production of the disease model Drosophila which expresses the responsible gene of MALT lymphoma that is one of leukemia. It is thought that we can contribute to elucidation of the mechanism of this disease and the development of the therapeutic drug by promoting this project. In addition, we think about what we can do in order to continue researches using Drosophila melanogaster in the world. So, this year we aim at the design of the parts with which a study that we use the Drosophila can expand in iGEM in future. If these projects are realized, the study using D. melanogaster will step forward to the new one step again.:::2012
