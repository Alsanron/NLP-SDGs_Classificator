NYC_Hunter_Software:::North America:::United States:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Modeling and buliding computational circuits from biological logic gates:::Our first goal was to make an abstract software model and kinetic reaction model of the bacterial XOR gate we designed on our wet lab team. We used python/pygame and BioNetGen software to approach these problems. We also wanted to demonstrate how biological logic gates could be assembled through hypothetical manufacturing processes into more complex computational circuits including hash function based algorithms. We wanted to model and help design various spatially arranged computational elements. Bacteria use signalling pathways ways that are highly dependent on spatial considerations and computational flexibility is likewise highly spatially dependent.:::2012
