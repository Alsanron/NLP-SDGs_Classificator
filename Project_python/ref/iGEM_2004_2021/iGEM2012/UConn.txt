UConn:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::VitaYeast - Transformation of S.cerevisiae for the production of Vitamin D3:::S. cerevisiae (yeast) is a commonly used organism in food preparation processes around the world. This fungi naturally produces Vitamin D2 - which is less potent in terms of biological benefit for humans than D3. In the past, Yeast has been modified to increase production of D2 but no attempt on converting it for D3 production has been made. Our team aims to insert the necessary genes to allow for simultaneous D2 and D3 synthesis when the modified Yeast is exposed to Ultraviolet light. If successful, this new strain of Yeast could provide an extremely cheap and efficient alternative to current Vitamin D supplementation.:::2012
