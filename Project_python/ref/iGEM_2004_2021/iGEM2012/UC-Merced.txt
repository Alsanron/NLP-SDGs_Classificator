UC-Merced:::North America:::United States:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. hydro Express: Streamlining Bacterial Production of Hydrogen Gas:::To exploit the fermentative capabilities of Escherichia coli to produce hydrogen gas, we performed P1 transduction on strain FMJ39 from JW1228-1 to produce the desired triple mutant with the necessary metabolic flux to hydrogen production. In the fermentation process E. coli converts glucose into various intermediate states to generate energy. The transduction of the adhE knockout found in JW1228-2 to FMJ39 will produce a triple mutant with the following genes deleted: ldhA, pflB, and adhE. From these deletions insertions of mhpF, pyruvate decarboxylase, and ferredoxin oxidoreductase will result in a more direct metabolic line towards hydrogen production.:::2012
