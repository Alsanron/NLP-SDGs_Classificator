Copenhagen:::Europe:::Denmark:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CyanoDelux:::Our overall objective is to create cyanobacteria that glow exclusively in darkness. To accomplish this, we will use a native promoter (lrtA) that normally functions as a light-regulated promoter in cyanobacteria. We will insert it into a plasmid together with the luxCDABE cassette. The cassette contains the luciferase enzyme and enzymes necessary for regeneration of its substrates. The final goal is to make cyanobacteria (Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7002) glow because cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis and therefore do not need supplied nutrients. First, the experiment is carried out in E. coli and afterwards the plasmid is transferred to the cyanobacteria. Both of the systems will subsequently be thoroughly analyzed to determine important characteristics of the system including kinetics and efficiency of the expression levels. To achieve this quantification we will collaborate with a fellow Physics student at University of Copenhagen.:::2012
