Fudan_D:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Telomere related construction of programmable time switch in yeast:::For this year's iGEM competition we create a programmable time switch in yeast(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) employing the counting mechanism of telomere. The time switch we made counts the replication number of a single yeast cell, and triggers the activation of a certain gene (death gene, for example) when the replication number of the cell reaches the pre-set level. The work is an attempt to use the special quality of telomere and the end of chromosomes in the construction of synthetic biology device. Our system utilizes a whole new mechanism that is seldom used in cell counting device, and it enables us to delay the expression of a certain gene for generations. By control the life span of a certain cell, it sheds new light on the biosafety concerns and can be used for fields such as the protection of intellectual property rights.:::2012
