WashU:::North America:::United States:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Production of Safranal, Picrocrocin, and Crocin in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Escherichia coli:::Saffron is highly valued as a spice that adds unmatched flavor, aroma, and color to food. A project was designed to synthesize three chemicals which compose a significant portion of the aroma and coloration of the spice saffron: safranal, picrocrocin, and crocin. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was chosen as the chassis because of its photosynthetic nature and native production of the substrate, zeaxanthin. It was proposed that the cloning of two genes ZCD and UGTCs2, would be sufficient to make the compounds in this organism. These two were cloned into E. coli in conjunction with the genes necessary to produce zeaxanthin. ZCD was successfully cloned into E. coli with the aid of a fusion protein to minimize the presence of inclusion bodies. This result was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS. With this groundwork laid, future work can produce a biosynthetic alternative to saffron.:::2012
