UTBC-RDCongo:::Europe:::Congo, The Democratic Republic Of The:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. coli as biodegradeur of organic waste (E. coli comme Biodegradeur des dechets organiques)::: In our work, we used the Streptomyces coelicolor, which is known for degrading organic waste, and eschirichia coli as biological materials. We searched the gene of s. coelicolor responsible for the degradation of organic waste and have inserted it in the e. coli so that it can express this activity. We have genetically transformed bacteria in biod√©gradeur organic waste. We have cloned the expression on biodegradation for the s. coelicolor to the e. coli.:::2012
