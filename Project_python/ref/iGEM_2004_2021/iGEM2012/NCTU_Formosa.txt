NCTU_Formosa:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::EcoFuel E.coLine:::Greenhouse Effect and the limitation of the fossil fuels have been a huge concern to people on Earth. Research shows that higher alcohols possess qualities making them more suitable as a biofuel than ethanol, including lower vapor pressure, lower hygroscopicity, and higher energy density. So our team (NCTU_Formosa) managed to produce isobutanol by E. coli. With the temperature control system, we can reduce the toxic intermediates of synthetic pathway to enhance isobutanol yield. Furthermore, we add 4 zinc fingers to the synthetic enzymes trying to increase the chance of protein interaction, making E. coli much as a production line to produce isobutanol more efficiently. This Ecofuel E.coLine gives an insight of yielding biomass energy, providing better biofuel and, in the long run lowering the burden of our Earth.:::2012
