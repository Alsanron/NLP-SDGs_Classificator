Johns_Hopkins-Software:::North America:::United States:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AutoGene:::Autogene is an innovative CAD tool used to automate the design process of synthetic DNA sequences. The first module, AutoPlasmid, leverages the power of cloud computing, sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms, and an expert curated feature database containing over 40,000 features to automatically annotate natural/synthetic DNA sequences, finding both perfect and imperfect matches. It also provides an effective solution to the Registry of Parts for annotation automation and pathogen sequence detection. The second module, AutoDesign, provides users with a drag-and-drop design environment to construct new sequences using user-imported features as well as those from our database. The third module AutoFab, which is still being developed, will provide users with guidelines of fabricating and optimizing their synthetic DNA. Compatible with other common bioinformatics tools such as ApE and capable of documenting in SBOL, genbank, and fasta formats, we hope that Autogene will allow synthetic biologists to take their research to the next level.:::2012
