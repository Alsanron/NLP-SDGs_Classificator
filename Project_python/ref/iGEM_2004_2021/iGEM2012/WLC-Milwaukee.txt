WLC-Milwaukee:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::iDifferentiate: The SAVE (Selection for Atrial and Ventricular cardiomyocytes through Engineering) Assay:::A clear understanding of stem cell differentiation pathways is important to advance regenerative medicine therapies using stem cells. An incomplete knowledge base of developmental mechanisms impedes stem cell research and innovation. The iDifferentiate system is a genetic engineering platform that may be used to elucidate differentiation pathways of any cell type for which there is a known lineage-specific cis-regulatory element. To demonstrate this system we developed the SAVE Assay, which uses visual cues to indicate the overall quantity and relative percentage of atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes amongst differentiated stem cells. The assay uses a dual plasmid system that selects for successfully transformed stem cells via neomycin and puromycin resistance along with fluorescent reporter genes regulated by atrial and ventricular promoters. Altering the basic protocol by using different reagents and induction factors will allow scientists to quickly and accurately determine differentiation pathways of two or more related cell types.:::2012
