UGA-Georgia:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genetically Modifying Methanococcus maripaludis into an Air Freshener Producer:::The methane-producing archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis was synthetically modified via expression of a gene to produce geraniol synthase (GS) from Ocimum basilicum. The GS gene was cloned on a methanococcal shuttle vector downstream of a strong promoter, and transformation of methanococci was confirmed via PCR. GS catalyzes the conversion of geranyl diphosphate, an intermediate in biosynthesis of the isoprenoid lipids of these archaea, to geraniol, the major aromatic compound in roses and a potential biofuel. Small amounts of geraniol biosynthesis were detected in cultures of the transformants by GC/MS. Methanogens are archaea that live in the guts of humans and animals and are responsible for the methane content of flatulence. Thus, this project could convert personal polluters into an air freshener. Because of the prevalence of flatulence among the aging population of the United States, the potential impact of this research is very high.:::2012
