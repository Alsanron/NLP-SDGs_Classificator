BYUProvo:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. colin: A Two-Circuit System for Early Colon Cancer Detection:::In the initial stages of colon cancer, malignant cells give off excess heat, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and lactate. Last year, the BYU iGEM team genetically engineered E. coli to detect heat or ROS. This year we developed E. coli capable of simultaneously sensing lactate, heat and ROS, implemented a novel Cre-Lox system, and constructed a library of thermosensors. Our project uses two circuits, each with a unique reporter. The first circuit contains a RNA thermosensor driven by a ROS-inducible promoter, allowing expression of Cre recombinase when both heat and ROS are present. Although heat is transient, Cre ensures continued expression of the first reporter gene. The second circuit contains a periplasmic lactate sensor coupled to a second reporter. Finally, we have evolved a library of thermosensors that work in a narrow physiological range. Together, this two-circuit system may allow accurate and specific detection of early colon cancer cells.:::2012
