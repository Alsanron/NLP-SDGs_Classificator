Yale:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) in Naturally Competent Bacteria: An Alternative to Cloning:::Traditional plasmid-based cloning methods are limited by tedious protocols that make targeted genetic changes within the cell. Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE), an alternative technique for rapidly generating genomic diversity using the recombination ability of the λ-phage ssDNA-binding protein β, has to date only been introduced in E. coli. These cells must be transformed via electroporation for each MAGE cycle to facilitate efficient uptake of mutagenic oligonucleotides, but this process kills a significant portion of otherwise viable cells. For our project, we designed and created a universal test cassette system to introduce MAGE to diverse bacteria as well as a library of β homologs for testing. Finally, we optimized the technique for the naturally competent organisms B. subtilis and A. baylyi to eliminate the costly electroporation step and developed computational algorithms to aid in the design and prediction of MAGE experiments.:::2012
