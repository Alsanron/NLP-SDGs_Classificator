Tsinghua:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Domino E.coli community:::The domino effect, a chain reaction that occurs when a small change causes similar changes nearby and leading to a set of changes in linear sequence, can be viewed as a form of information processing and signal amplification. In prokaryotes, information transmission through slow diffusion of chemical compounds is limited either in width or rate. In our project, we constructed a bio-film like Domino E.coli community, aimed at achieving an expansive and rapid biological signal processing system. Domino E.coli community, as its name suggests, is capable of amplifying a weak starting signal via geometrical progression, taking advantage of quorum sensing effect. Meanwhile, our system undergoes multi-signal integration, logical computation and transformation of chemical inputs to visual outputs, suggesting the approach of constructing multi-cellular biocomputing.:::2012
