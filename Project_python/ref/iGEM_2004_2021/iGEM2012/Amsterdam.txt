Amsterdam:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cellular Logbook - A methylation-based reporter system:::Multi-sensing genetic devices offer great future perspectives for biotechnology, environmental monitoring and medical diagnostics. In light of this we have created an innovative DNA-methylation based reporter system in E. coli, named Cellular Logbook, that has the potential of simultaneously reporting on significantly more signals than current fluorescence-based systems (eg. GFP). The Cellular Logbook can be used to detect and store the presence of any compound linked to a transcriptional regulator. This system allows for offline monitoring by functioning as a memory module. Assessment of the memory status is performed by digesting with restriction endonucleases followed by gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, the Cellular Logbook is able to infer the time of signal-onset or signal-intensity using the natural dilution of the registered signalâ€™s due to cell division. In short our exciting new memory module could potentially be utilized as a platform for many groundbreaking technologies.:::2012
