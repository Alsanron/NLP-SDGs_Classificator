Penn:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::pDAWN Of A New Era: Engineering Bacterial Therapeutics::: We are engineering E. coli bacteria which may enable highly targeted eradication of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing cancer cells. Upon binding to HER2 overexpressing cells, bacterial cytotoxicity can be triggered with spatial and temporal precision by illumination with blue light, which activates overexpression and secretion of Cytolysin A (ClyA) under the control of the pDawn transcriptional module. Furthermore, we are also investigating the feasibility of engineering bacterial biofilms that can act as antimicrobial surfaces. We are engineering E. coli bacteria to form non-pathogenic biofilms that express bacteriolytic proteins capable of inhibiting the formation of pathogenic biofilms that are potential sources of hospital acquired infections. These cells carry the a gene encoding lysostaphin (lss), which selectively destroys the cell walls of Streptococcus bacteria, a common pathogen in many hospital settings.:::2012
