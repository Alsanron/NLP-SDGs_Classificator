MIT:::North America:::United States:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RNA Strand Displacement for Sensing, Information Processing, and Actuation in Mammalian Cells:::The complexity of engineered genetic circuits in eukaryotic systems is limited by the availability of regulatory components and further hampered by the inability to assemble and deliver large DNA constructs. In contrast, in vitro synthetic DNA circuits utilizing strand displacement have demonstrated complex digital logic with reliable and scalable behaviors in a small base-pair footprint. The possible adaption of such circuits into cellular environments can amplify the scale and complexity of biological circuits, broadening synthetic biologyâ€™s application space. Our project leverages strand displacement to create a process technology that supports multi-input sensing, sophisticated information processing, and precisely-regulated actuation in mammalian cells. We construct RNA strand displacement circuits that detect endogenous mRNA, perform digital logic computation, and output desired proteins through programmable RNA interference pathways. We envision in-vivo RNA strand displacement as a new foundation for scaling up complexity in engineered biological systems, with applications in biosynthesis, biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics.:::2012
