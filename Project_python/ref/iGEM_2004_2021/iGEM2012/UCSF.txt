UCSF:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cell Mates: Engineering Metabolic Cooperation and Cellular Codependence:::One major goal of synthetic biology is to use common chassis (E. coli, yeast) for the production of drugs and useful natural products. This practice often requires placing large enzymatic pathways into one cell. Production of the desired product is usually affected by increased metabolic burden or negative feedback on the cell. In nature, however, many organisms work symbiotically to accomplish a task and/or provide mutual benefits to one another. For the first part of our project, we have studied two systems to create cellular codependence in E. coli - using either pairs of auxotrophs or toxin/antitoxins. In the second part of our project, we split a model metabolic pathway (violacein production) between two separate strains. Our goal is to create a tunable system to control population ratio of strains in co-culture in order to maximize the yield of a product.:::2012
