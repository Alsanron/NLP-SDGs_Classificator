We studied the rho-independent transcription terminators using both theoretical modeling and experiment method. We first developed a theoretical model. This model calculate the free energy of RNA folding and can predict the secondary structure of terminators. From the secondary structure, we proposed an algorithm that can calculate terminator efficiency. In the aspect of experiment, we construct 100 terminators. We measure the the terminator efficiency by measuring the GFP and RFP which are placed before and after terminators. The efficiency calculated from theoretical model fit quite well with experimental results. We also created a software and a web surver for people to calculate their terminators and also built a database of terminator efficiency which we believe to be the largest database of such kind. Our work is by far the most comprehensive study on terminator efficiency.:::2012
