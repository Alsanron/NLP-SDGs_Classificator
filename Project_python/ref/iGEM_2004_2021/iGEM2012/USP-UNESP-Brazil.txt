USP-UNESP-Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hackology - Hacking BioSystems:::Our group purpose is to discover and develop new ways of hacking and modifying biological systems. We developed two projects, which aims are to introduce new properties in a system and to gain control over the information processing. The first one hacks the way of transforming cells. It inserts and transcribes any protein inside E. coli, using only two steps: PCR and transformation. Using the Cre recombinase action and sequences flanked by loxP modified sites any open reading frame could be inserted and expressed in a plasmid ready to receive it inside the bacteria, called Plug&Play Machine. The second one is a way to build a bacteria network with memory capacity, which works as a Hopfield Network. This network could, by means of quorum sensing, recognize a given pattern (input), process the pattern and reach an output state. The output depends on two possibilities already imprinted in the memory.:::2012
