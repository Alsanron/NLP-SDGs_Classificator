VIT_Vellore:::Asia:::India:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Microbial Fuel Cell Using Consortium of Bacteria to Treat Wastewater and Generate Electricity:::A Microbial Fuel Cell was constructed which was used to treat sewage waste to produce electricity. The bacteria used for the degradation of the waste was Bacillus subtilis genetically modified to include the part BBa_J45014 which codes for banana smell. This was included to ensure a more pleasant smell during the working of the fuel cell and also provides an indicator for the battery life of the cell. Pseudomonas aeuroginosa was also used as a helper bacterium in the generation of electricity. The preliminary results indicated a production of banana odour by the bacteria. However, preliminary tests with the first MFC design did not result in a measurable electricity generation. Further tests with a different salt bridge composition and fuel cell design are underway to arrive at an efficient cell that produces a sizable electricity output that could be used to power small electrical devices.:::2012
