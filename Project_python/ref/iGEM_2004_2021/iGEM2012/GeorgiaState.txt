GeorgiaState:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Modification of Shuttle Vectors for the Expression of Recombinant Proteins Within Pichia and Plants:::The GSU iGEM Team strives to modify shuttle vectors for the expression of proteins in Pichia pastoris and within recombinant plants. Adapting the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (pGAP) shuttle vector to iGEM standards enables the expression of complex proteins in Pichia pastoris, due to post-translational modifications and a secretion system. We also plan to standardize the pPic9 shuttle vector for the same purposes. Our second project involves the use of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the causative agent of Crown-Gall disease in plants. The ability of this organism's Ti plasmid to insert foreign DNA into a plantâ€™s chromosome is used to manipulate plants to express desired traits. These small plasmids house a cloning site and a selectable marker between the left and right border of the TDNA. The aim of this project is to modify a binary vector system to be compatible with the iGEM standard for the expression of foreign proteins within plants.:::2012
