USC:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. musici: Facilitating communication between bacteria and researchers through song:::We have created a method of communication with Escherichia coli by engineering a system that causes a predictable response to a controlled environmental stimulus. Many strains of E.coli possess flagella which are controlled by a key group of genetic factors for assembly and chemotactic control. Regulation of these genes can be harnessed by creating combinations of promoters and individual components of the flagella apparatus. By promoting the synthesis of E.coli flagella genes and flagella activity under various conditions, such as salt concentration, nitrate concentration, pH and temperature, we can measure changes in flagella rotation and frequency. This frequency can be translated into an audible range, which indicates the bacteriaâ€™s distress and providing the researcher with a bacterial response to controlled growth conditions. Our system provides a new mechanism of bacterial communication with the researcher, through a spectrum of musical outputs. As such, we have named our system E. musici.:::2012
