Penn_State:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Questioning the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology:::The central dogma of molecular biology does not always accurately predict results acquired in the lab. A construct containing two adjacent start codons in different reading frames measures the E. coli DH10B ribosome’s proclivity for either one start codon or the other through a fluorescent protein reporter in each respective reading frame. Variations in RBS translation initiation rates and length between start codons provide additional data. Repeating sequences of non-degenerative threonine and alanine codons measure codon bias and determine E. coli DH10B’s ability to translate varying lengths of identical codons through the use of mCherry and GFP reporters. Promoters are tested for bidirectionality in protein translation by measuring the rate of forward expression through downstream GFP or reverse expression through upstream RFP. A ratio of fluorescence characterizes each tested promoter.:::2012
