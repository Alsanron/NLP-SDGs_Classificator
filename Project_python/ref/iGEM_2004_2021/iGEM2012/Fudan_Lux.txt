In project BIOWAVE, we want to create such a light driven feedback system including artificial light sensor and bioiluminescence. With the properties of feedback system and time-lapse of gene expression,colony could form a detectable wave like pattern in a macroscopic level. Project Nano-tubular Highways is about constructing a brand-new biological model using a recently discovered cellular structure termed Tunneling Nanotubes(TNT) and bacteria with green fluorescence protein. Studying the distribution of the bacteria which could transport through the TNT and its pattern format is helpful for the optimal model problem. Project LabCloud aims to provide a mobile app for iGEMers share their experiments, ideas, files and others in and between teams. It will also provide group's shared calendar, instruments management and other powerful functions to help iGEMersâ€™ cooperation. At last, it has the Push Notification to ensure communication in time.:::2012
