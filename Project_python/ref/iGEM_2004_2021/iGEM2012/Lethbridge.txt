Lethbridge:::North America:::Canada:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CAB Extraction: A Synthetic Biology Approach to Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery Lethbridge 2012 iGEM:::Increasing global oil demands require innovative technologies for the extraction of unconventional oil sources such as those found in Albertaâ€™s Carbonate Triangle. Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) has been utilized across the world to increase the productivity of these difficult resources. Using a synthetic biology approach, we have designed the CAB (CO2, acetic acid, biosurfactant) extraction method for a modified MEOR to extract carbonate oil deposits. CAB extraction will utilize natural carbon fixation machinery in the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus to convert CO2 into sugars to fuel acetic acid and biosurfactant production in Escherichia coli. Acetic acid and biosurfactant applied to carbonate rock will facilitate and enhance extraction. The use of carbon fixation to feed downstream systems can be tailored for many applications requiring inexpensive methods for fueling biological systems, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. CAB extraction provides an alternative, inexpensive, and environmentally sustainable MEOR method for carbonate oil deposits.:::2012
