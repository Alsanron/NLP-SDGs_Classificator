TU-Eindhoven:::Europe:::Netherlands:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SOMY – LCD, the Super Optimized Modified Yeast – Light-emitting Cell Display:::Eindhoven, the city famous for its light bulbs, is the place where the roots of Dutch television lie. The iGEM team of the Eindhoven University of Technology developed an innovative electro-biological equipment which will be the replacement of your old television screen in the future! They proudly present to you the SOMY – LCD, the Super Optimized Modified Yeast – Light-emitting Cell Display. It’s a multicolor display, in which genetically engineered yeast cells are electrically stimulated to induce a fluorescent light response and consequently function as pixels. Since calcium takes the leading part in this process, the yeast cells are engineered with fluorescent calcium sensors and extra voltage-gated calcium channels.:::2012
