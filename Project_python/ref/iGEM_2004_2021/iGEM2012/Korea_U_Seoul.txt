Korea_U_Seoul:::Asia:::United States:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Project 1 : Rice Guardian:::Bacterial leaf blight disease (BLB) is one of the preeminent vascular diseases inirrigated rice. Bacterial leaf blight in rice is caused by infection of bacteria known as X. oryzae pv. oryzae. Based on previous researches, it was proven that bacterial rax gene complex (rax A, B, C, P, Q, R, H) and their protein products(Ax21) are responsible for BLB. Since Ax 21 is a major pathogen that causes BLB and ever present molecule that signifies presence of X. oryzae pv. oryzae, we decided to make synthetic bacteria that detect Ax21 and furthermore, kill them. We will use rax R and H gene promoters to detect Ax21. As a result of transcription activation, gene will synthesize bacteriocin to kill X. oryzae species.:::2012
