IIT_Madras:::Asia:::India:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Novel Applications of a Chimeric Estrogen Receptor:::We aim to express codon-optimized ligand binding domain of Estrogen Receptor α in conjugation with the ToxR DNA binding domain from Vibrio cholerae in E. coli to separate stereoisomers that have profoundly different impacts on biological systems. Isolation and concentration of specific isomers is of immense biological importance to pharmaceutical industries. We plan to try and simplify this process by separating commercially important compounds using a biological system instead of traditional chemical methods which can be very resource intensive and time consuming. We also plan to develop a high-throughput system for screening of drugs which act on the Estrogen receptor using E. coli. Finally, we wish to provide an efficient means for the bioremediation of endocrine disruptors prevalent in the Indian subcontinent which have an adverse impact on the country’s population.:::2012
