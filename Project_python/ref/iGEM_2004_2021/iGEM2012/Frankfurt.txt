Frankfurt:::Europe:::Germany:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Steviomyces - ItÂ´s gonna be sweet:::The Stevia plant produces several sweeteners known as Steviolglycosides which have only recently been admitted as a food additive in the European Union. However it has been used as a traditional food ingredient by Paraguayan natives, for example to sweeten mate tea. The iGEM Team Frankfurt wants to transfer the pathway of the plant into baker yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to make stevia production much cheaper. Furthermore microbial production of these sweetening compounds could also lower the environmental costs of Sweetener production. In addition to these advantages, it would be possible to selectively produce only the most flavorful compounds. Several of known problems with carbohydrate sweeteners like diabetes or caries could be overcome by the Steviolglycosides which are produced by Stevia rebaudiana. Another interesting perspective is the capability of Steviolglycosides to reduce the blood sugar value.:::2012
