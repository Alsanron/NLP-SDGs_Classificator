Colombia:::Latin America:::Colombia:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Pest-busters:::We are developing a modular synthetic system that is able to recognize pathogen-associated molecules from either fungi or bacteria, aiming to speed up the activation of the plant immune system in an infection process. Three major parts comprise the system: A chitin-sensor system that is activated in the presence of Hemileia vastatrix (coffee rust) or, alternatively, a device that senses 3OH-PAME, a diffusible signal of Ralstonia solanacearum, cause of bacterial wilt. A second construct, the communication device, receives the input from the sensor device and starts the production of salicylic acid, a plant hormone that stimulates an hypersensitive response in the plant. The third part, toxin-antitoxin systems, will be either placed in the final plasmids or in the chromosome in different combinations, causing the cells to stay dormant most of the time without pathogen presence, and also ensuring no transfer of plasmids to other cells.:::2012
