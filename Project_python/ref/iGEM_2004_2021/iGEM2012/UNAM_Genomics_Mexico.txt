UNAM_Genomics_Mexico:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacillus booleanus:::Bacillus booleanus is a project that wants to create a “molecular computer”. How it works? We are working on the creation of different strains of Bacillus subtilis, each one will be able to perform a single Boolean operation just like a transistor. A single transistor is not a computer, they need to communicate with others to perform new logic operations, but how our bacterial transistors can communicate? In 2011, Ben-Yehuda et. al. identified a type of bacterial communication mediated by nanotubes that bridge neighboring cells, providing a network for exchange of cellular molecules within and between species. By using these nanotubes our bacterium will be capable to communicate with others so that create complex networks of logic gates. Using this it could be possible to develop a complex network of "transistors" to create, for example, a synthetic metabolic pathway.:::2012
