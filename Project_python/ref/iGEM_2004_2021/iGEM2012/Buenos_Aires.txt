Buenos_Aires:::Latin America:::Argentina:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synthetic ecology:::We aimed to create a stable community of microorganisms that could be used as a standard tool. Our system would allow the co-culture of several genetically engineered machines in tunable proportions. Hence the engineered organism would be a standard part! This defines a new level of modularity allowing the increase of the complexity of the system by moving to the community level. We´ve come up with several plausible circuits designs and in silico predictions and decided to build a “crossfeeding” system in which each strain produces and secretes an aminoacid the other strains need to grow. We characterized two auxotrophic yeast strains (for tryptophan and histidine) and designed novel biobricks that regulate the export of Trp and His rich peptides. In the future this would allow for other modules to control the proportions of each strain, thus allowing dynamic and stimulus dependent changes in the abundances of each strain.:::2012
