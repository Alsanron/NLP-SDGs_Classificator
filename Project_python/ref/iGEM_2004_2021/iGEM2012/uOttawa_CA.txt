uOttawa_CA:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Comprehensive Approach to Universal Network Design:::In order for synthetic biology to advance as a field it must be made simpler for large gene networks to be designed and built. The goal of the uOttawa team this year was to tackle this problem by characterizing parts and improving gene assembly by taking advantage of S. Cerevisiaeâ€™s ability to exist in both the haploid and diploid form. Inducible systems were used to externally manipulate gene expression and allowed for a fine-tuning of the designed networks. A shuttle vector was designed that will take advantage of the assembly abilities of yeast and the replicative abilities of bacteria. To expand the Biobrick registry we will be submitting new inducible activators, promoters and our shuttle vector.:::2012
