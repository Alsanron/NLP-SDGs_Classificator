Technion:::Europe:::Israel:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Trojan Phage:::Viruses can be described as complex 3D structures capable of efficient infection of their target organism. Because of their highly specific infection ability, they can be used as vessels for "smart" therapeutic strategies which rely on an agent that can effectively analyze the cellular environment and compute an appropriate response. To demonstrate the potential of a "smart" strategy, we are developing a "Trojan Horse" type of approach based on bactriophage-lambda. Our project uses phage lambda and its target organism, E.coli, as a proof of concept for creating a system with predefined actions that demonstrates the described strategy. The design is based on a high specificity system which combines several different cell elements that will function as a type of logic AND gate. The phage will not harm the bacteria unless three independent conditions are met, activating the phage's lytic cycle and resulting in the bacteria's death; imitating a "Trojan Horse".:::2012
