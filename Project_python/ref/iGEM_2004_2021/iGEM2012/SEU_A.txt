SEU_A:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::don't hide from me, bacteria:::Since people gradually rely on various antibiotics, people come across a big dilemma in drug resistance. Hence, we come up with two innovative ways which have great advantages over the traditional one. The first one, we try to take advantage of the bacteria's nature selection system. We construct a new plasmid which contains two types of genes, sweet and fatal for bacteria. Regularly, the sweet genes will be expressed, promoting the spread of bacteria transfer plasmid through conjugation. Once the amount of bacteria reaches a certain threshold, the dead gene will turn on, resulting in the death of the host bacteria. The second method derive from the idea of dog-eat-dog, we attempt to cultivate a Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus strain, which live in cracking other bacteria. We consider to improve the sterilization efficiency to a certain bacteria. All the two methods may avoid the probability of bacteria resistance at the same time.:::2012
