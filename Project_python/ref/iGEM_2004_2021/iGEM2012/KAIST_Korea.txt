KAIST_Korea:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CO2 Fixation Pathway and Pathway Switching Module:::1. CO2 Fixation Pathway Reductive acetyl-CoA pathway is a pathway for carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation in many anaerobes. Acetogenic use this pathway to synthesize acetic acid from carbon dioxide. Because the pathway is non-regenerative, reductive acetyl CoA pathway is a appropriate target pathway to consume atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Nowadays, full genome sequences of bunch of acetogens are available. Also, the enzymes consisting the pathway are elucidated allowing us to reconstruct the pathway in Escherichia coli. 2. Pathway Switching Module Throughout past iGEM competitions, many kinds of bio-modules were proposed and tested. In our project, we are suggesting dual-phase switching module using DNA recombination system that is new to iGEM part registry. With this module we will be able to control metabolic pathway we are targeting. Coupling of suggested module with cell growth, we expect to enable our cells to control their metabolisms according to cell growth.:::2012
