Caltech:::North America:::United States:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biofuels and BioFilms: Optimizing Biofuel Production and Animating Bacteria:::We aimed to develop a system capable of converting recalcitrant biopolymers into substrates for biofuel synthesis. From pond water, we isolated bacteria capable of metabolizing lignin and polystyrene. We attempted to identify the degradation genes and express them in Escherichia coli. In parallel, we worked to optimize ethanol production in E. coli by diverting electron flow from normal cell metabolism to alcohol fermentation. We also explored using Zymomonas mobilis, a more efficient ethanol producer, as an expression host for our biodegradation enzymes. We also aimed to improve the spatial and temporal control of bacterial behavior. We modified the coliroid system to produce a degradable output, allowing a bacterial image to change over time. With this animated coliroid, we worked to create an interface between digital animation and biology using a simple light projector.:::2012
