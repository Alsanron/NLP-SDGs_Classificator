HokkaidoU_Japan:::Asia:::Japan:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bio-capsule E. coli - E. coli bio-capsules that can accumulate bio-plastic in it-:::We designed two modules to make “Bio-capsule E. coli" that accumulates bio-plastic. First module is to form bio-capsule by aggregation, using cell-cell interactive protein “Ag43” located on the surface of E. coli. Aggregate of E. coli enables collecting them by simple filtration, so production of valuable materials will be more efficient. Second module is to produce bio-plastic (poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, P3HB). Development of cost-efficient method to manufacture biodegradable plastic is one of the most important issues for making sustainable future society. We optimized culture conditions for more efficient production of “Bio-capsule E. coli” and P3HB. This is the first successful production of bio-plastic as an iGEM team. We will try to extend the applicability of this system for producing other high-value macromolecules in the capsule. Also, we created new Bio-Communication tool, named "Biobrick Reviews and Issues" to share iGEMer's opinions about each biobrick.:::2012
