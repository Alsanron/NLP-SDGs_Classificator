Tuebingen:::Europe:::Germany:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Yeast based measurement system for endocrine disruptors in aquatic environments:::Lacking a genetically strict sex determination system, fish are very sensitive to hormonally active agents in water. The extensive use of fertilizers and the inability of sewage treatment plants to break down drug waste lead to increasingly high concentrations of so-called endocrine disruptors in rivers. As a result, male fish have been found to be less fertile and even develop female sex tissue, so called ovotesties. Since fish spawn is constantly exposed to river waters, fish development is easily disturbed, and while the ratio of female fish increases, population numbers decrease. For sensing we use a membrane-bound receptor of Danio rerio. Activation will lead to bioluminescence which can be read out by photometric measurement.:::2012
