EPF-Lausanne:::Europe:::Switzerland:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SWITCH: Direct, Light-induced Gene Expression for Optimal Drug Production in Mammalian Cells:::The fusion protein our team aims to characterize is a version of the LovTAP construct (submitted as a BioBrick by the 2009 EPFL iGEM team) adapted to mammalian gene regulation. It allows for tight regulation of conditional gene expression (started upon illumination with a blue light) through a photo-sensitive domain coupled to DNA-binding and activating domains. We are also developing and building a custom bioreactor setup to create the appropriate conditions for the LovTAP switch to work, and modeling the behavior of our system. Development of optogenetics has mainly been focused on bacteria but we are also comparing our project to another mammalian system, developed by Fussenegger et al. (Science Vol. 23, 2011), that uses a melanopsin switch to trigger endogenous calcium-driven promoters. Light-induced gene expression eliminates the need for activating molecules in sensitive applications such as the production of therapeutic proteins in the pharmaceutical industry.:::2012
