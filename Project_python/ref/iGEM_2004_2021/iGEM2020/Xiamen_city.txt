Xiamen_city:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Construct Probiotic E. coli that Cleans Reactive Oxygen Species in the Gut:::Sleep deprivation causes death by accumulating Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the gut. One way of preventing the accumulation is gut-targeted transgenic expression of antioxidant enzymes. Therefore, we use probiotics living in the gut to express Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) to eliminate the excess ROS. We first overexpressed SOD and CAT in E. coli separately and purified the overexpressed proteins. Both proteins were overexpressed successfully in E. coli and functioned properly. Furthermore, using plasmid p15A, we constructed the E. coli with in vitro display technology. This E. coli is effective for cleaning ROS, so our experiment lays the foundation for cleaning ROS in the human gut.:::2020
