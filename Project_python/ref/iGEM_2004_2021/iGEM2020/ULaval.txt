ULaval:::North America:::Canada:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::aSAP: a solution against maple polymers:::Maple syrup has a great cultural and economic importance for Canada. However, several issues can lower the quality of the final product. We engaged in conversations with experts to identify potential solutions to these problems, ultimately targeting ropy maple syrup. Ropy syrup has a very high viscosity, is not marketable, and damages maple syrup production equipment, which results in important economic losses, particularly for smaller producers. It is caused by the presence of dextrans produced by specific types of bacteria in the sap. aSAP, by team iGEM ULaval 2020-2021, will aim to develop an enzymatic treatment to degrade dextran and turn ropy maple syrup into a marketable product. Since maple syrup is stored at room temperatures, we are planning to use a dextranase from a psychrophile (cold-adapted) bacteria. In 2020, we have validated our candidate enzyme in silico, planned experiments to characterize and optimize it, and designed our implementation proposal.:::2020
