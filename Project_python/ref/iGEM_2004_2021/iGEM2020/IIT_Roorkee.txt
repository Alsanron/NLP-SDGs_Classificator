Our project provides a narrow spectrum treatment for the Multi-Drug Resistant Bacteria, A. baumannii, through the engineering of naturally found elements, namely, Bacteriophage and Pyocins. Pyocins, as produced by P. aeruginosa, provide single-hit killing kinetics. These are engineered to retarget their specificity by the fusion of a tail fiber of the AP22 Phage (specific to A. baumannii). We have conceptualised a modular system, that can be used to produce a portfolio of designers proteins against the bacterial species we wish to target. Our work also includes the development of a software which computationalizes the protein design process and are applying interesting Machine Learning algorithms to predict which genes are responsible for imparting resistance & susceptibility to strains of bacteria.:::2020
