XHD-ShanDong-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::DisHeat: increase heat adaptability of E. coli by changing the distance between genes:::Escherichia coli is one of the most widely-used bacteria in biological industry. However, its optimum growth temperature (37â„ƒ) needs to be carefully maintained to show the best activity. It will be more effective if E. coli can tolerate with a higher temperature. In this project, we tried to increase the heat adaptability of E. coli by changing the distance between a heat adaptation gene (degP) and its two regulator genes (cpxR and rpoE) belonging to a feed forward loop (FFL) network motif. Our new approach provides an alternative to the traditional methods such as enhancing promoter and plasmid transfection. This new engineered E. coli can not only improve reaction efficiency but also meet more requirements of special usage scenario (such as tropical regions). Meanwhile, we also investigated the relationship between distance and expression of genes in the network motif, which has foundational significance to synthetic biology.:::2020
