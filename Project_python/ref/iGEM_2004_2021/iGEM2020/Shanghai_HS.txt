Shanghai_HS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Combining PhoA and eGFP to Create a Biosensor that Detects Phosphate Concentration Rapidly:::Phosphorus pollution is the leak of phosphorus compound into water, which causes serious problems to peopleâ€™s health. Complicated technologies have already been invented to test the purity of water, however, those procedures always cause huge amount of money and energy. We found that a certain gene activity in E.coli will be inhibited with the presence of phosphorus. As a result, combing with a fluorescent protein, the gene will show its reaction when encountering certain concentration of phosphorus. Using this strategy we will be able to conduct pre-test of water pollution before investing much money and energy on processing unpolluted water. And through editing the gene, we will be able to detect water sources' phosphorus concentration that will harm human health by an easy and inexpensive method. We expect our experiment to become the starting point of detecting water pollution through biological method.:::2020
