CCA_San_Diego:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Acefate: Degradation of the Pesticide Acephate Using Genetic Modification:::The bio-degradation of the insecticide acephate using genetically modified Escherichia coli is studied in this project. Acephate exposure causes severe environmental and human side effects as well as paralysis or death. In this study, we enriched samples of acephate-treated soil for 5 weeks to propagate the growth of acephate-degrading bacteria. 10g from each sample was diluted 10-fold. DNA was subsequently extracted from bacterial colonies using the genomic etNA extraction and the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Degradation was monitored with HPLC and LC-MS. Certain genes, such as OPD, were isolated and analyzed using bioinformatics tools including CDD. Amplified genes were inserted into base plasmid pMMB206 using restriction digest protocol into E. coli K12. BetI, a transcription factor-based kill-switch, was added to the plasmid. While experiments could not be performed, MATLAB modeling and literature indicate the approach provides an effective pathway, with >99% degradation of acephate and all harmful intermediates.:::2020
