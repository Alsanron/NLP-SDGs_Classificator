Hybrid:::Large scale biosynthesis in producing valuable molecules and proteins come into its embryonic stage for more sustainable and renewable ways of manufacturing and simultaneously faces multiple challenges in bioengineering. Incorporation of light-driven proton pump into non-phototrophic bacteria to produce additional proton motive force has gained interest in recent years as several bacterial rhodopsins are utilized for generating larger amounts of adenosine-5â€™-triphosphate(ATP) for alleviating the metabolic stress caused by excessive reliance on glucose and supporting bioengineering reactions. We expressed functional Gloeobacter rhodopsin from ancient bacteria, Gloeobacter violaceus, on E. coli Lemo-21 and evaluated its growth and metabolic reactions and found it potent in creating alternative proton motive force for oxidative phosphorylation and eventually proved it to be ideal for improving protein and molecule yields. Gloeobacter rhodopsin-based E. coli serves as a fundamental strain that uses light as energy sources, thus paving promising avenues for biosynthesis and creative daily usages.:::2020
