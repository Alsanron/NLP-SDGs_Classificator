UUlm:::Europe:::Germany:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biodegradation of Polystyrene on the Basis of Genetically Modified Intestinal Bacteria of Tenebrio molitor larvae:::Polystyrene is one of the most abundant plastics on earth and often ends up in large quantities in our environment. Sustainability is our central credo and we present a new approach of biodegrading polystyrene with the help of genetically modified bacteria introduced into the intestines of mealworms (Tenebrio molitor larvae). Previously, it has been shown that these larvae can use polystyrene foam as sole carbon source, thus it is a biodegradable substance. We designed a recombinant Escherichia coli strain capable of converting acetyl-CoA to acetone. The genetic modifications intend to integrate a plasmid carrying several genes of the ABE fermentation. We want to have acetone produced by bacteria in the intestines of the larvae. Here, it is supposed to help breaking down the plastic, because acetone can dissolve polystyrene. Acetone intercalates in between the polymer chains and increases the surface area that can be attacked by the bacteria.:::2020
