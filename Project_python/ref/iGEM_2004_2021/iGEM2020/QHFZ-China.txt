QHFZ-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Super-Serum for Engineered Bacteria:::Various engineered bacteria showed useful functions. However, the storage of these bacteria usually requires -80â„ƒ refrigerators, which substantially limited their transportation and usages in daily life. Therefore, we decided to utilize TDPs from tardigrades (water bears) to supply a new storage method. By introducing the TDPs as the protectants into bacteria during lyophilization (freeze-drying), we could produce dry powder that can be stored at room temperature without any equipment. The powder can be stored at room temperature for a long time, without any usage of professional equipment. This year, we confirmed that certain TDPs have the ability to maintain the survival rate of E. coli. We also optimized the method by regulating the expression level and combining different TDPs. In addition, we proved the modularity and studied the degradation of TDPs after freeze-drying. We hope the method would promote the practical application of engineered bacteria.:::2020
