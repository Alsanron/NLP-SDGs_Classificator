Exeter:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CalcifEXE: A Bacterial Method of Calcium Carbonate Precipitation:::Traditional calcium carbonate production methods emit large amounts of carbon dioxide as well as many toxic compounds due to the reliance on fossil fuels in the manufacturing process. Our team is developing a novel precipitation method using bacteria engineered with enzymes capable of producing the carbonate ions required for precipitation of calcium carbonate. One enzyme we are focusing on is carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme that facilitates the interconversion of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate in solution. CA should not only increase carbonate production, but also allow for atmospheric carbon dioxide to be used as the feedstock for the carbonate ions. Our method has the potential capability to be employed with a 3D-bioprinter that will print structures comprising a hydrogel and our engineered bacteria. On precipitation the calcium carbonate should take the shape of the hydrogel structure. One potential application, is the production of coral backbones used to facilitate coral regrowth.:::2020
