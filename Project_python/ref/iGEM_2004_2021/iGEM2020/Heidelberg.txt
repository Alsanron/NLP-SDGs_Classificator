Heidelberg:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Legend of Cellda â€“ A Link Between Proteins:::DNA, RNA and proteins are the fundamental building blocks of synthetic biology and life itself. Of them all, fusion proteins, which are often too large and inflexible, take the spotlight, allowing for a modular approach to protein engineering. To mediate interactions between all three core components of life more flexible we aim to harness the power and flexibility of RNAs We apply machine learning to design flexible RNA modules and binding proteins for assembling complexes of protein domains, RNA and DNA in a sequence-specific manner. In addition, we engineer trans-splicing ribozymes to reconfigure our RNAs and proteins at the transcript level. Also, we apply molecular modelling to provide tools to design specific RNA-binding proteins. Taken together, we provide a controllable, compact, and dynamical alternative to fusion proteins with applications to drug delivery and expand the toolbox of synthetic biology.:::2020
