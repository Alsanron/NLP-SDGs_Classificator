However, the water is polluted: pesticides, hormones and antibiotics are present and might have a negative effect on the environment and human health. Our goal is to develop a solution to purify water. Using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a chassis, we designed a microalgae filter capable of retaining and degrading these harmful compounds. We focused our efforts on Atrazine, a banned herbicide but still detectable in the Seine. We expressed four enzymes from the bacteria genera Pseudomonas in C. reinhardtii using the Golden Gate Modular Cloning (MoClo). This newly added degradation pathway aims at degrading Atrazine into a less hazardous product. To ensure additional safety, we integrated a "kill switch" device based on UV-sensitive nuclease genetic circuit leading to the death of microalgae which could escape in the wild.:::2020
