ShanghaiTech_China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CESAR (Cas12a-based Efficient Solution to Antibiotic Resistance):::This year, ShanghaiTech_China developed an enhanced method of detecting antibiotics and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs), first applying Cas12a to this field. Antibiotic-resistance has become a global health concern. The antibiotic-abuse in clinical therapies and industries has led to antibioticsâ€™ leakage and unexpected rapid spreading of ARGs, causing the emergence of drug-resistant microbes. In order to solve this problem, ShanghaiTech_China designed a new detection system -- CESAR (Cas12a-based Efficient Solution to Antibiotic-Resistance), to identify antibiotic-residue and ARGs. CESAR contains two devices with different purposes: (1) CESAR-I is a portable rapid-response device for on-site antibiotic-residue detection. By integrating the aptamer-sensing module, Cas12a-reporting module, and fluorescence-measuring module, it simplifies the process and lowers the cost of antibiotic-abuse surveillance. (2) CESAR-II is designed for doctors' detecting ARGs. Current techniques are either time-consuming or too expensive for hospitals in less-developed regions. CESAR-II is cost-effective and can help eliminate the medical disparity caused by unbalanced economic development.:::2020
