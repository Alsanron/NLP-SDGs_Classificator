In response the sea seems to be fighting back through coastal erosion, which is threatening human settlements across the globe. This project aims to design a living sea defense system (bio-concrete tetrapods) by incorporating organisms capable of carrying out plastics and bio-cementation bioremediation. Several plasmids will be design to breakdown the plastic and carry out the bio-cementation process, and some plasmids will have the genes under a constitutive promoter; others would have it under a pH-responsive promoter to maintain the optimal pH for the ecosystem while others would be under a light-inducible promoter, which will be activated in the presence of increased light due to occurring cracks in the tetrapod. We are aiming to identify the conditions necessary to initiate the ecosystem and for making it self-balancing.:::2020
