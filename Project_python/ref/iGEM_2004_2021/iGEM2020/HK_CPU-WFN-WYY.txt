HK_CPU-WFN-WYY:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Cutinases - the Terminators of Microplastics:::Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the most common thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family. Our team is searching for one or more suitable cutinases to degrade PET from plastic packages. We found that cutinases can convert lcPET to terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Therefore, we aim at reducing the harm of PET to the environment by using cutinases with a lower cost safely. First, we will determine the optimum working conditions of cutinases. Different kind of cutinases will be compared on their ability, efficiency, and optimum condition of degradation. Furthermore, those cutinases will be chosen and we will focus on the degradation rate of PET. We will consider not only the efficiency but the safety of using cutinases to degrade PET. Hence, we are here to try our utmost to solve plastic pollution through Synthetic Biology to digest plastic.:::2020
