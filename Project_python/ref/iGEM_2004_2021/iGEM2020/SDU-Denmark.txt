SDU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PROSTATUS:::The current procedures to test for prostate cancer (PCa) in Denmark are all either based on invasive tests or based on the presence of the prostate specific antigen (PSA). The doctors must take a small biopsy of the patientâ€™s prostate or let the patient undergo a digital rectal exam. Our team decided to develop a risk assessment for prostate cancer, that makes use of the CRISPR-Cas13a system. We focused on three mRNA biomarkers found to be present in the urine of PCa patients, specifically TMPRSS2:ERG, AMACR and PCA3. We also conducted interviews with end-users and initiated an email correspondence with experts from different fields to discuss and gain insight on how to improve our project. Apart from this, we designed a set of playing cards and a card game that takes early detection as a theme and was distributed to different social areas to spread PCa awareness.:::2020
