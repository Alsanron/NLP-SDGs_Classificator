However, more common synthetic dyes may damage the hair cortex and cause allergies. Despite increasing attention to natural dyes, its production is limited and products are expensive. We propose using engineered bacteria to mass-produce natural, harmless hair dyes. We successfully synthesized melanin, indigo, dopaxanthin, and indoline-betacyanin and dyed hair into black, blue, and red. We used Vibrio natriegens to increase the rate of production. V. natriegens could produce melanin faster than E. coli. Furthermore, considering that synthetic dyes are composed of oxidants and pigment precursors, we envisage combining oxidases and pigment precursors to dye hair. We have expressed bacterial laccase and tested its activity. Next, we will try to optimize dyeing protocols and discuss the safety aspects of potential products. If successful, our products could bring dramatic changes to the market and introduce substantial social benefits.:::2020
