SJTU-BioX-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::LUCAS: Locational Unique Cas9:::The off-target problem of CRISPR technology is the most troublesome factor for its in vivo operations. Regarding this, our project conducted optimization methods to obtain a CRISPR-Cas9 system for specific target with high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we adopted directed evolution and rational design methods. We proposed a pipeline integrating machine learning and Markov process in off-target prediction. Meanwhile, molecular dynamics and graph theory were also applied to guide and interpret directed evolution and rational design. In experiment, the transcriptional activation and inhibition circuits were built to reflect the on/off-target rate, serving as indicators for screening and reporting process. Finally, we hope that our method can be a guidance for further application.:::2020
