Evry_Paris-Saclay:::Europe:::France:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Rosewood:::Illegal wildlife trade is a scourge that affects biodiversity, destroys the fragile equilibrium of natural ecosystems, leads to accelerated extinction of species, and adversely impacts humankind. Elephant’s ivory, rhinoceros’ horn, tiger’s fur are all well-known examples, but the most trafficked wildlife product in the world is Rosewood. To the naked eye, Rosewood logs are indistinguishable from other non-protected wood species. However, it can be distinguished at the genetic level with high precision. Here, we are developing cheap, portable and easy-to-use biosensors, based on toehold switches. Our biosensor uses engineered molecular machinery of the common gut bacterium to sense nucleic acid signatures specific to the Rosewood tree. We demonstrate how to go from the design to the final application, identifying the trafficked Rosewood to the family, phylum, or the species level. Deployment of portable and cost-effective rosewood biosensors will enable on-site surveillance and help to protect this rare and valuable species.:::2020
