WHU-China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Negotiator:::We aimed at rationally engineering probiotics to address the problem of nosocomial infections in respiratory tract, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) during COVID-19 pandemic. The chassis of our project was Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, recognized as the most amenable probiotic, and the target pathogen was Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a representative nosocomial pathogen notorious for its quorum sensing-based virulence behaviours. We constructed two modules to endow our chassis with the capability as "the negotiator": (i) Quenching Module: heterologously overexpressing quorum quenching enzymes to parley with "criminals" (P. aeruginosa) by degrading AHLs; and (ii) Sensing Module: sensing PQS and excreting appropriate amounts of chemokines to recruit "police squads" (immune cells) for eradicating pathogens. Notably, we leveraged E. coli lysate-based cell-free system for rapidly prototyping genetic parts of interest, in order to accelerate the design-build-test-learn cycle of our project as well as to give insights into the elegance of cell-free expression renaissance.:::2020
