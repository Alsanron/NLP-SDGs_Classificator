Shanghai_city:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::AtreXtinct: To Find Efficient way of Detecting Herbicide Pollution Caused by Atrazine in the Environment:::Atrazine is a contaminant for natural resources, which is dangerous for both people and wildlife. To be specific, atrazine can lead to serious diseases like prostatic cancer and breast cancer. However, owing mainly to the superior efficacy and economy of atrazine, the current policy in most countries is to strengthen registration instead of explicitly restrict the use of it. Furthermore, all the atrazine detection equipment in the market today have major flaws - expensiveness, heaviness, and difficulties in application. Thus, atrazine will leak into farms, lakes, and ocean without an effective and economical solution. To solve this problem, our team aims to envision a sytstem that degrades convert atrazine into cyanuric acid, which can be detected by human eyes under the condition of the excitation spectrum. In this way, it will be possible for us to create a convenient way to detect atrazine.:::2020
