ZJU-China:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MagHER2some:::Breast cancer is the main malignant tumor that threatens women's health. In an effort to overcome the unspecificity and side effect of the current contrast agent used for MRI, we reconstructure the magnetosomes from magnetotactic bacteria Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense to produce a contrast agent with high biocompatibility that specifically targets HER2 positive breast cancer cells. With biological modifications, magnetosomes can link with anti-HER2 antibodies. By antigen-antibody interaction, engineering magnetosomes can conjugated with HER2 positive breast cancer cells, demonstrating a special pattern on the image under magnetic field. Armed with our engineered contrast agent MagHER2some, the efficiency of evaluating the response of the treatment of HER2-postive breast cancer treatment can be optimized, thus assisting the progress of therapy process. Further application can be made through establishment of a platform with biomarkers targeting various diseases as inputs, paving avenue for precise evaluation of other diseases.:::2020
