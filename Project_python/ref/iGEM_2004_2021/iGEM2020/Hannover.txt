Hannover:::Europe:::Germany:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::InToSens â€“ Development of an Inflammatory Toxin Sensor for detecting implant associated inflammations:::The placement of implants is one of the most frequently performed operations in hospitals all over the world, still increasing in number. Unfortunately, the risk to develop an implant-associated inflammation after such surgeries is very high. The origin of an implant-associated inflammation is often biofilms, which attach to the implant surface. Targeted treatment of such bacterial biofilms is challenging. A typical therapeutic approach with antibiotics often fails. In the worst case, a generous removal of the region is mandatory. Therefore, it would be helpful to detect the formation of a biofilm at an early stage, increasing the probability of successful treatment. Our project aims to develop a sensor that makes this possible. The sensor is realized by genetically-engineered cells, which can recognize bacterial toxins and produce biomarkers as a response. Throughout the development, we looked at our project from different points of view in conjunction with social and ethical aspects.:::2020
