It is characterized by a generally poor prognosis and strong resistance to traditional therapies. This season, we focused on designing a novel immunotherapeutic approach involving DNA-launched RNA Replicons (DREP). We utilized our hotspot detection tool, “Custommune”, to generate a list of candidate neo-epitopes from clinically prioritized neoantigens thus reducing the need for extensive sequencing approaches. After in silico validation of our generated neo-epitope predictions, we devised a DREP-based platform to effectively deliver our multi-neo-epitope vaccine. The platform utilizes the inherent self-amplification ability of RNA-replicons to ensure enhanced neo-antigen uptake and presentation leading to the mounting of efficient cellular and humoral immune responses against TNBC. Embedded with optimized subgenomic regulation and linker-peptides alongside glycine-alanine repeats (GAr), a miRNA-based immune evasion mechanism and an OFF-switch, our platform is predicted to be highly safe and efficient through experimentally-driven mathematical simulations.:::2020
