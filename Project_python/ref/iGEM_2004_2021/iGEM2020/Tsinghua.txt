Tsinghua:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NO mediated Biofilm Allayer(NBA):::The formation of the complex bacterial community, termed as biofilm, has proved to be critical events in both industry and medical fields. P.aeruginosa, as a common opportunity pathogen, could form resistant bioflim on pipelines which allows it to evade antibiotics and disinfectants. The diatomic gas nitric oxide(NO), a significant signal molecular in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, has been demonstrated to regulate the formation of the biofilm in P.aeruginosa. Here we designed the engineered bacteria, E.coli in this project, which coudld sense the presence of P.aeruginosa via introduced Rhl quorum sensing(QS) system, triggering the synthesis of NOS gene and the production of NO, and eventually resulting in the biofilm dispersion. Compared with NO gas and chemical donors, our engineered bacteria provides another solution to degrade the biofilm with better efficiency and cost.:::2020
