Rochester:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Creation of a Novel, Noninvasive Diagnostic for Endometriosis using Menstrual Effluent:::The 2020 University of Rochester iGEM Team, Team UteRus, created a novel, non-invasive diagnostic for endometriosis using menstrual effluent (ME). Endometriosis is a chronic disease, affecting 200 million women worldwide, that causes abnormal endometrial-like tissue growth outside of the uterine cavity. The only diagnostic available is exploratory surgery. Our team created lateral flow immunoassays (LFA) that can qualitatively and quantitatively measure the presence of endometriosis biomarkers in ME and built a model to optimize the assay design. Using a Plug and Play approach, our team designed plasmids for antibody production in SHuffle stain Escherichia coli and reduced the cost of our diagnostic. Additionally, we created menstrual cups best suited for the comfort of endometriosis patients as well as inexpensive laboratory equipment for clinics without laboratory access. Our team also built a predictive model that we integrated into a software tool as an endometriosis diagnostic based solely on clinical variables.:::2020
