Lund:::Europe:::Sweden:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Protecto - A biopesticide production system for preventing late blight in potatoes:::We have designed a system for producing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and attempted to demonstrate that it is functioning. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and pET-11 is used to produce a cocktail of AMPs with either Thioredoxin A or Glutathione S-Transferase as a fusion partner, that will be cleaved by recombinant Enterokinase carried by another plasmid in the same cell. After AMP and subsequent protease expression, we will trigger the already developed Deadman kill switch and sonicate the cells in order to make sure that no live genetically modified microorganisms will be present in the product and that the AMPs are free in the solution. The resulting product is a cell extract containing soluble AMPs, which will serve as a biopesticide. We have also developed a computer model that generates and evaluates peptide sequences based on their potential as antifungal agents.:::2020
