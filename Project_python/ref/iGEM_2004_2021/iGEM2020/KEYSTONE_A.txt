KEYSTONE_A:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Bacterial cellulose-based living Gaoyao for arthritis treatment:::In this aging society, arthritis haunts 355 million people around the world, but we still have no radical cure for it. Inspired by “Gaoyao” (an active patch with medical properties) in traditional Chinese medicine, we aim to tackle arthritis by designing a living Gaoyao. Its matrix is bacterial cellulose, a biomaterial with excellent biological compatibility and physical properties. It is embedded with engineered mammalian therapeutic cells harboring a modular genetic circuit, which contains: (1) a sensor with (2) an amplifier to detect trace amounts of inflammation signals at the early stage; (3) an effector that can secret antagonists of pro-inflammatory cytokines to suppress inflammation, BMP2 to activate skeletal stem-cells, and glucosamine to provide building blocks for cartilage; (4) a safety switch, enabling people to externally control the system. It can provide long-term treatment for arthritis, which not only suppresses inflammation before damages and pains arise, but also promotes cartilage regeneration.:::2020
