Worldshaper-Wuhan:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::miR-155 Sensor based on LncRNA Sequence Predict Chemoresistance in Breast Cancer patients:::Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and is the second cancer frequently occurring worldwide of newly-diagnosed cancers. Resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains the major factor for treatment failure and death in breast cancer patients. Thus, there is an urgent search for new, non-invasive, biomarkers to evaluate the effect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in breast cancer patients. A growing number of studies highlights the role of miR-155 in breast cancer drug and radio resistance development. Moreover, studies indicated that lncRNAs could act as sponges to compete miRNAs, participating in various biological processes. This mechanism gives rise to our idea that a sponge RNA based on the sequences of lncRNA with binding sites complementary to the sequence of miR-155 could monitor the expression of miR-155, which offers a non-invasive approach for evaluate the effect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in breast cancer patients.:::2020
