ROADS_SY:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Rice Arsenate Accumulation Reduction:::Thanks to hybridization and genetic modification, rice sustains a huge proportion of the world population. However, arsenate accumulation poses a severe threat to the rice-consuming population, who are generally unaware of the threat and unable to deal with it. We decided to lower the arsenate accumulation of rice by identifying and modifying the genetic sequence related to the arsenate level. Specially, we adopted both the conventional method and the bioinformatic method to identify the related genetic sequence. By doing so, we intended to promote the fusion of bioinformatics and bioengineering. The assumption is that Ospt4 is responsible for the arsenate accumulation of many crop species, including rice. We planned to knock out the genetic sequence and perform contrast experiments to examine whether Ospt4 is related to arsenate accumulation.:::2020
