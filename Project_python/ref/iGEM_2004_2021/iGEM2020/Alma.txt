Alma:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Poisoned River:::The Pine River is found in central Michigan, near the campus of Alma College. Following the closure of the Velsicol Chemical Plant in 1978, many environmental pollutants -- such as DDT -- were improperly disposed of and allowed to leach into the surrounding soil and Pine River. These organochlorides are endocrine disruptors as well as possible carcinogens that have wreaked havoc on the local avian population. Several species of animals have estrogen receptors known to bind DDT, a known xenoestrogen. Linking this binding process to a reporting gene, such as RFP, within a microbe will allow for the detection of organochlorides, which can enhance broad spectrum screening of these contaminated areas both locally and globally. Ultimately, this biosensor has the potential to save thousands of dollars in the pollution cleanup effort as well as provide a basis for the development of future synthetic biology tools for the bioremediation of DDT.:::2020
