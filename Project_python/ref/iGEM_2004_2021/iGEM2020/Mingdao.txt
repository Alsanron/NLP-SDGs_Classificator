Commensal oral microbiome balance plays a pivotal role in maintaining oral health. Nowadays, probiotic treatment is attractive but with limited effectiveness. As a result, we designed a probiotic that can eliminate Streptococcus mutans, the main cause of dental caries. We genetically modified a E. coli probiotic strain, Nissle (EcN) with pyruvate oxidase (SpxB) gene to generate H2O2, aquaporin (AQP) gene to facilitate H2O2 transport, and catalase (KatG) gene to revive from oxidative stress by decomposing H2O2 into oxygen and water. We successfully presented a proof of concept in H2O2 assay, growth inhibition and antagonistic test against the growth of S. mutans. Furthermore, we developed a prototype, Cleandy, a candy can clean your teeth. The Cleandy composed of sugar alcohols and our engineered probiotic (GM EcN) was demonstrated in our experiment showing effective antagonistic activity against S. mutans by producing H2O2.:::2020
