Thessaly:::Europe:::Greece:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Amalthea: a modular platform for monitoring gastrointestinal health:::Amalthea is a complete, personalized, modular platform, which provides diagnosis, evaluation of the gut flora, and treatment of IBDs. A non-invasive encapsulated detection module, consisting of a genetically engineered bacteria-based system and an electronic system, will identify metabolite deficiencies directly correlated to IBDs, that may lead to malnutrition. Exploiting a bio-electronic interface to enable real-time monitoring on the patient’s smartphone. Based on this personalized data, a biosynthetic module will respond with selective production of the missing metabolites, thus eliminating that nutritional deficit and relieving the patient from the symptoms. Our product is designed according to healthcare experts and international standards, to ensure biosafety. With this work, we aspire to provide cost-efficient and innovative solutions for detecting intestinal deformities and improving the gut microbiome, while facilitating one of humans’ essential needs – to enjoy one’s food.:::2020
