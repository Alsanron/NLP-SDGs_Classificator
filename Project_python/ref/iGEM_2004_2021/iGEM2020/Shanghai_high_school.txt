Shanghai_high_school:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::ER Sensor:::Exogenous endocrine disruptors are called environmental hormones. EDCs are compounds that affect metabolism. These substances mimic natural hormones or hinder the action of normal human hormones. EDC surged in the environment in the past decades. Chemical substances created by industrial world are the cause of environmental hormones. About 70 kinds of chemical substances are widely used in fungicides, preservatives, insecticides, pesticides, food additives, plastic products, and so forth. In addition, harmful substances are also detected from rivers to the ocean in the world. Over 30 types of endocrine hormones were detected from the seeping water at the industrial waste disposal site. Since estrogen in the environment causes severe endocrine disorders, threatening the health of the fetus and children (obesity caused by cancer and metabolic disorders is also thought to be linked), we aim to create an estrogen sensor, namely ER Sensor, to detect the estrogen in the environment around us.:::2020
