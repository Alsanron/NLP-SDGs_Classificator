CPU_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Prevention methods of alcoholic liver disease by inflammation control and intestinal flora regulation:::We engineered a synthetic organism capable of expressing and secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-22, which will get to liver first due to First Pass Effect after its absorption into bloodstream and perform anti-inflammation function to protect the injured liver part from further inflammation damage. We also endowed the chasis with anti-E.faecalis function controlled by quorum sensing system. We chose bacteriocins JM79, plwα and plwβ with high specificity towards E.faecalis, the bacteriocins will function in situ to kill the over-reproduced E.faecalis to balance the intestinal flora, thus protect the liver from further immunoreaction at immunogen level. The chasis applied is E.coli Nissle 1917, which is a type of probiotic that can be taken orally in capsule. The system is expected to protect the liver with alcohol-induced inflammation from further pathological progression and is possible to be used as an adjuvant therapy in the future.:::2020
