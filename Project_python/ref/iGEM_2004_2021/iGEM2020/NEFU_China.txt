NEFU_China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bio-optical Landmine Detection:::Currently, at least 110 million landmines are still buried in the field worldwide. These landmines cause not only tens of thousands of human casualties each year, but also serious environmental pollution. To help deminers detect landmines in a fast and safe way, our team designed a bio-optical landmine detection device. We engineered an E. coli strain harboring a gene circuit to sense the dinitrotoluene (DNT), a typical chemical released by landmines. DNT can trigger the bioluminescence generation module in our engineered bacteria, and emitted optical signal can be captured and converted to digital output by the device, which is uploaded to an on-site computer. Through data processing, we will be able to create a probabilistic heat map of the landmines in a particular area. Eventually, an optimized landmine clearance route can be proposed to assist manual landmine detection with a minimal risk of deminersâ€™ injury.:::2020
