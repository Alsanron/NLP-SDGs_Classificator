OhioState:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biocontainment Reimagined:::The field of synthetic biology has one major barrier to being accepted by the broader public: safety. While we may know that the organisms we use are harmless, most people don’t have the background knowledge needed to come to the same conclusion. We believe that the best way to raise safety and confidence in synthetic biology products is by adding genetic biocontainment systems, which are genes and genome edits that give us control over the life of our microbes. These systems range from small genetic circuits of promoters and toxins to complete genomic rewrites, and we’ve compiled all of them into a simple, flexible database. To accompany this, we’ve developed predictive models and educational media, all with the express purpose of making biocontainment easier to implement and making synthetic biology safer for public use.:::2020
