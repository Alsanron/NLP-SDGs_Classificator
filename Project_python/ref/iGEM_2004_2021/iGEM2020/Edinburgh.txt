Edinburgh:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Finding NEMO – The transcription-only biosensing platform:::We are Edinburgh's iGEM team, Finding NEMO! This year, we wanted to create something truly innovative and impactful. That's why we developed Finding NEMO, a transcription only and cell-free system for biosensing. By stripping back the material necessities, we made biosensing faster, cheaper, safer and more accessible. To achieve this we have utilised fluorescent RNA aptamers to replace the conventional GFP protein reporters. We then devised an isothermal amplification and rudimentary logic processing system mediated by synthetic RNA transcription bubbles and T7-RNA-Polymerase. To this base system, we have studied the integration of conventional biosensing modalities such as transcription factors, transcriptional riboswitches and direct oligonucleotide sensing. Our case study application is environmental water testing and we have spoken to industry leaders and regulatory authorities. At every stage we have championed open science and the UN’s sustainable development goals to ensure our design is beneficial to all and the environment.:::2020
