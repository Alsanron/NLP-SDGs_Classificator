Tongji_Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synthesis Navigator:::Nowadays，there is a rising demand for designing and implementing metabolic pathways. However, Some biology researchers are faced with complicated metabolic pathways just like sailors trapped in the ocean, and our team’s integrated platform, "Synthesis navigator”, can assist them in the design of metabolic pathways. The first part of our project is an integrated database named “Synthetic Bay “, which contains much more data than last year, for synthetic biology sailors to get supplied. Secondly, in order to construct a route in metabolism oceans, synthetic biology sailors can input the starting and target compound (or one of them) then Synthesis navigator can search out a number of possible metabolic pathways from the database. Last, what counts is that facing unknown ocean environment, sailors can utilize the Hybrid Metabolic Simulation to predict the metabolic situation of chassis organisms thus avoiding the frustrated adventure in metabolic ocean.:::2020
