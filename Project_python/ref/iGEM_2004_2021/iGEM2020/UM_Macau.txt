UM_Macau:::Asia:::Macao:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biofilm-Removing E. coli for Aquarium Cleaning (BREAC):::As biofilm grows rapidly, it attaches to the inner surface of aquariums and aquatic organisms, which lowers the water quality if not cleaned regularly. However, the removal of biofilm in large aquariums is time-consuming and relies on inefficient labor through scrubbing. To address these concerns, we engineered the BL21 bacteria strain of E.coli to detect and biodegrade biofilms. The T7 promoter drives the expression of LuxR, which recognizes the signaling molecule AHL that is secreted by biofilms. Combined with AHL, LuxR would bind to the pLuxR to express the adhesive protein, Ag43, and digestive enzymes, DNase and protease. Our engineered bacteria will bind to the biofilm and degrade it efficiently.:::2020
