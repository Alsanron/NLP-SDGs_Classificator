Lambert_GA:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::AgroSENSE:::Over 23.5 million Americans face food insecurity or have limited access to affordable and fresh produce, leading to nutrient deficiency. Aquaponics is a pragmatic solution to address food insecurity, but maintenance and costs are barriers to implementation. Lambert iGEM’s AgroSENSE utilizes modular hardware, nutrient biosensors, and iOS/Android compatible software to monitor and analyze nutrient levels and environmental conditions to optimize plant growth. Our Arduino sensors measure environmental conditions while biosensors are utilized to monitor phosphate and nitrate nutrient balance. We characterized BioBricks based on E. coli’s native PHO and NAR signaling pathways. The expression of GFP in the presence of these nutrients is analyzed by Fluoro-Q, our improved frugal fluorometer. The data will be quantified by our Agro-Q mobile app, enabling end-users to make informed decisions regarding aquaponics systems. With an emphasis on integration of educational curriculum, AgroSENSE serves as a model for future agricultural biotechnology innovations.:::2020
