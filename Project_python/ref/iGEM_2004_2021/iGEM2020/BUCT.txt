They are cyanobacteria, which produce cyanobacteria toxins, such as microcystins. It can cause brain fever, skin allergies; even induce tumor genesis and liver cancer. In our project, we use a special chassis -cyanophage. We try to add two parts to the phage: a functional part that can be used to degrade the toxin and a control part that prevents the release of the cyanophage. Our functional part consists of MLR gene cluster, which produces microcystin-LR degrading enzymes to decompose the long-lasting cyclic peptide into harmless amino acids. Our control part consists of Unnatural amino acid systems. It can be used to limit the proliferation of the cyanophage. By putting our designed recombinant cyanobacteria into water bodies, we hope this will be a more safe and effective treatment in algal blooms and toxins degradation.:::2020
