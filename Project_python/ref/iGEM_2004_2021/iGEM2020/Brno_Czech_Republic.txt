Brno_Czech_Republic:::Europe:::Czech Republic:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CYANOTRAP:::CYANOTRAP is a synthetic biology system developed to lyse cyanobacteria and degrade their toxins. The host bacterium Bacillus subtilis will be immobilized on a cellulose matrix in a flow through device. It will also produce a collection of extracellular protein complexes attached to its cell wall based on the naturally occurring structures called cellulosomes. These structures will display enzymes carrying out the functions mentioned above. In the first step of our project, we aimed to immobilize the engineered cells on cellulose microbeads. For this we used a synthetic gene containing a cellulose binding module connected by a linker to LysM domain, anchoring the fusion protein to the cell wall of the host organism. We've carried out a number of experiments including cloning of the synthetic gene into a target plasmid, integrating the plasmid into the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, cultivating the engineered cells, producing and testing the synthetic protein.:::2020
