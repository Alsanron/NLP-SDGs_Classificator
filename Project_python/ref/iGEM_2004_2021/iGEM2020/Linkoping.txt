Linkoping:::Europe:::Sweden:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ClusteRsy: A user-friendly software for transcriptomic analysis and biomarker discovery:::Asthma is a chronic and inflammatory disease that affects the airways of 339 million people around the world yet the specific causes and triggers of asthma are still unknown. There is an increasing demand for refined diagnostic methods and in the age of Big data, the advancement of powerful algorithms provides an approach different from traditional methods. With the creation of the web-based software ClusteRsy we empower clinicians and biologists to analyze any RNA-seq data without the need of a bioinformatician. Through the use of ClusteRsy and our designed workflow, differentially expressed genes and pathways can be determined, which is pivotal to understand the mechanisms of diseases and find potential biomarkers. With the processed information, we have designed a theoretical biosensor to detect and distinguish asthma from similar conditions, hereby simultaneously striving to decipher the etiology of asthma and improving the diagnosis for the disease.:::2020
