CAU_China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Abaddon Remedy:::In Revelation, Abaddon is the king of locusts who brought disasters to the world. In fact, locust swarms have caused chaos throughout history. To solve the problem of food insecurity caused by locust, CAU_China did project: ABADDON REMEDY. We are interested in finding a efficient biopesticide which can kill locust based on RNAi. We hope that ABADDON REMEDY will bring us a world with less locusts, and also less pesticide contamination.:::2020
