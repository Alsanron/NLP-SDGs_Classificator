Hamburg:::Europe:::Germany:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Unicorn - an aMAIZEing concept:::Synthetic biologists imagine fancy synthetic circuits, which perform well in silico but have unforeseen effects in applications. In many cases we add synthetic control instruments (e.g. promoters) to already complicated cells, hoping everything works as planned even in the cellular context. But this additional complexity can pose a problem, due to unknown interactions with regulatory processes. Our aim is to make synthetic gene control easier. Cells possess specific responses to external stimuli, like pathogen infection. We propose a new mechanism which connects the natural cell response with the reliable expression of a target output, making synthetic gene control less complex and more replicable. After the proof of concept in E. coli, Zea mays and Arabidopsis thaliana we hope that our universally applicable method will be used to create sustainable pathogen and disease resistances in crop plants.:::2020
