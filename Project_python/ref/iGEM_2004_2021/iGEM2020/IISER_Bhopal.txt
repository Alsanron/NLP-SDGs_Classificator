IISER_Bhopal:::Asia:::India:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::THE BIG PIE: Beta Cells In Gut Produce Insulin using E.coli (Tackling Diabetes Without Injections!):::Globally, over 463 million adults suffer from diabetes, with the number estimated to exceed 575 million by 2030. Insulin, the ideal therapeutic for diabetics worldwide, is available only in an injectable form. Our project presents an out-of-the-box approach to tackle diabetes based on transdifferentiation. Our delivery vector, E. coli Nissle 1917, would be programmed to attach to crypt cells through expression of a crypt cell-specific antibody Lgr5. This would be followed by translocation of the three transcription factors - PDX1, MAFA & NGN3 - via the Type 3 Secretion System (a molecular syringe) into the cells to convert them into glucose-responsive beta-islet like cells. An inbuilt kill switch would ensure organisms egested from the body do not survive. Proof of concept will be established in the E. coli K-12 strain. The objective is to design a smart and viable alternative for insulin injections.:::2020
