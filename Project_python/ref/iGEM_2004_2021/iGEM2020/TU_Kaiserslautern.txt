TU_Kaiserslautern:::Europe:::Germany:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Microdestruction:::Micropollutants are a massive concern in wastewater treatment, as their accumulation can seriously impact ecosystems. Anti-inflammatory medications such as Ibuprofen or Diclofenac are primary examples of micropollutants becoming an ever-growing problem through patient overuse and relaxed disposal practices. Laccase has been shown to chemically deactivate Diclofenac, leading to functional degradation. Different laccase genes (MarLac, from uncultivated marine bacteria, and BaLac, from a mutant Botrytis aclada) were cloned into both our control bacterium, Escherichia coli, and primary organism, the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Produced laccases would be incorporated into a bioreactor set up. Our project will use synthetic biology in an innovative and cost-effective way to produce a self-sufficient system. We want to reduce the need for specialized and still experimental equipment with easy integration into existing sewage treatment plant systems. It is our vision to create a cost-effective and efficient approaches to a cleaner and healthier environment.:::2020
