BGU-Israel:::Asia:::Israel:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::WIPEOUT - Wipes out wet wipes of the environment!:::Over the last two decades, the use of wet wipes has become commonplace across the globe. Disposal of wet wipes through the toilet and their accumulation in the sewer systems cause extensive damage; In Israel alone, repairing the wet wipes damage to sewer systems is estimated by 3,360,000$ per year! "Wipeout" presents a leading and innovative solution to this unsolved, global problem of biodegradation of domestic contamination of sewage and water systems. We aim to utilize biological methods, including genetically engineering the sewer systems' bacterial populations, using bacterial surface- display systems. Our final goal is to solve the clogging problems caused by an accumulation of cellulose fibered wipes in sewer systems and prevent a generation of "fatbergs", which are thousands of wipes stacked together with other flushed solids and fats. By finding a solution to this problem we may be able to prevent both ecological and economic damages.:::2020
