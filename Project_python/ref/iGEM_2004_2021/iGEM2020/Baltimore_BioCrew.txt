Iron is required for photosynthesis and is critical for the base of the marine food web. A better ability to capture iron could increase phytoplankton populations which would have benefits such as reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide by acting as a carbon sink. We decided to engineer Synechococcus (cyanobacteria) because it consumes high levels of CO2, has a high replication rate, and has been used by many previous iGEM teams. Our project will engineer cyanobacteria to transport iron into cells and reduce it to the bioavailable Fe(II) form. The increased iron utilization will increase photosynthesis and growth of phytoplankton. To prevent harmful phytoplankton blooms, a kill switch will also be added to the cells to prevent overgrowth of cells if iron concentration increased significantly. These modifications will stabilize the marine food chain and absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.:::2020
