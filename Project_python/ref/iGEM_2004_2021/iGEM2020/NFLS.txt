NFLS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::A System for Degrading Waste Cellulose and Generating Electricity:::Things made from cellulose can be seen everywhere in our life, such as paper and straw. Although some methods for recycling used paper have reached good efficiency, there is still large amounts of waste paper that cannot reach the standard of being recycled and have no chance to be put into a second use together with many materials composed of cellulose. Some of those cellulose materials can only be buried or burnt, which creates pollution for the environment. To deal with those materials, we come up with an idea of using genetically engineered E.colis to transform cellulose into glucose with the help of enzymes, including endoglucanases(cex), exoglucanases(cen), and Î²-glucosidases, and the E.colis generate electricity in Microbial Fuel Cells. We hope to imply this synthetic biological method to deal with waste cellulose and more environmental issues.:::2020
