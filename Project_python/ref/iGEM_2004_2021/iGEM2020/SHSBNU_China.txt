However, the existing prevention measures are expensive and not environmentally friendly. Locust plague is mainly caused by the colonizing locusts, while the scattered locusts need to be initiated by serotonin and guaiacol to form colonized locusts. Therefore, we proposed a design to allow E. coli to express four enzymes to degrade serotonin and guaiacol in the intestines of the locusts. To enhance the degradation efficiency, we introduced a self-lysis system in E. coli to allow the enzymes release to the intestinal lumen of locust, which helps ultimately disturb the swarming behavior of locust and avoid the occurrence of locust plagues. For biosafety, we have also introduced a heat-induced suicide switch, which allows E. coli to commit suicide in response to the summer heat when the plagues are reduced.:::2020
