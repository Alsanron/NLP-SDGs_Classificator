Patras:::Europe:::Greece:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hippocrates: Genomic Analysis & Artificial Intelligence at your heart's disposal:::According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are one of the main causes of death worldwide due to the blood’s high LDL cholesterol level. Statins are the drug category that is administered to regulate the levels of LDL cholesterol. However, 1/3 of patients do not respond effectively, resulting in several side effects. There are human genes that regulate a particular drug’s metabolism. Depending on individuals’ genetic profiles, the required therapeutic drug-dose can be accurately determined by available but optional tests. The SLCO1B1 gene is involved in the uptake of statins by liver cells. So, we present an innovative, time-saving, and portable genotyping method based on BentoLab (iGEM UCL 2013) for detecting genome polymorphism related to statins’ metabolism, combined with Artificial Intelligence, to make a fast and accurate analysis of results to facilitate those who perform the test.:::2020
