Pittsburgh:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bluetooth Bacteria:::Our ability to control the function of engineered microbes is limited within hard to reach places, such as deep within human tissue, the rhizosphere surrounding crops, or pipes in manufacturing facilities. The field of magnetogenetics has begun to consider how magnetic fields could affect biological molecules and cells. In our project, we aim to control the function of bacteria via the remote activation of an alternating magnetic field (AMF). E. coli will be engineered to respond to magnetic stimuli by attaching magnetic nanoparticles to the surface of the bacterial membrane in conjunction with cytoplasmic temperature-sensitive transcriptional repressors to regulate gene expression of the green fluorescent protein. Upon AMF stimulation, magnetic nanoparticles heat up and increase cytoplasmic temperature, thereby inducing a conformational change of the repressor dimers and allowing transcription of target genes. This technology critically couples alternating magnetic field stimulation with thermal sensitive parts to enable “wireless” control of bacteria.:::2020
