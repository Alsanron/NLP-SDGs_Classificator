Although the current detection methods are diverse, most of the main applications are hospitals with certain qualifications and conditions. This is no small challenge for people in developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries. Therefore, it is very necessary to have a simple operation and easy-to-carry testing equipment that can be used in communities and rural hospitals. Therefore, this year’s BIT team is committed to designing related integrated detection systems. Based on the designed biosensing module, centrifugal chip module， smart phone module, and the COVID-19 related protein markers （Convert it into a nucleic acid signal） are fast, sensitive, portable and low-cost. Testing, providing effective testing programs for the new coronavirus in places with low medical testing resources.:::2020
