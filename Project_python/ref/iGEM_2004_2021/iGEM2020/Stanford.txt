Stanford:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SEED: Self-replicating Embedded Environmental Diagnostic:::The Stanford iGEM team is engineering a customizable nucleic acid diagnostic that can be performed with Bacillus subtilis, a GRAS gram-positive bacteria. Our goal is to create persistent environmental nucleic acid surveillance by taking advantage of the natural competence found in B. subtilis. In the presence of a target nucleic acid sequence cells will produce a visible signal through two detection systems. The first approach uses RNA toeholds, composed of an RNA hairpin complementary to the target sequence and a reporter protein that produces a visual readout in the presence of the target. The second approach uses B. subtilisâ€™ recombination system to remove a negative selection marker in the B. subtilis genome flanked by regions of homology to the sequence of interest. The goal of this project is to create a diagnostic system that will help address future viral testing shortages by leveraging the natural scalability of cellular systems.:::2020
