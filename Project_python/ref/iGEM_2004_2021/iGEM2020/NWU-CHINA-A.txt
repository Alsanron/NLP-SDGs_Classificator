NWU-CHINA-A:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Avenger assemble:::The rising risk of severe side-effects and potential resistance of antibiotics have limited their usage. Moreover, non-biodegradable medical product loaded antibiotic is one of global pollutions. To solve these problems, our team aimed to design a medical dressing based on novel human defensins (HBDs) and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) from micro-organisms. HBDs, kinds of novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP) from human, which has excellent blood compatibility and effective anti-bacteria without drug resistance and immunogenicity. In order to combine HBDs on the surface of flexible PHA film in vitro, we built a fusion protein by using a natural PHA surface binding protein (PhaP). All parts of the completely biodegradable medical dressing, including HBDs, PHA and PhaP, are designed and produced in engineering bacteria. We hope that the combination of HBDs and PHA could boost the persistent anti-bacteria and histocompatibility of adhesive bandages. Besides, implementing the concept to medical field would be our future jobs.:::2020
