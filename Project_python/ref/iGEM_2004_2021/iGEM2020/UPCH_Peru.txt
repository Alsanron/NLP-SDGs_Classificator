UPCH_Peru:::Latin America:::Peru:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CrioPROT: An innovative solution for crop loss due to frost:::In the Peruvian highlands, frosts during the winter cause crop damage leading to significant economic losses for small and medium scale farmers, perpetuating their already vulnerable condition. Our team wants to approach this problem by bringing an innovative solution. We aim to develop a system of production of an antifreeze agent which has a protective capacity in frost-susceptible crops, administrable by spraying. This product consists of a solution of recombinantly expressed and purified antifreeze proteins (AFPs). Our core genetic designs comprise the sequences of three types of AFPs, of plant and insect origin, with inducible and constitutive promoters, and a peptide signal for secretion to the culture medium. The chassis we have selected is a psychrophilic bacteria of the Pseudoalteromonas genus in order to guarantee an efficient work at low-temperature settings. In this way, our system will be capable of producing AFPs in low-tech environments in frost-affected regions.:::2020
