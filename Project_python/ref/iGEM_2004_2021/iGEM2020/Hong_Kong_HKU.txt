Hong_Kong_HKU:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Beyond Unicellular: Recombinase circuits to develop monoculture phenotypic heterogeneity with precise ratiometric control:::Some natural populations of unicellular organisms exhibit uniquely high levels of cooperativity and labor division by sustaining phenotypic variation, which allows them to handle complex tasks efficiently. Similarly, achieving high degrees of compartmentalization in monocultures of engineered cells can bring tremendous benefits to multiple applications of synthetic biology, including healthcare, industrial use, and environmental remediation. Our project aims to develop a versatile set of tools that can help create and maintain stable phenotypic variation in cellular monocultures using bacteriophage-derived Cre recombinases, which recognize and invert a loxP-flanked genetic sequence in a stochastic manner. We introduced and assessed different mutations in the Cre enzyme to improve its accuracy and conducted pilot experiments for establishing ratiometric control of cellular phenotypes. To confirm the experimental phenotypic ratios, we built computational simulations that successfully predicted the phenotypic ratios and assessed phenotypic populations' stability and convergence with the coefficient of variation.:::2020
