The Trypanosome Lytic Factor Apolipoprotein L-1 (APOL1) is a pore-forming protein known to kill all types of trypanosomes in baboons. While cattle lack APOL1, from the genome-wide BLAST we found cattle APOL3 (c-APOL3) which is the closest homolog of baboon APOL1 (b-APOL1). Sequence alignment analysis showed that c-APOL3 lacked 38 residues in N-terminus and had differences in C-terminus domain. Further, structure prediction analysis via HHPred and RaptorX indicated that the N-terminus might interact with the C-terminus to maximize pore-forming potential in the b-APOL1, though c-APOL3 lacked these interactions. Therefore, chimeric proteins with a combination of N and C-termini from b-APOL1 in native c-APOL3 were designed and investigated for function using bioinformatics. The capability of CRISPR for insertion of chimeric genes into the host genome and physiological functional assays are being performed.:::2020
