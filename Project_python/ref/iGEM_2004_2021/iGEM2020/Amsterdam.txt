A challenge is that it is more beneficial for cells to use their resources exclusively for growth, resulting in a loss of production ability. Therefore, we have developed Forbidden FRUITS, a pipeline that can solve this problem by calculating and optimizing engineering strategies to couple a product forming pathway to microbial growth. Multiple databases, constraint-based programming and gene-protein-reaction associations are used to devise suitable strategies. These strategies are then optimized using pathfinding methods and sequence optimization. As proof-of-principle, we applied Forbidden FRUITS to salicylic acid, lactate and mannitol production in Synechocystis PCC6803, lactate in Synechococcus UTEX 2973 and salicylic acid in Escherichia Coli. Forbidden FRUITS is shown to be flexible and allow for the fast development of stable production strains, making the full-potential of biotechnology evermore attainable.:::2020
