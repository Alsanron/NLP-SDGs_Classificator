SYSU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Semi-rational evolution of ADAR1 inhibitors:::RNA binding proteins(RBPs) play an essential role in tumors and neurodegenerative diseases, while most of them lack of effective inhibitors. Since directed evolution has shown its high efficiency, this year we provided a sample combining rational design and directed evolution to obtain dsRNA inhibitors of RBPs and took ADAR1, a dsRNA adenosine deaminase, as an example. In our project, an algorithm-guided model was trained from natural substrates of ADAR1 and used to established a candidate dsRNA library. Those candidates were connected to a self-splicing stem-loop sequence and transferred into HeLa cells with toxic genes regulated by ADAR1 and Tet-on system, which only survived when endogenous ADAR1 was inhibited by transferred dsRNAs. Efficient substrates were extracted and used to train the model above for the next round. Through the continuous cycle of this screening process, we could obtain high-efficiency inhibitors of ADAR1 efficiently, and extend this model to other RBPs.:::2020
