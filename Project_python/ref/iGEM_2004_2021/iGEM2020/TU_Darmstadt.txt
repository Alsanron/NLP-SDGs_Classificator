But somehow, we humans have managed to neglect and pollute this meaningful resource. Nonetheless, most of us arenâ€™t even aware of the consequences. In this year's iGEM project, we have made it our mission to make a difference in wastewater treatment and develop an innovative future for pharmaceutical degradation: B-TOX, a modular biofilm able to degrade a variety of detrimental micropollutants like the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac. By devising an enhanced and modular B. subtilis biofilm, we can render pharmaceutical residues less toxic, utilizing the degrading properties of enzymes. We immobilize our degradation enzymes in the extracellular biofilm matrix, thereby providing a self-sustaining system without the necessity downstream processing. A safe implementation and the prevention of bacteria release is given through our kill switch system, connecting the survival of our bacteria to the presence of determined molecules.:::2020
