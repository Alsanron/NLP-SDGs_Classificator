Our project aims to increase crop yield and minimize pollution caused by phosphorus runoffs. By genetically editing phosphorus solubilizing bacteria, we insert a gene important for bacteria’s survivals. This can constrict the area where bacteria can survive, so they are only close to the rhizosphere. The products are fertilizer adjuvants for farmers and agent kits for scientists. These create a Smart and Accurate form of agriculture, called “accuriculture”. To provide practical solutions to the issue, we also researched the market and interviewed some target customers. We communicated with professors in the area in order to prepare a more useful product. Finally, we made a business plan to attract investors and funding. We provide a comprehensive solution that even has the practical potential to be applied on broader aspects.:::2020
