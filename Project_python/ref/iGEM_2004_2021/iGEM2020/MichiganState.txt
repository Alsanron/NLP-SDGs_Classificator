MichiganState:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BeeTox:::Since 2005, bee populations have been declining at an alarming rate. Our team decided to address one major factor contributing to these deaths: pesticides. Project BeeTox is a probiotic that allows bees to detoxify imidacloprid, a common neonicotinoid pesticide. We divided into 3 subteams to address different aspects of the project. The Device team designed a feeder to administer the probiotic in sugar water, incorporating an image recognition biocontainment mechanism. The Gene Engineering team worked to create a designer strain of Snodgrassella alvi, a microbe that colonizes the bee gut and can be effectively transformed. Our efforts were directed towards modifying the type I secretion system of S. alvi to export enzymes for detoxifying imidacloprid. The Bioinformatics team computationally modelled imidacloprid-degrading enzymes and analyzed the metabolic profile of imidacloprid breakdown. Successful implementation of this technology has the potential to save countless bees and the plants they pollinate.:::2020
