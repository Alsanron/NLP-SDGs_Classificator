Austin_UTexas:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PhastPhage:::Bacterial contamination of drinking water is a huge problem worldwide, causing 780,000 deaths on average each year. With PhastPhage, we intend to create a phage-based biosensor for detecting the presence of E. coli contamination in water sources. Using the stoichiometric gene expression simulator Pinetree, we modeled the genome of bacteriophage T7 in order to determine how we could engineer it to produce large amounts of GFP and shorten the time it takes to lyse bacterial cells during an infection cycle. We determined that the most effective way to achieve this was to place a GFP gene, as well as move a holin gene responsible for lysis proteins, into the genome adjacent to gene 10A, which encodes for a major capsid protein and has the highest level of expression of all of T7’s genes. In the future we hope to engineer phage with these changes and confirm our model’s predictions experimentally.:::2020
