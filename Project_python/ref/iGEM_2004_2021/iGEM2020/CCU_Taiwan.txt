CCU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Peptide-based dengue virus detection - DENDEX:::Dengue fever is listed as one of the “Top Ten Health Threats“ by the World Health Organization, which threatens approximately 3.95 billion people in tropical and subtropical regions. C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A), a receptor locating on the surface of macrophages, could interact with the envelope protein of dengue virus and trigger the signal transduction to cause the life-threatening cytokine storm. Based on this knowledge, we tried to develop a dengue virus detection kit “DENDEX“ using the peptides based on the partial sequences from CLEC5A. First, we confirmed the interaction of these peptides and the envelope protein using docking simulation. Then, we produced these peptides massively using a novel technique, called linear array epitope (LAE). These peptides will be used for detecting dengue virus in our kit, which contains gold nanoparticles as indicators. We hope this type of detection kit will provide a new diagnostic perspective.:::2020
