BNDS_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::BACLOTH:::Wild animalâ€™s leathers have great values for the clothing and fashion industry. Some luxury products like crocodile bag even require leather from rare species. This profitable business drives poachers to illegally hunt and hurt those wild animals. The demands of leather put the wild animals in a dangerous place and the harms caused by poaching for species conservation is unthinkable. Therefore, we aimed to integrate bacterial cellulose and protein crosslinking to manufacture artificial leather for animal conservation. Specifically, we utilized G. xylinus to synthesize bacterial cellulose. Moreover, we engineered E. coli and P. Pastoris to purify collagen-like protein and spider fibroin with SpyCatcher003 and SpyTag003 for protein crosslinking. This synthetic biological method provides an alternative way to supply raw material for leather industry, while ensuring animal and environment conversation.:::2020
