KAIT_Japan:::Asia:::Japan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. coli that Create a Creative Environment:::Our goal in this iGEM jamboree is development of “E. coli that create a creative environment” We've all suffered from the unpleasant odor of culturing E. coli .Therefore, we wanted to make unpleasant odors comfortable by development of E. coli that biosynthesize aromatic components. We decided on the sweet-smelling vanillin as the aromatic substance. In this research, the metabolic pathway to biosynthesize vanillin, we selected a pathway that metabolizes glucose to L-phenylalanine and introduces an enzyme gene to metabolize it to vanillin. Making the E. coli smell like vanilla may help alleviate unpleasant odors during the experiment and make it more enjoyable, allowing you to be more creative with your experiments.:::2020
