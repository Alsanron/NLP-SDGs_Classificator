Groningen:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RootPatch:::Potatoes are an important crop for many cultures. They provide more carbohydrates, proteins, minerals and vitamins per unit area of land and time as compared to other crops and are therefore a popular choice for many farmers and consumers. However, the growth of the potato plant is severely affected by parasitic nematodes that feed on the roots of the plant. Per year, around 460 million dollar is lost due to these nematodes. Our project RootPatch provides a solution to this problem. RootPatch is a bacterial layer around the roots of the potato plant. The bacteria in RootPatch are engineered to produce neuropeptide-like proteins, a class of neuropeptides which specifically influence the behaviour of the parasitic nematodes, making them avoid the root system of the plant. To guarantee safety, the engineered bacteria are dependent on the potato plant, making sure that they stay where they are supposed to be.:::2020
