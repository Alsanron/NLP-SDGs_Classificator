NJMU-China:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Sound of Silence: Domestic autism screening based on urinary metabolites:::Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), with its prevalence increasing dramatically over past decades, brings severe burden on both families and the society. Nowadays, the screening of ASD mainly bases on behavioral scale, neglecting the genetic and metabolic alterations. Meanwhile, it calls for test methods with lower price and higher privacy. Our project consists two parts: a test strip for domestic tests based on urinary metabolites and further, a parallel screening strategy that increases sensitivity. As for the test strip, it is embedded with whole cell biosensors of elevated urinary serotonin, which was previously reported to play a critical role in ASD development. And the biosensor was constructed utilizing the Qurom-Sensing system in P. aeruginosa in this project. As for the parallel screening strategy, we employed machine learning algorithm and find a combination of metabolites for screening that performs best by representing most of the heterogenous patient population.:::2020
