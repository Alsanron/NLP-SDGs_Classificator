Research has shown that the gut microbiome alterations play a key role in a person's stress reactivity and influences anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors. In brief, if we can manage to alter the gut microbiome's functionality, the bidirectional communication might shift and lead to less anxiety and depression-like behaviors. We believe that Bubbly can revert depression and to bring relief to people suffering from depression. Our pearl, a novel food supplement, is composed of three major components: naringenin, a flavonoid that works anti-inflammatory, kojibose, a prebiotic sugar with beneficial effects on the gut microbiome and vitamin-B12. Now, we are producing naringenin in the lab and working on the formulation of the pearl. Our pearl can be sold as an independent product and could also be added to already existing foods as probiotics.:::2020
