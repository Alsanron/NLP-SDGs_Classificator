Bielefeld-CeBiTec:::Europe:::Germany:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::WavySense: Donâ€™t take your hormones, measure them!:::Have you ever thought about contraception? Did you know most contraceptives are invasive and can have severe side effects? A new, innovative and non-invasive method is needed. One that reliably reports the user's fertility. Therefore, we developed WavySense: Contributing to gender equality by supporting and empowering women, lacking any side effects. WavySense enables users to determine the current fertility by directly measuring the characteristic sex hormones estrogen, progesterone and luteinizing hormone in urine using the surface acoustic wave technique. An electronic module induces waves in a piezoelectric crystal, which are phase-shifted by mass changes on the surface. We produced hormone-specific antibodies in E. coli and single chain variable fragments for comparison. Immobilized on the gold-coated surface of the crystal, antibody-antigen binding leads to a phase shift which is detected by the electronics and transferred to our user-friendly app. It tracks, evaluates and visualizes recent measurements, displaying the current fertility status.:::2020
