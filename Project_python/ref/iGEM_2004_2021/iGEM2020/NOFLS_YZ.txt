NOFLS_YZ:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Discovery of FXR antagonist against T2DM:::Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), as a member of nuclear receptors is tightly associated with glucose metabolism. Accumulated evidence indicated that FXR antagonist relates to the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), although the related mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, our aim is to screen a small molecule FXR antagonist as a probe to explore the mechanism of FXR regulating glucose metabolism. Here, we used AlphaScreen assay to screen FXR antagonist. Among the compounds, H7 was finally selected for its highly antipathogenic activity against FXR. Finally, H7 antagonized GW4064-induced reporter gene stimulation in transactivation assay, indicating that H7 was a FXR antagonist.:::2020
