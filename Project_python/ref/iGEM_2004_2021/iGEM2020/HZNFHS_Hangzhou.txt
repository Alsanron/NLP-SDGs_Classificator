:::CO2 is the main greenhouse gas causing global warming. Using renewable electricity to reduce CO2 to chemicals is a sustainable strategy for greenhouse gas mitigation and renewable electricity storage. To overcome the disadvantages of CO2 electrochemical reduction with inorganic catalysts, developing a biological/inorganic hybrid catalysis system for efficient CO2 conversion is promising. In this study, lycopene will be obtained in the hybrid catalysis system by combining electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction and biological CO2 conversion with genetically engineered Ralstonia eutropha. In this hybrid catalysis system, bacteria can use CO2 and H2 as substrates to produce lycopene. As a result, CO2 can be transformed to valuable chemicals with electricity input and renewable electrical energy derived from wind and solar energy can be stored as chemical energy simultaneously.:::2020
