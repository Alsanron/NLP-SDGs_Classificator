BUCT-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biodegradation of plastics and further utilization of the degradation products for biopolymer synthesis:::Plastic is a remarkable substance that has multiple advantages for many applications. But it also brought huge disasters to our ecological environment. Over time, that plastic material does not biodegrade, but breaks down into tiny particles known as microplastics, and enter the food chain. Last year, we observed a strain, which can degrade PE and PS. This year, based on last year's study, we made some improvements and conducted further exploration work. Our project have two parts. The first part is to degrade PE into alkanesIn. We construct an artificial metabolic pathway and use surface display to express Laccase on the surface of spores, making the reaction more efficient and intuitive. The second part is to use those metabolites to synthesize environmentally-friendly material PHFA (poly hydroxyl fatty acid). Based on genome sequencing and synthetic biology, we constructed another engineered bacteria to utilize plastics to synthetic value-added products such as PHFA.:::2020
