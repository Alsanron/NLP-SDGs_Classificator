RDFZ-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Tea-HEE:::Depression is a common yet serious disease worldwide effecting more than 322 million people. It has been accepted that serotonin deficiency is the major cause of depression and medications are made to improve this situation. Yet patients often feel pressure and refuse to take antidepressants due to social stigmas. Our project, Tea-HEE, focused on a novel way to prevent this problem. We engineered E. coli Nissle 1917 (an FDA approved probiotic) to be placed in patientsâ€™ intestine. It can be activated by PCA, a tea metabolite derived from tea intake, and to produce 5-HTP, the precursor of serotonin naturally present in intestines that has multiple advantages for serotonin synthesis. Therefore by ingesting tea, a common beverage, patients can get an ample supply of 5-HTP in their intestine and hence an ample supply of serotonin in their brain to fight depression toward a better quality of life without pressure.:::2020
