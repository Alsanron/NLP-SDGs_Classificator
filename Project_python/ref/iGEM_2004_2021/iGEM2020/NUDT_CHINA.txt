NUDT_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Predator Pro: a modularized toolbox for signal-controlled Targeted Protein Degradation:::Exactitude temporal control of protein abundance is critical for the robustness and dynamics of synthetic circuits. While multiple approaches have been developed to manipulate the protein synthesis, few tools have been demonstrated to precisely control untagged protein degradation. Here, we present Predator Pro, a modularized and signal-controllable method for target protein degradation, on the basis of the Predator system we demonstrated in iGEM 2018-19. By rationally reengineer the Trim21 protein, we demonstrated that the interaction between Trim21 and antibody Fc domain can be replaced with other constitutive or inducible protein dimerization pairs. We demonstrated that constitutive DocS-Coh2 interaction or rapamycin-induced FRP-FKBP interaction enabled constitutive or drug-controlled degradation of untagged EGFP protein. As an effective expansion of the current synthetic biological tools for protein abundance control, this system may provide a modularized and convenient platform for controlled protein degradation, which might be applied in fundamental researches and clinical applications.:::2020
