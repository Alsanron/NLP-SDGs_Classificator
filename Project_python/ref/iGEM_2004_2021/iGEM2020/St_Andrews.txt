St_Andrews:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The in-silico design of an environmentally friendly probiotic sunscreen:::The St Andrews iGEM team have used synthetic biology to create a novel skin probiotic which protects against UV radiation. Current sunscreens contain multiple inorganic nanoparticles and UV-absorbing compounds known to enhance the bleaching response of corals, making them more vulnerable to other environmental stressors. Using Nissle E. coli as a chassis, we sought to design a living sunscreen expressing a potent photoprotective compound, shinorine. Our human practices reinforced our belief that the biosafety is integral to the success of our probiotic. We have developed a novel killswitch that uses environmental stimuli to prevent long-term colonisation of both the skin and the environment. We conducted an international survey on attitudes towards sunscreen and genetic engineering, allowing us to better appreciate public consensus on these topics. In-silico modelling served a vital role; we modelled the dynamics of our gene circuit and used these results to predict its evolutionary stability.:::2020
