Nanjing-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PolyP Pro:::There are many problems with synthetic chemical materials, such as the contamination and safety risks in production process. By means of Synthetic Biology, we hope to biosynthesis the inorganic material polyphosphates, which is commonly used in chemistry, with biomolecular proteins in order to obtain a new environmental friendly material, which not only maintains the original function of the biomolecule but also optimize its chemical properties.:::2020
