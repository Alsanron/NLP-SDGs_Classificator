Moscow:::Europe:::Russian Federation:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::HaploSense:::As viruses mutate quickly, different genotypes among one species can develop. For some viral diseases, genotype detection is crucial for successful treatment, and hepatitis C is one of them. Nobel Prize 2020 was awarded for the fight against hepatitis С, a major global health problem that causes cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis C is caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) that has at least six different genotypes. Recombinant variant RF2k/1b is common in Russia, but it is often mistaken for genotype 1 that leads to incorrect treatment. However, a lot of infected people in Russia do not know their HCV genotype because of expensive testing or the impossibility to perform tests in peripheral regions. So, we are developing an easy-to-use portable Cas-based device “HaploSense” to solve this problem. HaploSense can be optimized for genotypes detection of any RNA viruses, including HIV or Sars-CoV-2, and may become a universal detection platform.:::2020
