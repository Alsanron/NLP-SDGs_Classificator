FSU:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SPLASH: Sewage Purification Limiting Antibiotic Spread in Habitats:::Antibiotic resistance is an increasing global emergency. Microorganisms continue to evolve ways to render antibiotic therapies less effective causing 2.8 million infections in the US and 750,000 deaths worldwide each year. In Florida, dolphins are serving as a sentinel species. A longitudinal study on dolphins in the Indian River Lagoon found that 88.2% of bacterial isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic. Resistance to erythromycin was highest among all the bacteria at 91.6%. Antibiotics are entering our environment via animal husbandry and disposal of antibiotics. We've designed an engineered E. coli that expresses EreA and EreB enzymes, which will degrade erythromycin in the secondary portion of wastewater treatment plants and a genetic system that is intended to prevent the engineered cells from escaping. Our project can be implemented in water treatment plants across the world to curb the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance.:::2020
