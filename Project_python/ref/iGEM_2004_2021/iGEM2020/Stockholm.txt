Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), including PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), have been of great concern, due to their toxicity in low concentrations and bioaccumulating properties that lead to alarming concentrations in the ecosystem. Current detection methods, which are performed by analyzing massive amounts of water samples in the lab, cannot properly measure the low levels of POPs nor differentiate between the various iterations that exist. Our project S-POP aims to solve this issue by creating a monitor containing two major parts, a modular E. coli biosensor coupled with a Microbial Fuel Cell. When E. coli is activated by the pollutant a Quorum sensing (QS) molecule is produced. Upregulated by the QS-molecule, engineered Shewanella oneidensis produces an oscillating electrical signal that corresponds to the type and quantity of pollutants in the sample.:::2020
