IISER-Tirupati_India:::Asia:::India:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::In-situ Bioremediation of Antibiotics for Combating Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):::The irresponsible and off-label use of antibiotics in animal husbandry as growth promoters have contributed significantly to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Phage therapy, the current best solution, is also failing due to CRISPR and other innate bacterial defences. To combat antibiotic pollution, we have developed a proof-of-concept model to engineer E. coli harnessing a two-component sulfonamide degrading system that degrades the sulfonamides present in poultry waste below the Predicted No Effect Concentrations, preventing selection for resistant strains. Our system renders the poultry waste antibiotic-free and makes it safe to use as manure. Surface exclusion genes have been integrated into the bacteria to reduce horizontal gene transfer. A user modulated ‘kill switch’ with a DNA degrading mechanism is also engineered to prevent the escape of AMR genes to the environment and ensure biosafety. This proof-of-concept model can be extended for other antibiotics by switching the antibiotic degrading genes involved.:::2020
