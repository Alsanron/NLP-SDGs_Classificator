Besides, patients who undergo enterostomy are confronting social distancing because of the acrid smell released from the stoma on their bellies. To solve the problems above, We genetically engineered probiotic Escherichia coli to decrease the production of main molecules that contribute to intestinal acrid smell (ammonia and hydrogen sulfide) and produce an aroma substance (myrcene). We mutate argA into argAfbr and knockout argR to enhance the conversion of ammonia into arginine, create several mutants of cysE gene to promote the conversion of hydrogen sulfide into cysteine, and construct a three-plasmids-system to produce myrcene. The result shows we significantly improved e.coli's ammonia production and cysteine synthesis; myrcene was produced successfully in relatively low production. For human practices, we did a series of activities (survey, expert visits, collaboration, exhibitions, lectures, etc) to improve our product design and promote the education of synthetics biology.:::2020
