UCL:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PETZAP: Integrating enzymatic PET degradation into Microbial Desalination Cell technology:::The worldâ€™s oceans are suffocating from an annual addition of 8 million tons of plastic which threaten marine ecosystems and exacerbate water scarcity affecting over 2 billion lives. Our project aims to tackle these two global challenges by integrating enzymatic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degradation into a Microbial Desalination Cell (MDC). The system involves a 2-step process co-culturing engineered E. coli to express a PETase-MHETase fusion degrading PET and P. putida to achieve further degradation and produce lactate, which then supports the biofilm growth of exoelectrogen, S. oneidensis, generating bioelectricity for desalination. Desalination efficiency was maximised by optimising lactate secretion, co-culture design, and MDC configuration based on the results from flux balance analysis (FBA) and agent-based model, simulating bacterial plastic degradation and bioelectricity production, respectively. Insights for further technical optimisation and feasible implementation at large scales were obtained through iterative engagement with experts and stakeholders.:::2020
