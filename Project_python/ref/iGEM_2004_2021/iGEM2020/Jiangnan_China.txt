Jiangnan_China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Sophorolipid: Biosynthesis of fine-tuned acid/ lactone ratio in Starmerella bombicola based on CRISPR/Cas9:::Cyanobacteria blooms have gradually evolved into a global problem of water pollution. Sophorolipid, an eco-friendly biosurfactant, can degrade cyanobacteria effectively. Acid sophorolipids have better surfactant activity and lactone sophorolipids have better bacteriostatic effect. However, the sophorolipids produced by wild-type Starmerella bombicola are random mix of these two types. To obtain the higher yield of sophorolipid and combine the advantages of these two types, Jiangnan_China constructed a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system in Starmerella bombicola to over-express UDP-glucosyltransferase B (UGTB) and adjust the lactonase (SBLE) expression level by using different promoters. Finally, a recombinant strain consistent with our expectation was constructed and produces sophrolipids with appropriate ratio that achieves the maximum efficiency of degrading cyanobacteria.:::2020
