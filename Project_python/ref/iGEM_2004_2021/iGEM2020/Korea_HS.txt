Korea_HS:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Design and characterization of hyperstable cell-penetrating scFv targeting RAS:::Antibodies are being developed as therapeutic agents. However, the targets of currently used antibodies are restricted to cell surface proteins due to their inability to go into the cell and maintain their function in the reducing environment of the cell. We have chosen a hyperstable single chain variable fragments(scFv(P5)) as a scaffold and this antibody was engineered to recognize human RAS protein by changing residues in the antigen-binding site(scFv(RAS)). We attached cell-penetrating peptide to the N-terminus to develop an antibody that can go into the cell(CPP-scFv(RAS)). We cloned, expressed, purified, and tested if CPP-scFv(RAS) works as designed. The development of antibodies that can work inside the cell will dramatically broaden the range of target molecules and the diseases that can be treated with therapeutic antibodies.:::2020
