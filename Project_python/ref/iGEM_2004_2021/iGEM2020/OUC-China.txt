OUC-China:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Logitch: Logic Gates and RNA Switch:::In the future, more work must be done by computer, such as detecting virus and monitoring health in vivo. Such a function can only be achieved by biological computer working in wet environment, which plays an important role that traditional computer cannot replace. Since the basic function unit of electronic computer is implemented through logic gates, we incorporated a series of logic gates which were built by toehold and 3WJ repressor, and supplemented current lack of types with our own design. We also built more complex multi-input logic gates using basic logic gates. In order to show the wide application prospect of these logic gates, we used them in the construction of adder and subtractor, as well as virus detection. Biocomputer may have various possibilities in the next few years, and we hope our project can have some impact on its development.:::2020
