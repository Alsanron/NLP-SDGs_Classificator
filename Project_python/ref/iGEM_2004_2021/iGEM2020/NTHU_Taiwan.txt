NTHU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioSquad:::Quantum dots are zero-dimensional tiny speck of material effectively concentrated into a single point known as artificial atoms which can revolutionize everything ranging from home lights and computer displays to solar cells and biological warfare detectors. Our Team NTHU_Taiwan design a concept for biosynthesis of quantum dots utilizing industrial heavy metal containing wastewater. Hereby we hypothesized to gain multiple benefits from single project. We first aimed of bio-synthesizing quantum dots using E-coli. Secondly, we planned to use cadmium rich industrial wastewater as a source of metal ions. Under normal conditions bacteria itself cannot manage efficient internalization of metals which might leads to cellular oxidative stress and bacterial death. So, we used gene editing techniques and promoter genes to control internalization of cadmium ion and production of cadmium sulfide quantum dots. We are successful on genetically modifying E coli, to seek highly efficient productivity of QDs.:::2020
