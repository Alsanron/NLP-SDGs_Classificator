DTU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RESHAPE: Tuning morphology and secretion in Aspergillus niger for improved industrial applications:::Every week, almost 6 billion people use products made with the aid of fungal cell factories. Many of these fungi stem from the Aspergillus genus. We aim to improve the production efficiency of Aspergillus niger by creating a synthetic biology toolbox that focuses on mycelial morphology and secretion. Morphology has a significant effect on productivity of certain compounds, while proper secretion is important for later recovery and purification of a compound. We have approached our goal in three ways: 1) Characterising morphological changes of A. niger by engineering seven morphology related genes. 2) Establishing a computational model of mycelium growth based on imaging data. 3) Developing a library of native and synthetic signal peptides for protein secretion. By improving the efficiency of bio-based production processes, we can improve the economic incentive to use them, and decrease our heavy reliance on oil-based substrates in the chemical industry.:::2020
