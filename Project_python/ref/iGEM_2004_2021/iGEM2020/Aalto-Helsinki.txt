Aalto-Helsinki:::Europe:::Finland:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SINISENS - A step towards cleaner waters:::The presence of macrolide antibiotics in nature is a growing concern as they have been on the 'watch-list' of pharmaceuticals for EU-wide monitoring in aquatic environments for several years. They can be harmful for the environment and human health because they are persistent and can remain biologically active. Additionally, they may promote the development of antimicrobial resistance. According to various experts, there will likely be regulations regarding the monitoring of macrolide antibiotics in the near future. However, current methods for measuring them are time-consuming, expensive and require expertise. Our solution, SINISENS, is designed to aid wastewater treatment plants to monitor the concentrations of macrolide antibiotics and could be used to optimize the removal process. SINISENS is an optical on-site biosensor based on a genetic circuit that utilises a transcription factor called MphR to detect macrolide antibiotics. In the presence of these compounds, SINISENS produces green fluorescence as an output signal.:::2020
