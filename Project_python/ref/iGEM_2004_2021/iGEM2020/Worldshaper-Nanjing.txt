Therefore, these grains attracted much attention as the fermentation substrate. Meanwhile, the biodiesel attracted increasing attention as a promising biofuel to replace fossil diesel for the last two decades. In this work, Yarrowia lipolytica has been selected as the model host for biodiesel production. Taking into account the disability to degrade the raw starch of Y. lipolytica, we separately express heterologous alphaâ€‘amylase and glucoamylase enzymes in it. The results showed that the strains expressing glucoamylase were able to grow on starch as the sole carbon source. By optimizing the C/N=100, the total lipid content increases up to 21 % of DCW, which sets up the basis for further studies. In the future, we aim to provide a practical, economical, and environment-friendly method to treat substandard grains and produce biodiesel.:::2020
