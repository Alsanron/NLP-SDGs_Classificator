CSMU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::miRNA.docâ€”a novel detection method for oral cancer:::The mortality rate of oral cancer is ranked fifth out of all cancers in Taiwan. The most common way to diagnose the disease is visual examination. However, this method frequently results in false-negative outcomes. We aim to develop a simple and systematic approach to assist doctors in diagnosing and treating oral cancers in the early stage, ultimately decreasing the mortality rate of the disease. We chose the miRNAs present in the patient's saliva as our biomarker. When they bind to our designed toehold switches, the loop on the toehold unwinds and translates the enzyme, invertase, which can break down sucrose into glucose. The amount of glucose can be measured by a glucometer, and doctors can use the measured data to assist diagnosis of oral cancer. Our project not only helps doctors with the diagnosis but also increases patients' survival rate and their life quality.:::2020
