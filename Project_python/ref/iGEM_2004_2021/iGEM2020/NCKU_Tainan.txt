NCKU_Tainan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Eye kNOw: Envisioning the future of glaucoma treatment:::Glaucoma is characterized by progressive loss of visual field without any early symptoms. A leading cause of irreversible blindness, glaucoma affects millions of people worldwide and causes heavy burden on healthcare systems. The only proven effective treatment is reducing the patientsâ€™ intraocular pressure (IOP), which is usually done by providing eyedrops with IOP-lowering effect, like nitric oxide. However, due to ineffective IOP management and warning strategies, blindness is still a problem. Therefore, iGEM NCKU-Tainan developed a revolutionary solution, Eye kNOw, a pair of contact lenses that contains engineered bacteria producing nitric oxide in response to IOP fluctuation. We also developed Eye Screen, an affordable and portable detection device that utilizes ultrasound to measure IOP and identify the high-risk groups. With Eye kNOw and Eye Screen, IOP can be controlled in a real-time manner, and glaucoma can be detected and monitored with a low-cost device, saving more people from life-long darkness.:::2020
