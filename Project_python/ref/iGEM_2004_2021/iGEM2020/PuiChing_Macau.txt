To solve this problem, we here developed Eco-friendly and harmless flame retardant E. coli. While previous iGEM teams and research groups attempted to produce flame retardant proteins, the proteins they produced cannot retain on the surfaces of objects and can be washed away easily, precluding the application of these proteins. To address the problem, we engineered E. coli to produce flame retardant proteins (SR or casein) fused with surface adhering proteins (cellulose binding domain or mussel adhesive proteins). Thereby, we improved previous iGEM flame retardant systems, which contain only flame retardant proteins. We here proved the protein expression, fire retardancy and sustainability of our flame retardant systems, matching our previous modelling results. Additionally, we also engineered an easy-to-make vertical burning test, helping us and future iGEM teams to test flame retardants.:::2020
