IISER-Pune-India:::Asia:::India:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Anopheles: The Half-Blood Princess:::The WHO estimated that 228 million people contracted Malaria globally and 405,000 people died from it in 2018. Our project aims to develop a library of inhibitory peptide drugs against certain essential human parasite protein interactions; resistance to current antimalarial therapeutics is on the rise. We intend to use cyclotides as stable protein scaffolds for these peptides. Using in-silico modelling, our dry lab team has designed short peptides that will potentially inhibit the protein interactions crucial for the invasion and survival of malaria parasites inside a human host. Our wet lab team has designed various experiments to clone and express the interacting host and parasite proteins, characterize the drug and reduce the toxicity of the grafted cyclotides. To address issues related to poor diagnostics, we have developed a diagnostic tool using convolutional neural networks which will be able to identify patients with malaria based on images of their blood smears.:::2020
