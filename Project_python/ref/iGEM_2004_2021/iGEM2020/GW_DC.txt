GW_DC:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BactoLEAD the Way to Cleaner Water:::Lead is a heavy metal that can contaminate potable water through lead pipes, solder, paint, and household fixtures. This potentially fatal heavy metal is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissue and bones, leading to neurological disorders. In 2017, exposure to lead caused one million deaths worldwide. Current water filtration solutions are effective; however, they are not affordable, sustainable, or renewable. Our team is genetically engineering a bacteria that naturally filters lead to have biosensing properties, allowing easy detection of lead ion levels in solution by monitoring lead operon activation for lead filtration. The modified bacteria will express fluorescent proteins that allow us to visually monitor lead ion concentration sustainably and affordably. Our goal is to provide a user-friendly, accessible lead detection and filtration device to ensure safe drinking water globally.:::2020
