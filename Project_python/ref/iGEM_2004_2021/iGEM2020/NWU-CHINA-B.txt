However, the poor water solubility limits its application. Two UDP glycosyltransferases were obtained by constructing recombinant engineering bacteria to catalyze the synthesis of the derivatives of kaophenol, astragalin and kaophenol-3-glucose-7-oxygen-rhamnoside. The differences of water-soluble and anti-inflammatory properties between the two derivatives and kaempferol were compared, and the optimal conditions of enzymatic reaction were found through modeling.:::2020
