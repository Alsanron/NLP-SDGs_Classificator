Compared to traditional remediation practices, bioremediation is cheaper and more sustainable. First, we are creating a biosensor that will easily detect and measure environmental levels of benzene and catechol through a fluorescent protein expression system. Next, our project will identify and isolate the benABCDE gene cluster (benzene transport and degradation genes) from specialized bacteria that naturally import benzene into their cells and break it down into energy intermediates for growth in contaminated environments. Following this, we will insert these genes into a plasmid cloning vector and transform the model laboratory species Escherichia coli into a practically useful benzene degrader to clean up polluted sites on land and in water.:::2020
