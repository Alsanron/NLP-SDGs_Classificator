Cornell:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Lumicure:::This year, Cornell iGEM aims to design a bacteriotherapy treatment and tracking system for cancerous malignant tumors. This system aims to take advantage of the fact that cancerous tumors have an immunoprivileged microenvironment and that malignancies migrate through the bloodstream to other parts of the body. To our bacteria, we will introduce genetic constructs coding for a therapeutic: trichosanthin. We have designed a lactate-inducible toxin-antitoxin system (GhoS/GhoT) which ensures the E. coli do not survive outside of the high-lactate environment of the tumor. These E. coli cells will also be engineered to constitutively express mCardinal, a fluorescent protein, detectable by our fluorescence detection system. This detection system will consist mainly of: an excitation filter and emission filter, a dichroic mirror, a laser, and a raspberry pi microcontroller. We hope that we can effectively demonstrate a proof-of-concept for this treatment system in treating real cancerous tumors later on down the line.:::2020
