IISER_Berhampur:::Asia:::India:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::FRaPPe: A FRET based Ranker for Proteins and Peptides:::FRaPPe by team iGEM IISER Berhampur, is a reporter system which aims to validate efficiency of therapeutics targeting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). This reporter, assembled with mammalian promoters, modulatory domains (Chemically Induced Dimerization modules), fluorescence tags (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer modules) and the coding sequences of proteins of interest will be developed in E. coli and transfected into Human Embryonic Kidney cells. This tool will enable modulation of the extent of PPIs and their quantification via fluorescence readout, offering possibilities for a high-throughput screening system for drug efficiency in attenuating these interactions in vitro.The utility of FRaPPe will be demonstrated using interference peptides that will disrupt the Dengue Virus Non-Structural Protein and host STAT2 interaction thus modulating the host interferon signalling pathway. We propose FRaPPe as a one-stop solution for studying host-viral PPIs and also a tool to screen inhibitors of these interactions against several viral diseases.:::2020
