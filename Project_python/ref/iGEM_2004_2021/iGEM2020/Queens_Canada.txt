Queens_Canada:::North America:::Canada:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Velcrion - A transdermal biosensor to detect critical metabolites in chronic kidney disease.:::Team Queens_Canada will be designing a novel transdermal biosensor for point-of-care diagnostic quantification of phosphate, potassium, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Knowledge of the concentration of these analytes is critical for guiding effective treatments and improving patient outcomes. We will generate genetically encoded Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensors by fusing the N- and C-termini of phosphate-binding protein (PBP), potassium-binding protein (KBP), PTH 1 receptor (PTH1R), and α-Klotho to fluorescent proteins (FPs). To quantify physiologically relevant levels of phosphate, potassium, PTH and FGF23, highly optimized mNeonGreen and mCherry will be used as the FPs. Site-directed mutagenesis will be employed on protein-fluorophore constructs to add a Cysteine residue, to which a glutamate (E)/ lysine (K) coiled-coil system will be added to immobilize the construct onto a microfluidic surface. Through frequent monitoring and early disease detection, we hope to revolutionize CKD diagnostics.:::2020
