Chalmers-Gothenburg:::Europe:::Sweden:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::No Time to Waste:::Generating 70 million tonnes of textile waste each year, the fashion industry oftentimes goes unmentioned in the climate debates. Yet, the great environmental problem posed by the fashion persists and is further aggravated by the inclusion of synthetic textile blends, which renders a large portion of garments un-recyclable. Our teamsâ€™ attempt at tackling this problem focuses on the addition of the synthetic fibre elastane to garments, an addition that makes fibre separation a difficult process, and as such, poses a large problem for recycling. By including nine different enzymes to the bacteria E. Coli, our team attempted to create an enzymatic system capable of degrading the elastane fibre through biological means, effectively providing a biological solution to an environmental problem. A large part of our project has also been to communicate this large waste impact of the fashion industry, and to show that we really have No Time to Waste.:::2020
