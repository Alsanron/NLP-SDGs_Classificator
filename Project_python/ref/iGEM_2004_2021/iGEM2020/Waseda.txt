Waseda:::Asia:::Japan:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Zombie vs Samurai -Strategic struggle in cell-free systems-:::Cell-free systems are a flexible, quick, and powerful tool in synthetic biology that enables us to conduct back and forth the lab experiments and modeling. In order to continue our project under restricted lab access by COVID-19, We conducted projects (modeling and wet experiment, education, entrepreneurship) with cell-free systems.  The modeling is based on the struggle between Zombie and Samurai. Zombies attack humans and turn them into zombies. On the contrary, humans help zombies and return them to humans.ã€€In modeling, completion of the system was achieved by adapting the quorum sensing systems. We have confirmed working quorum sensing systems in the cell-free system.  It's important to know the smell to distinguish between Zombie and Samurai. We have created multiple monoterpene (Limonene, Sabinene) from glucose in cell-free systems. Finally, we are attempting to make gene circuit of model of these story.:::2020
