MSP-Maastricht:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MSP-Maastricht combating the OPC invasive species with Oak Shield, a biological pesticide:::In the past few decades, the Oak Processionary Caterpillar (OPC) has spread towards Northern parts of Europe, far from its natural southern predators. This invasive species is noxious for oaks trees but also dangerous for animals and humans due to its toxic bristle. Therefore, this yearâ€™s MSP-Maastricht iGEM team has decided to join the fight against the OPC. Our aim is to provide an eco-friendly pesticide - Oak Shield - specifically targeting the caterpillar as current pesticides harm other insects. We identified potential target sequences unique to the OPC genome and planned to modify bacteria to make them produce interfering RNA complementary to those sequences. Algorithms allowed us to estimate the decrease in population. Prior to Oak Shield we started Geneducation, a YouTube channel focusing on the popularization of syn-bio and genetic engineering. Additionally, we launched a proceedings journal for iGEM teams, containing peer-reviewed articles from more than 30 teams!:::2020
