SCU-WestChina:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Lung Knight- Recombinant protein carried by liposomes for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis:::There are more than 3 million people worldwide suffering from pulmonary fibrosis. However, the price of the mainstream therapy whose curative effect and targeting ability is poor, is too high to afford for most patients. Based on this fact, we offer an entirely new treatment: TGF-beta II truncated receptor was fused with collagen-targeted peptides to construct recombinant protein drugs. The recombinant protein was embedded in liposomes to construct the molecular drug delivery system. The patients are given the drug into the lungs by inhaling it through an atomizer. We have proved this product is effective anti-fibrosis drug through three-stage experiments. This product has the following advantages: 1. Directly block the worsening signal and significantly slow down the process of pulmonary fibrosis. 2. Accurately target the lesions with little side effect 3. Accurate liposome delivery, which is gentle and efficient. 4. Makes it convenient for patients to get treatment by themselves.:::2020
