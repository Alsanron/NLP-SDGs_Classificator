BOKU-Vienna:::Europe:::Austria:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Phangel – Taking Phage Therapy Ahead:::Our vision is to alleviate bacterial infections and their systemic consequences by not only eliminating hostile bacteria but also, in a second step, capturing their toxic components released during bacterial lysis. Our goal is to recombinantly engineer a T7 bacteriophage that by infection forces its target bacterium to produce gelsolin, a protein able to bind the endotoxin LPS. Firstly, we designed our experiments in silico to contribute our parts to the iGEM registry. We then cloned the plasmids containing the recombination system necessary for engineering our phage. The genes to be inserted into the phage genome were amplified. Additionally, we designed a safety measure to inhibit the engineered phage’s ability to reproduce autonomously. To support our experimental findings we modelled the interaction between T7 bacteriophages and E.coli. Furthermore, to gain more insight into the biology of the T7 bacteriophage, we collaborated with team TU Delft to characterize the wildtype.:::2020
