Purdue:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Microfluidic Argonaute Mediated COVID-19 Point of Care Diagnostic Device.:::The COVID-19 pandemic has strained global diagnostic capacities and highlighted the limitations of conventional lab-based assays, which can take between 1-14 days to receive conclusive results. Current on-site kits have false-negative rates as high as 33%. In an effort to provide accurate, non-invasive, affordable, and rapid Point of Care(POC) diagnostic tests for COVID-19 and other emerging pandemics, Purdue iGEM is developing cArgo: a COVID-19 Argonaute mediated microfluidic diagnostic device. cArgo extracts viral RNA from saliva for amplification and conversion into dsDNA. TtAgo that we will express and purify from e.coli then cleaves the dsDNA using COVID-19 DNA guides producing ssDNA fragments. These fragments hybridize to molecular beacons emitting a quantifiable fluorescent signal for conclusive result determination. Coupling the biologics with chip barcoding and app integration, we hope to revolutionize POC Diagnostics while making data more accessible for simultaneous detection and contact tracing.:::2020
