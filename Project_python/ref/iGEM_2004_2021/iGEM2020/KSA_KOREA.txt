KSA_KOREA:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Ligninatior: Biological Lignin Degradation Method for Paper Recycling:::Production of high-quality recycled paper through biodegradation of lignin can decrease chemical byproducts and wastewater generated by existing paper production processes to significant environmental and economic benefit. Treating box paper and newspaper with laccase and dye decolorizing peroxidase (DyP) during the recycling process produced paper with improved brightness, texture, and permanence. The results demonstrate that synthetic biology can be used to produce recycled paper in a more environmentally friendly manner compared to chemical treatments used to produce recycled paper today. In addition, we have developed a biosensor and fluorometer pair to detect and measure phenolic compounds that are produced when lignin is dissolved. The pair can be used to monitor progress of lignin degradation in the paper recycling process and detect phenolic compounds in the environment. By expressing transporter of phenolic compounds in E.Coli, we have been able to obtain improved sensitivity compared to existing biosensors.:::2020
