Manchester:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::HippoSol â€“ The sunscreen for the future:::Regular unprotected exposure to the sun can result in multiple skin disorders, including skin cancer. Skin cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer in the UK, yet 60% of cases are preventable. Sunscreens are therefore important to use, but when used while swimming in the sea, conventional sunscreen ingredients cause oxidative stress on coral reefs, resulting in serious coral bleaching. Our team aims to produce a novel non-toxic, bactericidal, mammal-derived broad-spectrum UV filter to address this problem. Our target compound polymerises naturally into an unreactive molecule minimising environmental effects. Our goal is to produce the novel sunscreen in bacteria, as a reef-safe alternative to commercially available sunscreens. We use innovative retrosynthesis methods to design a biosynthetic pathway to our target compound and utilise techniques like entrepreneurship, stakeholder engagement, and media analysis to ensure that our product meets an urgent real-world need in a safe and responsible way.:::2020
