Paris_Bettencourt:::Europe:::France:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SynDerma : a foundational advance toward synthetic dermatology:::In SynDerma we envisioned therapeutics being administered by engineered microbes integrated into the skin microbiome. First, to understand the perturbaility of the skin microbiome by individual habits such as hygiene, social interaction and exercise, which are all affected by this current unprecedented context of COVID-19 pandemia, we developed a community science project called Quaranskin. In Quaranskin we developed an at-home sampling kit, protocol and survey, where participants swabbed four body sites for metagenomic analysis. We correlated the diversity and composition of these collected microbiome data to behaviours noted in the surveys to uncover any trends. In parallel, we chose the skin commensal microbe Staphylococcus epidermidis to be a chassis for our future vision of microbial therapeutics enabled by synthetic biology. In projects EpiFlex, EpiGlow, and EpiGrow, we built a MoClo kit, expressed fluorescent proteins as a proof of concept, and optimised growth conditions, respectively.:::2020
