KU_ISTANBUL:::Europe:::Turkey:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Living Laser: Transforming Cells into Lasers:::Systems approach in many domains of biological sciences requires large amounts of imaging data across different length and time scales. To step up into high throughput screening methods required for diagnostics and basic research purposes, multiplexed labeling, uniquely tagging, and tracking individual cells, and increasing the penetration depth of light into tissues are demanded. In order to meet these necessities, here we are demonstrating the living laser which is a morphosis of cells into lasers by building natural resonators on the surface of cells using novel gene circuits. We will be exploring the stability, feasibility, and practicality of these biological lasers in four main application domains: picking quality oocytes for IVF, tracking cancer cells over long periods of time, sensing internal and external changes of cells and creating a novel technique for characterization of cells and tissues.:::2020
