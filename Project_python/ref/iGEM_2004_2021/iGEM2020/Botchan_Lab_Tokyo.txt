Botchan_Lab_Tokyo:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::nico-friendly:::About 4.5 trillion cigarette butts are deposited somewhere in the environment every year. Out of the waste collected by coastal cleanups every year, cigarette butts comprise the largest percentage of this, which account for approximately 19 - 38 % of total waste products by count. Nicotine from cigarette butts negatively affect marine environment. Pseudomonas putida S16 can metabolite nicotine. We are planning to introduce this pathway into Escherichia coli. We expect that Escherichia coli gets ability to degrade nicotine. Through the pathway, nicotine is changed to 2,5-dihydroxypyridine. 2,5-dihydroxypyridine is a precursor of 5-aminolevulinic acid which is the main material of fertilizer and pharmaceuticals. We hope that our project helps stop littering cigarettes. And we hope that living things are more safely and peacefully.:::2020
