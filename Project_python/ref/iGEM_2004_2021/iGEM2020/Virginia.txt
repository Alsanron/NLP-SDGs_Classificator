Virginia:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Manifold: Protein Shells with Encapsulated DNA Scaffolds for Increasing Efficiency of Biosynthetic Pathways:::The lack of a versatile and reliable way to improve metabolic flux channeling, pathway orthogonality, and product yields is a major impediment to the expanded utilization of biosynthesis for the production of drugs and industrially valuable chemicals. Manifold, a platform technology that addresses this problem, consists of bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) with encapsulated dsDNA scaffolds that sequester and spatially organize, at fixed concentrations, biosynthetic enzymes presented as zinc-finger fusion proteins. Here we deliver the designs for an E. coli cell capable of synthesizing resveratrol using the Manifold platform. The Manifold platform will help lower costs and expand the applications of chemical biosynthesis.:::2020
