UCSC:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Komaplastics: Creating a biodegradable bed mulch from bacterial cellulose:::Plastic bed mulch films are an essential agricultural tool; they limit fumigant emissions, provide UV and water resistance, prevent weed and pest growth, and maximize crop yield. However, current disposal methods are unsustainable; the majority of bed mulches are dumped into landfills, degrade into harmful chemicals, and pollute local communities. Komaplastics will lay the foundation for creation of a biodegradable bed mulch from bacterial cellulose (BC) produced by Komagataeibacter rhaeticus. BC is highly crystalline due to hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups of adjacent strands which is a barrier to homogenous incorporation of plasticizing molecules. Thus, we investigated carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) for their potential to disrupt these hydrogen bonding networks and facilitate addition of plasticizing molecules. We also tested various compounds for their ability to plasticize chemically decrystallized BC. Our work will provide a scaffold for the development of a cellulose-based biodegradable plastic bed mulch film produced in a biological system.:::2020
