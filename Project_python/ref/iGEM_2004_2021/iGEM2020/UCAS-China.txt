UCAS-China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Stomach Homeostasis Establishment for Eluding the Plethora of H. pylori (SHEEP):::On asteroid B612, the little prince was busy pulling up shoots of the baobabs. Because once they had occasionally grown up, their roots could split the entire asteroid into pieces. Fortunately, B612 eventually gets a sheep that eats up the soaring baobab shoots without uprooting them. In this way, the little prince, baobab trees and sheep form a stable ecological balance. This story presents our new ideas on the treatment of H. pylori related diseases. H. pylori has been symbiotic with humans in the stomach for more than 60,000 years. Either its plethora or disappearance inflicts various diseases on human bodies. Complete elimination recommended by current treatment is not satisfying. Thus we proposed "SHEEP" therapy, which introduced engineered L. acidophilus into the stomach to realize the balance of microecology. Aiming for personalized treatment, we obtain data from capsule robotsâ€™ stomach sampling and photographing. The ternary-balanced-relation module is simulated aswell:::2020
