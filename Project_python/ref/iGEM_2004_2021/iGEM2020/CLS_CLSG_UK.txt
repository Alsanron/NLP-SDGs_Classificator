CLS_CLSG_UK:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Project CocEels:::As a school located on the banks of the River Thames in London, we are focussing on the impact of cocaine upon the critically endangered European Eel, Anguilla anguilla. Concentrations of cocaine as low as 30 ng/L have been shown by studies to have detrimental impacts upon their migration and breeding patterns. In addition to this, high drug concentrations have even been detected in drinking water in countries such as Brazil due to lack of effective filtration systems. We aim to solve this problem by using genetically modified E. coli bacteria immobilised in the primary sedimentation tanks of the sewers. We also designed a novel, hypoxia induced toxin-antitoxin kill switch which will destroy our bacteria in the presence of standard anaerobic processes in wastewater treatment plants and hence prevent our bacteria from spreading into the wider ecosystem.:::2020
