Nottingham:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NeuroTone: The microbiome and neurodegeneration:::The University of Nottingham iGEM team have been developing a novel biotherapeutic to delay the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, using synthetic biology. By engineering the bacterium Clostridium sporogenes to secrete the ketone D-Î²-Hydroxybutyrate (DBHB), we achieve neuroprotection by ketone-mediated relief of oxidative stress in the brain. This will occur via delivery of our C.sporogenes spores to the gut, where an established culture will produce DBHB - which enters the blood stream and crosses the blood-brain barrier, utilising the gut-brain axis. Using mathematical modelling, we identified a pathway to favour microbial DBHB production and have investigated how the culture size and metabolic activity could be regulated. Recognising potential concerns regarding genetically modified organisms, we designed strict controls to ensure our biotherapeutic cannot escape into the environment. Through several outreach projects alongside consultations with key stakeholders, we have engaged the wider community to inform and shape our work.:::2020
