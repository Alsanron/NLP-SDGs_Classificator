TAU_Israel:::Asia:::Israel:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::sTAUbility - an innovative approach to increase the genetic stability of heterologous genes:::A key challenge in the field of synthetic biology is genomic instability of introduced genes. Once a gene is inserted into a host organism, it can cause an additional metabolic load, significantly reducing host fitness. Mutations that damage the introduced gene are therefore likely to be selected for, diminishing its expression. These mutations could render synthetic-biology products obsolete and require constant maintenance. We propose interlocking a target gene to the N-terminus of an essential gene in the hostâ€™s genome, under the same promoter. This way, mutations on the target gene are likely to affect the expression of the essential gene, leading to mutated host mortality. We are developing a software called sTAUbility, that would match the best-fitting essential gene and linker to a given target gene, based on bioinformatic models and novel approaches for measuring stability. Furthermore, sTAUbility optimizes the combined construct for efficient gene expression and increased stability.:::2020
