Here, we developed a rapid protocol, in which the presence of Covid-19 S protein is readily detected by genetically engineered Ace2-PmrA-PmrB system. In our work, we recombined the PmrA-PmrB two-component system derived from Salmonella to the surface of E. coli, and replaced the Fe(III) recognition site of PmrB with the core region of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)，which could recognize the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2. Upon recognition, the downstream signal pathways and the reporter gene are activated. Furthermore, an amplifier (Hrp regulatory machinery) and extra cytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factor were used to improve the sensitivity of the biosensor. A TEV protease-based post-translational regulation system to reduce the leakage is also used. In summary, our system shortens the time frame and reduces the cost and lab labors for detection.:::2020
