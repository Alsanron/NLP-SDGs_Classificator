MRIIRS_FARIDABAD:::Asia:::India:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Li-Koff: To Detect and Degrade N-Nitrosamines:::N-Nitrosamines are group of compounds formed from the reaction between nitrites and secondary and tertiary amines. Majority of these compounds are known to be potent carcinogens. They are found in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, processed meats, alcoholic beverages, cigarette smoke, suspended particulate matter (spm) etc. But, their presence in potable water post disinfection stage in water treatment plants is most alarming; as their formation depends upon temperature and pH and not on the precursor molecules forming them. Quantifying them through conventional techniques of LC/MS, GC/MS, HPLC, etc., is time consuming, labour intensive and an costly affair. Hence, li-koff pitches in as an alternate synbio solution for an easy detection and estimation of these compounds in water samples. Further, it also degrades some of these compounds upon detection.:::2020
