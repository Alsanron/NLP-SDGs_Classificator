SJTU-software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RICAID:::China has a miserable memory of suffering poverty and starving. On the other hand, China has been making rapid progress in tackling hunger. Thirty years ago, one in three Chinese people was hungry. Today, less than one in 10 is hungry. No other country has helped so many people out of hunger in such a short period as China. Encouraged by the scientists and their contributions in China, our project will provide a lot of new knowledge of rice genetics and provide a solid theoretical foundation for rice breeding. Our project will be designed to help experimental research of stress-tolerance related to one of Oryza sativa L., commonly named rice. We will set up a database including gene, RNA-seq, protein information, etc. of Oryza sativa and also help to evaluate and tag the undiscovered genes so that we can recommend genes most possibly related to stress-tolerance to researchers.:::2020
