BHSF:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Khronos: The Timer Yeast:::When baking at home, people always have their bread over-fermented due to the of experience and disturbance from other matters. However, fermentation is the most important process in baking. Therefore, we came up with the idea of modifying the genes in auxotroph baking yeast to stop fermentation at appropriate times. We designed a circuit based on toggle switch. Before we add the inducer galactose, the switch is kept at “off” state, where a protein that complements the auxotroph gets to express, after the galactose is added, the switch is turned on by accumulation of the previously repressed gene, the expression of the other gene is then shut down, along with the gene of the complimentary protein, leading to a drop in their concentrations and terminating fermentation over a certain period of time.:::2020
