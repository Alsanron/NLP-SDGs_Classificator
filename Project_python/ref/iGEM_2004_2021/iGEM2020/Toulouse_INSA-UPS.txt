Toulouse_INSA-UPS:::Europe:::France:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::iGEMINI, a coculture for food supplements production in space:::Space exploration drives us further away from Earth and will lead to year-long space travel. Some essential nutrients, such as vitamins, cannot be stored on the spacecraft since they rapidly lose nutritional value over time. iGEMINI aims to supplement astronautsâ€™ food with nutritional and tasty yeast supplement. We designed a quasi-autonomous coculture between the acetogen bacterium Clostridium ljungdahlii and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This system uses minimal resources which are currently considered as waste on spacecraft. As a proof of concept, the yeast has been engineered to produce provitamin A, an essential vitamin for human health. Since astronauts' tastes are altered by physiological changes in their body, we give them the choice to choose their favorite flavors by using optogenetic systems. Our project builds new bridges between space research and microbiology, and multiple efforts have been done to promote space synthetic biology as a truly promising and exciting scientific field.:::2020
