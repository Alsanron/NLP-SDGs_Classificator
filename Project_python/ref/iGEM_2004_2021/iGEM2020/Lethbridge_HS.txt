When food waste enters landfills, there are a variety of environmental consequences. This is due to the copious amounts of greenhouse gases emitted during the production of our food. Additionally, food shipping utilizes cardboard and plastic for shipping, which harms our environment significantly. Although food waste disposal services are available, they release methane and are not economically productive. Furthermore, composting facilities do assist in combating the issue of food waste but are oftentimes not readily available or advertised. While some do have access to home composting, this is an inefficient method of reducing food waste and may attract pests. Therefore, we propose a system that employs an engineered biological catalyst that breaks down food waste in a closed container, keeping animals out and ensuring chemicals do not enter the environment.:::2020
