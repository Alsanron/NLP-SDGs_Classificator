AHUT-ZJU-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::carbonic anhydrase 3.0:::Greenhouse gas emissions lead to a rise in global average temperatures, which will endanger human lives and lives. We decided to use the biomimetic method of enzyme (carbonic anhydrase), which has the advantages of safety, high catalytic efficiency and environment-friendly compared with other methods of capturing and concentrating CO2. We designed an efficient and stable CA by improving the catalytic performance of CA from thermophilic bacteria and the biological stability of capturing CO2. We use computer-aided analysis software to predict the ideal mutation site of the protein. Then we carried out enzyme-substrate molecular docking and enzyme-solvent kinetics simulation, constructed wild-type and mutant CA prokaryotic expression vectors, and expressed and purified the protein. Finally, we carried out functional identification to determine whether the activity of the mutant protein changed and whether the thermal stability was significantly improved.:::2020
