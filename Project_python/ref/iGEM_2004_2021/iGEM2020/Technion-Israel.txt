Technion-Israel:::Asia:::Israel:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ACT. Anti-COVID-19 Technology: A hydrogel-based skin-screen containing proteins that act as “decoy proteins":::It is now known that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells through binding between its spike proteins ("S") and the ACE2 membranal proteins that are found on our cells. Hence, by occupying these "S", infection of the host cells could be drastically reduced or completely blocked. To achieve our goal, we developed a novel hydrogel-based skin-screen containing "decoy proteins" particles that reduce the virus's ability to infect. Our product will be effective for hours, won’t damage the skin’s microbiome and will be easily removed with water. To capture the "S", we’ll use a mutated ACE2 (engineered for stronger linkage), and/or Sybodies (synthetic single-domain nanobodies) with the full antigen-binding capacity specifically to those "S". We have two delivery directions for both proteins: Microgel beads that strongly bind His-tagged proteins, and B.subtilis spore surface display technique. ACT. provides an active prophylactic solution that ensures further hurdles for the viral infection, thus flattening the curve.:::2020
