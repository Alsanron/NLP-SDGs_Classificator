KEYSTONE:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::B.B.Bin:::The aim of our project is to address PET plastic recycling coverage flaws as well as improving the tourists’ experiences through fragrance in natural tourist areas. It will incorporate elements that will educate the public about the importance of plastic degradation and environmental protection. The accomplishment of the our iGEM project this year has two main sectors-- the experiments, which includes the fragrance and plastic degradation, and the hardware. The first experiment was used to insert leaf compost cutinase genes into the E. coli and optimize conditions for translation of the LCC enzyme as well as the conditions for degradation of the PET plastic. Another experiment was inserting the geraniol synthase and linalool synthase gene to produce the linalool fragrance. The mechanical trash can that we designed will assemble these synthetic biology part to degrade plastic. It is comprised of three parts— the shredder, the power source, and the decomposer.:::2020
