OSA:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::metZyme: A DNAzyme-based Heavy Metal Ion Detection Kit:::High-density metals like lead and mercury, also known as heavy metals, have severely harmed the environment and our bodies. Every year heavy metal exposure results in millions of disabilities worldwide. Surprisedly, previous detecting methods for this urgent issue either require bulky instruments or professional technicians. Thus, it is imminent for us to devise a cheap, portable, accessible, accurate detection kit. We use DNAzyme, which can cleave ssDNA when combined with Zn2+, Mn2+, Pb2+. Cu2+. To maximize outputs, four amplification systems (HTDC, Toehold Switch, TO-DNA, and CRISPR-Cas12a) are also used. While we test these theories in lab, our human practice team interviews experts and discovers such a kit is not only needed for water detection but also for soil, which becomes the new focus of our project. We have achieved fluorescence and lateral flow detection of heavy metal ions which contribute to alleviating this severe environmental issue worldwide.:::2020
