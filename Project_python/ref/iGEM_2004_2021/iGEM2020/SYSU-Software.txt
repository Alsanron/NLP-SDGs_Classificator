SYSU-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Maloadis (Machine Learning based Optimization and automated Design Platform with Image Search):::Synthetic biologists lack an integrated circuit design platform featuring DBTL (design, build, test, and learn) workflow. Many steps in the design can be automated to enhance efficiency and smooth their work. Besides, the massive data of genetic circuits and parts are not fully utilized. To address these problems, we create Maloadis, an integrated automated genetic circuit design platform. Maloadis implement automated top-down design with GeneNet algorithm, and is capable of designing and rating possible genetic circuits according to usersâ€™ requirements. It also exploits the abundant information provided by genetic circuit images by extracting parts and structures from them to search for related previous work through trained neuro network. To improve success rate in wet-lab experiment, Maloadis predicts gene expression level with integrated models, and offers suggestions to shorten experiment cycle using Bayesian Optimization algorithm. We present Maloadis as a de novo approach to facilitate synthetic biology design automation.:::2020
