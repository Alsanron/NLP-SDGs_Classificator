DNHS_SanDiego_CA:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::PreeclampsiRNA: Degrading sFlt1-14 mRNA with shRNA via lentiviral vectors to treat preeclampsia:::Preeclampsia is a dangerous condition, characterized by high blood pressure during pregnancy. It affects many pregnancies globally, and although most women survive preeclampsia, untreated it can lead to severe complications, and even death. Despite extensive research, there is, unfortunately, no reliable treatment for preeclampsia. The goal of this project is to produce an effective theoretical siRNA treatment, PreeclampsiRNA, using recombinant lentiviral vectors to carry and deliver shRNA to the trophoblast to inhibit the translation of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt1-14), an antiangiogenic pseudo-receptor that captures placental growth factor (PlGF) and prevents it from binding the proper receptor, which would signal for angiogenesis. We would test several different shRNA sequences to see which causes the most effective reduction of sFlt1-14. By degrading the mRNA of sFlt1-14 using siRNA, we aim to reduce the placental levels of this molecule (which is overproduced in preeclamptic patients, leading to hypertension) and thus alleviate symptoms.:::2020
