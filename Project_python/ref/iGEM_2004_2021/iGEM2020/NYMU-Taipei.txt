NYMU-Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Off the crown:::Due to the serious pandemic of COVID-19, this year, iGEM NYMU-Taipei 2020 tries hard to tackle the problem in a much more elementary approach. By utilizing the nature of strong binding interactions between hACE2 and the spike of SARS-CoV-2, we deeply believe that we would be able to reap the benefits of viral evolution. In order to achieve our goals, we engineered a protein construct that includes the hACE2 receptor binding domain, a linker, and a protease that is specific at cleaving spike proteins. The protein construct functions as a capture device and can be implemented on many occasions, such as masks, contact lenses, and even filtration devices, as a mean to capture, destroy, and even quantify the amount of virus particles on a particular surface, so as to reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 and, moreover, decline the possibility of infection on human beings.:::2020
