UNILausanne:::Europe:::Switzerland:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::B.O.T: Bacterial Oscillation Therapy:::Colorectal cancer incidence has heavily increased over past decades, notably in more-developed regions. It is now the third-most common cancer worldwide. Recovery still relies heavily on standard chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. A promising new approach in cancer treatment is chronotherapy. By administering drugs according the circadian rhythm, chronotherapy aims at maximizing efficacy and minimizing side effects. For our project, we introduced a synthetic circuit producing oscillations into E. coli Nissle 1917, a tumour-targeting probiotic strain of E. coli, to explore the potential benefits of chronotherapy. The final engineered strain delivers azurin, an anti-cancer peptide in an periodic manner. In the interest of biosafety, we also built a kill-switch to be incorporated into the final design.:::2020
