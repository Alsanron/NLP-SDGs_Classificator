SCU-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RNAlphABA:::Late spring cold (LSC) is a common climatic phenomenon in many areas of the world, which refers to the sudden appearance of continuous low temperature after the weather warms up in middle of spring. Every year, LSC causes huge agricultural and economic losses through freezing the bud of crops. Currently, spraying abscisic acid (ABA) is the main way to deal with LSC. However, chemically synthesized ABA usually contains by-products and toxic waste, while purified ABA is expensive. Therefore, we hope to give a new application to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, so that it can synthesize ABA before the onset of LSC, and develop a software to predict degree of LSC. In addition, in order to solve the deficiency of eukaryotes' monocistronic gene expression system in the field of exogenous product biosynthesis, we develop a new application of the CRISPR-Csy4 system in the construction of eukaryotic multicistronic exogenous gene expression system.:::2020
