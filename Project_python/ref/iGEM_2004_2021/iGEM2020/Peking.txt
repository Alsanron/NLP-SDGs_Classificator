Peking:::Asia:::China:::Open:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Music Updating by Storage and Editing:::As a high-capacity, high-density storage medium, DNA has attracted the interest of many scientists. Based on the function of DNA to store information, using gene editing methods to change the information stored in DNA has great operability. In our project, music information is stored in plasmid DNA of E. coli with designed coding rules, and gene editing technology is used for artificial mutation. This is also brought out with in silico experiment. Through the scoring rules based on music theory and references, the mutated music information is screened, and music pieces with certain value are obtained, to achieve music evolution. At the same time, we have also used similar principles and methods to store and evolve video information. Together, this is a biological process of artistic creation, we hope to give an example of bio-art creation and inspire more artists to create in this interesting way.:::2020
