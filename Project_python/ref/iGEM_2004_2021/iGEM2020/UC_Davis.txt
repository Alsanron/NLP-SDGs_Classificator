UC_Davis:::North America:::United States:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Expanding the gene regulatory toolkit in filamentous fungi through bioinformatics-directed genome mining.:::We developed computational tools to identify potential filamentous fungal transcription factors and their cognate binding sites to expand the available parts list for these organisms. Our tools enable a comparative genomic approach to mine more than 600 fungal genomes for transcription factors associated with Biosynthetic Gene Clusters and motif finding algorithms to identify their putative binding sites. We have designed the tools weâ€™ll need to validate these constructs experimentally which will create a library of transcription factor-binding site pairs.:::2020
