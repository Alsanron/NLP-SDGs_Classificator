Recently, various e-pilis were discovered but not suitable for large-scale production due to the severe cultivation conditions and bio-safety concern. This year, LINKS_China designed PICACHU, an E.coli chassis to express different e-pilis. We manufactured a pili-generator consists of 12 genes for pili assembly, expressed three pilins, and created a new measurement to verify the pili production. Furthermore, we renovate the generator and optimize the growth condition of the cells to increase the yield. Ultimately, we transformed the e-pilis product into a nanowire battery and expect it to provide sustainable clean energy. We are aiming to apply PICACHU to track migrant birds, to monitor the wetland, and to trace the trash flowing movement in the ocean. Hopefully, more possibilities of e-pili application will be explored in the future.:::2020
