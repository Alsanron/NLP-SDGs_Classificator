UFlorida:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Aquatic Phosphorus Detection Using SCRIBE:::Team Florida 2020 takes inspiration from their 2019 project to improve and apply the novel biosensor technology that detects and records phosphorous levels to real-world ecological implications. This project couples the Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biological Events (SCRIBE) system with the naturally occurring PhoB-PhoR system in E.coli. In response to phosphorus, SCRIBE utilizes a reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce single stranded DNA which can be incorporated into the host-genome during DNA replication using the Beta Recombinase protein which results in a mutation within the bacterial chromosome. This system can be utilized to measure the amount of phosphorus in a body of water by modeling the fraction of cells that gain the mutation per generation. In the absence of a lab, the UF iGEM team seeks to model this hypothetical biosensor as part one of a two-part project.:::2020
