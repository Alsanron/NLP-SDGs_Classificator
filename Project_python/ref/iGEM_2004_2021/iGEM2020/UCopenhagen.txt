UCopenhagen:::Europe:::Denmark:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CIDosis - Just Sweat It! Developing a Biosensor for Monitoring Chronic Inflammatory Diseases:::Chronic Inflammatory Diseases (CIDs) are debilitating diseases affecting three out of five people worldwide. Optimal treatment requires constant monitoring, but current testing methods are invasive, time-consuming, and costly. CIDosis strives to change this with a non-invasive patch for self-monitoring. Backed by extensive computer modeling, we are developing a biosensor that continuously collects sweat from the skin, and produces a color reflecting the level of inflammation. The biosensor in our patch is based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells equipped with interleukin-specific receptors that will associate in the presence of interleukins, resulting in the intracellular complementation of a split protein. A transduction pathway is then triggered, leading to the production of a color, whose intensity is logged by an app and shared with a medical professional. By integrating the wishes of patients living with CIDs, as well as experts within these fields, CIDosis brings a next generation tool for patient empowerment.:::2020
