Long-term intake of cadmium will jeopardize human bodies. To deal with the problem, we utilize engineered Synechocystis as a competent cadmium absorber. Moreover, with blue-ray/antitoxin suicide system, the reformed alga will be appropriately contained. The cadmium can be recycled as the microorganisms will be calcined after absorption. The application of engineered alga will minimize human potential cadmium intake.:::2020
