These chemicals, along with many other kudzu removal options, are expensive and can pose harmful effects to human health and the ecosystem. Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola has been found to affect legumes specifically by producing the phytotoxin phaseolotoxin. Our team plans to replicate the phaseolotoxin production pathway in Escherichia coli and utilize the toxin as a more environmentally friendly option to remove kudzu. After the removal of kudzu, local endangered species can regrow without competition. Additionally, we developed three models to simulate the spread of infectious plant diseases like Asian Soybean Rust using kudzu as a vector, simulate the ROTCase production and activity under promoters with different strengths, and predict the spread and management cost of kudzu in a local area.:::2020
