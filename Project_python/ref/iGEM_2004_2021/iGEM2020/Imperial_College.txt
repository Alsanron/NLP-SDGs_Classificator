Imperial_College:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SOAP Lab: Automating DNA Design & Assembly:::DNA assembly is a vital first step in most synthetic biology projects. As genetic design spaces become larger with more complex genetic circuits and greater diversity of parts, the ability to construct sizable genetic libraries with high accuracy in a cost and time-efficient manner is imperative. While automation is an attractive and increasingly affordable solution, programming remains a technical challenge for many wet-lab scientists. To make automated workflows a practical reality, we developed SOAP Lab, an open-source web UI that infers genetic circuit designs from SBOL data files and customizes an assembly plan based on the userâ€™s specifications. This is then used to generate ready-to-run scripts for the liquid handlers, along with set-up instructions and logs for traceability and debugging. SOAP Lab is integrable into larger software pipelines through the use of SBOL data standards, empowering labs with access to a wider suite of tools available for computer-aided biology.:::2020
