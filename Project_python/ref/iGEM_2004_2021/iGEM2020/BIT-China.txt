BIT-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Lemon CP:::Our team BIT-China designed and constructed a double oscillation dynamic regulation system to produce flavonoids. By using this system, we can use an intelligent dynamic regulation method to regulate E. coli and Yeast, to match the growth rate, upstream, and downstream pathways of the two. It also means that we successfully produce saccharoid using a combination of E. coli and Yeast's advantages in their respective production processes.:::2020
