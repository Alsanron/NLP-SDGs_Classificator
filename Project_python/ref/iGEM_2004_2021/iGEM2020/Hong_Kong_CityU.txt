These wastes are discarded into the environment causing serious environmental pollution problems. This has inspired our team to search for effective scientific options to help reduce plastic pollution. In this project, we have adopted an in-silico mutagenesis approach to design two PUR-degrading enzymes - papain and polyurethanase esterase A (PueA) - that could be used to enhance PET and PUR biodegradation. Ultimately, we are aiming to construct a multi plastic-degrading E. coli bug by combining the genes of the two mutant enzymes (papain and PueA) with the well-studied polyethylene terephthalate hydrolase (PETase) gene in a single biobrick. It is hoped that this technology will contribute to reducing plastic wastes and help better protect our environment.:::2020
