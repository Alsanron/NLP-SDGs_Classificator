Stony_Brook:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Light-triggered knockdown of the WUSCHEL gene in Nicotiana benthamiana:::Genetically modified (GM) crops have seen widespread adoption in large-scale agriculture, given their potential to improve commercial farming yields and mitigate crop losses from pests and pathogens. With widespread adoption, they could also increase the incidence of gene flow—the transfer of genetic variation across populations—from transgenic to wild crops, threatening biodiversity. Hence, a solution is proposed wherein an optogenetic killswitch, introduced in Nicotiana benthamiana, preventing plant development upon exposure to UV-B light (~311 nm). Through the optogenetic pair comprised of ULTRAVIOLET RESPONSE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) with attached tetracycline repressor domain (TetR) and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) with attached VP16 transactivation domain, the transcription of synthetic trans-acting small interfering RNAs (syn-tasiRNAs) will be controlled. These syn-tasiRNAs will disrupt the CLAVATA-WUSCHEL signaling pathway through the knockdown of the WUSCHEL (WUS) gene. Stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) will differentiate, causing stem cell depletion and prevention of further plant growth.:::2020
