Lethbridge:::North America:::Canada:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::FriGEM Â® Engineering Potatoes to Express Antimicrobial Peptides for Agriculture and Human Health:::Fusarium is a fungus causing dry rot in potatoes on the field and during storage. We want to express AMPs within the potato plant to provide a biological control of Fusarium. We also want to engineer E. coli to produce the desired AMPs instead and apply them on the plants/tubers.This would have the advantage that the potatoes are not GMOs. Additionally, we want to address human health and the negative perception of GM food. We want to produce AMPs that also enhance the potatoes nutritional value and health effects. AMPs useful against Fusarium may also have effects against human pathogens, making their ingestion beneficial. One example is the bovine AMP BMAP-18, which has antimicrobial effects against trypanosoma, the cause of sleeping sickness. By creating GMOs with beneficial effects for consumers, we hope to alleviate the stigma of GM food and increase its public acceptance.:::2020
