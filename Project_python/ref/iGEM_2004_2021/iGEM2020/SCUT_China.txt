SCUT_China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::LyDT Phage:::In this project, we show that a specific gene in the genome of the lytic P. aeruginosa phage vB_PaeM_SCUT-S1 (S1) can be engineered by a CRISPR-Cas editing strategy based on a two-plasmid system, in which the first plasmid expresses a Cas nuclease and recombinases (Î»-red), the second plasmid harbors a crRNA cassette and a repair template. Briefly, we constructed a lysis-deficient phage mutant (LyDT S1) expressing the antibacterial toxin RelE. The mutant was obtained by replacing the gene of holin, a lysis-promoting phage toxin, with the relE gene, which can still inhibit bacterial growth through the expression of RelE but cannot induce cell lysis because the holin gene is eliminated. This is expected to reduce the amount of endotoxins released from the bacteria, with a corresponding reduction of systemic cytokine response and inflammation during bacterial infection.:::2020
