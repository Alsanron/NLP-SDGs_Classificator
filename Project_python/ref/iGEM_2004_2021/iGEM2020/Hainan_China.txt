Hainan_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::CHLORIS：Coral HeaLth bOost and Reinforcement In Symbiosis:::Coral reefs are secret gardens under the sea. Accelerated anthropogenic CO2 emission has led to elevation of surface temperature and acidification of the seawater. Symbiont Zooxanthellae cells are then expelled by corals, leading to coral bleaching. If the coral reefs remain bleached, they would proceed to eventual death, and destruction of the marine ecosystem. Hainan_China aims to develop a nutritional enhancement strategy to safeguard coral reefs against the devastation by coral bleaching. We plan to introduce synthetically engineered “probiotics” to stimulate coral microbiota for sustainability of Zooxanthellae-bacterial interaction and viable metabolic functioning of the coral systems. The probiotics would enable production of nutrients, such as N, P, Fe, and Vitamin B12 to nourish the coral symbiosis against environmental stresses. We will then design and fabricate a microfluidic chip to study in-depth the coral-Zooxanthellae symbiosis for large scale applications.:::2020
