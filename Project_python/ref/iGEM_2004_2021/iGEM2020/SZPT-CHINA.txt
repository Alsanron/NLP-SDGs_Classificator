SZPT-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Toothkeeper——A novel scheme for early diagnosis and care of dental caries:::Tooth decay is a chronic disease caused by dental plague turning sugars into acid. The prevalence of tooth decay has been increasing steadily in the past 20 years and gradually becoming a major global health problem. Several research articles signify that Streptococcus mutans is the major pathogen of dental caries. This year the SZPT-CHINA team will present an environment friendly and effective method to solve this problem. We have used synthetic biology methods to design an E. coil detector and a point-of-care test(POCT) device to detect caries, and an antibacterial gum to prevent caries in advance. After using our product, we can prevent dental caries effectively. This product will provide an economical solution and will improve the quality of life.:::2020
