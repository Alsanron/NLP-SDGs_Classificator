Qdai:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::P. coli: Engineering E.coli to have an increased capacity of phosphorus accumulation:::While phosphorus is one of the most important resources for agricultural food production, it becomes a great driver of water pollution when it enters the environment. Sometimes the pollution causes health problems to humans and animals. Further, phosphorus is expected to be depleted in about 50 years, so the recovery and recycling is a big issue. We looked into phosphorus metabolism of bacteria and hope to enhance its capacity of phosphorus accumulation by engineering E.coli to increase polyphosphate kinase and decrease exopolyphosphatase. We believe that our project contributes to sustainable development goals (SDGs).:::2020
