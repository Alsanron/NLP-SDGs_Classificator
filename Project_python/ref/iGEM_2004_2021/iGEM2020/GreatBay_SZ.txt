GreatBay_SZ:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::BIOT:::The Greatbay_SZ 2020 team aims to develop a moisture-driven energy harvesting device utilizing biotechnology: BIOT. The core of BIOT is engineered-protein filament nanowires, which spontaneously generate and maintain electric potential energy. We optimize BIOT's cost and power supply performance by mutating the pilA gene (of protein monomer) and RBSs. For future implementations, our team plans to provide a stable power supply for IoT (Internet of Things) devices. BIOT is the first application of biotechnology in the IoT field. Its advantages in low environmental restrictions, green and environmentally-friendly materials, stable power generation, long power-harvest duration, low cost, and large-scale applications will promote further global IoT development.:::2020
