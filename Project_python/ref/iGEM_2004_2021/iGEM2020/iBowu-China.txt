iBowu-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Sureloc (Surely Locates Cancer):::Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is a common type of epithelial cancer, which is not sensitive to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. To address this issue, our team developed a therapy based on magneto-hyperthermia. We designed a vector that codes for magnetic protein crystals (MPCs) through the use of a tumor-specific promoter. Liposomes with surface PEG GE11 modifications carrying MPC vectors will target NSCLC cells. Post transfection, targeted tumor cells will express MPCs, which enable the binding of iron. Iron-loaded MPCs will then respond to localized alternating magnetic fields and induce cell death. The active targeting ligand, tumor-specific promoter, and localized alternating magnetic fields provide triple targeting security. Currently, we completed the in vitro isolation and purification of the MPCs with successful confirmation of their magnetism. The successive steps are to control the MPCsâ€™ size, add the internal targeting ligand, and experiment the targeting capabilities in vivo.:::2020
