Jilin_China:::Asia:::China:::Open:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::iGame:::This year, an unexpected disease has struck the world. Professor John Conway, who has invented the Game of Life, unfortunately passed away due to this pandemic. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton as well as a self-regulating simulation game. Inspired by this, we design another “Game of Life” by synthetic biology means in which microorganisms compete for survival under player’s light-control. The game contains three plans. Under different plans, player bacteria fight against enemy bacteria with antibiotics system, sensing system and toxin-antitoxin system correspondingly. To optimize players’ gaming experience, we conduct experiments in the lab and collect relative parameters and data. Then we make it a videogame so that players can simply click on buttons on the screen to set the light for their battle and within several minutes they can get the game result.:::2020
