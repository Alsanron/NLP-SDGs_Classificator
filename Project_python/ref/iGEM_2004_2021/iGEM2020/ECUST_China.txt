ECUST_China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::D-E-tector for SARS-CoV-2:::SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible and pathogenic. In addition to the nature of RNA virus with high mutation rate, antigenic drift is the main evolutionary mechanism for SARS-CoV-2. Its wide-spreading has currently resulted in the evolutionary variants different from the originate isolate. Therefore, to curb this pandemic, effective surveillance of circulating viruses is much more urgent. We developed a high throughput POCT platform for the SARS-CoV-2 detection with the help of DMF. A nanomachine called DNA Walker can amplify the region-specific sequence of the virus genome in the specimen. And then it will be read out by E-CRISPR, which can output an electric signal by a Cas9 nickase and corresponding electrode. We are targeting not only the detection of COVID-19 viruses with alarming dangerous mutations, but also differentiating other related viruses and pathogens. This is not only for managing todayâ€™s pandemic, but also for the potential outbreaks of other coronaviruses.:::2020
