UIUC_Illinois:::North America:::United States:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Viralizer â€“ Modeling Covid-19 mutations and binding energies to design potential antibodies:::Covid-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a highly mutative virus for which developing effective antibodies is difficult. Thousands of spike protein mutations have been detected but fewer than 1% of them have solved crystal structures. To address this shortage, we created Viralizer: an interactive online database that contains over 26,000 mutated spike protein sequences and their corresponding structures, developed using homology modeling in PyRosetta. This allows the user to analyze the effects of spike protein mutations on the functionality of the protein and its binding with potential antibodies. The spike protein database is paired with a phylogenetic tree that characterizes the propagation of the virus over space and time. We also developed a genetic algorithm that uses spike protein structures and their binding energies to design hundreds of potential antibodies that bind to the spike protein and reduce its binding affinity to the ACE-2 receptor on cells.:::2020
