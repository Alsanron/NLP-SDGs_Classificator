Beijing_4ELEVEN:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Acneutralizer:::Acne vulgaris troubles teenagers and sometimes adults as it not only affects the skin but also self-confidence. Traditional treatment to acne vulgaris involving antibiotics may trigger drug resistance in acne pathogenic bacteria, especially Propionibacterium. acnes. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered excellent alternatives of antibiotics for their capability of providing effective, broad-spectrum defenses against infections and exhibiting relatively low potential to elicit resistance. However, AMP curing products nowadays are not abundant, and most AMPs are produced via chemosynthesis, a rather costly method incapable of yielding AMPs with great antimicrobial potency. Therefore, we aim to create an anti-acne product which consists of biosynthesized P. acnes killing AMPs, adhesive/cohesive proteins, and tyrosinase. The mixture which we named Acneutralizer forms a thin film when applied to acne-infected skin. This product may be brought to market, helping acne sufferers improve their conditions by easily killing P. acnes.:::2020
