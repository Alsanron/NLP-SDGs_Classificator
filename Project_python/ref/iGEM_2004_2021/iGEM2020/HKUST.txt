HKUST:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Green textile system: Biodegradable hagfish slime intermediate filament and non-toxic chromoprotein-based dye for fabric production:::The conventional textile industry is causing noxious pollution to the hydrosphere. Non-biodegradable Synthetic fibers, such as nylon, are causing microplastic pollution. While chemical dyes discarded in factoriesâ€™ sewage are mostly poisoning to aquatic lives. In view of the issue, our project targets to replace these fibers and dye by producing recombinant hagfish slime intermediate filaments (IF) with a chromoprotein dyeing system. A novel protein purification approach is also designed as an industrial solution. The hagfish slime IF is a competitive candidate to replace the polluting man-made fiber. While being biodegradable, it possesses outstanding mechanics that outscore Kevlar. When compared to other developing alternatives, like spider dragline silk, its simpler protein architecture facilitates the production process. We also developed an eco-friendly dyeing method for our threads. By fusing non-toxic chromoproteins to the IF, they can grant a wide range of vivid colors for the fabric, making it a viable clothing material.:::2020
