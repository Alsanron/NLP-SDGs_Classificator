HK_SSC:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Production of PdRp-CBD complex for recovery of palladium from palladium ions:::Palladium is widely adapted in industrial processes such as catalytic converters or ceramic capacitors. It also holds biomedical applications such as acting as a drug carrier and is utilised in cancer treatment. However, palladium is an environmental pollutant and difficult to be recycled. In this project, twenty-five palladium(II) reducing peptides (PdRp) are modified from a selection of known palladium binding peptides. The PdRp are fused to a cellulose binding domain 3 (CBD 3) derived from Clostridium thermocellum which acts as an affinity tag. The PdRp-CBD complex is expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) in pETBlue-2 vector and purified using regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC). Peptide-Palladium interactions are determined by computational methods of Molecular Dynamics. Downstream analysis and further experiments will be performed to determine the efficiency and performance of the PdRp with potassium hexachloropalladate.:::2020
