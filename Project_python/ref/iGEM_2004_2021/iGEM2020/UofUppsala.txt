UofUppsala:::Europe:::Sweden:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NANOFLEX:::Our project aims to create a cellular biosensor adaptable to detect your analytes of choice. Its design contains a sensory module, where nanobodies interact with the targets, activating the signal amplification module, which will result in an output signal visible to the naked eye. Placing this system in an easy-to-use format we intend to offer a standardized, flexible and accessible detection system.:::2020
