Warwick:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::An early detection system for bowel cancer based on the presence of colibactin derivative:::Colon cancer worldwide affects over 1.80 million people with approximately 862,000 deaths each year. Recent scientific literature highlights a correlation between colon cancer and the presence of colibactin in patientsâ€™ bowels, produced by Escherichia coli found in the colon of 20% of people. Therefore, to aid early detection we will develop a better diagnostic tool for the detection of colon cancer reliant upon modifying a DNA-binding protein. By engineering the transcriptional repressor MmfR of the TetR family, the binding of a colibactin derivative will prevent the binding of our new protein to DNA. The ligand-binding pocket of MmfR will be modified in-silico to ensure it accommodates a colibactin derivative - N-myristoyl-D-asparagine - instead of its native ligand. Specific amino acids mutated within the MmfR protein will be identified. Finally, the engineered protein will be overproduced and isolated. We expect resulting engineered proteins to be accurate and precise biosensors for colibactin.:::2020
