Aix-Marseille:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Make some Rham-Noise:::Since the 70â€™s green algae have been proliferating and forming what are called green tides on certain beaches in France, but also in China and the United States. This is mainly due to nitrogen-rich fertilizers used in intensive agriculture The green algae on the beach decompose and produce hydrogen sulfide a deadly gas for animals and humans. One very promising route for recovery is the production of bioethanol that could be blended with gasoline and used by adapted vehicles. The objective of our project is to define an efficient process to transform ulvan, a sugar polymer present in large quantities in the wall of Ulva into rhamnose and other fermentable sugars using the enzymes from Formosa Agariphila inserted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then transform it into bioethanol using the fermentation capacity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia stipitis. Thanks to this Ulva could become a renewable and profitable source of energy.:::2020
