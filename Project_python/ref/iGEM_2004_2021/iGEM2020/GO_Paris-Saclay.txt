GO_Paris-Saclay:::Europe:::France:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::HuGenesS: a project on gene entanglement:::HuGenesS is based on the concept of overlapping genes, where a DNA stretch encodes two genes, depending on the reading frame. The genes are interlaced, as if in a loving hug! While such genetic arrangements exist in nature, this phenomenon could not be easily harnessed for synthetic biology… until the CAMEOS software was developed by Harris Wang’s Team. We used it to generate several entangled genes encoding reporter and antibiotic resistance proteins. We cloned the sequence encoding GFP and KNT. Since the cloned entangled genes lost functionality, we improved CAMEOS to generate sequences preserving conserved amino acids and to choose the best overlap. We have written comprehensive tutorials on utilizing CAMEOS. The improved software generated sequences that are currently tested by a research team optimizing lipid synthesis in yeast. Genetic entanglement has many potential applications from designing minimal genomes to developing improved, safer and more stable genetic constructs. Confined hugs!:::2020
