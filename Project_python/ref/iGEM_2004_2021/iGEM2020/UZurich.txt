UZurich:::Europe:::Switzerland:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Plant Immunity based Biosensing:::Bacterial contamination in water is a global issue that affects developing nations and first world countries. Even Switzerland, famed for its drinking water, faces over 400 cases of Legionnaires disease annually. But plants have been combating microbial pathogens for far longer than humans and we believe there is a lot to learn from them. That is why we are developing a biosensor based on plant pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which are cell surface receptors of the plant immune system, that dimerize in the presence of microbes. We designed a system based on EFR, FLS2, CORE and their coreceptor BAK1, which recognize a broad spectrum of bacteria. We fused a split-luciferase to our receptors in order to quantify the total bacterial load of a water sample based on the luminescence-output. We achieved the expression of PRRs in yeast, which opens the door to future applications of PRRs as biosensors.:::2020
