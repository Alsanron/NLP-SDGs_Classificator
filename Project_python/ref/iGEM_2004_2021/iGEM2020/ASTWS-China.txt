ASTWS-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::When Microplastics Meet Biofilms: Enhanced Degradation of Environmental Plastics by Biosorption:::Microplastics from household waste are easily entered into our water system, which is one of the most difficult environmental pollutants to degrade. The newly developed biodegradation technology can effectively degrade highly polyester contaminants, such as PET plastics, which can be efficiently degraded using PETase. On the other hand, biosorption can effectively collect microplastic particles. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesize that genetically enhanced biofilms can promote PET microplastic degradation through the proximity effect of the enzyme and substrate, thus benefiting future environmental governance applications.:::2020
