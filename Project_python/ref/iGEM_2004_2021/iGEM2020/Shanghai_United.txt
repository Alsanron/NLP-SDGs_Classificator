Shanghai_United:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Degradation of P-cresol by Engineered Probiotics in treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease:::Uremic toxin p-cresol sulfate (pCS) accumulate inside the kidney due to Chronic Kidney Disease, further exacerbating harm. We aim to engineer probiotics that can be consumed by patient, express the target gene into enzymes to degrade p-cresol, the precursor of pCS. Since p-cresol is produced from phenylalanine and tyrosine in diet, we created tyrosine inducer gene, which controls the expression of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) – enzyme that can degrade p-cresol. This system was tested with the Green Fluorescent Protein gene on the p15A linear plasmid. We extracted the pchC – pchF – pchA operon gene segment from Pseudomonas citronellolis and connected onto the p15A linear plasmid skeleton to assist PPO with degrading p-cresol under oxygen-deficient environment (intestine). Lastly, the plasmid was converted onto E.Coli Nissle 1917, an edible and harmless probiotic, while High Performance Liquid Chromatography was used to examine the ability of our finished product in degradation of p-cresol.:::2020
