UC_San_Diego:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BACSYGEN: BACteriotherapy via SYnthetic GENomes:::Despite cancer being one of the leading causes of death, successful treatment remains a challenge due to the heterogeneous nature of tumors. While a multitude of treatment options exist including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, they all have significant limitations and have prompted the development of alternative therapies such as bacteriotherapy. While certain bacteria have shown great therapeutic potential, different bacteria are involved in unique tumor suppressing pathways, and as a result, a combination of various tumor-suppressing bacteria have been shown to achieve the greatest efficacy. However, these microbes require genetic modification to lower potential toxicity and eliminate any side effects on normal cells. Our team proposes a classification algorithm to first classify whether a bacteria affects a tumor-resisting pathway, and then feeding this information into our Generative Adversarial Network to create a synthetic bacterial genome with multiple tumor-suppressing features while also being clinically significant.:::2020
