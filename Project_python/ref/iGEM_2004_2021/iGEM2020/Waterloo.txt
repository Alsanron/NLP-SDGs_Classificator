Waterloo:::North America:::Canada:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::REMINE:::REMINE is a packed column bioreactor containing metal-binding proteins which remove and recover toxic but valuable heavy metals from electronic manufacturing wastewater. The REMINE system can be customized to target specific metals by increasing the metal affinity of the proteins using molecular dynamics and protein engineering tools. Process engineering methods will be used to design the packed column reactor and optimise it to specific waste streams and regulatory constraints. With REMINE, the electronic industry can continue to grow while reducing its impact on our environment and health.:::2020
