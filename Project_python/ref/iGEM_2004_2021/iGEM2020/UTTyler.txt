UTTyler:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Diagnosis of viral infections using photonics and biomolecular techniques:::Viral diseases are common to have a long incubation period with mild symptoms while carriers can still spread these pathogens via airborne transmission. These properties lead to a critical challenge in preventing the spread of these diseases. Potentially, routine diagnosis of the entire population can identify all virus carriers to block transmission. However, advanced equipment and skills are required for most diagnostic methods, making it difficult to frequently test all individuals in our society. To address this problem, we propose to develop a diagnostic platform that allows users to perform testing at home on a daily basis. Our approach involves using cellular techniques to generate probes for recognizing viral genomes and using photonics technologies to monitor association between our probes and viral DNA. We anticipate that a test will only take a short period of time and it can be easily performed by all users.:::2020
