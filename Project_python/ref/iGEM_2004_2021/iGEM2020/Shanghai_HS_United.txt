In China, the number of affected patients already towered over 100 million and still rising. We wanted to help relive patients with galactosemia, one of the saccharine diseases with the highest prevalence rate and detrimental influence. Our team came up with an innovative idea which is to engineer a probiotic with the function to decompose galactose into butyric acid, a useful short chain fatty acid. We engineered three different plasmids, each with its own capabilities that is essential for galactose breakdown. Using a competent E.Coli Nissle 1917cell, we transfer the plasmids into the cell, creating our final product. Eventually, the probiotics was successfully engineered in the laboratory. We plan to produce it as a health-care beverage product after analyzing over 400 pieces of survey and suggestions from experts in medicine and milk industry.:::2020
