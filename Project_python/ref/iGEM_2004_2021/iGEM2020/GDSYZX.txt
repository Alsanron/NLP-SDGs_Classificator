GDSYZX:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Cultural Great Adventure to Rice:::Chinese Traditional medicine such as honeysuckle has excellent efficacy in treating Novel Corona Virus, many patent medicine are now commonly used for treatment of COVID-19. One of the main active ingredient of honeysuckle is Chlorogenic acid (CGA), which synthesized under the key enzyme HQT. We tried to transfer HQT of honeysuckle into rice to increase the rice seedsâ€™content of CGA. Thus We constructed GluD-1pro::HQT and 35Spro::HQT vector with rice seed specific promoter GluD-1 and 35S promoter respectively. We transferred this two vectors into the rice protoplast individually. We detected the expression of HQT gene by Western Blot and synthesis of CGA by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in 35Spro::HQT vector transfected protoplasts as we expected. We provide a method that can increase the content of CGA in rice to improve human immunity.:::2020
