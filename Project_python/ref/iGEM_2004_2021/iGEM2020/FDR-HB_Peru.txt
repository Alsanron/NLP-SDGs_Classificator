FDR-HB_Peru:::Latin America:::Peru:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Fishing for Cadmium:::Our project seeks to tackle the issue of cadmium contamination in fishmeal. We chose this issue because it affects the health of humans, ecosystems, and our local economy. To tackle this issue we have designed a plasmid capable of detecting the concentration of cadmium in blended fish. We have plans to implement a cell free system to make our solution more accessible to fishermen as well as an affordable heated shaking incubator to make the culturing of bacteria easier. Lastly, we have taken strides to make science education more accessible for young adults in Peru, by creating videos, evaluating articles for a young science journal, and subtitling our previous TEDx talk.:::2020
