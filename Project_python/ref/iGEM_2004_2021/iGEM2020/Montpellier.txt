Montpellier:::Europe:::France:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Phagent: Phage-mediated reprogramming of the tumor microbiome to fight cancer:::Phagent is a global approach against cancer involving bacteria of the tumor microbiome and phages. Our goal is to engineer phages that will hack the tumor microbiome and make the infected bacteria produce oncolytic molecules. We focused on dacA, which triggers the cGAS-sting pathway, azurin which interferes with the tumor suppressor p53, and VHH-PL1, a nanobody interacting with the immune system. The phages are injected in the tumor and transform the bacteria of the microbiome. The choice of the phage depends uponthe target cancer and its microbiome. Then, the bacteria will produce the therapeutic proteins that will interfere with cancer cells and trigger apoptosis. Phagent would complement classical treatments that may be not effective to fight some types of tumor.:::2020
