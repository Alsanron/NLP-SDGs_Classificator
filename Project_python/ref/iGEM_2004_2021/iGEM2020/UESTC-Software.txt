UESTC-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CPD3DS-Classification of Protein Domains in 3D Shape to design a standard set of protein bricks:::Proteins are responsible for most of the physiological functions in the cells, and many synthetic biologists focus on  designing customized proteins according to demands. Nowadays, the protein design starts from a new amino acid sequence in most cases,  the workload is undoubtedly huge. At the same time, the structure of a protein is often closely related to the function of protein. Our project, CPD3DS,  directly uses the structural domains as the basic unit to analyze protein structures. To get a set of protein bricks,  domains were classified by their shape features, and 3D-Zernike descriptor were used to cluster all domains in existing databases. We developed a user-friendly website, termed CPD3DS, for retrieval, analyses and visualization of classified protein domains. In addition, we printed a set of our protein bricks for teaching and popularize synthetic biology.:::2020
