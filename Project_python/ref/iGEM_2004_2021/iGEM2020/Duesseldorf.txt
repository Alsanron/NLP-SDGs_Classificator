Duesseldorf:::Europe:::Germany:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mossphate: Yesterday's wastewater can fuel tomorrow's crops:::Phosphate is an essential element that fulfills diverse cellular functions in all living organisms. It is a key limiting factor of plant growth and therefore used for the production of fertilizers. However, phosphate is a non-renewable resource and its natural reserves are dramatically decreasing, while the growing world population has led to a growing demand of phosphate fertilizers. Our project is to accumulate phosphate from wastewater and reuse it for the agricultural sector using the moss Physcomitrella patens. The moss has been genetically engineered to accumulate phosphate in the form of polyphosphate granules through the introduction of polyphosphate kinases and additional phosphate transporters. With these modifications, we hope to provide a sustainable way to filter phosphate from wastewater and grow phosphate-rich moss plants. These mosses can be directly used as fertilizer to provide crops with recycled phosphate.:::2020
