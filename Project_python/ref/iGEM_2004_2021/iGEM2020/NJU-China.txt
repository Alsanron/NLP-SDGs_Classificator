NJU-China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ExosomeBomb SiRNA:::siRNAs offer an opportunity to specifically target mRNAs and modulate the expression of therapeutic targets which can facilitate cancer treatment. Here, we designed composable and programmable genetic circuits that used the liver as a tissue chassis to direct the self-assembly of exogenous siRNAs into secretory exosomes. The circuits include core parts which expressed siRNAs that not only inhibit the cancer cells, but also remove the disguise cancer use to evade the immune system; enhancing parts which facilitated the production of more anti-cancer exosomses, and guidance parts which directed the exosome to target cancer cells. Taken together, the genetic parts assembled into anti-tumor exosomes, secreted into circulation, delivered to cancer cells and eliminate them. The strategy provided a controllable, efficient and convenient cancer treatment which may even provide a personalized treatment strategy that can address a broad range of problems in biomedicine.:::2020
