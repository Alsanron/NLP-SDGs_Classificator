ICS_BKK:::Asia:::Thailand:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Project Trojan Horse:::Our project aims to treat tonsillitis utilizing phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics, whose drawback is resistance. Our ultimate goal is to create a mouthwash containing engineered Lactococcus lactis strains capable of releasing a phage to deactivate Streptococcus pyogenes. For computational lab, we modified over 300 strains of Phage P2, natural phage of Lactococcus lactis, to bind to S. pyogenes and achieved the highest binding affinity of -6.38 kcal/mol, compared with the original affinity of -4.50 kcal/mol between P2 and S. pyogenese. For the wet lab approach, we conducted biopanning, a screening method to identify peptides with high affinity to a given target, on Staphylococcus aureus, a common virulent gram-positive bacteria in respiratory tracts. We successfully binded one strand of Phage M13 to S. aureus. The successful binding results in both approaches lay a foundation for next yearâ€™s modification of bacteriophage-containing bacteria in mouthwash delivery.:::2020
