Athens:::Europe:::Greece:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Morphæ: An engineered biofilm for the production of a novel structurally coloured material:::Colours in nature can be the result either of chemical pigments or of the physical structure of surfaces. Certain bacterial strains exhibit structural colour when they form biofilms, a phenomenon caused by spatial geometries in the micron scale. In this iGEM project we utilize bacteria from the Flavobacterium genus that display structural colour naturally, to create a material that is coloured due to that property. In order for ​Flavobacteriia to secrete a cellulose based extracellular matrix that retains this property, genes from the bcs operon of Komagataeibacter xylinus will be transferred. A biophysical mass-spring model of the cell will be developed to simulate the gliding motility mechanism based on the mechanical interactions between the cells, along with a simulation predicting the optical properties of a known structure. A kinetic modeling for the cellulose biosynthesis will also be implemented to better predict the final structure of the biomaterial.:::2020
