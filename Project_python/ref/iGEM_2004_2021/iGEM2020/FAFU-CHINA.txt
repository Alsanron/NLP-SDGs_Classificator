FAFU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Design an integrated fermentation system with Juncao as raw material:::This year, we want to use Juncao to make bioethanol. We designed an integrated fermentation system that consists 3 chassis (E. coli & K. Marxianus & Pichia Pastoris) and the control elements that link them. The biosensor based self-regulation is realized by sensing the changes in the concentration of various intermediates during fermentation. Through the above design, each reaction stage can be organically combined without interference. In addition, we also want to modify the fiber corporeal through rational design of proteins, so that it has the ability to break down the structure of cell wall, and finally achieve the effect of degrading lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose.:::2020
