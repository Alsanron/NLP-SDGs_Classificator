Nantes:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A3 Project - Algal Acquired Acid:::Green macroalgae (Ulva spp.) have been poisoning oceanic coastlines for decades through the production of a toxic gas: hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The collection of algae is currently a costly and unprofitable process. Our project aims to enhance the value of the collected algae. To do so, we plan to target ulvan, the main component of green algae’s cell wall, using degradation enzymes and recombinant sulfatases. Once produced by transformed bacteria, the enzymes will be added to a tank of a bioreactor, filled with algae and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRBs) which are responsible for the production of H2S. The H2S produced in the tank will be transformed into sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), a useful compound for many industries such as the production of detergents, textiles and many others products. Our project could constitute a proof of concept for a subsequent industrial optimization.:::2020
