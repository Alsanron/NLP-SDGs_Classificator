NAU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Soil lead immobilization magician(SLIM):earthworms carrying engineered Bacillus subtilis:::Lead pollution in soil has brought great losses to agriculture and human health. However, traditional approaches such as physicochemical repair and plant enrichment will cause other hazards and have lower efficiency, respectively. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new strategies for lead pollution treatment. This year, to make up for the deficiency of traditional methods, NAU-CHINA combined earthworms (Eisenia foetida) and bacteria (Bacillus subtilis) to immobilize soil lead. Earthworms was used as carrier of bacteria, and we transformed bacteria to secrete phytase specifically by using oxygen-regulated switch to hydrolyze phytate in the intestines of earthworms. Lead ions can be precipitated into insolubles by combining with phosphate and chloride ions, thus purifying soil. Meanwhile, we added suicide module considering the biosafety of using genetically modified organisms in the environment. Affected by COVID-19, we cannot do experiments. So we collected data from literature and constructed mathematical models to predict results and feasibility.:::2020
