Currently, there is no specific treatment or vaccine for the disease. In this phase-I project, we propose a SynBio-based therapeutic solution for COVID-19. Our approach consists of a SARS-CoV-2-like particle that is capable of targeting cells expressing the ACE2 receptor. Upon delivery, our sensing moiety (Toehold Riboswitch adjusted for mammalian systems) is constitutively expressed. If SARS-CoV-2 triggers are present within the cell, the sensor will unfold initiating a GAL4-VP16-dependent interference pathway. Consequently, we designed two de novo siRNAs that play a critical role in our antiviral therapeutic approach. They inhibit viral replication via RISC-mediated degradation of the replicase region of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We also created a deterministic model to predict the levels of siRNAs as well as a structural model to predict the thermodynamic stability of our toehold riboswitches. :::2020
