KUAS_Korea:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::Open:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Thermopatch : What's your body temperature now?:::One of the key factors to South Korea’s success in controlling COVID-19 is early detection. Aside from aggressive COVID-19 testing, South Korea also deployed temperature checks at entries of every indoor public facilities for screening purposes. However, the current screening methods such as contactless thermometers and infrared cameras are not efficient because of the high costs of resources needed for setting up screening booths and its failure to monitor temperature continuously. Our ‘Thermopatch’ is a device that complements these limitations. In the process, we utilized light-up RNA aptamer(‘Catalytic Hairpin Assembly(CHA)’ method specifically) and thermosensing RNA. We ultimately hope our ‘Thermopatch’ can help people get through these difficult times.:::2020
