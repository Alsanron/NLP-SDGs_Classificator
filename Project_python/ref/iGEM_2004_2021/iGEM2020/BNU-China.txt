BNU-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Automatic Barcode Creator (ABC):::Tracing the lineage of cells is essential in answering diverse and fundamental questions in biology. In recent years, the method combing CRISPR/Cas9 and barcode, a DNA sequence as genetic marker, has attracted extensive attention in lineage tracing. However, the diversity of barcodes is limited and the constitutively expressed Cas9 consumes barcodes quickly. These make barcodes infeasible for the tracking purpose after several generations. We propose to track more generations by two ways. First, we build an inducible expression module of Cas9 in association with cell division to label each cell automatically without wasting barcodes. Second, we use homing guide RNA (hgRNA) to replace the small guide RNA (sgRNA) so that the diversity of barcodes can be increased greatly. In order to make the barcode sequence read at RNA level, we design a double promoter module, so that we can obtain the lineage information together with transcriptomic information.:::2020
