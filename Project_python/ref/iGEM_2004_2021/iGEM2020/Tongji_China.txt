It features small amount of bleeding and patientsâ€™ unawareness. To locate the bleeding site, endoscope is commonly used in clinics. However, endoscope puts heavy discomfort to patients and the time-consuming process postpones subsequent treatment, which becomes great obstacles of diagnosis and therapy. To solve this throng problem, team Tongji China designed Hetoul, the engineered bacteria that can realize more rapid localization of the bleeding site in lower gastrointestinal tract. The mechanism is: Hetoul recognizes the heme released by broken red blood cells. When heme is recognized, Hetoul will express gas vesicle protein, which can be detected by ultrasonic imaging. The location of Hetoul shows the location of bleeding site, which can provide guide to subsequent treatment. Further, Hetoul can also play the role of a diagnosis tool for lower gastrointestinal diseases like colorectal cancer.:::2020
