ECNUAS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Development of an Experimental Platform for Screening GR antagonist against T2DM:::T2DM is characterized by relative insulin deficiency caused by Î²-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Hepatic glucose metabolism is modulated by glucocorticoid, and the effect of glucocorticoid is usually mediated by glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Increasing of glucocorticoids has the side effect of aggravating blood glucose level, and the GR antagonists have been reported to improve blood glucose level. Therefore, it is important to establish a platform for screening GR antagonists. In our study, GR transactivation assay is established to verify the antagonistic effect of drugs on GR. Dexamethasone (Dex) as a GR agonist activates reporter gene expression efficiently, and mifepristone as a GR antagonist antagonizes Dex-induced reporter gene stimulation. Success of our experiments will boost research on GR-related medication.:::2020
