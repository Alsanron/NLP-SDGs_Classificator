TJUSLS_China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PET-CRUSHER:::PETase has the highest degradation activity of highly crystallized PET of all PET-degrading enzymes reported to date. However, its low thermal stability limits its ability for eﬃcient enzymatic degradation. Considering the glass transition temperature of PET is around 75°C, above which the polyester chain of PET performs in a high elastic state and the degradation is promoted, we accordingly modify PETase with a series of rational protein engineering strategy to enhance its thermal stability and therefore improve degradation efficiency. Variants are screened and verified through a series of bioinformatics strategy including computational evaluation, molecular visualization, docking and molecular dynamics simulation. Particularly, a variant with 12 mutations is expected to have a Tm value of 80.08°C, increased by 31.27°C in comparison with PETaseWT. Our project helps to increase the possibility of achieving the biodegradation of highly crystallized PET, contributing to solving environmental and health problems caused by the abuse of PET.:::2020
