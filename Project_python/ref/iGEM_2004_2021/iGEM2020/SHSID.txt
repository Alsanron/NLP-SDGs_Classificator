SHSID:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Efficient Detection of Listeria monocytogenes by a Cas12a-crRNA complex and ssDNA:::Food is usually stored in the fridge to keep it as fresh as possible and far from the contamination of bacteria. However, a species of poorly known bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, is able to endure cold conditions, and causes serious health risks such as fever, diarrhea, miscarriage, and even death. Unfortunately, as we learned from browsing related articles, field research, and surveys, modern detection methods are all very costly and time-consuming. So, we aim to create a biological kit, made out of crRNA, Cas12a, ssDNA, that allows for efficient detection of L. monocytogenes. crRNA and Cas12a will form a complex, and when crRNA binds to the oligo sequences that model the DNA of L. monocytogenes, it will activate the Cas12a protein, thus causing Cas12a to cut the surrounding ssDNA which produces visible fluorescence. Ultimately, our kit is able to produce a fluorescence after 10 minutes of exposure to oligo sequences.:::2020
