UPF_Barcelona:::Europe:::Spain:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hormonic: restoring thyroid homeostasis via an intein-mediated biosensor:::One-third of the treated hypothyroidism patients do not respond correctly to current therapies. To solve that, a system capable of restoring hormonal feedback was designed, offering an alternative to the 10% of Spaniards and 5% of the global population that suffer from this endocrine disorder. Its functioning is based on our successfully engineered intein-mediated Escherichia coli biosensor, which showed a great response to distinct T3 thyroid hormone levels giving rise to different superfolder GFP concentrations. This was designed to be coupled to a PID controller, which computes the dosage that compensates for hormonal disbalances. As a proof of concept for the validation of this regulatory mechanism, a lactone cell circuit incorporating a turbidostat was developed, showing a high correlation between the experimental and modelling results. Finally, a detailed future implementation plan was defined so that it included the necessary steps towards a feasible implementation of this innovative treatment.:::2020
