UChicago:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Optizyme: A Novel Open-Source Computational Modelling and Optimization Package for Design of Cell-Free Systems:::Optizyme is an open source package in the computer language R that aims to streamline computational approaches to synthetic biology problems. Optizyme contains a suite of functions that allow for Michaelis-Menten model construction and visualization given only biological parameters. Most importantly, Optizyme allows for optimization of enzyme concentrations within cell-free systems through a gradient descent algorithm that accepts models built using Optizyme’s capabilities, as well as any user constructed model that fulfills certain requirements detailed in the package documentation. Accuracy of the optimization algorithm is tested on the model described in “A combined experimental and modelling approach for the Weimberg pathway optimisation” (Shen et al). Using their model, Optizyme identifies a higher performing optimum than the optimal ratio identified by Shen et al. We then apply the capabilities of Optizyme to optimize the design of a cell-free system we intend to construct next year that degrades polyethylene terephthalate into catechol.:::2020
