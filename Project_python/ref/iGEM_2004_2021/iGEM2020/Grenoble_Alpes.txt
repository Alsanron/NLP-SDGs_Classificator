Grenoble_Alpes:::Europe:::France:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Innovative biotreatment for P.aeruginosa biofilm infections using an engineered E.coli:::We aimed at conceiving an engineered e.coli able to sense P.aeruginosaâ€™s biofilm and settle on it. Then, thanks to a synchronized lysis system, therapeutic molecules will be released to destroy P.aeruginosa and its biofilm. Our bacteria named Pyobusters works thanks to a complex genetic network based on the quorum sensing and designed by our biologists. To test the effectiveness of our therapeutic , our engineers conceived a testing bench able to emulate the different infection sites of P.aeruginosa. This way, we can monitor our therapeutic bacteria and train themselves in diverse fields.  We succeeded in building a functional testing bench and delivered proofs of concept for several pieces of our genetic network.  Further experiments and researches will be needed to test and unveil the full potential of our innovative treatment.:::2020
