XJTU-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Sand Fixers Alliance:::Upon the excessive deforestation, grazing and reclamation of human beings, desertification has been intensified. A natural sand-fixing system, biological soil crusts, was discovered to fight for desertification. But this natural sand fixation strategy always has little effect when facing the aggressive sand. Thus in our project, an engineered Bacillus subtilis was constructed to effectively produce extracellular polysaccharide, the key component of soil crust via introducing different combinations of key enzymes GalU and PGM. An arabinose-regulated suicide switch was also build to initiate suicide once the engineered bacteria release from the desert environment for biosafety. Furthermore, a symbiotic system of engineered Bacillus subtilis and cyanobacteria was developed to form sand fixers alliance, fighting for desertification. Our project is committed to educating the public about the current situation, hazards and solutions of desertification, and to providing a more convenient and effective strategy for desertification control.:::2020
