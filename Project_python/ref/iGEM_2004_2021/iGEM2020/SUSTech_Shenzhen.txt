SUSTech_Shenzhen:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Developing a Small Molecule to Inhibit Phage Infection of Bacterium Pseudomonas:::Pseudomonas have great potential for different biotechnological applications, particularly in the areas of bioremediation and biocatalysis. For instance, more than 80% vitamin B12 is synthesized by P.denitrificans in factories. Here we present a chemical biology approach of developing a small molecule that can protect Pseudomonas from phages infection. We attempt to utilize the Target-Directed Screening technique to find a small molecule which disrupts the translation of a critical protein during phages infections. In silico screening was performed using the software Molecular Operating Environment and an effective compound was confirmed through further tests.:::2020
