SZU-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Blueism - A novel eco-friendly scheme for jeans dyeing and washing:::Producing every ton of jeans will pollute 200 tons of water due to the discharged 2500 toxic chemical substances, causing catastrophic effects on the environment. What's worse, in South China’s Pearl River Delta, the use of traditional methods for jeans fraying such as strong corrosive chemical reagents and sandblasting cause irreversible damage to the workers’ health. This year we designed an eco-friendly, efficient system for jeans factory. Our system includes two parts. In the first part, we produced thermostable beta-glucosidase via recombinant E.coli to synthesize Gardenia Blue, a stable, environmental friendly pigment with high dyeing efficiency. After dyeing, we used recombinant cellulase (endo-glucanase) for fraying in replacement of the stone-washing process. Besides, we designed a hardware to adjust our products to jeans manufacturing process. In brief, our automatic green system can replace manual dyeing and fraying process, while reducing pollution and protecting the health of workers.:::2020
