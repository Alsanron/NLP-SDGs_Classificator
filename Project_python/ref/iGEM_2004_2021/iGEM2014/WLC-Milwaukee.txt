WLC-Milwaukee:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Sugar Rush:::In parts of the world suitable land to raise grazing animals is limited so these animals are either not raised or are malnourished. Animals can get more nourishment from a smaller amount of land if they increase digestion efficiency by converting more sugar polymers (cellulose) from plants into usable sugars. We aim to construct an Escherichia coli strain capable of secreting cellulose-degrading enzymes in an animalâ€™s gut. This strain will contain a plasmid that expresses the bglS, yesZ, and xynA genes from Bacillus subtilis that code for three enzymes that cleave different bonds in cellulose. These enzymes will be secreted from the well-studied probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 cell by a Type I secretion system whose genes are also engineered into the plasmid. In raising animals with this engineered bacterium, we hope to increase the amount of available calories for nutrient-deprived populations while having minimal effects on established cultural practices.:::2014
