UCL:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Azo-Remediation Chassis: a bioengineered process preventing accumulation of carcinogenic azo-dye products in industrial wastewater.:::Azo-dyes are the main synthetic chemical colourant used in industrial manufacture of clothing, cosmetics, food, and more. During the dyeing process of materials, unbound azo-dyes are washed off into water bodies as industrial/wastewater effluent. Some azo-dyes, and their breakdown products, have proven to be of major environmental and health concern worldwide due to their mutagenic potential. The UCL 2014 team proposes harnessing various azo-dye degrading enzymes to create BioBricks for a novel Azo-Remediation Chassis (ARC). This would be capable of sensing, degrading, and decolourising azo-dyes, and ultimately detoxifying the breakdown products created. A bioprocess employing the ARC in an industrial setting has been developed and various modes of operation explored. This may serve as an end-of-pipe, lucrative addition to facilities expelling azo-dye contaminants. Furthermore, xenobiological approaches to biosafety are considered and a proposal for an “azotrophic” organism paves the way for a new era in synthetic biology biosafety.:::2014
