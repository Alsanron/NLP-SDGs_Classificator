SCUT-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Programmed polyketide synthesis:::Polyketides are a class of secondary metabolites produced by almost all living organisms. These are structurally complex organic compounds that are often highly active biologically. Many pharmaceuticals are derived from or inspired by polyketides. For the heterologous expression of polyketide synthases(PKSs), the main method of the technology is transferring full gene cluster into heterologous host strains. However, such method canâ€™t synthetize various polyketides by the same polyketide synthase domains. This year, we are dedicated to using PKS domains as a synthetic unit to diminish the size of the target gene fragments. Meanwhile, the host strain E. coli should be genetically modified in order to enable the synthesis of the corresponding substrate. In this way, PKS domains can be assembled more quickly, enabling the programmed polyketide synthesis. In addition, we can design synthesis pathway of polyketide independently. This system can select the corresponding synthesis polyketide synthase domains to synthetize polyketide programmedly.:::2014
