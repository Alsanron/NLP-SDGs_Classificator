NU_Kazakhstan:::Asia:::Kazakhstan:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.Coli derived camelid p53 antibodies: a way to detect cancer in saliva:::Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a malignant tumor with 640,000 new cases annually worldwide. Saliva testing is non-invasive procedure that allows detecting OSCC biomarkers. Elevated level of p53 protein was identified in OSCC patients at different stages of the disease. Camelid antibodies containing only variable regions, nanobodies (VHH) and single-chain variable regions (scFv) with VH and VL, are becoming popular in research and diagnostics. It was identified that VL region showed higher affinity for p53 than VHH, and dimerization of VL regions increases their affinity up to ten folds. Camelid antibodies can be conjugated to other proteins without loss of function. They can be expressed and secreted in such common model organism as E. coli, reducing the cost of antibody production. Therefore, the aim of this project is to design biosensor to detect p53 in saliva samples for OSCC diagnosis using nanobodies expressed in bacteria.:::2014
