Reading:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cyanobacterial photovoltaic cell: electrons from unexpected places:::Photovoltaics are one of the main sources of renewable energy and are likely to become more widely used in the future, but their production is expensive and involves toxic materials. Biological photovoltaics (BPVs) have the potential to provide a cheaper and more sustainable alternative, especially where energy demand is lower. They could power the social, welfare and economic growth for the 1.2 billion people without access to electricity. BPVs take advantage of photosynthetic organisms by harnessing the electrons they produce from water and sunlight. We aim to increase their output by redirecting electron flow in the cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. To achieve this we have targeted areas in the photosynthetic electron transport chain to increase electrons, and pilus production to improve transfer to the anode.:::2014
