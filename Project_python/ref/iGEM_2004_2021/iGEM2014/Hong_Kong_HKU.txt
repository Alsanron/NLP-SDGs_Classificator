Hong_Kong_HKU:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Flexible Strategy for Cytoplasmic Compartmentalization in Bacteria:::It is well-known that prokaryotes do not have cytoplasmic compartmentalization. However, certain bacteria possess gene clusters that encodes five to six small, structural proteins that self-assembles into a hollow, icosahedral-like organelles called Bacterial Micro-Compartments (BMCs). We constructed a flexible plasmid with various features that allows convenient, customized functionalization of these microcompartments, both externally and internally. As a proof-of-principle project, we also attempted to purify the neo-functionalized BMCs and test their biological activity both in vivo and in vitro. Based on our generalized system, there would be more interest in utilizing this remarkable evolutionary product for multiple biotechnological applications, from solving environmental issues, to medicinal applications, or even metabolic engineering and novel scientific research tools.:::2014
