ArtCenter_MDP:::North America:::United States:::Art & Design:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Car Pools:::Synthetic biology assumes a future for modified organisms beyond the lab. Biofuel research is currently focusing on genetically engineered algae to produce gasoline, with the goal of one day being commercially distributed. This objective has created a network of open-ponds for algae production, dispersed across the southwest of the United States. As synthetic biology moves out of the lab into the wild, what are the ecological effects associated with the release of a modified organism? Car Pools is a series of simulations that examine potential ecological effects associated with the public release of modified algae for biofuel production. The project draws on current open-pond algae production methods to imagine a future fuel-pool infrastructure for Los Angeles, a metropolis built for cars and where there are more than 43,000 swimming pools. The project plays out different scales of interaction, the home, the neighborhood, and the city, to imagine future ecosystems.:::2014
