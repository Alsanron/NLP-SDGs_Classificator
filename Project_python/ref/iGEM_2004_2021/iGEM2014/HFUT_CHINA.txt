HFUT_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioFunctional Designer::: With the increase of influence which belongs to iGEM Competition, a growing number of teams involved in the game. Each team brainstorming to design many valuable model. There are a significant contribution to the field of synthetic biology. But it is a hard thing for people to understand the wide variety of models. Therefore , it is necessary to find solution to understand the integral information of the various models through a small part of it. Sometimes though people know the specific composition of the model, but its function is unclear. We are committed to the development of a software. It can help people to solve the above-mentioned problem in the first time. It could recommend corresponding parts should be used for different functions team proposed.:::2014
