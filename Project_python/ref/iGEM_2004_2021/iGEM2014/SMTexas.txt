SMTexas:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine(P):::High School:::Accepted:::VOColi: Detecting Lung Cancer Biomarkers:::Inspired by the olfactory ability of canines to detect diseases, we will pursue a long-term project that revolves around the creation of a minimally invasive and inexpensive detection system for lung cancer, through the identification of exhaled biomarkers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death around the world. Twenty-two volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been distinctly found in the breath of affected patients, creating a viable “fingerprint” for reliable detection (Horvath et al.). This year we focused on creating biosensors for three VOCs: ethanol, formaldehyde, and xylene. We plan to create genetic circuit systems for aldB induced by ethanol, frmR recognition of formaldehyde, and xylR activated by xylene. Our current device will utilize three reporter proteins (CFP, GFP, RFP) to indicate the concentrations of the three VOCs present in an exhaled sample. This research will eventually go into creating a conclusive test for use in the developing world.:::2014
