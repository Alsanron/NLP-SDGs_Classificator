HZAU-China:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Rewirable Circuit: an elegant means of systems integration:::Standardization is one of the greatest features in synthetic biology. However, synthetic biologists meet obstacles when combining parts and modules to create more sophisticated systems using the standardization principle. In our project, we created some modules to reintroduce the conception of "adaptability", which is one intrinsic characteristic of natural living systems. Processing modules can alter the way they process information in order to adapt to environmental changes. The circuit we designed can rewire its connections between parts and devices to implement multiple functions with the help of site-specific recombination systems. Host overload and unexpected interplay between modules are prevented in our design. Besides, we designed a post-transcriptional control in the input module and an RNA-level fluorescence in the output module to make the system work effectively. Our design may lead to a forward step towards system integration in synthetic biology.:::2014
