BIT-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.co-Lock:::BIT-China designed a genetic lock E.co-Lock in bacteria to keep important strains safe from ecological threatening or commercial loss even when they are accidentally leaked out or intentionally stolen. This bio-lock, likened to a digital combination lock, allows bacteria to grow only if three different inducers as password is put in order. To realize the code function three layered AND logic gates combined with sRNA system are built up. The corresponding sRNA selectively inhibits gene expression in AND gates to control the order of the password. MIN system is re-designed to inhibit cell division, which will be turned on to maintain the strain to a low density. In a word, locked bacteria are allowed to grow only when the input is correct; thus strains would remain low density and are effectively locked up. Therefore, commercially valuable or potentially hazardous strains will be under more strict control with different customized E.co-Locks.:::2014
