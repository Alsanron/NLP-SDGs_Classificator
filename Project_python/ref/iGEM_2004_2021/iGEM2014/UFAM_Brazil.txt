UFAM_Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mercury Bacter:::Mercury (Hg) is a widely used metal in mining and industrial processes. It’s easily spread in the environment and is considered a global pollutant, even reaching environments which have never been exposed to it. Among the contaminant metals, Hg is one of the most toxic and the only one able to undergo bio-magnification in most food chains. Besides, being the only known metal that causes human death through ingestion of contaminated aquatic organisms. To solve this problem, we used a bacterial mechanism of mercury resistance - operon mer - as inspiration. Mer operon is composed mainly by MerR, MerT, MerP and MerA proteins responsible for transport and reduction of mercury, being up regulated in its presence. Our project aims to develop contaminated water’s treatment using mer proteins for bioremediation, attach a fluorescent protein for bio-detection and metallothionein for bioaccumulation in order to reduce damage caused by mercury in the ecosystem.:::2014
