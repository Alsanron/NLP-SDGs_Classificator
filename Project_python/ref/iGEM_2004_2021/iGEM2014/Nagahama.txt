Nagahama:::Asia:::Jersey:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::One E.coli has one function theory:::The chemotaxis is a phenomenon to take action with the directionality for the concentration gradient of the existing specific chemical substance around a straight object. We make various systems by using chemoattractant. We keep one function in one E.coli. This theory means to make simple plasmid. The following is one example. Weâ€™d like to collect cadmium in water. Therefore we use two kinds of E.coli. One catches Cadmium. The other attracts all E.coli by using chemoattractant. Catches E.coli displays metallothionein a protein combines a heavy metal. Cadmium is a kind of heavy metal. The other synthesizes aspartic acid (Asp) one kind of chemoattractant. All E.coli gather in the E.coli synthesizes Asp. To use these E.coli, finally Cadmium will be caught.:::2014
