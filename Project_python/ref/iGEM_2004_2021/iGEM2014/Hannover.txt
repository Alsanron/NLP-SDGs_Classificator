Hannover:::Europe:::Germany:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Plant against â€“ Removing heavy metals from nature:::Plant against: Our title reveals the main organism of our project: plants. We designed a protein for plants, Top4-Metal Binding Protein (T4-MBP), composed of four different domains for the binding of heavy metals. We have chosen the domains from different organisms considering heavy metals with a global relevance: copper, arsenic, zinc and cadmium. Our goal is to produce the T4-MBP in plants, where it will be transported out of the plant cells to attach itself to the cellulose. The binding of the heavy metals via plants is supposed to work in water or on ground to clean up many different areas containing heavy metals. Furthermore we have other fields of application, like the purification of drinking water. With our project we want to provide the world an easy way to remove heavy metals where chemical solutions are lacking.:::2014
