Tec-Monterrey:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A novel cancer therapy delivered by bacteriophages in E. coli that triggers apoptosis:::By harnessing the inherent ability of facultative anaerobic bacteria to colonize and grow in tumoral environments, this project aims to develop a bacterial cancer therapy. A genetically modified E. coli will have knockouts in the lpp and msbB genes, which encode for the Braunâ€™s lipoprotein and for the myristic acid moiety transporter of the lipopolysaccharide respectively. These genes are known to trigger an immune response in the human body; by deleting them, the impact of a bacterial intravenous administration will be reduced. Furthermore, these bacteria will produce M13-modified bacteriophages under the control of a quorum sensing system. They will be able to bind to cancerous cells, internalize and transfect them with two different genes: apoptin, responsible for an apoptotic protein specific for cancerous cells and a survivin siRNA. The latter will inhibit the uncontrollable growth characteristic of cancer cells, making them more vulnerable to apoptosis.:::2014
