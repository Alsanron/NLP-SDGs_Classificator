Jilin_China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Intelligent Scout and Sniper for Freshwater Toxin::: Microcystin LR, one increasingly common toxin in freshwater, affects the liver as hepatotoxin, causing nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and even acute liver failure when ingested.Of all types of Microcystin LR , MC-LR has the most deleterious influence on the environment as well as human beings. Therefore, we strives to explore simple methods for detection of this toxin and finding ways to alleviate water pollution caused by this toxin. During algae bloom break out, a strain of Pseudomonas expresses a series of proteins, named Mlr, that could decompose algal toxin.we use E.coli instead of Pesudomonas to improve the expression of Mlr proteins and constructs a system to detect the contents of toxin in water and early alarm the algal bloom. If Microsystin LR is our enemy that poisons aquatic organisms and human body, then the engineering bacteria act as the intelligent scout and sniper for this freshwater toxin.:::2014
