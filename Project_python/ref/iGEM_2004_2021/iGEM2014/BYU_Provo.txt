BYU_Provo:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Reclaiming water reclamation: Engineering microbes for enhanced sewage treatment:::Wastewater facilities face challenges in effectively processing waste including residual antibiotics, excess nitrates, biofilm buildup and low survival rates of microbes essential to biodegredation. Using the native sludge bacteria Nitrosospira multiformis and Nitrosomonas eutropha as chassis we inserted genes to produce erythromycin esterase B and Î²-lactamase to breakdown azythromycin and penicillin. We also inserted nirS, norB, norC, and nosZ from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to convert nitrates into nitrogen gas, as well as genes to produce dispersin, amylase, and AHL-lactonase to inhibit biofilm formation. To increase bacteriophage resistance, prophage in the Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas genomes were identified and used to build a guide RNA region for a Type II CRISPR system. By deleting the serA and serB genes we engineered serine auxotrophs to prevent release of our modified microbes. These improvements will help reduce antibiotic resistance, increase water reclamation, prevent algal blooms, and allow more biomass to be harvested.:::2014
