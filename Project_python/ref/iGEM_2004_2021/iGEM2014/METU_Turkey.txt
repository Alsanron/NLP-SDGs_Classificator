METU_Turkey:::Europe:::Turkey:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Degredo PETronum:::The usage of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) like plastic bottles is one of the biggest problem of our era. Many plastic bottles are not reusable. Some tougher, reusable plastic bottles may cause cancer. The main disadvantage of plastic bottles is that so many of them end up in landfills instead of being recycled. It takes hundreds of years for plastic bottles to biodegrade, and the degrading process emits toxic chemicals into the air. We may alter the destiny of plastic in useful way. Our project aims to keep the environment clean with the degradation of PET to pyruvate by E. coli. With this project, while the environment will be cleaned from PET, the E. coli would add pyruvate to the cell cycle and use it as a new energy source for itself. We will biodegrade PET to Catechol. Then catechol to 2-hydroxymuconate resulting in pyruvate.:::2014
