British_Columbia:::North America:::Canada:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Darwin's Metals:::The local mining industry is an important economic sector for British Columbia, Canada. With increasing mandates calling for “sustainable mining initiatives”, one of the aims is to reduce the environmental impact of mining by increasing mining efficiency through innovative ways. Our project seeks to improve physical separation processes by targeting chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) and sphalerite (ZnS) minerals in natural ores using unique metal-binding peptides displayed on the S-layer of Caulobacter crescentus. We furthered our work by developing a novel directed evolution apparatus that will provide us new tools in improving ore separation, thereby granting our technology versatility and adaptability for biomining. This biological approach provides an alternative in mineral processing that involves fewer harmful chemicals, greater selectivity and better recovery of metals in complex or lower grade ores.:::2014
