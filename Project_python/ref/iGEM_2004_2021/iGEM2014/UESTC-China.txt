UESTC-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Plants vs HCHO:::Our team, named UESTC_China, is from one of the most livable city, Chengdu, the hometown of pandas. Even before we decided what to do in this game, we all agreed on that we should do something to save our planet. And then came the idea of "Plants vs HCHO". HCHO is toxic gas appears in every single room which is newly decorated. Not only is it smelly, but also cause various of desease, like skin and mucous membrane irritation, immunity or memory decline, drowsiness, fatigue, cancer, allergic dermatitis. To remove HCHO, we added FALDH,FDH,HPS/PHI to increase our plant's ability for absorbing and degrading formaldehyde. There are other two more important enzymes in our project. One is to enlarge the stoma, and another is for male sterility system which for safety. In the future,we sincerely chrish the hope that our work will be put to use in our everyday life.:::2014
