NTU_Taida:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Skin-guardian:::The oil oozes and gives the skin a greasy shine, and thatâ€™s one of the most fearsome nightmare of human. We expect ourselves to solve this problem by producing skin-care ingredients with fatty acid metabolism related gene circuits in our gene modified e-coil, skin-guardian. In our project, we have three kinds of skin-care ingredients to skin whitening, keratin decomposition and fragrance producing respectively. When skin-guardians uptake excess oil and sebum through fadl, it will synthesis acetyl coenzyme a, which will change the structure of repressor, fadr losing its affinity to promoter. And our skin-guardian can started to translate genes, make us looks fair and tender. Living through numerous theoretically and practical examinations, our skin- guardians proofed itself to be a great expectations in aesthetic medicine.:::2014
