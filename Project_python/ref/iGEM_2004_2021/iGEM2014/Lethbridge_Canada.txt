Lethbridge_Canada:::North America:::Canada:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::A Synthetic Biology Approach to Preventing Increasing Antibiotic Resistance:::In April 2014, the World Health Organization released a report about the increasing danger of antibiotic resistance stating “A post-antibiotic era – in which common infections and minor injuries can kill ... is a very real possibility for the 21st century.” People continue to misuse antibiotics by not finishing their prescription, using them to combat inappropriate pathogens like viruses, and using them liberally in agriculture. When this happens, antibiotics can enter the water table. This selective pressure causes organisms in the water to adapt and become resistant to the antibiotics. Reducing the amount of antibiotics in the water supply will help to reduce this selective pressure. To remediate antibiotics in the environment we plan to generate a strain of E. coli that will export an enzyme known as Beta-lactamase to degrade Beta-lactam antibiotics. Ultimately, this will help reduce the selective pressure causing the evolution for antibiotic resistance.:::2014
