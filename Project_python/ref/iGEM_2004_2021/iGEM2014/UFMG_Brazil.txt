UFMG_Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Colonyeast:::Colorectal cancer is a widespread form of cancer that develops on the large intestine. Its diagnosis requires extremely invasive techniques, such as colonoscopy, which is one of the main problems associated to its early detection. On our institution, a modified probiotic strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated from local beverage. Our objective is to introduce this strain as a new probiotic chassis on iGEM, and also to develop a gene circuit that allows it to detect one or more stool biomarkers for colorectal cancer on the intestine. We chose L-DNA (long DNA molecules) as biomarker, and designed a chimeric protein using TALE DNA-Binding Domains and a split version of mCherry that can detect certain repetitive sequences on DNA and emit fluorescence, which when measured serve as proxy for the DNA size.:::2014
