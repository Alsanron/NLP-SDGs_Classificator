Shenzhen_SFLS:::Asia:::China:::Food & Energy(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Lǘdagunr:::Our project is named as Lǘdagunr, whose chinese meaning is a kind of traditional snacks from China. Aflatoxin is a highly toxic substance which exists on grains. The most poisonous kind of aflatoxin is Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). Since it is difficult to degrade the toxin, we decided to use ScFv (single chain variable region fragments), an antibody, to neutralize it. We used ScFv to neutralize AFB1 because it has been used before and its molecular modification is easy. We used ScFv, SH3 ligand and 6*his-tag to construct fusion protein so that it can combine with SH3 domain. In this way we can use cells to recover the ScFv that have been expressed out to reduce the antibody-antigen complex that exists on grains. We anchored SH3 domain on E.coli's cell membrane LGT to recover the ScFv. Keywords: AflatoxinB1(AFB1),ScFv, SH3 ligand, SH3 domain, LGT:::2014
