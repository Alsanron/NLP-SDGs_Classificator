Aachen:::Europe:::Germany:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cellock Holmes - a novel SynBio platform to detect pathogens:::Detection and identification of microbial contaminations on hard surfaces are vital to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections and to alleviate the pressure on health care systems. Existing techniques pose limitations, as they do not combine effective, economical and rapid detection. The Cellock Holmes project aims to tackle these challenges all at once. By combining native microbial sensing systems, such as quorum sensing, with open source biology, hardware and software, a novel two-dimensional biosensor is developed. Cellock Holmesâ€™ simple, modular and open design enables the end user to test solid surfaces for microbial contamination without any expensive equipment or highly trained personnel. The working concept is demonstrated using one of the most prevalent human pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The versatile biosensing system, however, can be easily customized to detect other pathogens as well.:::2014
