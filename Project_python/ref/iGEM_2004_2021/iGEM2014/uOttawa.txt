uOttawa:::North America:::Canada:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering Fate: Creating Autonomous Decision making in Yeast:::Cellular decision-making is the process by which cells assume unique, functionally different states, to address various needs of an organism. However, due to a lack of well-characterized devices capable of producing multiple states, the design of organisms with multiple changing functionalities has been hampered. This year, we have engineered yeast that can make multiple decisions based on environmental cues and indefinitely maintain their state until conditions change. We will achieve this by implementing a synthetic cellular decision making transcriptional network: the tri-stable switch. We have designed and tested new dual input promoters that use transcriptional activators as both activators and repressors. We have also generated a mathematical model of our system from our constructed promoter characterizations, along with continuing with our outreach program to elementary and high school students. We believe that by emulating cellular decision making mechanisms we will, one day, be able to manipulate existing systems.:::2014
