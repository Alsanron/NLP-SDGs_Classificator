BUGSS_Baltimore:::North America:::United States:::Community Labs:::Community Lab:::Accepted:::Polymerase to the people!:::The DIY bio community has developed a number of open source, inexpensive designs for laboratory equipment necessary for synthetic biology, but the prices of commercial DNA polymerases remain a significant financial hurdle for labs operating on shoestring budgets. Founding members of the Baltimore Underground Science Space (BUGSS) began to address this problem in the 2010 iGEM competition, developing a Biobrick for Taq polymerase synthesis. BUGSS has built on this earlier work, developing a new Biobrick for Pfu DNA polymerase, which offers a replication error rate approximately 6 fold lower than that of Taq. The development of this Biobrick began with the amplification and cloning of the pol gene for Pfu DNA polymerase from contaminant DNA in a commercial stock enzyme. Modifications were made for compatibility with Biobrick Assembly Standard 10. BUGSS is now developing a kit for easy purification of Pfu polymerase to reduce the cost of this essential tool.:::2014
