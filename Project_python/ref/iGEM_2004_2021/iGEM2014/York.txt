York:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::EcoCADMUS ( E. coli CAdmium DecontaMination Universal System):::Metal and sulfate contaminated wastewater, generated both from industry and mineral processing, is a worldwide problem. Cadmium is one of the most commonly encountered toxic heavy metals in contaminated water and is known to cause severe damage to aquatic biodiversity and to humans. Furthermore, the removal of contaminants from wastewater is mainly based on mechanical/chemical processes that present drawbacks such as inefficiency, high energy costs and high technological cost. The University of York iGEM team has developed a new approach to remove cadmium and sulfates from wastewater using genetically engineered Escherichia coli. Our circuit is activated by a cadmium inducible promoter and is divided into two interconnected mechanisms: (i)increasing sulphate uptake and its targeting into cysteine production by engineering the cysteine biosynthesis pathway; (ii) increasing cadmium uptake and targeting of the free-cysteine into metal binding proteins (phytochelatins) for metal chelation/stabilization inside and outside cell.:::2014
