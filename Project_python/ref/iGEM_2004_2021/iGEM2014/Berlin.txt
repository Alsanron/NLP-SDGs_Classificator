Berlin:::Europe:::Germany:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A remote control for E. coli:::As the first iGEM team from Berlin, we decided to construct a simple BioBrick that enables synthetic biologists to remotely control the movement of E. coli. A seemingly simple and non-invasive mechanism for this remote control is the use of magnetic fields. By altering the iron homeostasis of E. coli, we want to increase the total iron level of the cytosol. By sequestering iron in a ferritin protein, iron crystals are formed and the cell is detoxified. We will work with other metal binding proteins such as metallothioneins and phytochelatin synthases in order to create ferromagnetic crystals. Furthermore, we will search for the optimal conditions which yield the most efficient formation of magnetic nanoparticles in E. coli. Once we have discovered the best way to magnetize E. coli bacteria, we will build and characterize suitable BioBricks that can be used to remote control the cellular movement of E. coli.:::2014
