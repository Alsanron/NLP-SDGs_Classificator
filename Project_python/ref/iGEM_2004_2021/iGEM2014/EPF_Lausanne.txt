EPF_Lausanne:::Europe:::Switzerland:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioPad:::The BioPad project aims to study how biological signals can be detected and processed in a fast and precise way. To illustrate this vision of biology, our team created the worldâ€™s first biological TouchPad. On top of serving as a living TouchPad, the BioPad will serve as a fast antibiotic screening device, an apparatus allowing the study of gene activation, and a perfect way to introduce synthetic biology and bio-hardware to the general public via a graspable project. Our BioPad is made of three components: touch responsive organisms, a custom microfluidic chip, and a mini-computer serving as a signal detector. Once touched, the BioPad responds quickly by emitting light or fluorescence. The biological engineering behind our project combines protein complementation techniques to dimerization in E. Coli and S. cerevisiae stress pathways. Split reporter proteins from fluorescent proteins, and luciferases were fused to the dimerizing proteins, allowing signal emission upon stress.:::2014
