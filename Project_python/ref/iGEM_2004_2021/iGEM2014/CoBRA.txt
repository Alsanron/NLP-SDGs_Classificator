CoBRA:::North America:::Canada:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::CoBRA, Cochrane Alberta - Stopped In Their Little Blue Tracks:::While mountain pine beetle are a natural part of the southern Rocky Mountain ecosystem, recent beetle outbreaks are larger than those of the past. Decades of fire suppression have created large tracts of older pine forest that provide a highway for beetle expansion. The lack of fire, combined with a recent warming trend, means that the beetles are now occurring farther east, farther north and at higher elevations than ever before. This is cause for concern as the mountain national parks form the margin between the beetle outbreak in British Columbia and commercial forests in Alberta. Our project will focus on building a bacterial plasmid that will produce and secrete the chitinase enzyme which will in turn be able to break down the chitin rich membranes of the BSF while leaving the tree unaffected and thus able to use its own defences to deal with the mountain pine beetle.:::2014
