GenetiX_Tec_CCM:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Biodetection of Anoxia in Lake Xochimilco:::Lake Xochimilco in Mexico City faces a condition of extreme pollution which endangers the endemic species; many of which are near extinction. Oxygen levels depletion in the lake directly affect the flora and fauna, making it less hospitable or even deadly. Our goal is to produce a biosensor that can easily and inexpensively detect anoxia in different regions of the lake. Using an oxygen promoter in addition with the biological markers RFP and GFP we could theoretically detect low dissolved oxygen levels in water samples. In addition, we intend to use a second construct with an Iron promoter to detect iron concentrations that also endanger the sustainability of living organisms in the lake. Once we identify critical regions of the Lake, our report could incentivate Civil Council and authorities to propose concrete legal initiatives to reduce pollution in the identified areas and start remediation campaigns.:::2014
