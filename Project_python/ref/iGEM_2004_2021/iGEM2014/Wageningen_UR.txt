Wageningen_UR:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BananaGuard: Biocontrol of Fusarium oxysporum using Pseudomonas putida:::Fusarium species are known to infect a wide range of crops and cause large losses in agriculture. Our project aims to use an engineered strain of the native soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida to protect banana plants against Fusarium oxysporum infection. Upon sensing of fusaric acid excreted by F. oxysporum, fungal growth inhibitors will be produced by P. putida to prevent infection of the banana plants. To minimize the environmental impact of the fungal inhibitors to the soil microbiome, the bacteria will contain a kill switch that will cause it to terminate once the threat of F. oxysporum to the bananas has been alleviated. Furthermore, a double dependent plasmid system will be used to prevent the spread of artificial genetic material to surrounding soil bacteria. In summary, we hope to develop a showcase for the use of synthetic biology in agriculture in a safe and sustainable way.:::2014
