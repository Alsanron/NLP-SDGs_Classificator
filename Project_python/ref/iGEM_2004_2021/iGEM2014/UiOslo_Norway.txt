UiOslo_Norway:::Europe:::Norway:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MicrOrganizer – The E.coli bodybuilder:::We are aiming to build a system for organizing E. coli in a predetermined way, a MicrOrganizer. We are trying to create biobricks that gives E. coli surface identity, and at the same time binds one E. coli bacterium physically to another E. coli bacterium. This binding will also transfer a signal to the inside of the bacteria and induce gene expression. We want to do this by using the split enzyme principle of the LacZ gene. This gene codes for β-galactosidase which can be split into two parts: β-galactosidase α and β-galactosidase β. The functional enzyme consisting of one alpha and one beta part hydrolyses lactose into galactose and glucose. This process produces on some occasions allolactose which can be transported back into the bacteria and induces the Lac-operon, and thus gene expression. To express each enzyme part on the bacterial surface we will couple them to autotransporter proteins.:::2014
