The_Tech_Museum:::North America:::United States:::Community Labs:::Community Lab:::Accepted:::e.Mosaic:::Our goal is to create an activity where Tech Museum visitors with no biology background can become part of our team and can engage in the hands-on experience of engineering a bacteria. In our project, they are guided through the transformation of a plasmid into e.coli and how we randomized the amount each of the three color reporters are expressed. When the transformed bacteria grow, each colony appears as a different color, essentially creating bacterial "pixels" representing a particular combination of the protein levels of each reporter. Visitors take these to a scanning station that uses computer-vision software to quantify the color and intensity of each colony. This is the first time a museum has entered this competition and our team is prototyping ways we as an institution can offer novel activities for our community to both learn and develop the skills of future innovators.:::2014
