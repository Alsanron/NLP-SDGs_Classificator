OU_Norman:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::How to train your Clostridia:::Due to environmental concerns and fuel prices, much research has been invested in alternative sources of fuels. Development of biofuels, in particular, is beneficial in the sense that it provides a renewable source of energy with a wide range of energy densities. Clostridium acetobutylicum has great potential for producing biofuels due to its native ABE (acetone, butanol, ethanol) fermentation pathways and its ability to metabolize a variety of carbon substrates. In addition to C. acetobutylicumâ€™s native pathways, the introduction of non-native genes makes it possible to expand the types of alcohols produced. The goal of this research endeavor was to develop an iGEM compliant Clostridial shuttle vector to introduce genes for the production of branched and longer chain alcohols within Clostridial species. We are in the process of testing our shuttle vector and plan to compare alcohol production efficiency between anaerobes and aerobes.:::2014
