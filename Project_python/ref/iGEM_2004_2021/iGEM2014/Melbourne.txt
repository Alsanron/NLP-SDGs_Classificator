Melbourne:::Asia:::Australia:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biosynthesis of star peptides in E. coli:::Star-shaped peptides are a promising biomaterial being proposed for use in nanomedicine. While star peptides have conventionally been synthesised in vitro, the University of Melbourne iGEM team aims to use the peptide-synthesis machinery of E. coli to produce these peptides in vivo. To this end, star peptide precursors will be expressed and purified from E. coli and then reacted to form stars. The arms of these stars may be functionalised with various biomacromolecules, including peptides and proteins. By incorporating various molecules in the star arms (e.g. antimicrobial peptides or anticancer drugs), the star peptides may be applied in a variety of biomedical contexts as drug delivery vehicles or macromolecular linkers. The project notably blends synthetic biology and synthetic chemistry, contributing to both fields by developing a bacterial platform technology for peptide-based nanoparticles.:::2014
