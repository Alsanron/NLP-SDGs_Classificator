ITESM-Guadalajara:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Entrepreneurship:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of a novel ecological, economic and biotechnological production process of Chitosan in Mexico:::Our project, “Kitosan Factory” (KF), consists in the production of a valuable biopolymer called Chitosan from the shrimp shell wastes using an ecological, economical and biotechnological process. Chitosan has a global market value of $20 billion USD and it is widely used in pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries, among many others, due to its biodegradability, non-toxicity and biocompatibility properties. The traditional extraction method involves the use of acids and alkalis that makes the process expensive, highly pollutant and non-standardized; that’s why we propose a novel method using B. subtilis and a modified E. coli, which contains 6 enzymes capable of cutting and deacetylating chitin for the generation of chitosan. This way, KF provides tools for the innovation and development of new biotechnological products, the creation of jobs, the solution of an existing waste disposal problem and the education of people about the advantages of biotechnology in Mexico.:::2014
