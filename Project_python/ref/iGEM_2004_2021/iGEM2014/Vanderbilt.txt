Vanderbilt:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Scenthase: Cellular Terpene Biosynthesis:::Long before the advent of modern science, it was recognized that certain plants are capable of producing compounds of immense value. From a single class of molecule, the terpenoids, come properties including agents with therapeutic qualities against maladies ranging from cancer to infection, antimicrobials, natural pesticides, rich flavorants, and fragrant scents. However, the utilization of these remarkable compounds has been severely hindered by their rarity in nature: many are found in only a small number of species and produced at levels measured in parts per million. Synthetic biology offers an opportunity to resolve this problem, by applying metabolic engineering in order to create cellular factories. Our project seeks to use the ideas of synthetic biology to develop a commercially viable strategy for the efficient production of a wide range of terpenoids.:::2014
