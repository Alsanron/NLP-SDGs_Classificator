Edinburgh:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RewirED: Introducing a new intercellular signalling mechanism based on metabolic pathways - Metabolic Wiring:::The Edinburgh team is introducing a newly invented inter-cellular communication method to iGEM, called Metabolic Wiring. This signalling method uses intermediates from metabolic pathways as signalling molecules, and is superior to the conventionally used quorum sensing due to improved orthogonality, wider range of signalling molecules available, and extensibility. Our project aims to implement the system in Escherichia coli and adapt it to BioBrick format. We will develop three metabolic wires using aromatic degradation, sugar degradation, and cis-genic wires. To demonstrate its potential, the three wires will then be implemented in a population control system and used to regulate the growth of a single bacterial strain in a mixed population, depending on the population sizes of the remaining strains. Stability of composition of the bacterial populations can thus be increased and more complex biochemical reactions enabled. We will also attempt an alternative use of the wires in an intracellular genetic circuit.:::2014
