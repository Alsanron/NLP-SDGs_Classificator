NRP-UEA-Norwich:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Green Canary: Induction of chromoproteins to signal plant-pathogen interactions:::Food security is a prominent health challenge faced by the increasing global population, which is exacerbated by high loss of crop yields to pests and diseases. Applying synthetic biology approaches, we aim to produce proof of concept, sentinel plants that will diagnose the presence of two pathogens, Xanthomonas oryzae and Xanthomonas campestris. The plant sentinels will produce a chromoprotein output, observable by the human eye, within 48 hours of pathogen infection. The sentinels would allow growers to apply appropriate agrochemical application before the diseases progress to symptomatic pathogenesis in neighbouring crops. This approach will reduce crop losses whilst decreasing the necessity for continual use of agrochemicals. Furthermore, we are constructing a series of BioBricks that will allow Golden Gate assembly to assist cloning of transcriptional units within the iGEM standard. These important developments will aid future iGEM teams to work with plant chassisâ€™ as well as utilise Golden Gate technology.:::2014
