USTC-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioPano-A platform which helps you figure out relationships between various substances in the bacteria.:::BioPano is a data visualizational open source software specially designed for biologists, which can be used to show gene regulation and metabolic network. When a node is selected, our software can quickly form a net with the nodes close to it. When a gene sequence is provided, such as a BioBrick part, our software can use homology method to predict the impact it gives on the gene regulatory network. Furthermore, the software provides users with various interfaces so that the entire network, or a part of it, can be exported into corresponding format which can be imported into other professional softwares for network analysis.On this platform, users can create, modify and complete different biological networks based on the information they get from online collaboration.:::2014
