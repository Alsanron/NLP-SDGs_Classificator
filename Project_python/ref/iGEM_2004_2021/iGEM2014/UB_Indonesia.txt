UB_Indonesia:::Asia:::Indonesia:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cervical Cancer Care+ (C3+):::Cervical cancer is deadliest disease in women, worldwide. The diseases caused by HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) and can be prevented by natural antioxidant consumption, such as tea that has epigallocathecin gallate (EGCG). Precancerous changes of the cervix can be seen with Pap smear test and colposcopy. However, the detections procedure cause uncomfortable and depending on oncologist.Therefore, UB-Indonesia team developed a Cervical Cancer Care + (C3+) to prevent the cervical cancer epidemic. First project, we have developed very simple detection kit for HPV DNA based on colorimetry and equipped with detection software-based of mobile phone applications. The software will suggest user for next step to do according the detection result. Second project, we developed siRNA to over-produce EGCG on tea.Third project, we have developed a robust Screening Cancer Therapy kit (SCT).The SCT provide easy tool to discovery particular drug based on HPV type or personalized patient character for cervical cancer treatment.:::2014
