Gaston_Day_School:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of Tools for the Switch to Isobutanol as a Biofuel:::There are several issues in the switch from petroleum to alternative fuels. One problem is what to do with existing wastes including leaking coal ash ponds. Another issue is the efficient production of an alcohol that is effective as a fuel, easy and inexpensive to produce, and will function within the current infrastructure. This year, we improved the sensitivity of our Cadmium detector using sensitivity tuners. We are developing a strain of E. coli resistant to isobutanol and cloning GlmY, GlmZ and IlvM which are genes involved in the isobutanol production pathway . Addition of sensitivity tuners has improved the cadmium detector approximately 4-fold, from 10mM to 2.5mM, still over the federal limit. The isobutanol resistant strain of E. coli can tolerate 3 times as much isobutanol as the original strain. Finally, we have successfully isolated the glmZ coding region and have cloned it into the BioBrick vector.:::2014
