Heidelberg:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Ring of Fire:::Biology works with networks of interacting proteins and controlling their functions is fundamental to Synthetic Biology. Conventionally, control depends on gene expression, however modifications made after expression enable fast and precise regulation. Our team has designed a universal toolbox for modifying proteins post-translationally utilising inteins and sortases. In the natural process of protein splicing auto-catalytic inteins excises themself leaving the flanking chains reconnected. Similarly, sortases identify, cut and rejoin protein sequences. Comprising a variety of standardised parts our toolbox can specifically change whole amino-acid sequences therefore regulating proteins via assembly or protein cleavage. Very curiously, these methods enable circularisation of enzymes rendering them thermodynamically stable and resistant to exoproteases, which will be applicable in biotechnological procedures requiring high temperatures. Our software selects the best technique for circularisation and a distributed computing platform facilitates the calculations. Taken together we provide a new foundational advance introducing full post-translational modification to Synthetic Biology.:::2014
