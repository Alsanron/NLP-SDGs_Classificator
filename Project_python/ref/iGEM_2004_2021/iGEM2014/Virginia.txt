Virginia:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NyGone: A Bacterial Biofilter for Nylon Microplastics:::Microplastics, small plastic pieces with diameters of 5 millimeters or less which are present in commercial products and form from degrading macroplastics, are a growing threat to both public health and the environment. Our project design is centered on the creation of BioBricks that facilitate the formation of an E.coli biofilm that captures and degrades nylon microplastics. Biofilm formation is achieved through the overexpression of the transcriptional regulator NhaR, which increases the production of poly-beta-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PGA). This exopolysaccharide creates a stable biofilm capable of adhering microplastics. Microplastics are then degraded by manganese peroxidase and nylon hydrolase that are secreted by the biofilm. Using these modified E. coli, our team designed a biofilter to effectively remove the threat of microplastics from water supplies.:::2014
