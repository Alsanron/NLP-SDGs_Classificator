FHS_Frederick_MD:::North America:::United States:::Food & Energy(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Engineering an anaerobic indicator to monitor the health of microbial fuel cells:::Weâ€™re seeking to create microbial fuel cells to experiment with genetic engineering and produce a clean source of energy and water. In order to fashion a more effective microbial fuel cell, we need to monitor the viability of bacteria within the fuel cell. Microbial fuel cells produce electricity and water when metal-breathing bacteria respire via an anode placed within an anaerobic compartment of the fuel cell. In order to monitor the health of these power-generating anaerobes, we designed an operon that will cause the microbes to fluoresce when growing in the oxygen-depleted anode chamber. Our operon consists of an oxygen-sensitive promoter, which activates gene expression in the absence of oxygen, and an open reading frame, which encodes a protein that fluoresces without the need for oxygen. This simple reporter system will allow us to determine when anaerobic conditions inside the fuel cell are optimal for bacteria growth and power generation.:::2014
