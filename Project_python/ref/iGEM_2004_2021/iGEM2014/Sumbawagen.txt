Sumbawagen:::Asia:::Indonesia:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ECONEY::: ECONEY is a mobile device from an engineered E coli that capable to measure different level of glucose in honey by calibrating the color of E. coli medium. Our circuit utilizes catabolite repression mechanism of E coli to measure the concentration of glucose in honey. We construct plasmid Bba_J04450 by inserting either Adenylate cyclase or IIA Glc which may affect the sensitivity of catabolite repression. Creation of novel circuit which consists of constitutive promoter followed by either Adenylate Cyclase or IIAGlc genes, which placed downward lac-mRFP circuit, may affect the sensitivity of catabolite repression. We expect an engineered E coli shows red color expression in different range of glucose concentration. By changing mRFP gene with amilCP, a blue fluorescent protein, we may obtain E. coli expressing either red or blue color when different honey added to the medium due to different glucose concentration.:::2014
