Dundee:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Lung Ranger:::Cystic fibrosis is among the most common inherited disorders in Caucasian populations. It is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene and results in a thick mucus covering epithelia. This is particularly problematic in the respiratory tract, which becomes chronically infected with pathogenic bacteria. The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify these bacteria. We have developed biosensors to recognise signalling molecules that are released by the bacteria and can be detected in a patient’s sputum. The biosensors will be housed in an electronic device that can be used as a point-of-care test for a patient’s respiratory microbiome. ‘The Lung Ranger’ is a portable tool designed to be faster and easier to use than current diagnostic techniques, allowing clinicians to make decisions about a patient’s treatment in a matter of hours rather than days.:::2014
