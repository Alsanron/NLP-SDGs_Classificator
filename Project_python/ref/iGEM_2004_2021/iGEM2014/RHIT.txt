RHIT:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synthetic Unity:::Our project explores synthetic obligate mutualism as a means to produce novel, multi-species chassis as foundations for innovative synthetic biological applications. These applications could exploit unique biochemical potentials emerging within chimeric systems. Here we explore the pairing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli by constructing genetic circuits for reciprocal induction of essential histidine biosynthetic genes. Since one species relies on the other for induction of their own essential gene, mutualism is obligatory. Another key component of our efforts addresses the need for effective interactive models to facilitate teaching and understanding of synthetic biology concepts. Victor the Vector is an electromechanical device, which combines circuits and software to not only model components of our project; but to facilitate understanding of gene regulation and the synthesis of genetic circuits. In toto, Team RHIT strives to stimulate innovation and education in synthetic biology.:::2014
