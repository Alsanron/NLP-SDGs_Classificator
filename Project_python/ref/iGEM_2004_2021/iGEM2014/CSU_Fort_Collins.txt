CSU_Fort_Collins:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Using Frying Oil to Produce High Value Products in an engineered strain of Escherichia coli:::Approximately 3 billion gallons per year of frying oil are used in the United States. The purpose of this project is to create a value added product from used frying oil as the feedstock. Escherichia coli is being engineered to breakdown lipids to acetyl-CoA and produce a high value terpenoid based product through the mevalonate pathway. A biosensor will be incorporated to detect the presence of lipids via the interaction of acyl-CoA with FadR which results in the de-repression of Green Fluorescent Protein. For added security, a kill switch is being developed to destroy the cell if released into the environment. The protein KillerRed is repressed in the presence of tryptophan. In the absence of tryptophan and in the presence of light, KillerRed will kill the cell through the production of reactive oxygen species. The progress on the various parts of the project will be presented.:::2014
