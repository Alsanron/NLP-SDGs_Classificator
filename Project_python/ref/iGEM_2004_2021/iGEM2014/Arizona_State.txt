Arizona_State:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Microbial Communities Making Biodiesel:::The Arizona State iGEM team aims to produce biodiesel in a new and efficient way using Escherichia coli. Using a wax esterase, fatty acids and ethanol, both naturally produced by E. coli, can be combined to form biodiesel. However, E. coli uses the same intermediate products to produce both fatty acids and ethanol, which reduces the efficiency of this process. This problem can be avoided by engineering two different strains of E. coli to work in tandem. One strain will be engineered to produce free fatty acids (FFA) through expression of enzymes including as TesA and acc. The other strain will be engineered to produce ethanol through expression of enzymes including pdc and adhB. These two products will be combined in one of the two cells using a waxy esterase, producing the final biodiesel product. Cooperative production will hopefully produce more ethanol than current single strain methods using E. coli.:::2014
