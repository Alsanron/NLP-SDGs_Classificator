Austin_Texas:::North America:::United States:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Genetic Code Expansion Pack:::Expansion of the genetic code has the potential to add novel functionality and chemistry to biology. Typically, expansion occurs via reassignment of the amber stop codon. When reassigned, this codon results in incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) not normally found in proteins. Such ncAAs can grant new functionality, including photocrosslinking, photocaging, novel bonding or binding sites, and fluorescence. One part of our project creates an “Expansion Pack Reporter Kit”. This kit uses a fused fluorescent reporter, containing an N-terminal RFP domain, a C-terminal GFP domain, and an amber codon-containing linker sequence that connects the two domains. While the RFP domain is translated and fluoresces under all conditions, the GFP domain is only translated when the ncAA is incorporated within the linker. Failure to incorporate the ncAA leads to translation termination, and thus no GFP fluorescence. This allows us to accurately assess the rate and fidelity of ncAA incorporation.:::2014
