Exeter:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Creating a modular TNT/NG bioremediator and improving commonly used tools in synthetic biology.:::Our project has two aims: To create an organism capable of effectively degrading environmental contaminants; and to create and improve synthetic tools for the iGEM database. Our first goal is to create a bacterial strain capable of degrading environmental contaminants such as TNT and Nitroglycerin. We are investigating two enzymes that can potentially perform this function, and will characterise them both in vivo and in vitro. Our second aim is to study some of the most commonly used regulators found in the iGEM Registry to assess how reliable they are, by combining them in different contexts. The reliability of such parts is essential when optimizing biological systems. In addition to this we are also testing the fluorescent protein iLOV, originally added to the Registry by Glasgow 2011. iLOV could be a useful alternative reporter to the commonly used GFP, but a lack of characterization has hindered its usage in iGEM.:::2014
