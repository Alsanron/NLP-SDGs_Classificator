Stony_Brook:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Apis-Biotics: Using a Bee Venom Compound as an Alternative to Antibiotics:::Pathogenic bacteria are becoming increasingly antibiotic-resistant, even to last-resort antibiotics. In addition, infections caused by some harmful strains of bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cannot easily be treated with antibiotics or other common forms of treatment. We propose a strategy against this sort of resistance which uses the bee venom compound melittin to target pathogenic bacteria. Our intention is to engineer cells which can both produce our compound and recognize the communication signals of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, allowing our system to maintain some target specificity. Two plasmids, one which controls the production of melittin and the other which acts as the cell-signal receiver, will be inserted in E. coli cells. When melittin is released, it can then insert into the outer membranes of a bacterial cell, creating pores which then cause cell lysis.:::2014
