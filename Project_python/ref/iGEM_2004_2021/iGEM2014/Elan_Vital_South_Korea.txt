The purpose of the lab is to investigate multidrug resistance of Methicillin Resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and to identify the genes involved. We tested the resistance of the transformed E. coli in different antibiotics and could conclude that MRSA showed resistance to antibiotics. We were able to get an idea of which of the DNA were involved in the multidrug resistance. By running PCR, we were able to amplify the DNA involved, and by analyzing this, we could come up with a better understanding of how the multidrug resistance works. An appropriate follow up on the project would be to research the sequence of the identified genes with the hopes of finding a possible drug that destroys even the most MRSA.:::2014
