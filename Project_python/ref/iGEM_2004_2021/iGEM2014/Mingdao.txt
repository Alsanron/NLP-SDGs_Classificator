Mingdao:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Odor - Let it die::: Food wastes can be recycled as fertilizers but leaving strong odors (e.g., NH3, H2S, etc.) from metabolizing by food spoilage bacteria. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with effect against bacteria, viruses and fungi are small, cationic peptides that bind anionic membrane surfaces of microbes, resulting in forming channels or pores and leaking cell contents. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an environmental bacterium with beneficial effects for plant growth. Several extracellular proteins such as proteases, lipases, nucleases, chitinases and elastases have been identified as decomposing enzymes. In the design of our genetically engineered bacteria, weâ€™ve created biobricks of (1) AMPs (cecropin and magainin) to attack spoilage bacteria, and (2) several secreted decomposing enzymes directed by the secretion signal of E. coli OmpA to enhance the digestion of food wastes, as well as set (3) a self-destructive device inside to sacrifice when completing the mission, in which ccdB lethal gene expression is regulated by light.:::2014
