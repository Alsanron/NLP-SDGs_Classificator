WashU_StLouis:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NitroGENIUS: Engineering E. coli to Fix Nitrogen and Regulating Transcription with Light:::We have a nitrogen problem. The atmosphere has a bunch; our crops need it to grow, but they rely on nitrogen fixing bacteria in the soil to utilize it. To keep up with our population growth, farmers are more dependent on inorganic fertilizers (which can be expensive, inaccessible, and harmful) to enrich the soil and increase yield. If only we could engineer crops to fix nitrogen! Endosymbiotic theory states that chloroplasts in plants originally came from a symbiotic relationship between prokaryotes. A certain cyanobacterium, Cyanothece sp. 51142, can photosynthesize and fix nitrogen within the same cell. Another photosynthetic cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. 6803, has light activated proteins. Our project is to study the systems in a simpler environment by expressing nitrogen-fixing genes in E. coli, and to work on a light repressed system for gene expression, because the nitrogenase enzyme is poisoned by oxygen, a product of photosynthesis.:::2014
