LIKA-CESAR-Brasil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ColiKiller for BreastBotSensor:::The LIKA- CESAR BRAZIL proposes the development of a biosensor for the detection of breast cancer with the help of robotics. The idea is to build a robotic system linked to genetic engineering capable of processing and prepare small samples of blood in an automated manner. For this our team, will generate useful BioBriks records and parts for possible future insertions in the plates. This system will be coupled to biosensors capable of detecting breast cancer in its earliest stage, where the chances of the patient having an accurate diagnosis and treatment guidance are very high. The automation of the entire process, together with the creation of a specific biosensor for breast cancer, will result in a future decrease in deaths from the disease, due to a more rapid and effective treatment.:::2014
