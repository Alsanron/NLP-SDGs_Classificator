Shenzhen_SZMS:::Asia:::China:::Food & Energy(P):::High School:::Accepted:::E. coli Plant-sitter:::Our project is to create an “E. coli Plant-sitter” that achieves smart maintenance of healthy plant growth through the application of synthetic biology to temperature moderation. We hope that our toolkit will simplify the process of plant cultivation and make synthetic biology accessible to people’s daily life. Hothouse plants whose preferential temperature ranges from 25~30℃ are exposed to the threat of low productivity and unhealthy growth in overly cold environments. Therefore, we came up with a system that aids the healthy growth of these plants by protecting them from overly low temperatures through smart temperature control. Our system of temperature moderation, including temperature sensing and temperature regulating, is able to produce heat once the temperature drops below 27℃ and stops heating when the temperature reaches 27~28℃. In this way, the temperature is to be kept at 27℃, ensuring the healthy growth and high productivity of hothouse plants.:::2014
