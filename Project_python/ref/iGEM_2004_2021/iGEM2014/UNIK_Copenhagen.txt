UNIK_Copenhagen:::Europe:::Denmark:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::EASY - Engineered Antibody Sensing:::The latest spread of emerging infectious diseases like Ebola have shown the need of a fast detection method to monitor outbreaks and take further actions. Here are biosensors an attractive tool to take the job. Cecilie, Henrik, Morten and Owik are competing for the University of Copenhagen in the iGEM competition 2014. With our idea of using an antibody-fluorophore agent as a biosensor we are able to combine the high affinity of an antibody with the simple detection method of a fluorophore. With this unique setup we are able to simplify the detection as well as reduce costs and time. Our project EASY is exploring the opportunity of new detection methods for various antigens as hormones or virus proteins. Meet the team and join our journey to the next generation of biosensors.:::2014
