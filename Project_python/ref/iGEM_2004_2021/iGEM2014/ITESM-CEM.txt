ITESM-CEM:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Medical Biorremediation: An alternative treatment for atherosclerosis:::The biochemical development of atherosclerosis is complex, and involves a variety of factors; it is intimately associated with hypercholesterolemia, smoking, obesity, and diabetes mellitus, among other conditions. One of the most accepted theories explaining its origin suggests that it is triggered by the chemical modifications of Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL), which are susceptible to oxdiations; it is believed that these oxidized products accumulate on the artery walls (tunica intima), generating an inflammatory process that will ultimately cause the development of atheroma plaques. LDL products are being oxidized by the interaction with Reactive Oxygen Species in the bloodstream, this can occur either within fatty acids or sterols, such as 7-ketocholesterol, one of the most common reaction products. We pretend to develop a new synthetic model capable of degrading the oxidized form of cholesterol by using gene therapy.:::2014
