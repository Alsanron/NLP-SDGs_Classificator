HokkaidoU_Japan:::Asia:::Japan:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RNA in loveã€€~ Ms. asRNA just wants be a perfect one for Mr. mRNA ~::: Utilization of anti-sence RNA (asRNA) became more popular method for knockdown of target gene expression. However, it is still difficult to create a perfect asRNA structure because it is affected by several factors, just like love. Ms. asRNA is always seeking to succeed in love with Mr. mRNA. iGEM HokkaidoU plays a role as Cupid through advising her to be a perfect structure as asRNA. We made an easy and useful protocol, which enables us to design standarized BioBrick parts expressing asRNA. Using this protocol, anyone can easily became Cupids. These asRNAs contain paired-termini (PT) structure, which flanks asRNA sequence, and stabilizes asRNA part through forming "stem-loop structure" in E.coli cells (N. Nakashima et al. 2006). We believe that our protocol will largely contribute to make easier for utilizing asRNA and help many researchers, including iGEMers. Let's lead Ms. asRNA to success!:::2014
