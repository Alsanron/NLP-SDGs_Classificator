HIT-Harbin:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Green Yeast:::Dioxins are commonly regarded as highly toxic compounds that are environmental pollutants and persistent organic pollutants. Its deleterious hazards intensify with the odorless, colorless and fat- soluble properties, which enable dioxins to accumulate in vivo thus threaten almost the whole biosphere. To detect dioxins blisteringly, we have constructed device for rapid detection of dioxins inside yeast. We utilized associability between the gene for testing dioxins of MOUSE as receptor and dioxins as signal, together with the regulation conducted by lexA operator to downstream promoters so that the fusion protein combined bydioxin receptor and lexA can induce downstream gene with the presence of dioxins. Eventually, we can achieve our goal of detecting dioxins rapidly through the system of positive feedback of fluorescence. We additionally design a secretive gather part by emulsifying protein to add the soluble ability of dioxins and anchoring the dioxin degradation enzyme on the surface of the yeast.:::2014
