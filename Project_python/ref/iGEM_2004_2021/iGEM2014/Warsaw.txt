Warsaw:::Europe:::Poland:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CeLuLaRE â€“ Lanthanide Recycling System:::Recently, interest has been growing in waste recovery of chemical elements due to depletion of some ores, especially lanthanide ones. Our goal therefore involved designing a bacterial system capable of detecting and binding lanthanides. We then proposed a method to extract these ions, hence making the recycling of these valuable metals (e.g. from wastewater) effective. Basing on Salmonella iron-binding system we modified lanthanide binding tags to adjust them to different ionic size. We also used a superfolder GFP to measure the concentration of collected ions. When an ion binds to LBT, a signalling pathway is activated, inducing fluorescence. Our project introduces an eco-friendly retrieval technology for industrially significant elements. We hope that extracted metals will be viable for applications in electronics, including medical devices. To propose possible applications in medicine we prepared a report about some fascinating challenges in that field, thus creating the model of Future Lantan Hospital.:::2014
