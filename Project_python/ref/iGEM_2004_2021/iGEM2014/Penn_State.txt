Penn_State:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Next-Generation Approaches to Overcome the Challenges of Metabolic Pathway Engineering:::Engineering metabolic pathways requires answering several questions and often performing many experiments. We sought to answer such "combinatorial questions" using new biophysical models and experimental approaches. First, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to identify the missing enzymes of a metabolic pathway that functions in one organism, but not in another. We demonstrate our approach on a 5-enzyme catabolic pathway that functions in P. putida, but not in E. coli. Once a multi-enzyme pathway functions in a preferred host, the DNA sequence of the system must then be optimized to achieve a desired metabolic activity. We took a forward engineering approach to systematically investigate the differences in translation rate capacity when using either "frequent", "fast", "rare", or "slow" synonymous codons during codon optimization of protein coding sequences. Our research will enable metabolic engineers to overcome two of the most commonly encountered combinatorial questions during metabolic pathway engineering.:::2014
