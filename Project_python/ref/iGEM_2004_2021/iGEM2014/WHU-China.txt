WHU-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Formaldehyde Terminator::: This year the project of WHU-China is Formaldehyde Terminator, in this project, we use three systems to get access to our target which is about detection and removal of formaldehyde. With the Twice Coloration System, we can know, from the color change, whether there is formaldehyde or not and whether the formaldehyde is eliminated completely. And the Street Cleaner System could change formaldehyde into water and carbon dioxide through several reactions with the help of specific enzymes. The Lysis System can help to split E.coli and release the enzymes into the reaction mixture, in which way it enhances the function of the Street Cleaner System. And with the help of all these three systems, we can detect and remove formaldehyde systematically.:::2014
