Nanjing-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioLego: Toxin cleaner::: The contamination of ecosystems with a multitude of pollutants has been a problem since the industrial revolution. Toxins make up a high proportion of pollutants. Fugal toxins, Antibiotics, heavy mental and various natural toxins threaten environmental health and are not effectively removed by conventional environmental treatment. In order to avoid the disadvantages like high sensitivity; high cost and complicated operating process of traditional specific methods of treatment, we are hard to find a sensitive, selective, and convenient method. To do this, we aimed to create a BioLego of genetic parts for engineering complex E.coli. Our project has to design a modular system which makes it possible to quantitatively detect and degrade whatever kind of toxin, with its specific promoter and the coding sequence of its degrading enzyme. This BioLego will provide future iGEM generations and scientists worldwide with a greater ability to work with different kinds of toxins.:::2014
