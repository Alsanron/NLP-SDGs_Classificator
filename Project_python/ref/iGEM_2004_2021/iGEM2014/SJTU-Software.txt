SJTU-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Evaluation, Visualization, Simplification, Standardization of Biobrick Information and Biosystem Design:::Confusing biobrick database and different ways of interpreting the bio-system remain to be two main problems in synthetic biology. To help wet-lab users get neat information and evaluation of specific biobricks quickly and to display their bio-system easily, we create "Easy BBK". Users can input keywords of the biobrick they are interested in and select special requirements of certain properties that are listed in the software, biobricks related will be listed, sorted by a score given to each biobrick, which takes into consideration the current status, user comments and reviews, times of citation in a publication and etc. Additionally, Users could draw their bio-system easily with the standardized biobrick icons, and they can also look into the detailed information about the biobricks in the bio-system. Finally, before self-created biobricks are uploaded to the official database, users could first assess their biobricks in our software according to our assessment model.:::2014
