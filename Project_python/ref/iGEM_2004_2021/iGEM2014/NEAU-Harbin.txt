NEAU-Harbin:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Gene Tracer, a Visual Gene Replacement System for Aspergillus Niger:::We aim to establish one visual operation system of continuous target gene replacement to transform target gene into the high expression site through homologous recombination in the Aspergillus Niger genome. In this construct, amilCP gene was driven by GlaA5 promoter, and followed by GlaA3 terminator; the HPH and cjBlue fusion gene was driven by pgpdA promoter, and followed by GlaA3 terminator. GlaA5 and GlaA3 can be used as homologous arm sequences that can mediate specific recombination. After homologous recombine between homologous arm sequences, we will get the transgenic Aspergillus Niger cells only express amilCP gene which can be easily detected by blue color. These transgenic Aspergillus Niger cells with blue color can be used as original strain for target gene transformation. Those colonies without blue color will be the real transformants in which amilCP gene is replaced with the target gene.:::2014
