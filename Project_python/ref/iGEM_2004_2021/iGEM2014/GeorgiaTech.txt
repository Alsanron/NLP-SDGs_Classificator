Luckily, nature has provided us with a tool to reduce this toxin: the enzyme soluble monooxygenase (sMMO). This multi-complex protein is composed of Proteins A, B, and C, with Protein A itself being comprised of three-dimeric subunits α, β, and γ. While researchers have successfully expressed functional Proteins B and C in Escherichia coli, Protein A could be expressed but was nonfunctional, possibly due to incorrect subunit assembly. We hypothesize that a working protein complex may be constructed through transcriptional and translational modulation of individual sMMO genes. We will use our primer design technology to insert varying levels of efficient promoter and ribosomal binding site pairs to produce the optimal amounts of individual proteins for the formation of a fully functional enzyme-complex.:::2014
