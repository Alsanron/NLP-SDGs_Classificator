Warwick:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Replicon : Flipping the Switch on Gene Therapy:::Disrupting the flow of biological information at the level of mRNA is a safer alternative to conventional gene therapy, wherein insertional mutagenesis can occur through integrating vectors. In addition, the ability to regulate the level of expression of a gene using such vectors proves difficult. Therefore, we aim to create a modular, self-replicating RNA system using Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) derived RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This drives production of siRNA directed against the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) which is elevated in type 2 diabetes and is the target of major drug studies. The replicon contains control modules, exhibiting a negative feedback mechanism provided by: an MS2 domain linked to RdRp, thereby controlling RdRp translation and therefore controlling replication, and an aptazyme switch to regulate expression levels of our siRNA. Validation of our system and the testing of modules will be performed in human (Huh 7.5) and E. coli cells.:::2014
