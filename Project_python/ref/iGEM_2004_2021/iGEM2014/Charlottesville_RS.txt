Charlottesville_RS:::North America:::United States:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Polyhydroxybutyrate as a Substitute Source of Energy for Denitrifying Bacteria:::In Albemarle county, Virginia, a large amount of the waste water goes to and is processed in the Moores Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant. Each year, the plant purchases 250,000 dollars worth of glycerin, which is used by bacteria to denitrify the water, in order to prevent eutrophication in the Chesapeake Bay. The UVa iGEM team from 2008 created a part which, when added, enables E.Coli to produce polyhydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable, bio-derived plastic. Our project is to make E.Coli that produces this plastic, which the plant could then use this bacteria to create polyhydroxybutyrate, filter out the E Coli, and then use the plastic as an alternative food source for their bacteria, saving them 250,000 dollars per year, as well as giving them a renewable energy source for their plant.:::2014
