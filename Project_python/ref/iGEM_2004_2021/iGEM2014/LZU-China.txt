LZU-China:::Asia:::China:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Novel Microbial Fuel Cell System That Can Measure Substrates Concentrations Using Genetic Engineered Bacteria:::Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) which can convert contaminants in wastewaters into energy is an ideal approach to solve both pollution problem and energy crisis. However, MFCs is hard to determine the contaminants concentrations which is a major drawback for MFCs applications. We found that the electricity produced by MFCs was somewhat related to the substrates concentrations such as P-nitrophenol (PNP) in anode or Chromium (VI) in cathode. Then a novel MFC system was designed. For anode strain, we’ve cloned a PNP sensor sequence and a riboflavin into Escherichia coli. The recombinants is able to detect PNP and produce riboflavin to boost electrical generation when co-cultured with Shewanella oneidensis. In the cathode, gene codes chromate (VI) reductase Yief was cloned into E.coli. The stability of MFCs has been improved and the electricity generated was correlated with the substrates. Moreover, we’ve designed a program which can monitor the contaminants concentrations in MFCs.:::2014
