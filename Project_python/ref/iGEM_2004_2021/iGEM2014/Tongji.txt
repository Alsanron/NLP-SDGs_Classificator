Tongji:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Decolor Four:::XynB, ArfB and ManA1 are three different decolor-assistant proteins. With the help of these proteins, the pulp (which then becomes paper) can be bleached by much less chemical reagent, to save the environment. Nowadays bio-assistant bleaching method is becoming popular in paper making industry. In our project, we build the parts for these three decolor-assistant proteins to assemble a decolor-assistant machine, and design experiments to see whether these three proteins have synergistic effect. We will also use different kinds of paper pulp to do experiments. Furthermore, we try to make a ready-to-use and user-friendly decoloring solution, based on our synergistic decolor-assistant bacteria.:::2014
