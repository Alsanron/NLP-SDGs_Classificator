UCSC:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering A Halophillic Archaeon For Butanol Production:::Today our energy needs are met by burning ancient fuels, accumulated from historic, decayed organic carbon, and stored deep in the earth. Every atom of this ancient carbon was once present as a simpler molecule, synthesized to more complex carbon molecules by plants using solar power and through our burning, returned to the atmosphere in a multi-thousand year cycle. Today, we are burning more of this “slow-solar” petroleum than is being made and we accumulate CO2 as a greenhouse gas. We intend to directly address global CO2 accumulation through a “fast-solar” strategy that relies on rapid conversion of cellulose from plants to an energy-rich liquid fuel. For 2014, Team UCSC will focus on production of butanol fermented by a salt-loving microbe.:::2014
