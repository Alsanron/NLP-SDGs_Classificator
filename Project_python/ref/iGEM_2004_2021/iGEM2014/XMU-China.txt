XMU-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Pattern formation via pseudotaxis under mathematical control:::Pattern formation is a hallmark of coordinated cell behavior in both single and multicellular organisms. It typically involves intercellular communication and intracellular signal processing, which requires different configurations of “sender” cells and “receiver” cells. Pseudotaxis provides us a new way to reprogram chemotaxis. Here we design gene circuits based on E.coli pseudotaxis, which is capable of forming conic curves governed by precise mathematical principle. We introduce orthogonal experiments to figure out the most impact factor of pattern formation. We use computational modelling to explore the laws of pattern formation and pattern changes over time on semisolid medium. Therefore, the precise control of pattern formation under mathematical principle lays the foundation for the development of regulators efficiency characterization, tissue engineering, targeted therapy, 3D printing ,biosafety and fabrication of biomaterials.:::2014
