The weight loss pill on the market tody have a big side effect on our health. More overï¼ŒFatty acid biosynthesis is essential for cell growth. The Fatty acid Synthase II pathway has attracted considerable attention because it presents multiple potential target for antibiotic development, especially after us elucidating the enzyme structure of each step of this pathway. There are a lot of unknown small molecular that have the potential to inhibit the fatty acid synthesis. For example, there is still a lot of unexplored area of the traditional Chinese medicine. What we need to do is to construct a bio-sensor in order to screen the drug we want in such a big pool.:::2014
