KAIT_JAPAN:::Asia:::Japan:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::cure allergy system:::Acquired immune system is one of two main immunity strategies in vertebrates. In this system , Helper T cells work mainly. Th1 cells and Tｈ2 cells keep balance mutually, and two cells usually control immune response. When this balance collapses and became the Th2 predominance, IL-5 is secreted excessively from Th2, and eosonophil,basophil,and mast cells are activated by IL-5. These activated cells secrete inflammatory materials that cause allergic symptoms such as bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis. On the other hand, by stimulation of IL-12, naïve T cell differentiates into Th1 cell and Th1 cell alleviates allergic symptoms. We though it is possible to ameliorate allergic symptoms by decreasing IL-5 and increasing IL-12. Focusing on ligand dependent dimerization of IL-5 receptor ,we try to make IL5 independent expression system.:::2014
