GES_NCSU_Raleigh_NC:::North America:::United States:::Policy & Practices:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mapping responsible innovation: A Do-It-Yourself, Choose-Your-Own Adventure Approach:::We propose an iterative concept mapping framework to assess ethical, legal, social, and environmental outcomes associated with releasing genetically engineered plants beyond the laboratory. We then apply this framework to The Glowing Plant, the world’s first crowd-funded genetically engineered organism. Rather than prescribing a single “responsible” course of action, we enable individual users to decide how much weight to attribute to principles such as the conservation of biodiversity, the preservation of human health and safety, the advancement of entrepreneurship and innovation, and the promotion of social equity. We also invite users to contribute additional principles, providing an iterative mechanism to help guide future decisions. By enabling users to explore the potential implications of their choices, and to compare their own preferences to others’, our model demonstrates how policy decisions depend on value judgments and encourages reflexive thinking about the social, cultural and ethical negotiations involved in technological oversight.:::2014
