UST_Beijing:::Asia:::China:::Art & Design:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Proteorhodopsin in Mitochondria:::Synthetic biology is an emerging field which combines forward-engineering technology with that of conventional biochemical and molecular genetics approaches, also considered “reverse engineering” of terrestrial life systems. Since first established in 2003, the iGEM competition, a college level education platform, encourages the practice of genetic engineering using standardized function-oriented DNA fragments; in recent years especially, iGEM projects have become increasingly sophisticated, and some winning ones have reached the limit of logical reasoning and design. Our 2011 UST-Beijing team took the initiative of exploring horizontal gene transfer, by inserting a bacterial light-driven proton-pump into the inner mitochondrial membrane of cultured human cells. This year, for the 2014 iGEM competition, our UST-Beijing team will continue to analyze the transformed human cells, and make further proposals based on the unique observation of these experiments, in order to promote health and human welfare.:::2014
