StuyGem_NYC:::North America:::United States:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Wanted: Bacteria. Dead or Dead:::There is a public fear of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their escape from the laboratory environment into the outside environment. Our project will quell the fears of the general public and increase support for synthetic biology by introducing a safety mechanism – a kill switch. The team will build this kill switch with constructs consisting of a “kill gene” - a naturally occurring toxin: ccdB, a riboregulatory system, and a UV light inducible promoter. We plan on testing the riboregulatory system for efficiency of cell death. The success of inducible cell death would revolutionize the control over the unintended dispersion of GMOs.:::2014
