CSIA-SouthKorea:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Stop Desertification With Urease from Klebsiella oxytoca:::Our project presents a synthetic biology method for preventing this acceleration of desertification, trying do it based on the urease reaction, to change the dry soil to the CaCo3, which can ultimately concise the dry lands and also make a capsule to contain water. Using urease test with the strain Klebsiella oxytoca Kctc 1686, we checked out the different results between urease-contained strains and non-urease strains. The work presented here has profound implications for future studies of synthetic biology and might help to solve the problems of desertification. We are planning to use Klebsiella oxytoca and type of free nitrogen bacteria to settle the environment that plants could live. First, Klebsiella oxytoca is a bacterium with the ability to precipitate calcite and solidify sand given a calcium source and urea, through the process of microbiologically induced calcite precipitation or biological cementation.:::2014
