UCL_Academy:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Bio-purification of water to remove bio-toxins: Bio-IN, Bio-OUT.:::The project aims is to degrade microcystin, a toxic substance produced by cyanobacteria. When cyanobacteria die, the cell walls collapse, causing the release of microcystins into water. However, microcystins happen to be extremely stable, so this means they are able to resist common chemical breakdown, such as hydrolysis, at natural conditions. It also breaks down very slowly at high temperatures (40°C), so the best way to deal with the problem is to use a bacterium that can break it down. However they aren’t usually found in water, so this allows the toxin to ravage the aquatic ecosystem. Our idea is to make a genetically modified organism that can break down microcystins. So, we will modify an E.coli bacterium to float at the top of a water column, where the cyanobacteria are located and to detect and degrade microcystins.:::2014
