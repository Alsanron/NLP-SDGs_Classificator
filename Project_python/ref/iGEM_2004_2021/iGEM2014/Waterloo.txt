Waterloo:::North America:::Canada:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Delivering Antibiotic Resistance Gene Silencing Mechanisms to a MRSA Population using Bacterial Conjugation:::Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (or MRSA) is an infection-causing pathogen that poses serious health threats in hospitals and in the community. They are well known for their resistance to all β-lactams due to the expression of the mecA gene from the mec cassette. This year, the Waterloo iGEM team proposes to combat this infection by delivering gene-silencing systems: CRISPRi and RNAi through a Staphylococcus conjugative plasmid. This will effectively disable the antibiotic resistant phenotype over time so that a β-lactam antibiotic can then be administered to kill the MRSA. As a proof of concept, our gene silencing mechanisms will target a YFP gene within a Staphylococcus population. We also propose to improve the efficiency of an existing conjugation plasmid so as to develop a more effective means of delivery between Staphylococcal organisms.:::2014
