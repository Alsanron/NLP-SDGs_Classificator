ULB-Brussels:::Europe:::Belgium:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mighty Coli, addicting bacteria to protein production:::Our aim is to enhance recombinant protein production in bioreactors by making microorganisms addict to the production of a protein of interest (PI). We built MightyColi, a recombinant Escherichia Coli expressing a toxin and a PI. This protein will be on the same open reading frame than an antoxin, a protein able to neutralize the effects of the toxin. Stressed subpopulations might not express the PI (and thus the antitoxin) to a sufficient level, allowing the toxin to kill unproductive cells. Our work will consist on building and modelling this system.:::2014
