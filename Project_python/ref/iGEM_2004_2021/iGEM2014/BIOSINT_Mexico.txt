BIOSINT_Mexico:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Green Demon:::In Mexico and around the world there is an urgent need to implement measures to reduce heavy metal soil pollution. Different treatments have been used including in situ and ex situ, which have proven extremely expensive and impractical for large scale areas. For this project we have designed a modular system, plastic and ready to incorporate to A. thaliana; in order to extract the metals, in particular mercury, from the soil and convert it into a less reactive species. The final challenge is to develop a measurable, specific, effective, safe and low-cost treatment for large areas of contaminated soil.:::2014
