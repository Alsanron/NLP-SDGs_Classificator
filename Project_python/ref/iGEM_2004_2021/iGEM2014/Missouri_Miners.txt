Missouri_Miners:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Remediation of Coal Flue Gasses:::The goal of this year's project is to genetically modify Cyanothece to allow it to fix all forms of nitrogen oxide pollutants in coal flue gases. Coal is one of the primary sources of global energy and produces carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollutants, among others, which contribute to global warming and acid rain formation. Fixing nitrogen through Cyanothece has another benefit besides reducing pollution; the end products are ammonia compounds which are a major component of fertilizer. We hope this will allow power companies to offset some of the costs of cleaning their emissions by selling the ammonia products to be made into fertilizer. We will be isolating the nitrogen fixing genes and adding them to the BioBricks Parts Registry for the Jamboree.:::2014
