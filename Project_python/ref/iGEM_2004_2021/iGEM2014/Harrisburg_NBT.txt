Harrisburg_NBT:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PUPS- Paper Utilizing Pesticide Sensors:::Pesticide pollution is an unfortunately typical problem found in agricultural regions around the world. Developing regions that rely heavily on agriculture, but have less regulations related to pesticide use tend to suffer the most from pesticide pollution. Organophosphates (OP) represent a large class of toxic pesticides used heavily in these areas. We have designed novel devices to detect these toxic pollutants in waterways called PUPS, or Paper Utilizing Pesticide Sensors. These devices are paper-based with 3D printed shells, making them very cost effective for use in poor areas worldwide. The PUPS will utilize a fusion protein that will be produced in E. coli to degrade organophosphates into 4-nitrophenol (4NP), which OPs degrade into naturally over time. The 4NP will then be reduced in order to electrochemically measure the 4NP concentration at cheap, graphite electrodes. These reactions all occur within cellulose paper, which drives the microfluidic movement of the samples.:::2014
