Purdue:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Minecrobe: Bacillus subtilis Production of Corn Phytosiderophores to Combat Malnutrition:::More than 870 million people are malnourished according to the United Nations World Food Program, and the World Health Organization states that iron deficiency is one of the most common and widespread nutritional disorders in the world. A solution is presented by utilizing synthetic biology to engineer Bacillus subtilis to increase plantsâ€™ ability to uptake iron, through production of plant phytosiderophores. Phytosiderophores are small, high-affinity iron chelating molecules that many microorganisms and plants use to increase bioavailable iron by reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+. Our genetically engineered system combines five corn genes to produce these phytosiderophores: SAMS, NAS1, NAATI, DMAS, and TOM1. We are using corn and rice to confirm that plants grown with our engineered bacteria will have higher iron content than plants grown with wild-type Bacillus or with no Bacillus at all. Mass spectrometry, chlorophyll readings, and height measurements were used to determine the effectiveness of our engineered system.:::2014
