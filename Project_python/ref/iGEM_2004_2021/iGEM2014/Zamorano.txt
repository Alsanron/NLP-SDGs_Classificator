Zamorano:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Policy & Practices:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::¨Know your enemy, helping the good guys and stopping the bad¨:::Currently, biotechnology in Latin America faces constraints that limit their social acceptance, mainly due to a lack of or distortion of information available to the general public. The team will first determine the perception of biotechnology undergraduate students through a survey developed for this purpose. Second, we will coordinate and conduct education and information activities with children and youth using synthetic biology activities with the goal to publicize scientific and timely information about this technology. Finally, we will conduct a risk analysis of the E zamofordi organism by the Cartegena Protocol and the Environmental Risk Assessment of genetically modified organisms’ guidelines (ERA). With these we will scientifically demonstrate that the project ¨Know your enemy¨ complies with the established norms of biosafety. If handled according to relevant regulations, as an alternate product through the extrapolation of this evaluation, this is a simple tool for future risk analysis applicable to Central America.:::2014
