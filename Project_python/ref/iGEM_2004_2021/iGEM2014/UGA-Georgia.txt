Our research demonstrates the utility of a methanogenic archaeon, Methanococcus maripaludis, as an alternative platform. Our two primary focuses in this study are: 1) improving the genetic tools for synthetic biology available in archaea and 2) demonstrating the utility of archaea in synthetic biology through production of geraniol. Previously, a synthesized gene encoding geraniol synthase was expressed in M. maripaludis, and geraniol production was quantified as 0.2% of lipid dry weight using GC/MS. In order to optimize geraniol production, we are experimenting a combination of chemical, biological and computational approaches that include: an improved geraniol extraction procedure resulting in better recovery, a fluorescent protein monitor for protein expression and regulation, a synthetic ribosome-binding-site library enabling variable levels of expression, and a metabolic model of the lipid biosynthesis pathway subjected to flux balance analysis.:::2014
