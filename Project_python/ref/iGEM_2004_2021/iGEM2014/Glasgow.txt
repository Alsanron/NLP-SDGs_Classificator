We attempted to create a recombinase switch which would, in response to arabinose, switch from encoding a flagellar gene, to two genes that encode gas vesicle formation, namely gvpA and gvpC. This switch could be applied to many areas, e.g. desalination, biofuel production and drug production, by simply changing the stimulus that would cause the switch to “flip”. Computer modelling showed that swimming was detrimental to floatation. In response we created knockouts of two different flagellar genes, motA and fliC. In vivo Gvp expression is toxic to E. coli. Instead, we focused on an RFP/GFP switch, which proved that our switch construct is viable. In the future, RFP and GFP can be replaced by any two functional genes that are desirable.:::2014
