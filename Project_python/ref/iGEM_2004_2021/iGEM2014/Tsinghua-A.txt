Tsinghua-A:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Marvelous TALE-- A Better Gene Edit Tool:::Transactivator-Like Effectors (TALEs) are a technology that once revolutionized the way researchers manipulate DNA with exceptional site specificity.Though it works well in eukaryotic organisms, it is not available in prokaryotic organisms. We come up with the idea that the long repeating sequence of the TALEs coding sequence leads to it. In our project, we attempt to construct a marvelous TALEs system which can efficiently work in prokaryotic organisms. By optimizing the TALEs coding sequence with modeling methods and testing it by Golden Gate Assembly and Report System, we hope we can have a handle tool for gene editing in prokaryotic organisms.:::2014
