StanfordBrownSpelman:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Towards a Biosynthetic Unmanned Aerial Vehicle:::There are growing applications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in both space exploration and terrestrial activities, such as remote environmental monitoring and payload delivery. However, these devices are complex, costly, and made of non-eco-friendly materials, preventing their widespread use in scientific and humanitarian missions. We are pioneering the development of the first biologically-produced UAV, which will present numerous advantages over the current manufacturing paradigm. First, a foundational architecture built by cells allows for construction in almost any location and responsible disposal through biodegradation. To this end, we are synthesizing a novel cellulose acetate bioplastic, characterizing natural waterproofing proteins, and programming timed biodegradation. Second, we are leveraging synthetic biology to move costly analytic functions, which require bulky electrical components, into a cell layer with biosensing capabilities. In thinking about synthetic biology in the environment, we developed the Amberless Toolkit as a standard for preventing expression of synthetic constructs in undesired organisms.:::2014
