Colombia:::Latin America:::Colombia:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ChOL Bio-Sensor:::Our project aims to use synthetic biology to develop a V. cholerae sensor using a new technique. Instead of trying to detect the cholerae toxin, specific sequences of nucleic acid, or antigens, we propose detecting V. cholerae Autoinducer 1 (CAI-1), the bacteria’s species-specific quorum sensing molecule. If we rewire V. cholerae’s own quorum sensing mechanism –used in nature to gauge population levels and regulate pathogenicity– in a harmless E. coli chassis, we can build a cheap and easy-to-use biosensor that gives a color output when it senses the pathogen. This prototype can serve as a proof-of-concept for future quorum sensing-based pathogen biosensors.:::2014
