NGSS_TR:::Europe:::Turkey:::Health & Medicine(P):::High School:::Accepted:::S. Diagenes:::Streptocccus Pyogenes is a severe bacteria which can result in some ilnesses such as pharyngitis. Diagnosis of S. Pyogenes can be done in some ways. However some ways are fairly expensive or takes more than a day to detect. We designed our system to solve this problem by using synbio. We simply found the sequence which can be cleavaged by the protease, SpeB, secreted by S. Pyogenes. In our system we used a wall protein which is linked to cleavage site by a sequence of linker. On the other side of the cleavage site, we located Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase(C2,3O) monomer. When cleavage site is eradicated by SpeB, free C2,3Os form tetramers. Catechol is a substance that reacts with Oxygene. As a result of this reaction yellow colour is produced. This system is fairly fast in comparison to blood agar method. The system can also be modified to detect other demerit bacteria.:::2014
