UI-Indonesia:::Asia:::Indonesia:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mission i(GE)Mpossible: Vibrio Espionage:::Biofilm is a matrix extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that is surrounding microbial collonies. It causes more than 65% of all microbial infections. Most of pathogenic bacteria could make biofilm that can cause antibiotic resistance issue and increase its pathogenecity. Our Escherichia coli can degrade biofilm from various bacteria after it seeks them by detecting their quorum sensing molecule. Our team will focus in Vibrio cholerae because it is a cause of cholera as a deadly tropical countries disease. We present our E. coli agent that can degrade biofilm of V. cholerae after it can detect quorum sensing molecule from V. cholerae, CAI-1, by CqsS receptor. Then our E. coli agent will activate motility gene, CheZ, to hunt V. cholerae. When it arrives, our bacteria will degrade the biofilm by secreting enzymes, such as Î±-amylase, nuclease, and substilisin to break down the matrix and peptide 1018 that will kill V. cholerae.:::2014
