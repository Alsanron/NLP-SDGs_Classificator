Fudan:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::"'Tet and Cre'-dependent" genetic logic circuits in mammalian cells::: Cells of all organisms process numerous signals originating from the internal biological processes or from the environment to produce the appropriate cellular response.To a certain extent,the endogenous cell signal pathway is just like a logic circuit in digital system. Our team design and create a new kind of genetic logic circuit in mammalian cells based on "tet-shRNA expression system" and "Cre-tamoxifen system" ,which can implement all 16 boolean logic gate functions ideally. And our team will use the circuit for creating a pathway for cell transdifferentiation and reprogramming.:::2014
