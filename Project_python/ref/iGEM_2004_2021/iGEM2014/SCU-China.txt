SCU-China:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Imperial Edict:Simulating Signal Analysis & Transfer Using E.coli:::Our project is focusing on using the simple prokaryotes to imitate the nerve system which exists in the advanced animals widely. As we all known, the nerve system of advanced animals like human consists of 3 major parts: the receptive neurons, the central neurons, and the effector cells. Correspondingly, we separate bacteria into 3 different communities to execute different functions and we name these 3 communities as Receptor, Transmitter, and Effector. In details, we replace the neurotransmitter by AHL family and in the meanwhile, we construct the multiple promoter to simulate the procedure of signal receiving and processing. In addition, for the sake of achieving the signal transmitting and analyzing, we isolate a new cell quorum sensing systemâ€”the PPYs signal pathway from photorhabdus luminescence. The mechanism of this PPYs signal pathway is similar to the AHLs pathway.:::2014
