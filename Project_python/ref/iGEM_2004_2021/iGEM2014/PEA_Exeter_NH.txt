PEA_Exeter_NH:::North America:::United States:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Development of Fracking Runoff Detectors::: Our team's primary goal is to create a cell that can detect naphthalene (a toxic chemical often found in fracking runoff) and degrade it to a less harmful compound. We used a nahR gene, on plasmid NAH7 (BBa_J61051), which breaks down naphthalene in a cell environment into the more inert catechol. We then use the downstream element BBa_K118021, whose protein product, catechol-2, 3-dioxygenase, catalyzes the conversion of catechol to 2-HMS (2-hydroxymuconate semialdyhyde) a yellow-colored molecule. In addition, we created a cell that will be able to broadly identify other toxic fracking byproducts via a nonspecific SOS cell damage element. The promoter recognizes and binds to a combination of sequences of SOS repressor proteins produced after cellular stress from damaging toxins or radiation. This promoter (BBa_K518010) will be attached to a downstream element (BBa_K592009) coding for a blue-colored protein, so that bacterial cells exhibiting stress can be easily discerned.:::2014
