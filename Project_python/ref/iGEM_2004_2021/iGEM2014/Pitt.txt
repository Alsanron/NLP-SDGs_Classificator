Pitt:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Building a Toolkit to Engineer the Skin Bacterium, Propionibacterium Acnes:::The goals of the Pitt iGEM team are to: 1. Engineer a plasmid that will replicate in P. acnes. This plasmid will also be compatible with the synthetic biology standard RFC10, allowing for the simple addition of genes. 2. Optimize a protocol to transform P. acnes with our engineered plasmid using statistical design of experiments. 3. Transfer the following beneficent genes to P. acnes for function as a skin probiotic: 3.1 Melanin - for skin pigmentation and UV protection. 3.2 Aldehyde Dehydrogenase - for destruction of sebum (oil) on skin 3.3 Cathelicidin - for defense against bacterial infection:::2014
