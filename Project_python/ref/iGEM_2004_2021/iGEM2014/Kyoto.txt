Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DMS SYNTHESIS AND MAGNETOSOME FORMATION:::This year, we have two projects. The first project is DMS (dimethylsulfide) synthesis. DMS is known to be a precursor of the cloud condensation nucleus. Some researchers say that DMS greatly affects the climate. Although the existing researches have already lined up the candidate genes of the DMS biosynthesis pathway, most of them are still unconfirmed. Therefore, we tried to confirm them by introducing 5 candidate genes in Fragilariopsis cylindrus; a diatom, into Escherichia coli. The second project is magnetosome formation. Magnetosome is a specific organelle in magnetotactic bacteria. Although many researchers have focused on it for its unique feature; magnetosome detect magnetic force, they have discovered only magnetotactic bacteria to have this ability so far. So we tried to form the Magnetosome in E. coli by introducing 4 operons which has been lined up recently as the sufficient genes to make magnetosome in Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense.:::2014
