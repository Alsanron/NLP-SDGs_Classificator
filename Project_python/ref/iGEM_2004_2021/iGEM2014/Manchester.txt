Manchester:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Battling Against Obesity:::Obesity is a growing problem in today’s society. Our project aims to engineer a novel treatment for obesity. By modifying the natural CRP pathway, we will turn the commensal bacterium Escherichia E.coli Nissle 1917 into a “sugar sponge” that will absorb excess carbohydrates before they can be taken up in the human intestines. Our engineered bacteria is aimed at obese people who have tried other approaches to weight loss, but have failed to see any results. Other uses could include patients who need to lose weight before surgery. The bacteria would be delivered in the form of a pill or yogurt drink. Our project will include an in-depth sociological analysis of modern attitudes to obesity based on research and data collected from surveys, exploring public opinion regarding body weight as well as synthetic biology and genetic modification. We have used the results to direct our engineering strategies.:::2014
