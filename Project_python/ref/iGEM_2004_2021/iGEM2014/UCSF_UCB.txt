UCSF_UCB:::North America:::United States:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Sense and Secrete-ability:::Cells in a local population have a wide range of responses to a given stimulus, potentially due to differences in extracellular environment or intracellular molecular composition. However, cellular communities often need to resolve this variation to respond in a concerted and robust way. Our project seeks to understand complex intercellular interactions underlying specific community phenotypes by engineering communication motifs with the goal of reaching a community behavior to either converge or diverge in response. To do this, we have engineered novel sense-and-secrete circuits into yeast. To model community signaling, we repurposed endogenous yeast mating factor alpha(MFα) as an extracellular signal. Our designed circuit outputs initial individual responses to stimuli as GFP signal and, after signaling through secreted MFα, a downstream community-coordinated response is reported as RFP signal. By tuning parameters like positive and negative feedback strength and MFα-sensitivity, we hope to develop a circuit capable of analyzing cellular community interactions.:::2014
