Duke:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Developing an ultra-sensitive response in CRISPR circuitry:::Biological tools that are based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system could potentially enable synthetic biologists to create gene circuits of far greater complexity than what was previously possible. However, the function or robustness of many circuits relies on ultrasensitive, switch-like responses from the transcription factors involved. Currently, CRISPR-based tools have distinctively analog, non-Boolean responses, making them unsuitable for use in functions that require a steep response curve. Tools that introduce Boolean-like ultra-sensitivity into the CRISPR system would increase its versatility for applications in complex gene circuits. We are implementing two possible approaches to demonstrating ultra-sensitivity in CRISPR: cooperative repression and molecular titration.:::2014
