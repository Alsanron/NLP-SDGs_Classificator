Bordeaux:::Europe:::France:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Elasticoli:::Elastin, Resilin and Spider Silk (Spidroin) are elastomeric protein found in nature. These biomaterials provide properties like high stress resistance and high elasticity. To produce these proteins, synthetics genes were engineered for E.Coli and it inspired by consensus sequences found in natural peptides, for elastin like polypeptides (ELP) the consensus sequence is VPGXG where X can be different amino acids, on the same way GPGXG, GPGGY and GPGGV were identified for spider silk like polypeptides (SLP) and finally for resilin like polypeptides (RLP) there is PSXXYGAP. Proteins are produce, after they are purified and freeze-dried to measure the dry-mass. Further soluble proteins are wet spin to obtain strings and test physicals properties. The final goal is to assembly ELP, RLP and SLP to create new polymers properties. The biobrick assembly method is used and optimized to combine fragments without stop codon to obtain new innovative proteins.:::2014
