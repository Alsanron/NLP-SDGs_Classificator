UT-Dallas:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bactericidal and Bacteriostatic Probiotics: targeting infectious agents of the human gut through a genomic approach.:::Treating infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with antibiotics disrupts a patient's gut microbiota and can increase the prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains. The increasing population of multi-drug resistant bacterial strains, both within and outside of health centers, is a growing health concern that is becoming progressively difficult to treat. We envision a new paradigm for treating infections of the human gastrointestinal tract through exploitation of engineered probiotics that produce anti-microbials with high specificity for pathogens at the genome level. Toward this end, we will utilize the CRISPR/Cas9 system with gRNA engineered to recognize genes from infectious bacteria. Our CRISPR/Cas9 system will be delivered from the engineered E. coli to infectious bacteria using bacterial specific phages, minimizing any side-effects to native microbiota and human-host cells. As a proof-of-principle for our engineered probiotic, we start by targeting the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholera.:::2014
