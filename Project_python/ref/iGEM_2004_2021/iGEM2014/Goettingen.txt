Goettingen:::Europe:::Germany:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A small change for man, a giant pain to germkind.:::Our aim is to develop a diagnostic technique capable of detecting the presence of fungal pathogens in a sample collected from a patient. Briefly, our approach is as follows. Through a yeast two-hybrid assay we will select a set of peptides that show affinity towards surface proteins from different fungi (Aspergillus nidulans, A. fumigatus, Candida albicans and C. glabrata). After confirming the interaction between the surface proteins and a given peptide, we intend to attach a molecule to the peptide marker. In our project, this molecule will be a fluorescent protein, but in principle can also be an immune system activator which is then recognized by the immune cells or other chemical moiety that adds novel functionalities or increases the peptide stability.:::2014
