BUCT-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A water quality detection method based on constitutively bioluminescent E. coli and microfluidic:::Human beings have been suffering from contaminated water a lot since first industrial revolution. Both of water protection and water examination are of great importance. Here, we aim at rapidly testing a multiply water sample, finding out whether itâ€™s toxic or not and making a specific toxin detection, these toxin materials may be heavy metals and nitrate that contained in the contaminated water. To achieve this, we design a bio-system-recombinant luminous Escherichia coli to which diverse bio-sensors are transformed. Then we ascertain the quality of water by analysis the light intensity which correlated to the expression of lux gene reflecting comprehensive toxicity and multi-FP genes indicating specific toxicities. All these test data are analyzed in a algorithm we designed which give feedback in the form of report including referable information. Furthermore, adding microfluidics to this system will make the trace and fast test possible.:::2014
