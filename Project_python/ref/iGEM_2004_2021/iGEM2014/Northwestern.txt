Northwestern:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NU Models: Exploring Transcription and Translation Rates in Non-Model Organisms Using a Cell-Free System:::NU Models seeks to expand promoter and ribosome binding site characterization of E. Coli to other non-model organisms chosen for their promise in other fields of research. All processes take place in a cell-free system to provide a consistent characterization platform. This information is useful in synthetic biology applications for healthcare, the environment, and industry as it provides a basis for DNA design in organisms other than E. Coli that are more optimized for the needs of a given application. An example of a non-model organism that we are using with the cell-free system is Streptomyces, which has played an important role in antibiotic production. While we explore adaptation of the cell-free system to these non-model organisms, we also strive, through characterization of sets of promoters and RBS, to create a combination that would yield the maximum protein production.:::2014
