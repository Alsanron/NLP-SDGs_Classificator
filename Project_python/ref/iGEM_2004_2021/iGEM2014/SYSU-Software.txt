SYSU-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::FLAME -- Framework-based Layout And Metacircuit design Engine:::Based on principles of design frameworks, this software provides you with smarter, more automatic designs. With standardized biobricks and databases, the software automatically joins parts and modules and consequently a system come into being. That is, after you define the inputs, outputs and logic between them, our software offers you with different solutions (that is, different mechanisms for the same effect) , the performance of each can be visible via a rader map. The built-in databases are abstracted from papers of considerable values of reference. It is far from finishing a design when a system comes out. Our software can mathematically simulate three major characteristics that describe the behaviour of the system: static performance, dynamic performance and expression efficiency, which might help you determine the performance of your designed system.:::2014
