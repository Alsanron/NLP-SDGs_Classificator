Greensboro_Aggies:::North America:::United States:::Art & Design:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BactoArt: A multicomponent, inducible expression system:::Regulated gene expression is one of the primary means by which phenotypic differences are generated among genetically identical cells (e.g., endothelial cells versus nerve cells). Nonetheless, the concept of inducible gene expression is often difficult for students to understand. To help students gain a better understanding of inducible gene expression, we developed "BactoArt", a multicomponent, inducible expression system that allows students to visualize gene regulation in action. First, different fluorescent protein (FP) color variants (e.g., CFP, GFP, or RFP) were placed under the control of specific inducible promoters. The inducers can then be patterend onto a petri dish—using either a paintbrush or an inkjet printer—before plating BactoArt bacteria, leading to selective induction of a given FP. We simultaneously induced GFP and RFP from pXyl and pLac, respectively, and measured their fluorescence intensity over time. We believe that such hands-on activities will spark questions, leading to "teachable moments" about transcriptional regulation.:::2014
