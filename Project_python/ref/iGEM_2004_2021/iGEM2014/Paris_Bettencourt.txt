Paris_Bettencourt:::Europe:::France:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The smell of us:::Body odors are complex phenomena observed among mammalian species. Corynebacterium striatum and Bacillus subtilis are among the main contributors to body odors. One of the objectives of our project is identifying and isolating natural mutants that have non-functional odor-producing enzymes using CRISPRs. We're also engineering bacteria to degrade smelly molecules: TMA (trimethylamine) and 2-nonenal. The old people smell is mainly due to 2-nonenal. To degrade it, we want to perform directed evolution on skin bacteria. TMA has a fish odor and it appears in people suffering from trimethylaminuria. We will clone the enzyme trimethylamine monooxygenase, which degrades TMA, in E.coli and skin bacteria. Parallelly, we intend to develop a set of primordial odors by cloning enzymes known to catalyze reactions yielding volatile compounds. We're also focusing on scientific communication, for that, we are developing an online course developed on the Education Genius platform about iGEM high school.:::2014
