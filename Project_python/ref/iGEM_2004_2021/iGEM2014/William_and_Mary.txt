William_and_Mary:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Calcium Kit: Tools for the in-vivo sensing and manipulation of calcium:::Our project is to create a series of tools for inducing, measuring and counting intracellular calcium spikes in both bacteria and yeast. Calcium is known to be important in its function as a signaling ion in eukaryotic organisms; thus, it is valuable to develop synthetic biology tools for studying calcium ions in cells and for interfacing genetic circuits with cellular calcium dynamics. The tools we are creating with this project will enable future study of calcium in bacteria and yeast, as well as create a groundwork for future genetic circuits to be created to study calcium in these organisms, and, eventually, in multicellular organisms.:::2014
