Harvard_BioDesign:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A robust information encoding and display system in E.coli biofilms for use in biosensors:::E. coli cells naturally secrete a protein called curli into their extracellular matrix that self-assembles into ordered, linear, amyloid fibers important for the structural integrity of the biofilm. We have designed an information encoding and storage system in the E.coli curli biofilm network. In our system, bacteria are engineered to produce a mixture of curli subunits that can later be read out as information. Our system can be put under the control of any environmentally sensitive promoter, facilitating the practicality of using biosensors in the field. Other potential applications include cryptography and nanoscale patterning. This system represents a novel method by which information can be stored in a scaleable nanomaterial with functional potential. Living materials offer an advantage over classical materials because they are adaptable, versatile, and can self-pattern complex architectures.:::2014
