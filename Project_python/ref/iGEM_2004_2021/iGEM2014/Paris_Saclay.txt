Paris_Saclay:::Europe:::France:::Art & Design:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::This is not a lemon!:::Synthetic Biology has the power of changing paradigms of society such as our conception of what living beings are. If we deprive bacteria from their “unnecessary" functions and have them produce what we need, do these bacteria still possess the status of living organisms or have they become machines? To raise this question, we adopted an artistic approach, as Bio-Art is one of the best way to spark debate with citizens. We create a concept organism that would reflect these interrogations. We modify Escherichia coli to produce the scent and simulate the ripening process of a lemon. A mixture of bacteria and growth medium will be molded: it will smell, ripe and look like a lemon, but "ceci n’est pas un citron” - this is not a lemon… or is it? With this we invite everyone to think about the upcoming opportunities and the ethical limits of designing living beings.:::2014
