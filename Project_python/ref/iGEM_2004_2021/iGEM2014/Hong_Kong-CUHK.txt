It is also used to make bio-degradable plastic. We aim at converting carbon dioxide and carbonate, which are excessive to the ecosystem, into methane. An engineered nitrogenase (α-70Ala, α-195Gln) in Azotobacter vinelandii has been shown to have the ability of reducing carbon dioxide and carbonate into methane and other carbon compound. However, the carbon fixation process consumes a large numbers of protons and thus decreases the reaction rate. We propose to co-express hydrogenase III from Aquifex aeolicus to speed up the carbon fixation step in A. vinelandii.:::2014
