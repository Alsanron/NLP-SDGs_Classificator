TU_Delft-Leiden:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Microfluidics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Using ELECTRACE to detect landmines:::Our team will develop a microbial based sensor â€“ELECTRACE. The great innovation of our project consists on the biosensor's ability to produce a directly measurable electric signal as output. Electrical conductivity is a novel output that is orthogonal to all other standard outputs currently in use, such as fluorescence. In this way we will overcome the difficulties that arise by using conventional output signals, which are hard to quantify and to use outside the lab. The sensor-output system will be implemented in a microfluidics set-up, offering the possibility of designing a cost effective device that could be used at a large scale. ELECTRACE enables the interface between biology and electronics and fundamentally broadens the range of applications for synthetic biology. As a proof of principle, we will realize a system that is able to detect landmines. Additionally, the pathway that will be implemented can be extended to several other applications.:::2014
