Linkoping_Sweden:::Europe:::Sweden:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AllergenSAFE: A Sensitive and Accurate Food Evaluation:::The goal of our project is to use an antibody in combination with fluorescent probes to detect Ara h1, a major allergen protein in peanut. We use a detector which is divided into two components, one chemical and one physical. The chemical component is composed of three potential parts: one antibody complex linked to Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), one epitope complex linked to RFP, and finally Ara h1. These are potential parts in the sense that the system will always contain the first two parts (antibody and epitope complexes), but will only contain the third part, Ara h1, if the inserted food sample has been contaminated with peanut protein. The physical component, the biosensor system, is composed of a box containing sensors necessary to detect fluorescence and any eventual changes in fluorescence. This information is processed by a microprocessor to give a color indication, correlated to the changes in fluorescence.:::2014
