UCC_Ireland:::Europe:::Ireland:::Entrepreneurship:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SeaDNA and SeeDNA.:::"SeaDNA"- takes inspiration from the hagfish, which lives on the ocean floor and produces a defensive slime made of filaments with amazing properties. From these filaments we aim make novel biopolymers that are biodegradable, lightweight, thinner than a human hair and potentially stronger than nylon, steel and even Kevlar. We plan to use E.coli cells to mass produce these polymers, that should be very useful in health and medicine, food and manufacturing industries. "SeeDNA"- aims to create a system for bacterial-based DNA detection. We hope to design customizable plasmids and exploit DNA hybridization to detect any specific short DNA sequence as an alternative to PCR. Hybridization of the target sequence to the plasmid results in bacterial cell growth and production of a visible signal. This could be a rapid and cheap diagnostic tool for pathogenic DNA such as HPV, and a revolution in resource poor hospital labs in developing countries.:::2014
