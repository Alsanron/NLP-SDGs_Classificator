SUSTC-Shenzhen:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Application of CRISPR/Cas and A-B Toxin System in Resisting Retrovirus:::In this project, we want to establish a more effective HIV-curing system with less side-effects by integrating CRISPR/Cas system into human hematopoietic stem cells, which aims to protect the helper T cells from virus infection. The gRNA is designed to target the relative conserved regions in HIV viral genome and inactivate its biological activity. Since viral vectors seem to be of limited use in gene therapy strategies (e.g., potential pathogenicity), there is still a need for a simple, efficient nucleic acid transfer system which allows the target-cell-specific introduction of nucleic acids. By using non-viral DNA delivery system like A-B-toxin-GAL4 fusion protein, we can deliver plasmids encoding gRNA into the helper T cells and readily attack multiple HIV genome sites simultaneously and update the targets along with our knowledge of HIV.:::2014
