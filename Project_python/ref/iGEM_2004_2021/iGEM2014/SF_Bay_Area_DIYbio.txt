SF_Bay_Area_DIYbio:::North America:::United States:::Community Labs:::Community Lab:::Accepted:::Real Vegan Cheese:::Environmentally conscious individuals, vegans, and vegetarians worldwide crave a suitable alternative to cheese that is cruelty-free and environmentally friendly. We are attempting to create the first real vegan cheese by engineering normal baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae) to express cheese proteins (caseins), purifying the proteins, creating a milk-substitute by blending in vegan replacements for lactose and milk fat, and finally turning the resulting milk-substitute into semi-hard cheese like gouda using the normal cheese-making process. We will express the four casein proteins, as well as the Fam20C Golgi kinase that phosphorylates the caseins, with an alpha factor tag that targets them for secretion. The Real Vegan Cheese project (aka iGEM team SF_Bay_Area_DIYbio) is a community team of more than two dozen individuals from all walks of life, sponsored by DIYbio labs Counter Culture Labs from Oakland and BioCurious from Sunnyvale.:::2014
