ITB_Indonesia:::Asia:::Indonesia:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SynBIGreen (Synthetic Biology Indonesia Go Green):::PET or commonly known as plastic has been widely used in various application. We canâ€™t deny that plastic give us a lot of benefit, though overproduction of plastic could give serious impact for the environment if not treated properly. The total of global plastic is estimated to exceed 24.39 million tons in 2015; therefore, appropriate treatment is necessary. To solve the problem, we try to degrade plastic using synthetic bacteria. We establish ompA protein fused with LC-Cutinase in Escherichia coli BL21 thus exposing the degrading enzymes on the surface membrane of bacteria. We also construct a cassette comprised of glycoaldehyde reductase and glycoaldehyde dehydrogenase which responsible in metabolising ethylene glycol as byproduct of degradation. We use constitutive promoter for both construct, thus making it necessary to create a modul of reporter and self regulatory to maintain system efficiency and minimizing severe cytoplasmic stress from formation of inclusion body aggregate.:::2014
