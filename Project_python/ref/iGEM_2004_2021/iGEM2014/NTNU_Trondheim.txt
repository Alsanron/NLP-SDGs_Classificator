NTNU_Trondheim:::Europe:::Norway:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SynECO2 - Light driven carbon capture:::The changes observed in the global climate within the last hundred years have been attributed to rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2). This heavy increase in atmospheric CO2 is thought to be caused by the heavy industrialisation of our civilisation with the use of fossil fuels. With the potential impact climate change could have for many ecosystems globally, it becomes apparent we need to slow-down, if not prevent these changes in order to preserve our current habitat. One strategy for reducing the CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is biological carbon fixation. The project undertaken will look at establishing the lactate inducible expression system into Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Once established, glucose oxidase (GOx) will be incorporated into this expression system. It is proposed that Glucose oxidase will prevent respiration of the organism, thereby increasing its carbon fixation capacity.:::2014
