Minnesota:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mntallica: Engineering Bacteria for Mercury and Heavy Metal Bioremediation:::Mercury is a neurotoxic heavy metal with the ability to biomagnify, and is a significant issue in public and environmental health worldwide. Rising levels of mercury due to mining activities, industrial catalysts, agricultural fungicides, and the burning of fossil fuels has resulted in the pollution of many ecosystems and water reservoirs. Cleanup of mercury contamination using current technology is either not feasible or incredibly costly. This study describes the engineering of recombinant bacteria that can facilitate the bioremediation of the neurotoxic methylmercury and mercury ions into less toxic form, and reduce other heavy metals. This synthetic microbe was encapsulated within a cost-effective, scalable water filtering device. Device employment could rigorously change the practices used in mercury decontamination efforts by switching to biological rather than chemical processes. Furthermore, this technology can be applied towards bioremediation and biosensing of various heavy metals and organic toxins in the environment.:::2014
