SDU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Edible coli - The untapped food resource of the century:::Edible coli is a nutrition source of high quality emerging from a yet untapped food resource: Escherichia coli (E.coli). Through genetical modification, an odorless E. coli strain will be able to overproduce a self-designed wonder protein, containing the exact ratio of essential amino acids needed in the daily diet. Furthermore, the Edible coli will be able to produce essential fatty acids, Ω3 and Ω6. Neither of these products can be synthesized by the human body. This amazing nutrition-combo will be obtained from the degradation of otherwise non-degradable material for humans, such as cellulose. Edible coli is thus a bacteria containing some of the optimal quantity of nutrition a person needs, and will at the same time be tasty – with a touch of lemon.:::2014
