Caltech:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Implementation of Non-Endogenous Bacterial Quorum Sensing Systems in E. coli:::While there exist many well-characterized genetic circuits in synthetic biology utilizing intracellular genetic regulation, the implementation of methods governing intercellular regulation—that between two different cells—has lagged behind in comparison. To investigate the viability of independent, non-interfering cell-to-cell signaling, we attempted to implement non-endogenous bacterial quorum-sensing systems from various Gram positive bacteria in E. coli, in hopes that successful transfer of these systems into E. coli will promote enhanced prototyping of intercellular signaling and regulation in synthetic biology’s favorite model organism. To this end, three separate quorum sensing systems—agrBDCA, lamBDCA, and fsrABC—were investigated. We constructed various cell strains expressing separately the signaling and receiving components of the quorum sensing systems and measured their efficacy in creating and receiving the signaling molecule. Treatment of hormonal regulation disorders (e.g. diabetes, Cushing’s disease, etc.) is one of many possible applications of successful creation of circuits implementing intercellular regulation.:::2014
