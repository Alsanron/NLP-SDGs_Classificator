UCSD_Software:::North America:::United States:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SBiDer: Synthetic Biocircuit Developer:::Genetic circuits are often difficult to engineer, requiring months to design, build, and test each individual genetic device involved in the circuit. SBiDer, a web tool developed by the UCSD Software iGEM team, will leverage existing devices to construct a database with consideration for the function of each device interpreted as boolean logic. The data can be queried by the user through SBiDer's visual interface to explore circuit designs. The displayed circuit's literature reference, characterization data, and images of included devices can be viewed through the built-in table. Basic validation of the circuit performance is also provided within in the interface. SBiDer's web of information can be expanded through user-generated additions to the database to improve the efficiency of the application and the accuracy of the models.:::2014
