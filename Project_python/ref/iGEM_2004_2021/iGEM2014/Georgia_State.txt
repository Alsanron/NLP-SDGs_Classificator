Georgia_State:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Utilizing the PGAPZα vector system to modify and express Mambalgin in Pichia Pastoris:::The GSU iGEM team has been working with the PGAPZα vector system in order to use the vector to artificially produce the peptide Mambalgin-1, naturally found in the African Black Mamba snake venom. This protein is unique because it has the ability to exhibit sensations comparable to morphine, but is less addictive, more efficient, and easier to obtain on a larger scale, if synthesized in a laboratory setting. By ligating the Mambalgin DNA into the PGAPZα expression system, we are able to linearize and ultimately transform the gene of interest into eukaryotic yeast, Pichia Pastoris, allowing the protein to be excreted in its most pure form. The nature of the PGAPZα and Pichia Pastoris successfully provides a smooth transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic expression of the gene; therefore, we have chosen these vectors to effectively isolate and extract our most desired Mambalgin-1 peptide.:::2014
