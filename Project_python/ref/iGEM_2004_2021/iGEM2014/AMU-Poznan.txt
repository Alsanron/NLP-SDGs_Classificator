AMU-Poznan:::Europe:::Poland:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::sh-miR designer v2.0 - a user-friendly tool for sh-miR prediction:::RNA interference (RNAi) is a one of the post-transcriptional gene expression regulation process. The process occurs physiologically, but it can also be employed in biological research. RNAi reagents such as siRNAs, shRNAs and sh-miRs (also called artificial miRNAs or sh-miRNAs) are widely used in molecular biology. They can be used in basic research or in therapeutic approaches for genetic diseases. sh-miR designer is user-friendly and fast software for sh-miR design and in silico validation. In sh-miR designer v2.0 only the mRNA number (from NCBI database) can be provided to predict molecules targeting desired transcript. Moreover, we expanded functionality of the software with off-target validation and immune motifs presence verification and also extended the miRNA-shuttles database. With sh-miR designer we automated the tedious and time-consuming process of sh-miR design.:::2014
