SKLBC-China:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing(P):::High School:::Accepted:::WeIGEM+: A SNS-based Platform for iGEM:::With the development of technology, the use of biobrick has been widen. However, it is not easy to find out the right one in thousands of biobricks. We have been dreaming a bioinformatics solution. Here comes the WeiGEM+, Wechat plus iGEM, which is a multi-functional public account that includes BioBrick search engine and iGEM articles. Biobrick search engine can be a useful tool for IGEM participants. With the Catalogs in the WeiGEM, users can search the ideal BioBricks by typing key characteristics in the text box. The science popularization part contains instant news on advanced science, including synthetic biology, life technology and brief introduction on previous works in iGEM and so on. Besides, human partice such as iGEM China meetup has been held by us in our region. With WeiGEM, synthetic biology can be spread to the global world and this can be a new way for leading science popularization.:::2014
