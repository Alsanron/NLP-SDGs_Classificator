CSWProteens:::North America:::United States:::New Application(P):::High School:::Accepted:::PlantiFreeze:::Frost damage to crops causes loses of billions of dollars annually. Currently, farmersâ€™ attempts to prevent frost damage are decidedly low-tech and only marginally effective. A synthetic biology solution to this problem is a spray-on slurry of a nonpathogenic strain of E. coli that covers the crop with a biofilm containing a secreted antifreeze protein (AFP). AFP's possess the ability to bind to the ice crystals on the plant surface, inhibiting the formation of ice. RiAFP refers to an AFP produced by the Rhagium inquisitor long horned beetle. This protein is particularly attractive for recombinant expression and biotechnological applications.:::2014
