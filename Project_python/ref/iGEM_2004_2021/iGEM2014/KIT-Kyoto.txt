KIT-Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::Art & Design:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.motion: Dawn of the New Generation BioArt::: We infuse dynamic art and design into E.coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to create new inspiration. It is not just static, garden-variety of drawings with fluorescent proteins such as GFP, RFP or YFP, you have seen somewhere. In front of you are fragrance by monoterpene and motion of organisms in perfect combination. We even invite insects to perform around our artwork; monoterpene's repellent effect certainly affects insects' behavior. It is a BioArt of future generation that gratifies your senses. Our artwork will wow you and wake up your desire to express yourself in the form of art. You may think E.coli is stinky or poopy. No! With the power of synthetic biology, it can be aromatic! Our proposition: synthetic biology inspires everybody.:::2014
