DTU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Advancing Synthetic Biology: Measuring promoter activities using the Spinach RNA aptamer:::Since promoters are an integral part of every biological system, thorough characterization of promoters is a prerequisite for quick and robust construction of devices in synthetic biology. We have developed a method for measuring promoter activity in absolute units, that can be used to better characterize promoters. The method uses a fluorescent RNA reporter called Spinach and allows calculation of promoter activity in Polymerases per Second (PoPS). Furthermore the RNA reporter enables direct assessment of transcriptional activity without the factor of translational efficiency. In addition to this we have created a brainstorming exercise with the dual purpose of sparking an interest in synthetic biology among high school students, and providing the community with ideas for synthetic biology projects. Finally we have performed an analysis of the ethical issues associated with synthetic biology. All the efforts in our project have thus been directed towards advancing the field of synthetic biology.:::2014
