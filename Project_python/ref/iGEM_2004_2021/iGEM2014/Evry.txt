Evry:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Sponge patrol: Wipe the ocean clean!:::Our team wants to heighten awareness about environmental pollution and particularly its devastating consequences on the aquatic life. In this line of thinking we are driven to design a bioremediation tool to decrease the marine pollution and protect aquatic ecosystems. We aim at tackling elements of the main pollutant families by focusing on 5 toxic agents: Polychlorinated Biphenyls, nitrite, phenol, lead and cadmium. The bioremediation tool will be based on Pseudovibrio denitrificans, a bacterium living in symbiosis with Spongia officinalis. Our goal is to engineer the bacterium to detect, signal and degrade/capture pollutants and to bring it as new chassis in the iGEM competition. The projectâ€™s originality lies on the duo formed by Pseudovibrio denitrificans and its symbiotic sponge. Combining these two organisms allows for safe containment of the engineered strain while the extensive filtration capacity of the sponge stimulates the optimal sensing, signaling, and capturing of pollutants in water.:::2014
