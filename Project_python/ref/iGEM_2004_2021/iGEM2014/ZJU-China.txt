ZJU-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::GeneSocket:::The assembly of genetic circuits is a huge obstacle between designs and achievements in synthetic biology. Many well-known methods, from traditional restriction digestion & ligation, 3A assembly to Gibson assembly, aim to overcome the difficulties but unfortunately get respective defects. This year, ZJU-CHINA seeks to build a gene-insertion system in bacterial chromosome, "GeneSocket". Clearly different from the in vitro constructing methods mentioned before, GeneSocket, which can be easily combined with existing in vitro methods, makes gene expression more accurate, stable and controllable by assembling genetic elements in chromosome directly. Two core methods, lambda red recombination and recombinase-based bistable switch, are applied. Both are the best choices for achieving the characteristics of GeneSocket. We hope that by using GeneSocket, synthetic biologists can turn their theoretical design into reality faster and better. We want to lead to the revolution in techniques of synthetic biology!:::2014
