HUST-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Warlord E.CaoMengde - a tale of 3 pollutants treatment:::As a result of industrialization, heavy metal pollution has become a serious problem in the world and copper can be extremely toxic to human body. The excessive cellular amount of Cu ions can readily interact with oxygen, resulting in the generation of hydroxyl radicals which lead to harm. The typical disease caused by copper is called Wilson Disease, which has become a world concern. A rotating biological contactor (RBC) is a biofilm-based reactor technology widely used for wastewater treatment. In our program, we combine heavy metal meditation with RBC and developed a toolkit gathering Cu ions from polluted water, degrading the cyanide, detoxifying the fluoride and suggesting whether the water is safety in terms of copper amount. Our bacteria stands out with the character of accumulating everything in favor and eliminating things with hostility, which is similar to a famous Chinese historical warlord called Cao Mengde.:::2014
