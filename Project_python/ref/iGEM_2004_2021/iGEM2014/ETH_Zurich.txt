ETH_Zurich:::Europe:::Switzerland:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mosaicoli â€“ From simplicity to complexity with biologic gates:::Emergence of complex patterns in nature is a fascinating, widely spread phenomenon, which is not fully understood yet. Mosaicoli aims at investigating emergence of complex patterns from a simple rule by engineering a cellular automaton into E. coli. This automaton comprises a grid of colonies on a 3D-printed millifuidic chip. Each colony is either in an ON or OFF state and updates its state by integrating signals from its neighbors according to a genetically pre-programmed logic rule. Complex patterns, like Sierpinski triangles, are visualized by fluorescence after several steps of row-wise propagation. The implementation of quorum sensing based sequential logic computation is challenged by leakiness and crosstalk present in biological systems. Mosaicoli overcomes these issues by exploiting multichannel orthogonal communication, riboregulators and integrase-based XOR logic gates. Successfully engineering such a reliable system not only enables a better understanding of emergent patterns, but also provides novel building blocks for biological computers.:::2014
