USTC-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::C.imager:::In this project, our aim is to design and construct a colorful bio-imaging system----Once you project a picture on engineered C.cresentus, they present the same image accurately, and itâ€™s even flourescent! We took advantage of the nature of Caulobacter crescents (C.crescents), which is the ability to attach to a diverse range of surface by developing holdfast, to design circuits in C.crescentus in which light of different wavelength and intensity could trigger expression of corresponding florescent proteins as well as the enhancement of holdfast. So that C.crescentus can locate themselves correctly and present image colorfully. We also found that allosteric RNA operating as riboswitch is a promising alternative to proteins for synthetic chemical circuits due to its many distinct advantages such as rapid response and specificity. So we designed logic gates base on RNA switches to replace previous passway to create a faster C.imager.:::2014
