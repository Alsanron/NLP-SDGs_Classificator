Recent studies found that more than 69% of the extra virgin oil sold in US supermarkets is rancid, while no inexpensive testing method is currently available to consumers. Our team has developed a rapid, inexpensive and accurate technique to measure oil quality. We have built an electrochemical sensor that incorporates engineered enzymes to detect a spectrum of aldehydes that serve as a proxy of rancidity. Computational analysis and custom hardware that includes signal filtering, processing and optimization of chemical kinetics allows us to perform multi-compound detection and hence olive oil quality control in a highly reproducible manner. Current and future collaboration with olive oil producers and distributors will pave the way for a widely-applicable platform with far-fetching consumer applications.:::2014
