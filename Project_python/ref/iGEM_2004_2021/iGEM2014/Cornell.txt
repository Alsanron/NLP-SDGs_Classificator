Cornell:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Lead it go: Heavy metal sequestration from regional contaminated waters using genetically engineered E.coli:::Heavy metal pollution in water is one of the most significant public health risks around the world. Pollutants including lead, mercury, and nickel can enter water supplies through improper disposal of waste, industrial manufacturing, and mining. Previous researchers have developed biological methods of heavy metal sequestration utilizing heavy metal transport proteins and metallothioneins, a class of low-molecular weight proteins with high binding affinities for heavy metals. In these genetically engineered systems, the transport proteins will preferentially transport a specific heavy metal into the cell and the metallothionein will aggressively bind--driving flux into the cell and sequestering the toxic metal. Our research aims to modularize previous sequestration systems for nickel and mercury utilizing a yeast metallothionein/glutathione-s-transferase fusion protein as well the transport proteins NixA (nickel transporter) and merT/merP (mercury transporter). We also plan to extend this sequestration system using a putative lead transport protein.:::2014
