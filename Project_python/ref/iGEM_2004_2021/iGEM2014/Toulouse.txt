Toulouse:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Let's save our trees with SubtiTree !:::A threat, originated from the fungus Ceratocystis platani, affects the gorgeous plane trees in one of the most beautiful sites in Southern France named “Canal du Midi”. The Toulouse iGEM team is committed to protecting this UNESCO World Heritage site and has designed a bacterial cure named SubtiTree. This engineered bacterium derives from the natural Bacillus subtilis species present in the plane tree sap. SubtiTree’s mission is to detect, bind and destroy the pathogenic fungus. First, a chemotaxis module directed towards the N-Acetylglucosamine released by the fungi confers the ability to head for the pathogen. Secondly, the bacterium binds to the fungal cell wall via a chitin binding domain. The final step is to kill the pathogen using an antifungal triple therapy. Different strategies are developed to control the spreading of our smart bacterium in the environment. SubtiTree opens new perspectives to vanquish many fungal associated diseases in plants.:::2014
