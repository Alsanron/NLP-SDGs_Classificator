Genspace:::North America:::United States:::Community Labs:::Community Lab:::Accepted:::Open Lab:::The Open Lab is a key step towards democratization of synthetic biology. It is the complete set of knowledge, tools, and resources required to successfully develop a thriving community biolab, all created following open source principles. The project has four parts. 1) The Open Lab Blueprint, a website guide to launch and develop a sustainable community biolab. It includes the following components: starting up a lab, physical space, acquisition of key equipment, and efficiently implementing safety, standards and best practices, community-building, generating content and sustainability. 2) Open source equipment development in the form of a liquid handling robot, customizable with shareable protocols. 3) Set of IP-free fluorescent protein genes in open plasmid backbones to be made available to citizen scientists in the form of a starter activity kit. 4) Bioglyphics, a visual protocol design tool to lower the barrier of entry to synthetic biology practice, especially geared toward visual thinkers.:::2014
