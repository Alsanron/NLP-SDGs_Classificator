SCUT:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Forgotten Corner——Cellular Compartment:::This year, we focus on "cellular compartment”, aiming to construct a much more effective metabolic pathway in the full use of the advantages of different, membrane-bounded organelles. Concretely, we've built up a pathway to produce n-butanol in yeast. Throughout the pathway, all enzymes are transported into the mitochondria with the employment of leading peptide. We hope to bring the output of n-butanol up to a brand new level by utilizing higher concentration of ATP and the powerful coenzyme regeneration system in mitochondria. Moreover, we have assembled a CO2-fixing device with enzymes PRK, Rubisco and CA which are combined by scaffold protein. In order to take advantages of characteristics of subcellular structure, this device was anchored in outer membrane of mitochondria. Finally, we aim at raising the output of n-butanol by fixing CO2 with Rubisco. Meanwhile, we've built up and tested out leading peptides of other organelles for future research.:::2014
