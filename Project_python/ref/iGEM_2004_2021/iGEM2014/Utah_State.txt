Utah_State:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Stain Busters:::Laundry detergents are one of the most commonly used household cleaning products in todayâ€™s society because they effectively clean and remove stains from clothing. Even though they are relatively harmless to humans, laundry detergents contain caustic chemicals and reagents that have a detrimental impact on the environment. Our aim is to use enzymatic means of cleaning to reduce the amount of detergent necessary for normal washes as well as increase the efficiency of stain removal. We have engineered E. coli to produce enzymes that can be used to remove laundry stains such as grass, starch, and oils. By functionalizing these enzymes on a bioplastic material that can be used as an additive to traditional laundry cycles, we hope to improve the sanitation of clothing and other washable materials. The demonstration of enzyme functionality after biological immobilization will create a platform for future teams to display enzymes relevant to other applications.:::2014
