Astronauts have been sent to outer space. In the meantime, how to prevent radiation harm has become a serious problem that demands promting solution. Our project focuses on establishing a more portable, accurate and economical biosynthetic system to detect the dosage, and to provide measurement precisely to guard human from being hurt by invisible radiation. We assembly gene circuits in E.coli, which function as radiation detector and reporter individually. Meanwhile, we design bi-switch circuits for the detector, a quorum sensing circuits for reporter and a linkage between the two. Once the detector senses radiation by the damage, the linkage auto-inducer molecules will drive the reporter to produce light and digital signals. We firmly believe that this biological-activity-based detector system is more sensitive, and has more significant influence in measuring the level of harm by sensing the dosage of radiation.:::2014
