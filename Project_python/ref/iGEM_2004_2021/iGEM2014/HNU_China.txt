HNU_China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Alcoholic Miner: Iron Sensitive Absorbing Yeast with Optogenetic Apoptosis Biosafety System:::As far as the bronze age, our ancestors began to extract valuable metal from the mineral, with the combined process of chemical reaction and high temperature treatment, using quite a lot energy.When this ancient industry comes to the modern time, we would like to utilize microorganizms to extract metal with the tool of synthetic biology. Our microbial miner briefly consists of two systems, iron sensitive absorbing system and optogenetic apoptosis system, the last of which is designed for the biosafety reason. These two yeast systems combined to work together getting iron.:::2014
