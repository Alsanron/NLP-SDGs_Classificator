Nanjing_NFLS:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance(P):::High School:::Accepted:::CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing kit in eukaryotic cells:::Utilizing the unique features of CRISPR-Cas9 system, our team developed a gene editing tool kit that can be effectively used in eukaryotic cells. Comparing to the traditional approach that relies upon restriction enzymes, a CRISPR-Cas9 based system offers several advantages including greater flexibility in silencing, enhancing or repairing gene expression, and the ability to introduce larger gene fragments. Our gene editing kit has three components: Guide RNA (gRNA), outer membrane protein of TMV homologous DNA sequences and CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme. The system was designed to have great compatibility with a wide range of organisms and easy to work with, and has been preliminarily validated by plasmid transfection in CHO cell line. With iGEM database in mind, the kit follows a modular design and aims to future iGEM projects with greater flexibility and compatibility in gene editing.:::2014
