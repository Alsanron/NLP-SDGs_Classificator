Nevada:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BAIT Switch: Bioorthogonal Auxin Inducible Trigger for Protein Degradation:::In biological systems, changing from one state to another can depend on gene repression, induction of new genes, and degradation of previously used proteins. The ability to quickly and inducibly degrade a signal, repressor, or other protein would greatly improve the sensitivity and timing of biological switches. Auxin, a plant hormone, is involved in nearly every aspect of plant growth and development. In the presence of auxin, auxin receptors induce polyubiquitylation of a targeted protein, leading to degradation by the proteasome. This hormone based protein degradation has previously been used to create inducible protein degradation in yeast and mammalian cells. However, a parallel system – using jasmonic acid as the small molecule inducer – is also found in plants. Our goal is to use both the auxin and jasmonic acid responsive pathways to develop a quick, efficient, and bioorthogonal system to control protein stability in yeast.:::2014
