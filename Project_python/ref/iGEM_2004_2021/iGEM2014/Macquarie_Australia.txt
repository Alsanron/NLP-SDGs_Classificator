Macquarie_Australia:::Asia:::Australia:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Green Machine: Re-engineering the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway in E. coli:::Photosynthesis is a key biological pathway that uses the energy from sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into ATP, glucose and oxygen. Chlorophyll is a green pigment that facilitates energy production in photosynthetic organisms. Our goal is to engineer 13 genes of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway (CBP) from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to be expressed in E. coli. Although the CBP has been well characterised by biologists there has been no success in reproducing the process in a non-photosynthetic host. Successful production of chlorophyll in a bacterial host is the first step towards the synthetic construction of Photosystem II leading to industrial production of Hydrogen gas for energy production.:::2014
