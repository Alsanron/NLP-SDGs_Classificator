Tuebingen:::Europe:::Germany:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::T-ECO: Tuebingen Erythrocyte Converter to O:::Blood types within the ABO-system differ in their glycosylation. The oligosaccharide characterizing type O is a precursor for those characterizing types A and B. Thus, shortages of type O blood units, which can be received by people with any common ABO genotype, might be overcome by specific deglycosylation of blood units of type A, B or AB. For this task we will utilize blood antigen-specific glycosidases in combination with different immobilisation tags. Ultimately we aim to create a matrix coated with our enzymes, able to convert blood for transfusion. Of the three enzymes we utilize, two will leave the blood compatible with all common ABO-types, while one will make the blood compatible even with the rare Bombay-blood type (Oh). Additionally we will provide the parts-registry with new protein-tags in the RFC25 standard for fusion proteins, allowing protein-protein coupling as well as immobilization on specifically prepared matrices.:::2014
