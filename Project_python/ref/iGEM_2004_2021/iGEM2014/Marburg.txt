Marburg:::Europe:::Germany:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SURF – Synthetic units for redirecting functionalities:::Life’s success story on earth is largely based on the rewiring of a rather limited set of naturally occurring protein modules. We systematically analyzed the structural evolution of certain protein families by a computational approach, and deduced design principles for the creation of artificial scaffolds and catalysts with individualized properties. By this approach, we enable exchangeable and extendable protein libraries that carry synergistic functionalities. Our conceptual approach is challenged by the creation of chimeric proteins and their functional assessment as relevant biotechnological and biomedical applications for the sake of humankind.:::2014
