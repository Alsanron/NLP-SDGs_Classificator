UIUC_Illinois:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Puppy Probiotics: Theobromine Degradation by an Engineered Lactobacillus plantarum:::The stimulant theobromine is an alkaloid found naturally in cocoa trees and chocolate. Due to metabolic inefficiencies, canines cannot digest theobromine as quickly as humans can, thus leading to an excess of the stimulant in the gastointestinal tract. Even small amounts of chocolate can induce toxic side effects such as nausea and even death in canines. However, by manipulating theobromine via N-demethylases, it can be metabolized into xanthine, which is much safer for animal digestion. By repurposing a previously characterized caffeine degradation operon into Lactobacillus plantarum, we aim to create a probiotic that can sustain theobromine N-demethylation while simultaneously colonizing canine guts. We will also incorporate modeling with our experimental data to determine the feasibility of our novel probiotic strategy.:::2014
