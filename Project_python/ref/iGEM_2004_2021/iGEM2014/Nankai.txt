Nankai:::Asia:::China:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Super Petroleum Magician:an anaerobic rhamnolipid-producing engineered bacterial strain for microbial enhanced oil recovery::: Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) is a popular method that relies on microorganisms and their metabolic products to mobilize residual oil. Rhamnolipid, a widely-used biosurfactant produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa under aerobic conditions, is helpful in reducing oil-water interfacial tension, which makes it easier to remove oil. However, because of the anaerobic environment in oil reservoirs, rhamnolipid has to be produced ex situ, and then injected into the oil reservoirs. Our project is to build a bacterial strain that is able to utilize oil as its carbon resource as well as producing rhamnolipid in anaerobic environment. We start with a Pseudomonas stutzeri strain that lives in the oil reservoirs, clone and make it express the rhamnosyltransferase operon genes rhlABRI from Pseudomonas aeruginosa so that it can produce and excrete rhamnolipid into the oil constantly. With all the strengths enhancing the oil recovery, we name our engineered bacterium "Super Petroleum Magician".:::2014
