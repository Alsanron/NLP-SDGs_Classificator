Beijing_HDFLS_High:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine(P):::High School:::Accepted:::The UV-responsing tandem generators for a wintergreen odor and protective melittin.:::We design a bacteria that produces a wintergreen odor and protective melittin under extensive UV radiation. The biological system includes two generators: the UV-responsing wintergreen odor generator (BBa_K994000) and UV-responsing melittin generator. The melittin generator is composed of two transcriptional devices: RecA (SOS) promoter (BBa_J22106) and synthesized melittin gene with enterokinase digested sequence. The protective generator takes as input extensive UV radiation and produces as output fusion melittin. Melittin can improve immunity and scavenging free radicals to alleviate the harm from electromagnetic radiation, such as UV and blue light.:::2014
