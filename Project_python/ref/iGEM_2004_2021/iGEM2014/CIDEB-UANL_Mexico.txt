CIDEB-UANL_Mexico:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::E. CARU:::iGEM CIDEB 2014 team’s project is a bio-filter of sodium ions in salt water. In order to work and test the different processes of the project, it was divided into four modules, which also made up the acronym of our project’s name: Capture, Aroma, Resistance, and Union. Capture module is in charge of recollecting sodium ions in the water due to the new NhaS gen registered by the team. Aroma module is with the help of salicylic acid, responsible of producing a Winter Green odor that acts as a reporter if the bio-filter is working. Resistance module allows the E. coli to survive in the salty environment of the water, and this allows the bio-filter to works. Finally, the Union module allow the bacterium to joins to a silica pearl, which facilitates the removal of the bacteria from the water.:::2014
