Queens_Canada:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Inteins- Designed by Nature, Accessible by Design:::Found across all domains of life, inteins are protein elements capable of autocatalytic splicing. This phenomenon, termed protein splicing, allows inteins to be a point of control in forming mature and functional protein products. Current genetic circuits are limited by transcriptional lag, rendering them limited in applications which require fidelity and responsiveness. Inteins represent an innovative solution to improving the sensitivity of biosensors and synthetic circuits circumventing this lag and controlling the output of the circuit at the protein level. Here, we have created an intein toolkit, designed to introduce and facilitate the use of inteins in future iGEM projects. We have engineered several inducible intein switches capable of being activated by common environmental triggers as well as small molecules. To showcase the utility of inteins, we have also developed an intein based system to tackle mitochondria disease by allotropically expressing and transporting mitochondria proteins using inteins.:::2014
