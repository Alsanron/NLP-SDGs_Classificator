Aalto-Helsinki:::Europe:::Finland:::Entrepreneurship:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Aalto-Helsinki Bioworks - A Synthetic Biology Startup with a Three-Channel Gene Switch:::We have engineered a three-channel switch that is controlled with the intensity of blue light. By utilizing the mechanisms of the lambda repressor, we are able to switch between the expressions of three different genes with a short delay. This kind of mechanism provides a nearly real-time control over genes, which could provide advantages in variety of industrial bioprocesses. Inspired by the principles of open source software, we introduce an Open Sequence business model implemented around our switch. We want to encourage future companies to create Open Sequence based solutions and to empower customers to participate in the product development. Open Sequence modelâ€™s transparency as well as lower degree of protection raises trust and continuity and benefits larger community. We want to share our experiences and insights in biotech entrepreneurship and address the difficulties that students and newcomers may face in the early stages of building a synthetic biology startup.:::2014
