Acton-BoxboroughRHS:::North America:::United States:::Food & Energy(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Project E. coli Luwak:::Kopi Luwak coffee is the rarest and the most expensive type of coffee in the world, and is processed from feces of the Asian Palm Civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). As the coffee berries are digested, bitter components of the coffee bean are broken down. Later, the beans are cleaned, roasted, and brewed to make the Kopi Luwak coffee. The problem with the procedure today is that farming industries keeps tens of thousands of civets living in battery cages, and force-feeds them only coffee berries. As a result of the treatment, the Asian Palm Civet population is declining. We propose to make this process humane, efficient, and sanitary by instead using bacteria to produce the coffee. We will accomplish this by genetically engineering E. coli with genes for various digestive enzymes, thus simulating the digestive process of the civets with coffee berries so we can finally save the Asian Palm Civets.:::2014
