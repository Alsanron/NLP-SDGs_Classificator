SJTU-BioX-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Crown:::This year, our project intends to achieve protein polymerization with the help of TAL effector (Tale Transcription Activatorâ€“like Effector), a DNA-binding protein, which can recognize a specific nucleotide sequence. With circular DNA(plasmid) as the connection medium, expressed proteins in the host can form a complex selectively, so that a variety of enzyme combinations can be used to complete different tasks. Compared to traditional methods, the advantages of the project lie in selective polymerization of proteins and the ability to mediate polymerization between more proteins.:::2014
