WHHS_Cincinnati_OH:::North America:::United States:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Arsenic Biosensor:::In many developing countries, arsenic-contaminated water remains a cause of many problems. Although the WHO and EPA both recommend a maximum level of contamination of 10 ppb, many areas, like West Bengal and Bangladesh, have a much more relaxed 50 ppb. Arsenicosis, arsenic poisoning, has severe effects, including headaches, vomiting, hair loss, and skin lesions. Arsenic has also been known to lead to heart disease, stroke, cancer, and eventually death. A reliable biosensor would allow these areas to observe arsenic contamination. This inspired the WHHS iGEM to design a project similar and just as effective, yet with our own spin. Instead of pH, a pigment output would also be a viable method. Using the lycopene plasmids that were created by the 2009 Cambridge team, we are engineering an E. Coli strain that will produce a visible solid yellow pigment (PNPG) when it comes in contact with toxic arsenic concentrations.:::2014
