Carnegie_Mellon:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::STREAM: Sensor That Reports Endocrine Activating Molecules:::Detection of hormones in the environment has raised concerns recently because of their potential to affect both humans and wildlife. Estrogens from natural, synthetic, plant, and fungal sources show endocrine disrupting properties and even at low concentrations have harmful effects due to receptor activation. A sensor was constructed using the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor. Estrogenic activity occurs in water sources including waste, drinking, and freshwater. In freshwater, estrogens are harmful to the ecosystems, feminizing fish and disrupting populations of organisms. Additionally, estrogenic substances can be present in what we drink. However, since the presence of hormones in water is a relatively new area of study there have been no previous restrictions or regulations regarding removal of estrogenic compounds. The sensor and fish ecosystems were modeled and middle school outreach kits for Creature Feature and DNA extraction and hybridization were created to demonstrate concepts of synthetic biology.:::2014
