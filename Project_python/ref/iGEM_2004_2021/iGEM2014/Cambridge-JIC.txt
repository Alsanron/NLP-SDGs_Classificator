The shift from analogue to digital came first. Now, a new change is happening: biosensors are allowing mankind to detect compounds and the environment using genetically-enhanced life forms. However the creation of such biosensors requires deep knowledge and dedicated facilities. What if it were possible to create customised biosensors in the comfort of one's home? mösbi is a modular, open-source biosensing platform developed using a novel, user-friendly plant chassis: Marchantia polymorpha. The mösbi biosensors consist of 3 modules: input, output and processing. The user is free to mix-and-match the modules to create custom biosensors simply by crossing the chosen modules’ pre-transformed plant lines and collecting the progeny. mösbi’s open-source nature allows users to create and modify modules ensuring its continuous evolution. In farming, homes, education, and maybe even space - mösbi will change the way we view biosensors.:::2014
