NJU-QIBEBT:::Asia:::China:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.coil:::Fatty acid(FFA) plays an essential role in many aspects of modern society, such as food industry, rubber industry, fuel, etc. Relied on animal grease or plant oil currently, the FFA production, however, is highly restricted by seasonal, regional factors and the expensive manufacturing cost. Therefore, we strive to transform E.coli into a biological factory that produces more FFAs of different length of carbon chain and saturation levels in both an efficient and a controlled manner. To achieve that, we will introduce FFA desaturase and various thioesterase, key enzymes for unsaturated FFA production and FFA synthesis respectively, and different operon structure into the engineering E.coli. Also, we design a fluorescence system composed of Transcriptional Regulatory Protein FadR to monitor the FFA producing status in E.coli. In this case, we can produce different FFAs by applying different signals to operons in E.coli and detect the real time production status by fluorescence report.:::2014
