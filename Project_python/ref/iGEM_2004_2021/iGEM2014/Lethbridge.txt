Lethbridge:::North America:::Canada:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Nomadocytes: Engineering Microglia for CNS Cell Therapy:::Stroke and neurodegenerative disease collectively cost the Canadian medical system millions of dollars annually while effective neural regenerative therapies remain elusive. Astrogliosis, a cellular response to such neural insults, leads to the formation of a non-functional “glial scar” and an inhibitory cellular environment that impedes neural regrowth and recovery. Our project involves engineering microglia, the mobile immune cells of the brain, to package and deliver a therapeutic plasmid specifically to central nervous system cells. The plasmid encodes a reprogramming factor that converts reactive astrocytes into new neurons, helping to restore the functional neuronal population and permit regrowth of damaged connections. We have also developed a novel plasmid selection system that bypasses antibiotic-based selection to reduce the size of the reprogramming plasmid. This project has the potential to provide a novel, non-invasive rehabilitative therapy that could lead to significantly improved functional recovery following brain injury or disease onset.:::2014
