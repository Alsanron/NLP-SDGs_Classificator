SCAU-China:::Asia:::China:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::High Efficiency MFC-Based Seawater Desalination Device:::In view of rapid depletion of traditional energy resources and increasing demand of desalination of seawater for fresh water, we aimed to enhance the electrogenic capacity of microbial fuel cells (MFC) by genetically modified bacteria and optimize the traditional microbial desalination cells (MDC) device. We knocked out the arcA gene, over-expressed the nadE gene and incorporated the porin OprF in cell membrane in E. coli. These modifications released the inhibition of metabolic enzymes in anaerobic condition of ArcA protein, also boosted up intracellular NAD+(H) level for higher electron transferring rate and provided membrane channels for electron exchange, by which the electrogenic capacity of the MFC was collectively enhanced resulting in a high efficient seawater desalination in MDC system.:::2014
