WalthamHS_BioHawks:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Stain Removers: Creating an Environmentally Friendly Alternative:::For the Biohawks iGEM team, our primary goal is to develop an organic, safe stain remover for commonplace applications. By transforming bacteria to manufacture an enzyme that breaks down common proteins, we hope to present a new alternative to marketed removal products, which contain harsh chemicals. In theory, many enzymes could be used, varying in function to break-down different molecules such as cellulose in plant-based stains, lipids in oil stains, starches in condiment stains, and so on. However, not all enzymes can be used, as the integrity of the clothing must be preserved and the user must be kept safe from harm. Some enzymes or solutions can cause epidermal damage or respiratory problems. Our goal, using the enzyme subtilisin, is to remove protein-based stains and create a substitute for potent chemicals with a green solution for the 21st century.:::2014
