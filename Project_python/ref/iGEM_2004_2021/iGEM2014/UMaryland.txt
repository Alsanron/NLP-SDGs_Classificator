UMaryland:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineered E. coli Biosensors for the Oyster Pathogen Perkinsus marinus:::The population of Crasseoterra virginica, the Eastern oyster, is a fraction of what it once was. A major reason for this decline is the spread of Perkinsus marinus, a protist that infests oyster cells, causing tissue damage and eventual oyster death. P. marinus infection requires recognition of a four-domain galectin protein, CvGal1, produced by oyster hemocytes to capture bacteria by binding surface sugars. P. marinus targets CvGal1 using unknown carbohydrate ligands on the protest surface. As a first step in generating a bacterial biosensor for P. marinus, a recombinant OmpA-CvGal1 protein was engineered to anchor on the E. coli outer cell membrane. OmpA fusions with mammalian two-domain galectins were similarly engineered to investigate the effect of galectin size on the efficiency of membrane display and pathogen recognition. The receptor was designed to couple to a defensive response, such as the production of anchored beta-galactosidase to cleave P. marinus recognition ligands.:::2014
