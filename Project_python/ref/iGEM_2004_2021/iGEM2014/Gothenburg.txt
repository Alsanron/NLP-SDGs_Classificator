Gothenburg:::Europe:::Sweden:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::How I colored your mother:::In order to determine the replicative age of a yeast cell, researchers usually rely on direct micromanipulation of daughter cells and bud-scar counting. Given the long generation time of a cell (approx. 90 min), measuring its replicative lifespan is a laborious and time-consuming procedure. The goal of this project is to address this problem with a synthetic biology approach. We design and implement in Saccharomyces cerevisiae a synthetic gene circuit that “colors” mother cells depending on their replicative age. We use a combination of endogenous elements and Crispr/Cas-based transcription factors to induce expression of different fluorescent proteins depending on the number of budding events that the mother cells have already experienced. We foresee that the successful outcome of this project will not only facilitate yeast age determination but will also pave the way to using cell sorters in order to fully automatize the procedure.:::2014
