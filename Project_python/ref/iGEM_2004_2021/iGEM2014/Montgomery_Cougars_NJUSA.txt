Montgomery_Cougars_NJUSA:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Acne Vulgaris Prevention through Dehydrogenation of Sebaceous Lipids:::Acne vulgaris affects around 85% of American adolescents. The four main causes of acne are comedogenesis, sebum production, proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes, and inflammation in the form of papules, pustules, and nodules. Triglycerides, wax esters, squalene, free fatty acids, and sapienic acid are the main components of sebum. Our team has created a biosystem that reduces the presence of sebaceous components (primarily wax esters). Our mechanism includes two proteins of interest-Medium Chain Alcohol Dehydrogenase and Medium Chain Aldehyde Dehydrogenase in two identical biological circuits to change the structure of wax esters and other lipids, rendering them insufficient for bacterial consumption. We included a basic promoter, RBS and terminator, making the protein-coding domain the only variable between the two circuits. We hope this mechanism facilitates sebum breakdown and reduces inflammatory responses of the P. acne bacteria.:::2014
