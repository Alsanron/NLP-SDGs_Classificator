Braunschweig:::Europe:::Germany:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. cowli -fighting climate change where it begins-:::Milk cows and cattle are important factors in global warming: In their rumen, billions of microorganisms release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane as they help digest the animal’s food. Even though this is a natural process industrial-scale farming intensifies the situation. Therefore, finding ways to decrease production of such gases damaging to climate is essential. Considering the 25 times greater contribution to global warming compared to CO2, methane emission is a substantial point of action for future climate protection. In order to achieve this, we are going to engineer a bacterium in a way that it is able to render methane harmless just as it originates in the cow’s rumen. The bacterium shall be equipped with the 6 subunits of the monooxygenase (MMO) out of Methylococcus capsulatus turning methane into a natural intermediate of the cellular metabolism so that no methane is released into the atmosphere.:::2014
