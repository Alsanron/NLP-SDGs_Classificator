Brasil-SP:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Kidney sensing - toward a bacterial biosensor engineered for early stages chronic kidney disease:::Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which is characterized by alterations in kidney functions and structure, affects millions of people worldwide and a large portion of them is unaware of it. Absence of symptoms in early stages leads to a late diagnosis when patients need dialysis or even transplants. Currently, CKD is diagnosed by measuring creatinine levels in blood, which in turn are detectable only at late stages of renal dysfunction as well as are sensitive to factors such as diet, gender, ethnicity, age, muscle mass. We report the development of a biosensor that can diagnosis CKD in its early stages, identifying a biomarker named Cystatin C. Using a cell surface biosensor as detector and quorum-sensing system as transducer and response mechanism, we developed a genetic circuit that establishes a threshold, differentiating concentration ranges of Cystatin C. We envisioned it as a fast, simple and reliable tool for CKD screening and diagnosis.:::2014
