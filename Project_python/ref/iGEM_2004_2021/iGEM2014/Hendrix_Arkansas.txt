Hendrix_Arkansas:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Using synthetic biology to engineer a visible alkane-reporter strain of Yarrowia lipolytica yeast:::Cancerous cells are known to give off volatile compounds (alkanes) that can be detected by trained dogs. Our goal is to engineer a strain of Yarrowia lipolytica, which is capable of detecting alkanes, to turn color in the presence of these volatile compounds. We hope that we can use this yeast to detect melanoma cheaply and non-invasively (perhaps in a cancer detecting band-aid). To achieve our goal, we will build a reporter construct that uses an alkane sensitive promoter to drive the expression of a blue chromoprotein from the coral Acropora millepora which should cause the yeast to turn blue in the presence of alkanes. Our parts include an alkane response element (3xARE1), a leu minimal promoter, our reporter gene (blue chromoprotein), and a terminator (XPR2). Once the reporter construct is assembled, we will clone it into a Yarrowia lipolytica shuttle vector and integrate it into the yeast genome.:::2014
