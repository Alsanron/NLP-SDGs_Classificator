HUST-Innovators:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Using the third generation sequencing technology in EPA production:::Using the conception of module ，We are trying to use the third generation sequencing to build new biobricks from some unsequncing species.This is a novel idea to combine the bioinformatics and the synthetic biology.We improve the algorithm to let the sequencing be quicker and cheaper and the output of our software includes both genome and some useful biobricks. Then we apply this software for the Thraustochytrids which has not been sequenced yet.By analysising the output of the software，we locate the sequence which the Thraustochytrids use to produce EPA，then we use this sequence and assemble them as biobricks and transfer them into yeast which have a mechanism that control a set of particular enzyme by the concentration of lactose .So the production of EPA can be controled by lactose.:::2014
