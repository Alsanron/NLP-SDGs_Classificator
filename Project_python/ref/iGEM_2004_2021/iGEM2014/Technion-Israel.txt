Technion-Israel:::Europe:::Israel:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Safie:::Our team is building a proof-of-concept computational network using E. coli cells for the detection of trace amounts of harmful substances, such as allergens in food. Each cell is an independent computational module programmed to execute instructions based on common input. They comprise bypassed toggle switches - mimicking transistors (the basis of any computational system), an interchangeable promoter serves as an input port, and a histidine kinase two-component signaling system fused to a sensor in the periplasmic domain will serve as a converter for other input signals. The independent modules communicate using quorum sensing to produce a unified output signal. We are chemically synthesizing a photo-switching molecule connecting the cells together, creating an artificial biofilm. The result is a network made of independent computational elements that upon detection of a substance, co-operate to provide the user with an output visible to the naked eye.:::2014
