UC-Santa_Cruz-BioE:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: Increasing Coulombic Efficiency and Current Density in a Microbial Fuel Cell:::The UC-Santa Cruz-BioE team is working to design a self-sustaining microbial fuel cell (MFC) that can run on waste water. Microbial fuel cells use bacteria to metabolize organic compounds from waste water and generate electricity under anaerobic conditions through electron transfer to an anode. For our project we plan on engineering Shewanella oneidensis as our electrogenic host. Our first goal is to increase the coulombic efficiency that is lost by Shewanellaâ€™s preference to turn acetyl-CoA into acetate, as opposed to metabolizing it through the citric acid cycle[2]. Our second goal is to increase the efficiency of the MFC by altering growth patterns of the bacteria. Current density has been shown to be dependent on biofilm formation by the electrogenic bacteria within the MFC[8]. Therefore we plan to increase current density by increasing biofilm growth.:::2014
