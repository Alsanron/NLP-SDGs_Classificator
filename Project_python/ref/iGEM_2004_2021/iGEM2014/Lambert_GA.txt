Chitosan is derived from chitin through the N-deacetylation process. Uses include agriculture, medicine, and industry. Research in our local community led us to research applying chitosan in an agriculture setting by preserving post harvest fruit from fungal infections. Current technology to produce chitosan involves a caustic chemical process that is detrimental to the environment. An alkali sodium hydroxide removes the acetyl group from chitin to produce chitosan. Fortunately, this conversion process also takes place in the natural environment in a multitude of organisms through the aid of an enzyme called chitin deacetylase, or CDA. The main focus of our project was to obtain a CDA gene from a eukaryotic source, engineer a suitable vector with promoter, and transform into a bacterial host using the standard Biobrick assembly.:::2014
