Rutgers:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Enzymatic de novo DNA Synthesis:::The synthesis of nucleic acids with custom sequences is a very important tool in the research of biological systems. The prevailing strategy for DNA synthesis is the phosphoramidite strategy, which involves anhydrous solvents and acidic environments that are slightly harmful to DNA, causing small amounts of side reactions that limit overall efficiency and yield. In theory, using enzymes instead would eliminate all deleterious side reactions, allowing for extremely high levels of efficiency that would lead to very inexpensive gene-length DNA synthesis. A template-independent polymerase called Terminal Transferase was tested as a catalyst for the Coupling reaction, and several different Esterase enzymes were tested as catalysts for the Deblocking reaction.:::2014
