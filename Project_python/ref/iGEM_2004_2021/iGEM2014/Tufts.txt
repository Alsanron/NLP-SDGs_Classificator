Tufts:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Robust biofilm formation using a cyclic-di-GMP aptamer and investigating ethics and applications of engineered bactiophage:::A long, noncoding massively expressed regulatory RNA (merRNA) discovered in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is present in high levels during its dormant phase. The merRNA is believed to sequester cyclic-di-GMP, much like a sponge. Since cyclic-di-GMP is a second messenger for various cellular functions, including motility and biofilm formation, the Tufts iGEM team introduced this merRNA sequence into E. coli. Constitutive expression of this merRNA transcript was shown to increase biofilm formation. This property can be useful in microbe-based approaches to environmental remediation. Earlier designs for phage delivery of the merRNA to disrupt biofilms inspired an investigation into the policy surrounding engineered bacteriophage. Tufts iGEM will be convening a panel of experts from various disciplines to put forth recommendations for the responsible use of phage in therapeutic and industrial applications. A proposal will be drafted for a silk bandage containing a phage cocktail which can prevent and treat infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.:::2014
