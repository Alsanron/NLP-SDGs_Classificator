MIT:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Diagnosis and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease:::Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the aggregation of beta-amyloid oligomers in the brain. These cause neuron death and disrupt the proper functioning of surviving neurons. Despite the severity of the disease, Alzheimer's diagnosis and treatment are limited to post-symptomatic psychological methods and so there is great need for molecular detection and alleviation mechanisms. To address this, we have genetically engineered a system to diagnose and treat Alzheimer’s disease. Diagnosis is based on the detection of two Alzheimer’s-specific biomarkers in the brain: extracellular beta-amyloid protein oligomers and the intracellular miRNA profile of afflicted neurons. Successful detection triggers a treatment module that reduces beta-amyloid levels, thereby preventing neuronal death and slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s symptoms. This research demonstrates an approach that could inform an eventual treatment, not only for Alzheimer’s disease, but for numerous other human afflictions.:::2014
