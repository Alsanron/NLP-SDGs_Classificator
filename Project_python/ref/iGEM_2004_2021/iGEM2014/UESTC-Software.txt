UESTC-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CRISPR-X: a sgRNA design tool for genome editing in synthetic biology:::Just like “Plants vs. Zombies” has become one of the most popular games, CRISPR/Cas system learned, borrowed and modified from the natural game “Bacteria vs. Phages” has been the hottest technology for genome editing. The CRISPR craze wept across scientific community last year. Synthetic Biology and iGEM were no exception. The sgRNA design tools are an important part for CRISPR/Cas technology. However, all available tools neglect the purpose of a given experiment, pay no attention to BioBricks standards, and do not support standard for synthetic biology data exchange (SBOL). Thus, a sgRNA design tool for genome editing in synthetic biology is desirable. In this project, we present CRISPR-X, a sgRNA design tool fully supporting SBOL and BioBricks standards with dynamic algorithm based on intent function, chassis, and newest experimental data. The program can be used on all platforms.:::2014
