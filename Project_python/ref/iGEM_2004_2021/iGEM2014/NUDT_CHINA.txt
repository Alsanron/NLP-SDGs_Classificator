NUDT_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Programming bacteria to solve the shortest path problem in a directed graph:::The Single Pair Shortest Path Problem (SPP) is one of the basic problems with many applications. Many computational methods, such as Dijkstra algorithm etc., can solve it in a tolerable computational complexity. However, as the technology of the traditional silicon computers is gradually meeting its physical limits, new methods of the high-volume computing has been looked for for years. As developing rapidly, synthetic biology makes bacterial computing possible and great potential. Here, we designed a series of genetic circuits in Escherichia coli to solve the SPP in a directed graph. The nodes and arrows are programed as well-assigned promoters and transcription factors (TFs) respectively. The paths in the graph are described by the transcriptional regulatory cascades. The promoter of destination node in SPP is followed by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter. According theoretical analysis, we can find the the shortest path with linear computational complexity.:::2014
