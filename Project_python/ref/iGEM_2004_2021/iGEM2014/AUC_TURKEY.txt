AUC_TURKEY:::Europe:::Turkey:::Foundational Advance(P):::High School:::Accepted:::DegradEColor:::Response systems possess great significance in the validation of designed systems in the current state of synthetic biology. This year we, team AUC_Turkey, focused on the improving of response system. In our appraisal, we recognized that it would perhaps be easier to degrade dye instead of producing fluorescent proteins or pigments. In our new response system, the module will primarily be transparent and will change color according to enzyme activity thus creating a distinction between the initial and secondary modules. The process will allow a relatively faster response through the cleavage of the enzymes. The usage of different types of enzymes will result in differentiation in the cleavage and through the examination of the color; it will be possible to make find an equivalent match on the scale. DegradEcolor will be a fast response system as an alternative to the most popular response systems:::2014
