ATOMS-Turkiye:::Europe:::Turkey:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Change of Heart::: Tissue hypoxia, or ischemia, is the condition that describes the poor conveyance of oxygen and other vital products to body tissues and organs which consequently results tissue death. Up to now, the number one cause of death worldwide is caused by ischemia and related conditions such as heart attack or stroke. It is needed to regard the big picture of the condition in order to solve the problem. In our project, our will is to build two different devices, which work synergistically, to fix these two distinct situations. We decided to use ‘’hypoxia inducible systems” and ‘’reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive gene fragments’’. These two receptors will hopefully regulate the release of clot dissolving factors and antioxidant peptides synthesized by our engineered vessel cells. We hope to bring encouraging results in vitro to pave the way of this promising system into the lifesaving remedy method.:::2014
