INSA-Lyon:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CurLy' on:::The INSA-Lyon team is developping an E. coli-based platform as an alternative depollution method for metal contamination in water using an amyloid-display system for surface-functionalization, called CurLy'On. As far as France is concerned, drinkable water contamination from the metal pipes is a real issue. Indeed, the cost is estimated to twenty billion euros to fully replace the existing infrastructure. Using our system based on nano-sponge surfaces for water purification, we propose to extend this concept into a cheap bacterial filter as a solution. Indeed, the use of surface-specific protein particularly benefits the biotechnology research field, and extensively the synthetic biology field, in depollution alternative strategies but also in the medical field by improving the dialysisâ€™ filter specificty on various metals for renal-insufficient patients.:::2014
