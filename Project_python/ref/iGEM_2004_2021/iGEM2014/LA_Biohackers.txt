LA_Biohackers:::North America:::United States:::Community Labs:::Community Lab:::Accepted:::Boot up a Genome:::We are using Bacillus subtilus as a backbone to incorporate the entire genome of Streptococcus thermophilus. Once incorporated, we use the cre/lox recombination system to remove the Bacillus subtilus genome so only the Streptococcus thermophilus genome remains. This demonstrates the use of Bacillus subtilus as an ideal chassis to boot up an artificial genome.:::2014
