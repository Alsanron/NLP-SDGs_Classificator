We're engineering cell lines containing the gene fragments of LacZalpha and will use an E.coli cell line with the M15 mutation expressing the omega fragment of Beta-galactosidase. We're introducing a cassette of coliphage cell lysis genes under the control of a coliphage promoter to accelerate the enzyme fragment release, further reducing test time. Alternative to the enzymatic read-out we are exploring a microfluidic system to detect the lysis of the cells. Our goal is to design a fast-acting hand-held coliphage biosensor device that can be used by someone without any special technical expertise. Our device is useful in rapidly reporting the contamination of recreational waters or assuring drinkable water in developing nations.:::2014
