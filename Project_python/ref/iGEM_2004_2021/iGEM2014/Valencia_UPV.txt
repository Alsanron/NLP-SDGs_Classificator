Valencia_UPV:::Europe:::Spain:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Sexy Plant:::The Sexy Plant offers a sustainable alternative to current pest management and crop protection techniques, which nowadays rely on pesticides and chemically synthetized pheromones, which are chemical signals that insects use to communicate. We are developing a synthetic plant capable of producing insect sexual pheromones and releasing them into the air. High concentration of sexual pheromones into the air prevent male insects from finding the females. Using this mate disruption strategy, damage in crops caused by larvae is avoided. Since the Sexy Plant is implemented with a genetic switch and a biosafety module, it rises as a strong, safe and environmentally friendly candidate as the pest management method of the future.:::2014
