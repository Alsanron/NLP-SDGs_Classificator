Tianjin:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Transfibre:::Biosensors are becoming more and more indispensable tools in life science, medicine, chemistry and biotechnology. Yet in the bio-sensing procedure, the limitations of signal output methods restrict the usage and practicality of biosensors. Wildly used reporters such as chromophore and fluorescent protein which requires laboratorial equipments to measure often result in the loss of accuracy and immediacy. Thus our project is focus on the bio-signal transformation to diversify output methods of biosensor. Following this idea, we design a transducer which can convert the change of gene expression level that stimulated by inducer directly into the electric signal via inductive synthesis（or destroy）of nanowire between the electrodes. Curli fiber, a well characterized amyloid fiber which forms β-sheet-rich amyloid fibers, seems to be an ideal foundation of our nanowire structure. CsgA, the modified morphon protein of curli fiber with the ability to bind nano gold particles, will play the role as the conductor.:::2014
