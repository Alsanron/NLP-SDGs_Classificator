Michigan_Software:::North America:::United States:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ProtoCat: Increasing Reproducibility Through Protocol Sharing And Review:::Choosing apt and reliable protocols for new experiments is a problem that wet labs routinely face due to the difficulty in anticipating which protocols will produce the best results. Experimental practices may differ immensely across laboratories and precise details of these practices may be lost or forgotten as skilled faculty or students leave the lab to pursue other endeavors. Furthermore, there are few well-defined protocols that are generally agreed upon by the scientific community, in part due to the lack of a system that can supply a measure of a protocol’s acceptance. In order to address these problems, we set out to build a database that integrates a crowdsourced ratings and comments system to serve as a protocol curator that enables wet lab investigators to compare various protocol efficacies, quantify a protocol’s acceptance within the scientific community, and provide an avenue through which experiential knowledge can be communicated.:::2014
