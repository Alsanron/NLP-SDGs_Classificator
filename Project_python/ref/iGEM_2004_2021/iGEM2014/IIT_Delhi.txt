IIT_Delhi:::Asia:::India:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Eco.Coli : Eco-Friendly Reduction of Harmful Oxides from Automobiles and Industrial Emissions:::The effects Global Warming has attracted the attention of the major stake holders of the world who believe that the need of the hour is to combat the levels of the toxic greenhouse gases emitted. With increase in the number of automobiles and industries, the emission of harmful greenhouse gases mainly nitrogen and sulphur oxides increases leading to global warming. We plan to build a model involving synthetically engineered E.coli, which is compatible to all the possible exhaust mechanism due to its scalability. We genetically engineered NrfA , Cys1 and SQR genes in E.coli which would help in converting SOx and NOx from the exhaust gases of automobiles and chimneys of industries to harmless compounds.Our model is optimized for the efficiency of the reduction of nitrogen and sulphur oxides without compromising on the growth and manufacturing productivity of the industries.:::2014
