NCTU_Formosa:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Operation Debug:::Insect damage brings significant loss to modern agriculture and obstructs agricultural development. Most conventional treatments have harmful side effects, such as pollution and drug resistance. Currently, the use of pheromone traps is one of the cleanest methods to specifically attract and kill insects. Instead of carrying out the complex biosynthesis pathway of pheromones, we choose the simple act of expressing the DNA sequence of Pheromone Biosynthesis Activating Neuropeptide (PBAN). PBAN is similar to pheromone in its species-specificity. Once a specific PBAN comes in contact with and stimulates the target species, specific pheromones will be emitted to attract more of said species. In our project, we have successfully constructed and expressed in E. coli PBANs of nine different species and also built a capturing device. Hopefully this model can be widely used in the future when PBANs of more insects are found.:::2014
