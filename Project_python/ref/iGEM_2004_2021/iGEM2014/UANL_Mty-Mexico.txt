UANL_Mty-Mexico:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Reprogrammator:::The interest on GMOs and their potential exploitability has rapidly grown, but public concerns about their controllability once introduced into the environment have limited their usage. In order to offer a security system, we have designed a stratagem and a series of tools to posses the ability to hack the genetic composition of GMOs, either to "reset" the genetic programmation back to wild-type or to modify it for a different one if an "update" is required. To achieve this, we integrated a DNA delivery system that works in situ and a sequence-specific DNA digestion system that works in vivo. The main advantage our work provides against suicide switches, a different type of security system for GMOs, is that our technology does not trigger a "shut down" to the target organism. As a reliable eco-friendly tool, our system is not able to hack native species, only those developed in the laboratory.:::2014
