Vanderbilt_Software:::North America:::United States:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Darwin: A Version Control System for Synthetic Biology:::Darwin is a software package to document changes to DNA which allows for easy, standardized, and collaborative editing on the genome scale. It builds off of tested and proven version control software, allowing easy browsing and transferral of the entire history of the tracked data. Darwin distinguishes itself from other version control systems by focusing specifically on tracking DNA data at the file level, offering significant speed and security improvements over other solutions. Darwin is completely open-source, so any security or optimization issues can be identified and solved immediately to help all users of the tool. Darwin is also agnostic to the type of version control backend used, so it can be put into place on a massive variety of systems. Darwin is a complete solution for change tracking in a single cross-platform solution.:::2014
