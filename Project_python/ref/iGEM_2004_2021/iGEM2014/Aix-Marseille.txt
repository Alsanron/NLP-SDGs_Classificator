Aix-Marseille:::Europe:::France:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::S.E.colization : Green light, GO!:::The S.E.colization project focuses on synchronizing a culture of E.coli cells, so that they divide synchronously and change color from green to red and back as they go through the cell cycle. More specifically the culture stops dividing full of red cells and at regular intervals the cells turn green and divide before returning to the red quiescent state. To control the cell cycle, this project relies on a re-engineered chemotaxis system which instead of controlling the flagellar rotation direction drives changes in gene expression in response of the cell community through the use of a series of on/off switches and a modified serine production pathway which allows between cell communication. Introduced together, these different components will create an oscillator that regularly drives the switch modules between their two states which coupled to color changes will make the cells GO to the other state only when the light is green!!:::2014
