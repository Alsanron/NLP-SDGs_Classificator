Tokyo_Tech:::Asia:::Japan:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bank E. coli::: This year, our team Tokyo_Tech designed Escherichia coli which can act like a bank. As everybody knows, bank is a place where we deposit and withdraw money. In order to mimic this system, we made E. coli accumulate and excrete phosphate just like what bank does with money. This "Bank E. coli" enables you to deposit and withdraw phosphate any time you like. Additionally, bank has another function as a central bank, which controls the amount of money in the market. We designed a system consisted of three kinds of E. coli: imitating bank, company and customer. In this system, they exchange signal molecules as currency. By using the cell-cell communication, we are trying to make our "Bank E. coli" work as a signal molecule stabilizer like a central bank.:::2014
