TCU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Trogene Horse::: This year, we are trying to develop a CRISPR system combined with phage transduction to solve bacteria's resistance to antibiotics. The type II CRISPR system is a powerful mechanism in gene engineering. This system has been proved to have more efficiency than other mechanisms such as zinc finger or TALEN. However CRISPR can only function within one cell, so we use M13 phage as vector to send our CRISPR into bacteria cells to cure their resistance for M13 is a lysogenic phage. In order to regulate our phage transduction, we use phagemid pBluescript and M13KO7 helper phage. The pBluescript contains our designed CRISPR system, it will produce CRISPR-transferd M13 phage only when a helper phage infect bacterium which have pBluescript. Then the engineered M13 phage will infect other bacteria and induce transduction of CRISPR system. Once we start the CRISPR, it will recognize and knock down the antibiotic resistance gene.:::2014
