Consort_Alberta:::North America:::Canada:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::ECOS (Environmental COntaminant Sensor):::Our goal is to design and develop a construct that will detect levels of Xylene which is well correlated with the presence of carcinogenic benzene/benzene derivatives. During the extraction of petroleum, oil spills are a potential risk, and contaminated soil is harmful to the agricultural industry. Xylene is not overly harmful in the concentrations naturally found, however benzene derivatives related to xylene are, which is why we test for xylene in our lab. Our prototype will involve using alginate beads, which are porous. The matrix is big enough to contain e.coli, but small enough to prevent bacteria from escaping. The XylR transcriptional activator is a protein which in the presence of m-xylene will bind to the Pu promoter which activates the reporter genes. We are attempting to use two reporters: GFP and amilCP. We are evaluating which of these reporter genes are the most convenient and efficient to use.:::2014
