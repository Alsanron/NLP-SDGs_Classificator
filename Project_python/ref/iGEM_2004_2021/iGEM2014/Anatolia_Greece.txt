Anatolia_Greece:::Europe:::Greece:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Methane Gas 'Sensor':::Methane gas(CH4)is a non-toxic greenhouse gas;however it's flammable and can form explosive mixtures with air.It affects the radiation of Earth directly and indirectly by reacting with oxidizers,halogens and some halogen-containing compounds.It is an asphyxiate gas and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space environment.Asphyxia may occur if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below 19.5% by displacement.When structures are built on or near landfills,methane can diffuse into buildingsâ€™interiors and expose occupants to significant levels of methane.Being socially conscious of the situation,we participate in iGem 2014 with an experiment according to which,we will synthesize a bacterium that recognizes methane gas and emits aroma in response,using two genomes.Having this in mind we're aiming to develop methane detection methods,thus helping in taking precautionary actions for future exposure.It introduces a new way of activity that may result in improved indoor air-quality.This could be later developed in a kit by companies active in the field.:::2014
