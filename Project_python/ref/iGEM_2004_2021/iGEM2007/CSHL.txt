CSHL:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Research:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering fruit fly behavior by remote activation of neurons involved in reward and punishment:::The aim of this project is to engineer a behavior in the common fruit fly. It is well known that the fruit fly is capable of learning through reinforcement, and many experiments in classical and operant conditioning have been done to demonstrate the fly's capacity for learning and memory. By applying reward and punishment in the presence of certain neutral stimuli, the fly can make associations and learn to avoid or seek out these previously neutral stimuli. The current hypothesis in the literature is that, like humans, punishment and reward in insects are mediated by different neurotransmitters. It is believed that in insects, dopamine mediates punishment and octopamine (an invertebrate analog of norepinephrine) mediates reward. In our project we seek to further develop an existing method that allows for direct activation of these putative reward or punishment circuits by application of blue light to the intact animal. We hope to use this method to engineer defined, and even complex, behaviors in the fruit fly by using the blue light flashes to directly ‘reward’ or ‘punish’ behaving animals in real time.:::2007
