Bangalore:::Asia:::India:::Foundational Research:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bottom-up biology: A proof of principle:::As synthetic biologists, we aim to build biological systems from the bottom-up. The general idea is that, by measuring the behavior of simple parts, we should be able to design and construct complex systems from those parts. But can this be done in practice? We set out to test this idea rigorously. Our project is designed so that, by measuring the characteristics of relatively simple devices called 'open-loops', we are able to predict the responses of more complex systems called 'closed-loops'. These predictions can be directly tested against the observed responses. If we are successful, it would represent the first experimental validation of this powerful bottom-up design principle.:::2007
