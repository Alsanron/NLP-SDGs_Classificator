Mississippi_State:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Ubiquitin-Ligase Probe:::The search for renewable energy sources from alternative crops has led to the desire to understand the pathway by which lipids are synthesized. Higher lipid content has a direct correlation to higher energy value, so if the plant pathways involved in lipid metabolism can be modulated, biofuels could become more economically feasible. It has been reported that the ubiquitin proteasome pathway affects lipid metabolic processes. The ubiqination of target proteins for degradation requires the sequential activity of three enzymes: a ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). The objective of the 2007 MSU iGEM project is to develop a rapid and sensitive method for assaying the ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity.:::2007
