Penn_State:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Diauxie:::Bacterial cells in growth phase preferentially metabolize glucose before utilizing any other sugar. This is because glucose is the most efficient sugar for growth. Only when glucose is no longer available for the cell's use does it switch to the metabolization of other sugars like lactose or xylose. When the cell switches from glucose to another sugar there is a lag period during which the cell produces the alternate, sugar-specific metabolization proteins. This delay is called diauxic lag.:::2007
