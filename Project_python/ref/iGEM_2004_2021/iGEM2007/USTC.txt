USTC:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Extensible Logic Circuit in Bacteria:::Artificial Bio-Logic Circuit is composed of "logic gates" and "wires" like Digital Electronic Circuits. Though we have been enjoying the advantages of ultra-large-scale electronic circuits in modern life, we still cannot implement a somewhat small-scale circuit in vivo with several levels of gates.:::2007
