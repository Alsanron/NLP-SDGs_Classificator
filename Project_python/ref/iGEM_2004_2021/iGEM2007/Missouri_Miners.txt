Missouri_Miners:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A biological timer + A biological breathalyzer:::To participate in the iGEM competition, we plan to make a timer from a synthetic genetic circuit. Past iGEM designs of clocks have been successful, so we decided to build on this idea. Our idea is to fashion a genetically modified network within E. coli cells which is regulated by and input signal, and emits an output, or “off” signal after a given amount of time. The input for the circuit will be a specific amount of arabinose and the output will be fluorescence. The bacteria, which will continually synthesize GFP, will be fed an input signal of arabinose sugar. During consumption of the sugar, the GFP production will be repressed. This hiatus in the fluorescence signifies a timed period. Upon complete consumption of the sugar, the bacteria will once again actively generate GFP, signaling that time is up and the timer is off. The amount of arabinose fed to the cells will determine the amount of time it takes for them to fluoresce. The purpose of this research is to use recombinant technology to culture yeast cells capable of determining the concentration of ethanol and using these cells to construct a breathalyzer. A complex pathway for the metabolism of methanol exists within some species of the Pichia genus. Alcohol oxidase (AO) appears to be the first and major enzyme produced in this metabolic pathway (1). Transcribed from its gene (AOX1), AO converts methanol to formaldehyde within the yeast’s peroxisome (1). A metabolic pathway for the utilization of ethanol is also present within the yeast. However, if both ethanol and methanol is present, the yeast will utilize the ethanol before consuming the methanol (2). Consequently, the AOX1 gene will not be expressed to produce the AO enzyme until the ethanol has been consumed.:::2007
