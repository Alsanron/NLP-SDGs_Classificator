Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Medical:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::GlucOperon:::Diabetes mellitus is a significant problem especially in developed countries and leads to several severe long-term complications. Compared to well-known type 2 diabetes mellitus, manifested with different degrees of insulin resistance, type 1 diabetes mellitus is caused by insulin deficiency following destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Controlling blood sugar in a reasonable level and avoiding severe emergency as diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) are very important clinical issues. Thus, the NYMU_Taipei iGEM 2007 team is designing a biological system to sense environmental glucose concentration and decrease the level of glucose by releasing insulin. Besides, life-protection functions for removing toxic ketoacids produced during DKA and preventing hypoglycemia status will also be established. This system will be a convenient and safe design for those patients with diabetes mellitus, and further improve their quality of life by avoiding them from diabetes-related morbidity and mortality.:::2007
