Turkey:::Europe:::Turkey:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::1) Mexican Wave 2) Chase Simulator 3) Metal Transporter:::Our first thought was to create a pattern by the change of colors (by production of different fluorescent proteins) triggered by a signalling protein in a concentration dependent manner; so that the production of a protein as a result of the processing of a separete system, would trigger the pattern formation, just like a goal triggering a *Mexican wave in soccer games. The first idea of project was to simulate the competition between two different warrior cell types made from E. coli to invade a semi-solid plate having a lawn of passive cells. The green and red cells are the invaders, and they represent two teams. The 'empty cells' are the ones to be invaded. Empty cells have two constructs and each code for a fluorescent protein and an inhibitor. They are normally off. One of the constructs (coding for green) can be activated by nearby green cells and the other(coding for red) by nearby red cells, possibly through quorum sensing molecules. Once one of the constructs in the empty cells is activated by an invader, expression of this construct irreversibly prevents activation of the other and the cell becomes permanatly green or permenantly red. The aim was to have a sort of game, where red cells and green cells would be competing to convert to empty cells so that they would not affected by the opponent cell any more. In this project our aim is to transport specific metal ions from a specific location to another on the surface of engineered bacterial cells. In other words, to use cells as metal carriers.:::2007
