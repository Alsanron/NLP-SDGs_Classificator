Virginia_Tech:::North America:::United States:::Medical:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering an Epidemic:::Using modern air travel, it is possible to travel around the world, often several times, within the time it takes for a viral infection to show symptoms. This complicates the early detection of epidemics, making it even more important to predict whether an infection will become an epidemic as early as possible. If an infection is "treated" on a worldwide scale early enough, an epidemic could be prevented. Since transportation and communications technology has changed so rapidly in recent years, research needs to be done to find new ways of combating epidemics.:::2007
