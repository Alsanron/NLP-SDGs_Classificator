Glasgow:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ElectrEcoBlu:::ElectrEcoBlu combines an environmental biosensor for common organic pollutants with a microbial fuel cell which can produce its own electricity. These cells produce their own electrical power output which increases in the presence of one or more organic pollutant stimulants. This system has the potential to be used for self-powered long term in situ and online monitoring with an electrical readout. It is based around novel reporter genes encoding electron carrying mediators which aid the transfer of electrons from the cells to the electrodes resulting in enhanced electricity generation.:::2007
