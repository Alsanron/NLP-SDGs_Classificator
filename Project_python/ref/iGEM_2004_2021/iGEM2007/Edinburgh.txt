Edinburgh:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Research:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Division PoPper + Self Flavouring Yoghurt:::We designed a signal generator device that produces an output in the form of PoPS pulses each time a bacteria undergoes cell division. Therefore it may trigger actions as a function of cell replication. We aimed to develop flavour and colour biosynthesis pathways for potential use in 'self flavouring yoghurt' & a plasmid which would enable biobrick expression in gram positive bacteria:::2007
