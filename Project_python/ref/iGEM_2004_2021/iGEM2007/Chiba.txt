Chiba:::Asia:::Japan:::Foundational Research:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Marimo:::Constructive Approach Our team focuses understanding how such spherical structure can be sustained even when it is multicellular organisms using E. Coli. Since E.Coli is unicellular organism, this approach is quite challenging.... Making 3D colonies- for next generation (lazier) molecular biologists. For years microbiologists have been using agar plates to isolate cells from each other. By spreading the diluted cells on a solid surface, we can make "colonies", dome-shaped gathering of genetically identical cells. Although convenient, this is only two-dimentional. What if we can create three dimentional (spherical) colonies with controlled/ defined size? Thus we can eliminate the plating process that everybody hates. Combined with the microfluidics devices, we might be able to pick, isolate, count, or innoculate each of the floating yet independent colonies to conduct routine works in future molecular biology. Crazy thought? Well, that is exactly what our advisors say.:::2007
