Purdue:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Research:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: :::The plan is to transform two types of E. Coli: one with plasmid 1 and the other plasmid 2. The gene map can be find from IGEM parts: BBa_I738009 (for plasmid 1) and BBa_I738010 (for plasmid 2) The two devices (parts assembled within a plasmid) are (in the actual DNA sequence): [Green fluorescent protein production][AraC production][Cl regulator][ccd_B death gene] & [Red fluorescent protein production][Cl production][AraC regulator][ccd_B death gene]:::2007
