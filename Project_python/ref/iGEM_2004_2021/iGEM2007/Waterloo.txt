Waterloo:::North America:::Canada:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: :::The goal of this project is to design a basic device for computing. Our idea was to reproduce a circuit element called a half adder with DNA, which takes in two 1-bit inputs, adds them, and outputs a sum and a carry. Our device responds to two inputs: red light and the chemical tetracycline. The input sensors control a set of genetic switches in order to carry out the computation and fluoresces green, red, or neither, depending on the outcome.:::2007
