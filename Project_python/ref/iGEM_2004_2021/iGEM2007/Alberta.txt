Alberta:::North America:::Canada:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Butanerds:::We propose using a different fuel source to eventually replace gasoline, butanol. Butanol is a superior to ethanol as a replacement for petroleum gasoline. With a low vapor pressure, high energy density, and a gasoline-like octane rating, it can be blended into existing gasoline at much higher proportions than ethanol without compromising performance, mileage, organic pollution standards. Blending butanol with gasoline also prevents major modifications of the fuel-air ratio and modifications to the fuel system. Butanol also is immiscible with water at concentrations higher than 7%, alleviating storage concerns as well as offering the possiblity of phase separation which would realize huge cost savings in terms of production.:::2007
