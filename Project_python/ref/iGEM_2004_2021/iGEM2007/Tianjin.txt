Tianjin:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bio-Diode:::In this project, we try to construct a biological device to imitate the function of the diode, one of the most significant parts in the electric integrate circuit. The flow of molecular signal AHL is considered as the current of electric circuit. The generator, amplifiers, blocks and detector cells are constructed with the parts provided by MIT and then are equipped in series in order to establish the cellular and molecular biological diode. Our device, which is a combination of technologies from the field of computer science, molecular biology and chemical engineering, is a breakthrough for the application of mature techniques of chemical engineering to the field of synthetic biology.:::2007
