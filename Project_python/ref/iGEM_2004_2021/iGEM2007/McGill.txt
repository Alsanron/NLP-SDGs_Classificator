McGill:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Research:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Quorum-sensing coupled with the Repressilator:::Our project is a continuation of one of the projects we presented last year: a two-gene oscillator with an 'On' and 'Off' switch using LacI and LuxI. This simple relaxation oscillator could be used as a modular component for the synchronization of other complex oscillating systems such as the repressilator. Quorum-sensing coupling between cells is achieved with a diffusible autoinducer AI (AHL) made from LuxI which promotes the synthesis of LacI from pLux. As Lac accumulates, it represses pLac which controls the synthesis of LuxI.:::2007
