Mexico:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Experiment involving collonies with RFP and GFP interactions:::One of the most important problems in developmental biology is the understanding of how structures emerge in living systems. Several mechanisms have been proposed, depending on the observed patterns. The so called Turing patterns are based on the interaction of two effects: diffusion of some chemicals, called morphogenes, and the chemical interaction between them. It has been highly controversial whether some patterns observed in several organisms are of this type. In particular, although some systems have been identified to be of activator-inhibitor type (the most popular Turing system proposed by Gierer and Meindhart), it is still questioned if pattern formation and more generally, the appearance of functional structures can be understood by means of Turing patterns or more broadly, reaction-diffusion mechanims. One of the main goals of our project is to test different pattern formation mechanisms, not only Turing patterns, but also oscillatory and time varying structures. We propose that if the appropriate genetic construction is implanted in a colony of bacteria, the reaction-diffusion mechanism can be replaced by a genetic control system. This fact is first illustrated with the, by now classical, repressilator. Then we give two constructions of our own. The first is a modification of Elowitz system, which inclueded bot positive and inhibitory interactions. The positive ones are in fact dependent on quorum diffusible signals.:::2007
