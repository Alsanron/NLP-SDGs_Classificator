Michigan:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Research:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Divide-By-Two Circuit:::The DBT circuit is a single-input toggle switch with the green and red fluorescent proteins (GFP and RFP for short) to monitor product levels. If the system is at a steady state, with high concentrations of GFP and low RFP levels, adding arabinose will cause a switch in the protein levels. As a result, another steady state will be reached in which RFP is at a high concentration and there are small GFP levels. Adding arabinose again causes a switch back to the original steady state of the system (GFP at high levels, RFP at low ones).:::2007
