Virginia:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Harvesting Cellulose and Light to Power Butanol Biosynthesis:::Economic, environmental and geopolitical factors have played a significant role in driving forward current research in biofuel production. Plant biomass, including fast-growing feedstock plants such as grasses and agricultural waste products such as corn stalks, can be converted to liquid transportation fuel by microbial metabolic pathways. Although the concept of deriving fuel from biomass was first proposed in the 1970s, only recent technological advances promise to exploit this abundant, renewable and sustainable source of hydrocarbons that can be domestically produced (Stephanopoulos, 2007).:::2007
