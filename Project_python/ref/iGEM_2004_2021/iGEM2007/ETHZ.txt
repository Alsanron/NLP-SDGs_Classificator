ETHZ:::Europe:::Switzerland:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::educatETH E.coli System:::Our combined team of biologists and engineers is coping with the problem of implementing memory capabilities in bacterial colonies. First, E.coli are able to respond differently (with distinct fluorescent proteins) to two different inputs (we used chemicals). Second, they remember which input was presented to them. Finally, when confronted with a new input, they are able to recognize whether it is the one that they were trained with or not. In other words, in this project we are educating the E.coli!:::2007
