Harvard:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Research:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cling-E. Coli:::Our efforts were focused on engineering bacterial surface proteins to express peptides that will target bacteria to specific substrates. We then sought a biological read-out for whether the engineered bacteria interact with the substrate. For this purpose, we employed two distinct detection methods: quorum sensing and the Fec iron response system. By the end of the summer, we successfully demonstrated that bacteria expressing well-characterized tags on their surface could bind to specific substrates. Separately, we characterized the quorum system with multiple types of promoters and reporters, and we are on our way toward a combined targeting-quorum system in the near future. In addition, we are working on inserting random peptide libraries into the bacterial surface proteins; we will then screen for the ability to bind to a variety of substrates.:::2007
