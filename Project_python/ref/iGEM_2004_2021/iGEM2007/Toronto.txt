Toronto:::North America:::Canada:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacterial Neural Network:::Our project aims to build a bacterial (E. coli) neural network composed of two cell types, where filter cells (type A) modulate input to reporter cells (type B). The first cell type is stimulated with red light of a specific intensity and duration, and will turn blue in proportion to that "pulse" of light. Populations of type A will be physically mounted above those of type B, acting as a light filter. Type B cells are receptive to the same wavelength of light, and will fluoresce in proportion to the amount of light they receive.:::2007
