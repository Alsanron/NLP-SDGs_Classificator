Melbourne:::Asia:::Australia:::Medical:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::COLIFORMING:::The formation of complex scaffolds of extracellular matrix is one of the problems facing the emerging discipline of tissue engineering[1]. One way to produce such scaffolds would be to have them secreeted by cells joined together in a three dimensional structure. We concieved the idea of using two light sources of different wavelength, impinging on a suspension of cells from differnt directions to induce the cells at their intersection to join to each other and thus create a three dimensional structure. Since we plan to implement the system in Ecoli we called it coliforming.:::2007
