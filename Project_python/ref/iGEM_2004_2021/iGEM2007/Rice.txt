Rice:::North America:::United States:::Medical:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Project A: Phage that select against bacterial resistance:::The widespread use of antibiotics has amplified the fraction of virulent microbes in the biosphere that have evolved genetic-encoded tricks to sidestep the toxic effects of these drugs. In fact, a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggested that the number of deaths associated with Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), exceeds those attributed to AIDS, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, emphysema or homicide each year (see JAMA 298:1763-1771). This ever-increasing problem stems from the fact that antibiotic use selects for bacteria with resistance and increases the fraction of total bacteria in the biosphere that are resistant. Bacterial populations have little or no selection pressure against them to change this enrichment of resistant cells in the absence of antibiotics. The goal of our genetic circuit is to program the fitness of antibiotic resistant cells to be lower than that of antibiotic sensitive cells in the presence of non-toxic levels of antibiotic. In this way, we seek to reduce the fraction of antibiotic resistant cells in the biosphere and increase the utility of existing antibiotics.:::2007
