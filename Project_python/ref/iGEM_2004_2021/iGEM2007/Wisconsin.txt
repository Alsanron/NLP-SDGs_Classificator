Wisconsin:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Research:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Artificial Transcription Factor:::Reprogramming gene expression is one of the main goals of synthetic biology. In the past, most groups have focused on cis-regulatory elements such as promoter to control transcription. We decided to explore artificial transcription factor (ATF), a trans-regulatory element, for controlling genes. Our project consists of characterizing ATF and testing ATF in mammalian cells.:::2007
