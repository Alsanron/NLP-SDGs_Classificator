Tokyo_Tech:::Asia:::Japan:::Foundational Research:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Balanced Redifferentiation of E. coli!:::To follow Paretoâ€™s principle found in an ant society, our model system must satisfy the three conditions shown in Fig. 1 to 4. In our model, all individual cells have the same genetic circuits but take either of stable state A (worker) or B (idler) depending on the surrounding circumstances as if they DIFFERENTIATE. They also change their states as if they DEDIFFERENTIATE and REDIFFERENTIATE so that the ratio of the two cell states is well balanced.:::2007
