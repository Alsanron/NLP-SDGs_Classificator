Saint_Petersburg:::Asia:::Russia:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Copper and Copper Toxicity:::Copper is a unique transition element, that may easily activate dioxygen bond. This makes copper both vitally essential to aerobic species and severely toxic to all organisms at higher concentrations. The toxicity is caused mostly by catalyzing uncontrolled dioxygen conversion to reactive oxygen species via a series of redox reactions (electrochemically similar to Fenton cycle). To avoid this problem most organisms evolved copper metabolic systems, so that virtually all copper inside the cell is tightly protein-bound. Still high external concentrations of copper is deadly to many organisms, underlying the well known antifungal and insecticide applications of copper salts in agriculture. Yet copper is not so evident toxin as nickel or cadmium, as many organisms (e.g. higher plants) are resistant to high concentrations of copper.:::2007
