Lethbridge:::North America:::Canada:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bioprospecting:::The goal of our project is to create a ‘bio-prospector;’ a microorganism capable of moving up a concentration gradient for a particular small molecule (theophylline), and activating either a metabolic or signaling pathway. We hope that once this system is developed, it will be easy to modify it to be specific to many different small molecules. To achieve this, we will use a riboswitch (Topp and Gallivan, 2007) to control the levels of CheZ, a protein involved in motility.:::2007
