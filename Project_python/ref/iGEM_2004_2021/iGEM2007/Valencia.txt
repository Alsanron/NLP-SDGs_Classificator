Valencia:::Europe:::Spain:::Foundational Research:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Ecoli Ruler:::While last year a vanillin sensor was designed (1), students from Universidad de Valencia and Universidad Politécnica de Valencia have gathered this year to create a device which behaviour resembles an electronic comparator. The comparator works analyzing two input signals, like two proteins or metabolites, and responses with a given output, as fluorescence, related to the concentration of the input signal. Each input has an associated fluorescence colour. The interesting part is that differences of the output signals become amplified whenever a slight disparity between the initial concentrations of the input signals occurs. If inputs are equally sensed, both fluorescences have equal concentrations, but whenever one of the input’s levels is above the other, this fluorescence becomes greater and the other one gets inhibited. This behaviour emerges directly from the design of our system (Fig.1) in which we have used well established biological parts (2).:::2007
