Imperial:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Medical:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Infector Detector:::Infector Detector tackles the ongoing problem of catheter-associated urinary tract infections. To do this, we looked at how infections develop - as biofilms - and designed a system which would be able to detect their presence. We have created a system which is capable of detecting one of the types of signalling molecules found in biofilms, AHL, and visibly report its presence by producing a fluorescent protein.:::2007
