Naples:::Europe:::Italy:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::YeSOil: A Yeast Sensor for real Extra Virgin Olive oil:::The aim of our project is to engineer a synthetic biological network in yeast. This system will help in evaluating the quality of olive oil, one of the wordly famous product of Italy [4]. Detection of oil quality is now possible only through expensive and bulky machines. In order to render this process easy and cheap we will modify Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells so that they will act as sensors and indicators of different oleate concentrations.:::2007
