Brown:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cellular Lead Sensor + Tristable Switch:::About 40% of the world does not have access to clean water. Lead is a major contaminant worldwide. In the US alone, over 1 million children ages 1 through 5 have elevated levels of lead in their blood. Current lead detection systems are expensive and require lab analysis. The Tri-Stable Toggle Switch represents a continuation on the theme of the Toggle Switch begun by Gardner, et al to produce stable outputs in response to transient inputs. Applications such as a memory circuit and a drug delivery system are a few suggestions, but perhaps the most promising innovation lies in the design process. :::2007
