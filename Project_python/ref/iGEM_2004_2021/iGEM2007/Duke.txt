Duke:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Research:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: :::We had a formal abstract submitted a few months ago, but to keep this short and sweet This year's Duke iGEM team is interested in tackling problems associated with engineering bacterial systems to be easily controllable by clean, macroscopic inputs in order to create useful, macroscopic products. We became obsessed with trying to find solutions to these problems. We wanted to make bacteria we could control like a computer, with electric fields and light and heat. Not stopping there, we wanted to make bacteria that could generate their own electric fields, and their own heat, and after they'd been programmed, interacted, and formed networks, we wanted bacteria that could yield precise and complex materials.:::2007
