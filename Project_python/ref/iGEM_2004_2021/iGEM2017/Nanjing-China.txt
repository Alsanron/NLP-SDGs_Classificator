Nanjing-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Three Microbial Whole-Cell Sensing Systems to Detect Gas Molecules in the Environment:::Formaldehyde, hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen pose great danger to our lives. Traditional methods for detecting them are mainly based on irreversible redox reactions in expensive devices with short life spans, whereas whole-cell bacterial biosensors have major advantages over traditional analyses with regard to specificity, sensitivity and portability. We attempt to develop whole-cell systems detecting these gases. We have managed to transfer gene clusters encoding translational suppressors or activator into E. coli to respond to different gas molecules by up regulation of specific downstream genes. In order to visualize the gases’ existence and concentration, FP genes are inserted in the expression system after the promoter influenced by the suppressor or activator. At present, results have shown sensibility at a µM level. As long as proper containers are designed, we will be able to construct portable sensors by which users can perform instant on-site monitoring with higher sensitivity, stability but lower costs.:::2017
