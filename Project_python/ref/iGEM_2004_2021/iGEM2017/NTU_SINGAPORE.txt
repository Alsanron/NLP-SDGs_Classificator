NTU_SINGAPORE:::Asia:::Singapore:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Improving CRISPR-Cas-based technologies:::The CRISPR-Cas system is a wonderful tool for mankind to manipulate the genetic code of an organism. Originally functioning as bacterial adaptive immune systems, CRISPR-Cas-based technologies have been extensively studied and improved upon in recent years. Our team is interested in overcoming current limitations of CRISPR-Cas technologies, which may hinder their efficiency and deployment in living cells and organisms. There are three projects that we are working on. First, we are interested in enhancing the efficiency of HDR repair, which is utilized by scientists to precisely edit certain genes of their interest, by fusing the Cas9 enzyme with a HDR protein. Second, we are trying to deploy the enhanced design to correct a non-small-cell lung cancer mutation. Third, we are optimizing the dCas9 DNA-targeting scaffold by exploring potential deletions and introducing several mutations that will render it to be more compact and better than the traditional dCas9.:::2017
