Linkoping_Sweden:::Europe:::Sweden:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Forgetful Folding:::Aggregation prone peptides, such as Amyloid Beta and Tau which are found in Alzheimerâ€™s disease tend to form plaque and tangles in the brain. Proteins known as chaperones can help these peptides in the folding process and hinder aggregation. The four chaperones called GroEL, GroES, DnaK and Trigger Factor are going to be studied, both on their own and in different combinations. These chaperones will be overexpressed in Escherichia coli together with Tau and Amyloid Beta fused with the fluorescent proteins eGFP and mNeonGreen. These fusion proteins will also be expressed in different conditions where parameters such as temperature, expression time and induction strength is varied.:::2017
