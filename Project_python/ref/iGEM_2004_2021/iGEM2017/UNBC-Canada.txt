UNBC-Canada:::North America:::Canada:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MRSAway:::Antibiotic resistance is one of the largest issues facing modern medicine today. Of particular importance is the lethal Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA. We propose to use sRNA-mediated gene silencing as a substitute for antibiotics to target an array of essential genes in MRSA: mecA, secA, glmM, and ddl. First, we identified a dsRNA-binding chaperone, Hfq, which acts to stabilize the sRNA-mRNA duplex in order to recruit RNase III to degrade the dsRNA. We then designed complimentary sRNAs for each mRNA target and tested the affinity of Hfq to our custom designed (AU)7A binding region on the sRNAs using a fluorescence polarization assay. The number of ribonucleotides cleaved from the binding region of Hfq via RNase III was determined via alkaline hydrolysis and long-format PAGE. Finally, Hfq and sRNA were co-transformed on a single vector to test gene knockdown efficiency.:::2017
