Cologne-Duesseldorf:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Designing a Customizable Synthetic Cell Compartment Toolbox:::Unknown, unpredictable reactions inside cells pose a major problem in synthetic biological designs as they are affecting the purposed applications. Nature solves the problems of unavoidable interactions or toxification by intermediates and by-products by separating enzymatic reactions through compartmentalization. The integration of pathways into organelles leads to the concentration of enzymes and metabolites, sustains unstable intermediates and enables naturally incompatible reactions to take place simultaneously. We intend to follow nature’s example and engineer yeast’s peroxisomes to create an intracellular space with customized properties. To do so we establish an open source toolbox and enable booting up a compartment perfectly tailored for a specific application. To demonstrate the potential of this approach we relocate the nootkatone and violacein pathway into peroxisomes, modify the compartment’s characteristics using our toolbox applications and thereby create an artificial compartment with optimal reaction conditions.:::2017
