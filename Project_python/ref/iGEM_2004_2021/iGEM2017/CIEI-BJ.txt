CIEI-BJ:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Repel the mosqiutoes, no harm left:::Mosquitos are capable of transmitting severe diseases to human beings (e.g. malaria, yellow feverï¼Œand microcephaly, etc). Consequently many countries have suffered disasters caused by these epidemics, and there were roughly 1.5 million people killed in 2016. Even worse, most mosquito repellents currently used contain DEET which is detrimental to both humans and environment. Thus, our team, CIEI-BJ, decided to design a biosynthesis pathway to produce a special substance, Citronellol, which is nontoxic to human beings, environmental friendly, and can repel mosquitoes effectively. One of the most significant concern during production is to ensure that neither pollution nor toxin will be released. Therefore, our team transferred geraniol synthase gene (GES) and old yellow enzyme gene (OYE) to E.coli and yeast, then let them help us convert glucose into citronellol. Through this method, we can produce citronellol massively with high efficiency, low cost and zero toxic byproducts.:::2017
