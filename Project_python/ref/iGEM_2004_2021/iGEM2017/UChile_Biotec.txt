UChile_Biotec:::Latin America:::Chile:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bimatox: A biosensor made of aptazyme to help people detect marine toxins in their environment:::BiMaTox is a biosensor that detects marine toxins that are produced during harmful algal blooms, also known as red tides. Of these toxins, saxitoxin is the most-deadly, as it attacks the human nervous system impeding synapse formation. The biosensor consists of a cell-free cellulose matrix device that displays a color in the presence of the toxin. This color is produced by the aptazymes which are contained within the device. The aptazyme consist of a specific toxin aptamer connected to a DNAzyme. When the toxin binds to its specific aptamer, the peroxidase activity of DNAzyme is triggered and produces the oxidation of a compound called ABTS, which generates a color that is readily visible to the human eye. The device is constructed in such a way that it is easy and simple to use, with the aim that, for example, fishermen can know when there are toxins in their fishing area.:::2017
