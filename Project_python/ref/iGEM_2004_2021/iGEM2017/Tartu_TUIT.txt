Tartu_TUIT:::Europe:::Estonia:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Yeasthylene:::Ethylene is the building block of many chemical compounds. Its polymer, polyethylene, is the main component in numerous plastic materials. Due to its versatility, the demand for ethylene has been increasing during the last decade. As it is derived from petroleum, which is a non-renewable source, it is necessary to find an environmentally friendly way of producing ethylene to satisfy this demand. In this project, two yeast strains with completely different roles will be genetically modified to produce ethylene from sucrose. The focus of the project is set to make those strains dependent on each-other and to provide a balanced growth. This approach represents a more efficient method than cloning the whole pathway into one population, especially when longer heterologous pathways will be used in the future to produce more complex chemicals. Energy gain due to lower metabolic burden and balanced co-factor metabolism will result in higher production rates.:::2017
