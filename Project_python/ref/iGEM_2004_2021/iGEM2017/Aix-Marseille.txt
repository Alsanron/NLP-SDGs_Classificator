Aix-Marseille:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::KILL XYL : We have vermin to kill:::Our project, KILL XYL will provide a treatment for the disease caused by the plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa. This disease currently causes loss of millions of acres of crops and no cure exists. KILL XYL is an efficient and green cure that works in two steps. First, we detect early symptoms of the disease using a drone equipped with an infra-red camera. We then treat the disease with our product, designed to KILL XYL. This product contains a powerful combination of specific phage-like particles and a green cocktail optimized to break-up bacterial aggregates. Our treatent will kill the bacteria, stop disease progression and unclog the trees vessels, all without using any harmful chemicals, pesticides or GMO crops thanks to synthetic biology.:::2017
