SZU-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CON-cure-CRETE::: This year we designed a self-healing system for concrete. When there is a microcrack our system can be switched on and concrete can start to heal themselves. We transfered gerA gene to be our biosensor. When there is liquid L-alanine. GerA receptor can be induced so the whole chain can be started. we improved the alkali resistance by transfer nhaC. We put the spores of our Bacillus subtilis into microcapsules, along with nutrients and L-alanine powder. And mix the microcapsule with concrete. When there is a microcrack, the tension of the wall breaking will also break the microcapsule and the water will infiltrate, after the germination that induced by L-alanine. The Carbonic anhydrase gene that we transfered will let CO2 hydrate to produce CO32-, which then binds with free Ca + in the environment to form calcium carbonate sediment,so the microcracks are filled.The rebars inside won't rust.:::2017
