Baltimore_Bio-Crew:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::We’re breakin’ it down: degrading plastic and stigma in Baltimore through engineered E. coli:::The Baltimore BioCrew seeks to eliminate plastic pollution, specifically the pervasive issue of microplastics, through a sustainable, innovative mechanism. In comparison to other efforts, our focus is shifted from the macro to the micro by utilizing microorganisms to degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Prior research has identified a Japanese bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis, that can degrade PET plastics. We designed, synthesized and expressed two genes from I. sakaiensis encoding the enzymes, PETase and MHET, in E. coli. We are currently examining the activity of these enzymes and the ability of our engineered E. coli to degrade PET and produce benign byproducts with potential industrial uses. We plan to utilize the enzymes secreted by our engineered E. coli to degrade microplastics in controlled environments such as a bioreactor, and in doing so, ridding the Baltimore Inner Harbor of plastic pollution.:::2017
