First, lignocellulose must be broken down into component sugars by cellulases, hemicellulases, and various debranching enzymes. Because the primary diet of porcupines is lignified plant material, we reasoned that the porcupine microbiome would be filled with enzymes required to degrade lignocellulose. Using in silico metagenomic analysis, we mined the porcupine microbiome to identify, synthesize and characterize microbial enzymes required for cellulose and hemi-cellulose degradation. Using an orthogonal approach, we created a metagenomic library in E. coli from the porcupine microbiome, to be screened for the ability to grow on lignocellulose, or other pathway intermediates, as a sole carbon source. This work provides a solid foundation for future development of a bioreactor utilizing enzymes from the porcupine microbiome to convert lignocellulose into biofuel.:::2017
