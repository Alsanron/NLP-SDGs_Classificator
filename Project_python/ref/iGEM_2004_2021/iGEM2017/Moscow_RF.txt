Moscow_RF:::Europe:::Russian Federation:::Food & Nutrition:::Community Lab:::Accepted:::Phytases piggy bank:::The project is aimed at solving the problem of thermal destruction of phytase of Citrobacter braakii during production of granulated compound feeds for farm animals. As producers serving as capsules for phytase molecules and protecting them from high temperatures we will use Yarrowia lipolytica. In order to protect phytase from degradation when affected by enzymes of yeast cells we will modify the protein attaching another protein – phytochelatin – to one of the ends of the protein chain. Phytochelatin has a very stable and compact structure resistant to yeast enzymes and will serve as a barrier between phytase and such destructive enzymes.:::2017
