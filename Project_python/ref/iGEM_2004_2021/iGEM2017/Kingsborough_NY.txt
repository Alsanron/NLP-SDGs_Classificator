Kingsborough_NY:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Microbes of the Night:::In synthetic biology, its essential to implement control mechanisms that disable microbes that are unintentionally released into the enviroment. Teams have developed 'kill-switches', or toxic genes are activated under selected conditions. We decided to create a light-inducible kill-switch, based on the design by Wageningen 2016. This complements our previous project (which we are continuing to explore); enhancing E. coli metabolism for wastewater treatment, in dark conditions. The kill-switch is based upon the pDawn system, activating transcription in the presence of blue light. It features MazF, a mRNA-targeting endonuclease. We have designed controls to verify the expression pattern. Furthermore, we introduced additional layers of regulation to prevent premature cell death. Completion of our previous work, together with our kill-switch, is a step towards an environmentally friendly and safe bacterium for nitrogen removal. Moreover, the creation of an effective light inducible kill-switch is a useful addition to the synthetic biology toolkit.:::2017
