Groningen:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::IMPACT - a programmable bacteriophage detection system:::During the fermentation process of dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt, fermentation bacteria are under constant threat of bacteriophages. Severe infections can result in inferior product quality, wasted processing time and expensive countermeasures. Our team has developed IMPACT: Integrated Modular Phage-Activated CRISPR Tracer. Built in Lactococcus lactis, this bacteriophage detection system consists of two specialized orthogonal CRISPR mechanisms. The first continuously surveys incoming bacteriophage DNA and isolates spacers from it, while the other enables transcription of a signal-gene when a spacer is matched to the pre-programmed target array. To facilitate use, we have developed a closed detection cartridge and bioinformatic algorithms for determining new target sequences. Our product offers rapid on-site detection without techniques that require highly trained personnel. Our goal is to have a positive impact on industries all over the world that depend on fermentation processes and contribute to a better understanding of bacteriophage infections in general.:::2017
