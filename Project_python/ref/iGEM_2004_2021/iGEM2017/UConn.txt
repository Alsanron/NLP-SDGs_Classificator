UConn:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::An Algaeneious Approach to Continuous Cultures for Biofuel Production:::Biofuels are a promising, nearly carbon-neutral alternative fuel source, often derived from algal lipid production. Previous methods of fuel harvest have relied on destructive means of extraction, but we aim to upregulate the excretion of lipids, allowing for potential harvest by physical separation. Our goal is to enhance the algal lipid production and extracellular transport in Nannochloropsis oceanica, a well characterized species with high lipid content. This will be achieved by upregulating the endogenous lipid production enzymes of the cell with high expression promoters and transfecting algae with an ATP binding cassette transporter from Arabdopsis thaliana. Next steps will include developing a system to physically separate excreted lipid from the algal biomass, while maintaining a productive continuous culture.:::2017
