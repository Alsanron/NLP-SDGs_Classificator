NEU-China:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::iSmeller: An intensified cellular odor sensor system based on CRISPR activation technology:::Odor molecule can be sensed via the specific binding with its cognate olfactory receptors and the following elicited signaling cascade within the cell. Our research aims to build a mammalian cell-based biological odor detection system (iSmeller, intensified Smeller) with enhanced sensitivity by employing the CRISPR/Cas9 activation technology. Once an odor binds to the specific olfactory receptors on the cell membrane, it leads to a series of signaling rally and consequently generates a flux of cAMP (cyclic AMP) which could be detected by a cAMP-activated reporter gene system. We implement CRISPR activation apparatus to simultaneously amplify several core components endogenously along the olfactory signal cascade to enhance power and sensitivity of the cellular odor sensor. We will evaluate the performance of iSmeller with two odor/receptor pairs: Î²-citronellol/OR1A1 and bourgeonal/OR1D2. The iSmeller holds great promise in various applications such as cancer diagnosis, environmental pollution evaluation and food quality control.:::2017
