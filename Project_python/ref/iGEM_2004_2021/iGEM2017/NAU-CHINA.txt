NAU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Wheat Guard system:::Fusarium head blight（FHB）is one of the most destructive global disease of cereal，which poses a significant threat to the wheat production and the safety of food. Fusarium Graminearum predominates among several Fusarium species that can cause FHB. Deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN) compounds, produced by Fusarium that are common contaminants which pose a threat to human and animal health. So the main purpose of our project is to prevent FHB，not only inhibit growth of the F. graminearum，but also degrade DON and ZEN . We choose to have mass production of biological pesticides—antifungal peptide using yeast system and engineer Yeast-based biosensor to detect. Considering biosafety，our project also includes a kill switch, which is responsible for preventing gene contamination. The mammalian Bax protein will confer a lethal phenotype when expressed in yeast. This reassures that the yeast removes itself when it was exposed to the environment.:::2017
