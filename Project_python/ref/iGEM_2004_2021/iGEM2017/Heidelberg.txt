Heidelberg:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::THE PHAGE AND THE FURIOUS:::Darwinian evolution is an enormously powerful concept that drove biology towards astonishing complexity and beauty. This year, the iGEM team Heidelberg aims at harnessing this power to accelerate the engineering of biomolecules for human benefit. To this end, we built upon the PACE (phage-assisted continuous evolution) method: Synthetic biological circuits couple the survival of quickly mutating phages carrying a protein of interest to directed selection within E. coli hosts. Thereby, proteins with improved functions can be evolved within hours. We designed a standardized toolbox that highly simplifies PACE and expands its utility towards various new areas of application, including the development of enzymes for pharmaceutical production. Additionally, we applied machine learning techniques to evaluate and systematically improve protein sequences to serve a desired purpose. Taken together, we provide a new foundational advance by introducing a unique combination of in silico and in vivo directed evolution to Synthetic Biology.:::2017
