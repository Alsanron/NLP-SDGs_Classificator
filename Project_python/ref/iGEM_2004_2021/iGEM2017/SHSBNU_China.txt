SHSBNU_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Noninvasive gut inflammation detector:::Thiosulfate and tetrathionate are two kinds of chemical compound which would be produced during gut inflammation. Until now, scientists are able to detect gut inflammation using utilized two-system detector, which includes detector and reporter part, gained from marine Shewanella species and present the result by expressing sfGFP gene. Considering this method can be further improved, SHSBNU_China team worked on changing the reporter part to let the results be presented more clearly and visibly without specially-produced ultraviolet light, instead, the E.coli would change into a different color even in anaerobic environment. Furthermore, to make the result being collected more easily, we developed a kind of pill, where the E.coli is stored, with special walls that would only allow small molecules to get through. This system also has a functional potential that it could be further modified to do some treatment to the inflammation once it's detected.:::2017
