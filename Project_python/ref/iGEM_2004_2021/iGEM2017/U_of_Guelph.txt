U_of_Guelph:::North America:::Canada:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::One OXCellent FRC’n Project:::The University of Guelph’s project focuses on the development of an enzyme-based cleaning method for the removal of calcium oxalate scale (commonly called beerstone) from the inside of beer brewing vats. Beerstone is incredibly insoluble and difficult to remove, with common cleaning methods involving the use of caustic acids. Our team hopes to use the enzymes Formyl-CoA Transferase (FRC) and Oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase (OXC) from Oxalobacter formigenes’s oxalate degrading metabolism to break down beerstone. This year’s aspect of the project focused on cloning frc and oxc into E.coli DH5a using pET-28a. This required conducting site directed mutagenesis to add the PstI cut site to the pET-28a vector. Future experimentation will include cloning into BL21, expressing and characterizing FRC and OXC, and the development of an enzyme-based cleaning solution.:::2017
