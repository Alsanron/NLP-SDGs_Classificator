TECHNION-ISRAEL:::Asia:::Israel:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Tolegen: A preventative treatment for autoimmune disease and allergies:::Autoimmune disease and allergies are an increasingly common phenomenon in the Western world. An estimated 73 million people suffer from allergies and autoimmune disease in the United States. To date, many of these diseases lack treatment and pose an incredible financial burden on both the patients and society. We intend to design a preventative treatment for allergies and autoimmune disease by utilizing the innate system of Central Tolerance. Weâ€™ve designed a plasmid based platform that will allow inducible expression and display of target antigens on the membrane of Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs). Hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC-7) will be transfected with our plasmid and we will attempt to show apoptosis in an immature B cell model (WEHI-231) closely approximating the process of Central Tolerance. In the future this technology may be used to engineer HSCs harvested from cord blood and allow for a cost effective preventative treatment.:::2017
