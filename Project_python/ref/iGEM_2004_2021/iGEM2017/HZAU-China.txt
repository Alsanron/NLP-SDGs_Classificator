HZAU-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synchronizer-4C: Computer-Controlled Cell Cycles:::Cell cycle synchronization is highly needed in many fields and the traditional synchronization methods have different limitations; for example, chemical methods usually have severe side-effects on the natural physiological states of cells while physical methods (like cell sorting) cannot sustain long time synchronization. In this project, we proposed a cell synchronization approach based on a synthetic circuit of light-controlled CRISPR system targeted at OriC to block the initiation of chromosome replication in E. coli cells. Under the control of computer, the cell cycles can be synchronized with tuned lightening patterns. Our synthetic biological approach of cell synchronization has multiple advantages than traditional methods and may become a fundamental tool for biological research.:::2017
