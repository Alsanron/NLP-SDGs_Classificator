Rice:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::HexaTri: Bioremediation of Chromium(VI) Contaminated Wastewater via Engineered Chromium(VI)-Reducing Shewanella oneidensis:::A recent analysis of America’s drinking water for carcinogenic hexavalent chromium (CrVI) revealed over 218 million Americans consume CrVI at levels exceeding a de minimis lifetime cancer risk. Our team attempted to solve this problem by engineering Shewanella oneidensis to reduce CrVI to its less toxic form (CrIII) in contaminated wastewater. We enhanced reduction via expression of a mutated chromate reductase enzyme (chrR6) and increased chromate permeability via over-expression of sulfate transporter and binding proteins (cysP,U,W,A and sbp). Addressing biocontainment, we included a “kill switch” where low CrVI levels signaled expression of a “toxin” (BamHI). Laboratory work has been completed in model organism Escherichia coli; future work includes characterizing the circuit in S. oneidensis. To assess real-world feasibility, we developed bioreactor- and cell-scale simulations of our engineered bacteria in an activated sludge secondary treatment system aimed at determining the kinetics of Cr(VI) remediation and cell death.:::2017
