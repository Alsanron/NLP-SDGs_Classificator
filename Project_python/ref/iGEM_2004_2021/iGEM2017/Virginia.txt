Virginia:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Sewage, PD:::Current wastewater treatment methods are complex and often difficult to maintain. During the biological nutrient removal process, sludge composed of co-cultures of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria converts ammonia and nitrites into inert nitrogen gas. Proper treatment of wastewater is important because the release of ammonia and nitrites poses health risks to humans. These toxic chemicals also fuel detrimental water eutrophication. Unfortunately, reaching optimal efficiency of the predominant nitrifier, Nitrosomonas europaea, requires aeration, which is costly for treatment facilities. Here we present a biological device that reduces aeration requirements and eliminates the need for co-cultures. We use a denitrifying bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans as a chassis for a device that contains a nitrification circuit taken from the genome of N. europaea. The addition of amoCAB, haoA, and the associated cytochrome genes creates a complete nitrogen removal system. Upon implementation, our device reduces the operating costs of wastewater treatment plants.:::2017
