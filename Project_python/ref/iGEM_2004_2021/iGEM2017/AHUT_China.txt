AHUT_China:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biocompass: The Maze Runner::: Our project is based on "The Maze Runner", where Thomas experienced the maze in constant change. How he reached the exit can be abstracted as classics of Graph Theory. Using the theory of biology, we designed experiments for stimulation and through means we found several feasible paths. It's the extension of our project in 2014 and 2016, the difference is: this project is an analogy of the maze, and can be extended to many practical fields. In detail, we combined experimental design with theoretical analysis. Firstly, we used computer processing for theoretical analysis of specifics in the movie. Then, we utilize biology-related instruments and provided materials to process sequence by trail and error. Finally, we extend related methods to other practical fields. The project not only has theoretical values: solving a math problem, but also bears broad application prospects, so it can be considered as an alternative for information processing.:::2017
