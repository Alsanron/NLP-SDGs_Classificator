British_Columbia:::North America:::Canada:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::aGROW:::A single species of bacteria is responsible for many plant diseases - Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Infection with this bacteria causes bizarre growths and tumors on plants that repurpose the plant cell to reallocate its nutrients to the bacterial cell, causing plant death and agricultural loss. In Agrobacterium, the ability to infect a plant is contained in a tumour inducing plasmid which can spread through conjugation between cells. Here we have constructed aGROW, a strain of Agrobacterium capable of disarming pathogenic Agrobacterium and remediating infected soil. We have armed aGROW with a stable plasmid carrying a CRISPR/Cas9 system programmed to remove a key virulence region of the tumour inducing plasmid. Our plasmid employs a separate conjugation system to carry itself through a population of Agrobacterium, preventing them from becoming virulent. We envision this system to be adaptable in disarming other virulent plasmids such as those found in Shigella, Salmonella, and E. coli.:::2017
