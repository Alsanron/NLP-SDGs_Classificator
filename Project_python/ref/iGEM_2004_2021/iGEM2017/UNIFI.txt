UNIFI:::Europe:::Italy:::Art & Design:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The sound of coli:::Since ’90 biotechnologies have been highly debated at political and social level, strongly influencing public perception and mass media. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between public perception and biotechnologies and managing to speak to the broadest audience we chose the universal language of music, an innovative science art. We make use of bacterial oscillator related to quorum sensing molecules. In particular the idea is to create three E. coli strains, expressing three fluorescent proteins under an oscillating gene regulation circuit controlled by three molecular inducers. The patterns of the emitted fluorescence by the co-culture will be used as input signal for a colour-to-sound translation software. The end will be a "son et lumière" show, which will serve as demonstration of the complexity and beauty of the fascinating biomolecular world. We want to demonstrate that such hidden beauty can be disclosed only by the use of biotechnological tools.:::2017
