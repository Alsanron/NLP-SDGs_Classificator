UPMC_PARIS:::Europe:::France:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The BioMaker Factory, Synthetic biology for access to health care:::Realizing that the lack of access to health care is a major problem in developing countries, we decided to create an automated user-friendly mobile factory able to produce therapeutic molecules for multiple diseases. A heterologous recombinant protein expression system will make E. coli bacteria produce antigen-binding (Fab) fragments of antibodies under an optogenetic regulation thus the production. Our smart box will automatically manage the expression of active biological substances as well as their purification thanks to a computer that will control every step through a software specially designed for our box. “The BioMaker Factory” will be available to humanitarian organizations and local facilities to tackle the lack of access to health care in areas in need. Thanks to the BioBricks system and the work currently done by researchers and industries to develop bioproduction, we are now confident that “The BioMaker Factory” will offer a wide range of applications.:::2017
