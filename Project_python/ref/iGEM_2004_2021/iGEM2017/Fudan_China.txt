Fudan_China:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MemOrderY: A sequential memory device that monitors the changing of signals:::Biological memory can be defined as a sustained cellular response to a transient stimulus. Although the existing memory devices can be highly diverse and delicate, they can only record the static state at the instant the recording action happens, therefore, they do not have the ability to monitor the dynamic changing process of one signal. This year, we want to development the concept of cellular memory, and to realize the monitoring of one changing signal. So, we design a unique memory device with sequential structure using recombinases. After we measure the orthogonality and efficiency of our recombinases, we try to engineer our E.coli population to record several static states of the target signal at different time point. Thus, by putting these results together in the right time order with our recombinase-based sequential system, we can finally get an idea of how the signal changes as time goes by.:::2017
