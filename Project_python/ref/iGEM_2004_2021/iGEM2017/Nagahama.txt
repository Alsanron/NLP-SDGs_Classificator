Nagahama:::Asia:::Japan:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Design of nutritious food based on “Funazushi”:::Our team wants to make nutritious foods that can be stored for a long time to help people suffering from hunger. Starvation is caused by the fact that not only calories but also nutrients such as protein are short. Therefore, we propose nutritious food that can be stored for a long time by fermentation mainly using fish which is a protein source which does not cost money to raise. We focused on the fermented food called Funazushi which rooted in the area where we live in. We will develop nutritious food by recombining yeast which was dominant species of Funazushi and making yeast produces nutrients lacking in the area. Because Funazushi is high salt concentration and low pH state during fermentation ,we will try to create yeast which make necessary nutrients for nation which is troubled by starvation while have resistance to high salt concentration and low pH.:::2017
