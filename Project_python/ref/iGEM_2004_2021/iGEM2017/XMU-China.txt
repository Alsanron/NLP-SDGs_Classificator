XMU-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A chip based device for sensitive and in situ detection of several contaminants in water:::With the increasing amount of industrial wasted water being discharged into water areas, various kinds of harmful ions have had a great impact on the ecological environment and daily drinking water, but the degree of detection of these ions is limited in some special institutions and instruments, which cannot be portable, real-time and general. Thus, we plan to develop a miniature instrument to achieve these goals. To achieve a trace detection, we designed a genetic system which can amplify electrochemical signals or optical signals. At the same time, we designed a device based on micro-fluid chip to concentrate our engineered bacteria on improving the sensitivity of detection following the principles of modularity, cheapness and easy operation. Last but not least, our system provides an innovative and satisfying platform of detection for other molecules by simply changing corresponding promoters.:::2017
