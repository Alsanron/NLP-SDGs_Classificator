NYU_Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Methyltransferase-1-Mediated Consumption of Methanol in Fake Alcohol:::In China and Europe, substitutes for drinking alcohol, known as fake alcohol, have caused dangerous health effects in the community. One such substitute is methanol, known to cause blindness and/or death. The methyltransferase pathway exists in Methanosarcina Acetivorans, converting methanol into methane. By taking advantage of this pathway and two of its essential component, mtaB and corrinoid protein mtaC, methanol may be reduced in fake alcohol solution without affecting the concentration of ethanol. Since methane is a greenhouse gas, we stopped the biological pathway halfway at its intermediate methyl-mtaC. After transforming mtaB and mtaC into DH5Î± strain of E.coli, the effectiveness of the pathway remained undetermined due to limitations of our gas chromatography equipment and to large fluctuations in our magenta sulfite colorimetric results. Further tests, including clonogenic assay and fluorescence counterstaining, suggest that the possibility of the E.coli being unable to survive in methanol could be ruled out.:::2017
