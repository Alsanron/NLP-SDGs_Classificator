Tel-Hai:::Asia:::Israel:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Wonder Wine:::The purpose of our project is to improve upon the quality of wine nutritional value production by way of genetically engineered yeast, aimed at several objectives. The first is spoilage of the wine due to the undesired presence of the Brettanomyces yeast. We intend to target this obstacle by secretion of Brett-specific toxins by our "designer" yeast. Second, enhancing the health benefits of wine, specifically antioxidant content, by increasing presence of reservatrol. Third, lowering the glycemic index of wine while maintaining its flavor and quality by introducing the Miraculin molecule.:::2017
