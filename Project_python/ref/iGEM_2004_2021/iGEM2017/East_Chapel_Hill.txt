Consequently, drinking water is prone to high levels of fluoride from geological sources, corresponding to endemic fluorosis and may lead to developmental or reproductive defects. Underdeveloped regions in rapidly developing countries, such as China and India, have triple the recommended WHO limit of fluoride in their groundwater. Our project seeks to develop the fluoride riboswitch, an mRNA that can bind to fluoride and regulate the expression of downstream genes, as a technology to combat fluoride contamination in water. We developed a system where the fluoride riboswitch controls the expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, allowing bacteria to grow on the antibiotic chloramphenicol in the presence of fluoride. We will use this operon to screen and select riboswitches with higher responsiveness to fluoride. We envision using engineered fluoride riboswitch systems as tools to sequester, bioremediate, or detect fluoride in a cost effective manner.:::2017
