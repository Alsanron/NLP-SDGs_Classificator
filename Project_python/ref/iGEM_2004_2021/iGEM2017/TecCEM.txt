TecCEM:::Latin America:::Mexico:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Silencing multiple Diaphorina citri genes using siRNA for control of Huanglongbing disease in citrus plantations.:::Huanglongbing disease (HLB) is caused by Candidatus liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), a phloem-limited bacteria, transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri (ACP). Current HLB control methods include insecticides and antibiotics that present short-term solutions, that are not specific and may cause a negative impact in plants and the final product. The use of RNAi technology has been widely used in research of gene silencing. Team TEC CEM designed siRNAs targeting four different D. citri genes: Abnormal wing disc (Awd), Wingless (WNT), Superoxide dismutase 1 (CSD1) and Rac-like GTP-binding protein 1 (RacI) to prevent CLas infection and the spread of HLB. RNAi has been proposed as a control mechanism for D. citri, but has only been tested using long dsRNA, therefore we developed siRNAs to maximize the specificity, reducing off-targeting. To ensure effective delivery, siRNAs will be encapsulated using nanotechnology for their direct application to citrus plants.:::2017
