Princeton:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering the Microbiome of Drosophila melanogaster:::Tremendous potential lies in engineering the microbiome, like recognizing and metabolizing toxic compounds the host cannot. Using the Drosophila gut as our model host and E.coli as our microbiome component, we developed techniques to engineer the gut microbiome. The E. coli was engineered to fluoresce GFP or RFP when induced by arabinose, its localization in the gut confirmed by fluorescent microscopy of dissected gut. To increase uptake of e. coli, it was mixed with bakerâ€™s yeast, thus coexistence of 3 species was required to deliver the bacteria to fly gut, When continuously fed, the bacteria remained in the gut, but removing bacteria from food led to a gut residence time of E. coli of 24 hours. The work showed the resistance of the host to establish a foreign persistent microbiome; future work would involve engineering a more native bacterial species such as Lactobacillus to increase gut residence time.:::2017
