Westminster_UK:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The detection of quorum-sensing signalling molecules from Pseudonomas Putida via a novel biosensor:::AHL is a quorum-sensing molecule secreted by bacteria and is essential in biofilm formation. Biofilm is a collection of extracellular proteins and DNA which decreases sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is emerging as a world crisis with the NHS spending roughly Â£1 billion just on treating nosocomial infections. Multidrug resistant (MDR) gram negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas in particular are emerging as increasingly problematic bacterial species, especially in secondary infections. Therefore, we are aiming to develop strategies to help counter biofilm formation from the molecular level using synthetic biology, with the specific genes ppuR, ppuI and RsaL in Pseudomonas Putida being involved in the formation of the quorum sensing molecule AHL. A Biosensor can be developed to identify and decrease production of AHL, causing decreased biofilm formation and an increased sensitivity of the bacteria to antibiotics. Subsequent applications in pharmacology and well as the development of biocontainment devices.:::2017
