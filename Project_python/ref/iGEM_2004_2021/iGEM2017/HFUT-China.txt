HFUT-China:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioDesigner Dolphin::: We developed BioDesigner Dolphin, an information portal which integrates papers, previous teams and BioBricks information along with various algorithms and designs of assistant devices. Users can search for team information, and they will obtain extra information about similar teams as well. Search results are classified into different categories so users will acquire various information efficiently on project overview, description, team awards and so on. The searching engine of BioDesigner Dolphin also allows users to find gene information and explore gene relationship. Besides information acquisition, users are also able to design biological parts with the help of recommendation. We hope BioDesigner Dolphin will improve the working efficiency of researchers and give inspirations to iGEM teams when deciding theme and methodology of their projects.:::2017
