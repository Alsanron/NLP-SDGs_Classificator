Paris_Bettencourt:::Europe:::France:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Medusa: Bringing control to the 3rd dimension:::Accurate spatial-temporal response is fundamental to synthetic biology. Optogenetics has emerged as a powerful tool for genetic control and Medusa brings optogenetics to the next level. By engineering E. coli to respond to multiple light inputs, creating a logical AND gate, we aim to achieve both spatial and temporal control of gene expression. Photosensory transmembrane proteins as well as photoswitchable protein caging were investigated to further expand the existing library of optogenetic tools. For spatial control at the subcellular level, we explored the use of a novel synthetic RNA organelles to manipulate enzymatic activity. Finally, in an effort to promote synthetic biology, we sought the input of the DIY community and chose to illustrate the power of our system by 3D-printing biomaterials.:::2017
