Bristol:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bristol BREATHE: BioReactor to Eliminate Atmospheric Threats to Health and the Environment:::Nitrogen oxide (NOx) gas levels in Bristol are unacceptable. Produced predominantly by car emissions, NOx causes significant morbidity and mortality; it exacerbates lung disease and in Bristol alone kills 300 people per year (8.5% of deaths). NOx is also the third most detrimental greenhouse gas. We aim to engineer E. coli to metabolise NOx using the cytochrome c nitrite reductase (NrfA), which reduces nitrite (NO2-) to ammonia, and the Nap periplasmic nitrate reductase to convert nitrate (NO3-) to nitrite. As NOx dissolves to form both nitrite and nitrate, the use of Nap will improve efficiency. The ammonia produced could be used to make fertiliser, or electricity if incorporated into a microbial fuel cell. An agent-based bacterial model will be adapted to predict system efficiency and behaviour. We aim to contain our bacteria within pods to be strategically placed in the most polluted areas, based on our atmospheric pollution modelling.:::2017
