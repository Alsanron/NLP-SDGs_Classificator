The current method for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer remains as a big limitation. The current options for treating colorectal cancer include chemotherapy, which attack all fast-growing cells. MicroRNAs are noncoding single strand small RNA molecules which act as regulators of gene expression and control many cellular processes. Recently, miR-21 is reported to have high sensitivity and specificity in identifying colorectal cancer. Meanwhile, miR-21 can be served as a therapeutic target by targeting many oncogenes in colorectal cancer. That had inspired us of using it as the new biomarker in diagnosing and treatment of colorectal cancer. Our project constructed a mir-21 sponge containing marker gene of GFP and luc for the detection and inhibition of mir-21 in cell lines, which offers a non-invasive and highly sensitive approach for early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer in the future.:::2017
