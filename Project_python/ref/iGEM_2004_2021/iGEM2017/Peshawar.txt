Peshawar:::Asia:::Pakistan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bio-Reporter Fish: Detection of heavy metal contamination in freshwater through novel BioBricks-based devices:::Estimates from national and international studies indicate an alarming concentration of heavy-metals in the water resources of Pakistan, with 60 million Pakistanis affected by arsenic alone. This highlights the negative impact of heavy-metal contamination on environment, food, and health. To solve this problem, we are developing novel bio-brick devices which will enable a fish to detect Arsenic, Cadmium, Mercury, Nickel, Copper and Zinc. Using metal inducible promoters we aim to construct six devices which express specific chromo-proteins for heavy-metal detection. All devices with prokaryotic parts will initially be tested in E.coli to establish their proper functioning. Next, we will express heavy-metal reporter devices in fish which will in principle be able to provide colorimetric detection of heavy-metals in fresh water ponds. This novel bio-reporter system will ultimately help in taking timely actions to ensure the safety of water and fish, impacting the environment, food and livelihood of millions of Pakistanis.:::2017
