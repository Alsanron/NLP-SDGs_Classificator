USTC:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PELICAN:::Bio-manufacturing is a type of manufacturing that utilizes biological systems to produce commercially important biomaterials. However, it can’t be scaled up and put into practice so easily mainly due to the unstable productivity. So, to make bio-manufacturing a more practical technology for synthesis, we build up a more stable and efficient synthesis platform based on bio-cathode. There are 3 systems in our project. To enable E.coli to transfer the extracellular electrons into the cytoplasm as NADH, we construct the Mtr CAB system, the first system we have. Mtr CAB, a protein complex located on the outer membrane, can transfer electrons from the outside of the membrane into the periplasm. The second system is a photoelectric system, generating high energy electrons with CdS nanoparticles as a light harvester. Lastly, we introduce an enzyme as an indicator to demonstrate our project’s flexibility and efficiency.:::2017
