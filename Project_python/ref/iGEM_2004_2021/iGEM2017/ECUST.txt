ECUST:::Asia:::China:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Light Harvester:::Traditional energy will finally come to exhaustion, and the development of new energy is extremely urgent. To produce hydrogen, which is a clean and efficient source of energy, through microbial photosynthesis is an environmentally friendly and sustainable pathway. However, the facts such as low efficiency of bio-hydrogen production, lack of large-scale application device and others hinder the application prospect of bio-hydrogen production. Therefore, this project aims to expand the absorption spectrum of photosynthetic bacteria by the way of forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in order to improve the efficiency of the photoreaction. On top of that, we will also design a photo-reactor special for bio-hydrogen production to solve the problem of applying it on a large scale.:::2017
