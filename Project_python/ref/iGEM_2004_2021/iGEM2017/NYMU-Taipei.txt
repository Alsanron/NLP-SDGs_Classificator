NYMU-Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Smart AlgaEnergy:::Facing the threatening energy crisis, scientists are craving for alternative energy sources. Taking both clean energy productivity and other factors under consideration, we have decided to target our project on increasing the oil accumulation in microalgae by multiple approaches. On the one hand, we have determined to make microalgae undergo nitrogen starvation to increase its oil accumulation by creating a co-culturing system of microalgae and NrtA-transformed Escherichia coli that can deprive microalgae of nitrogen source. On the other hand, we have changed the color of microalgae by transforming pigmentation functions from other species into microalgae cells to enhance its efficiency of photosynthesis. By combining these two approaches, we can develop a new intelligent system which can enhance bio-energy production and contribute to the needs of renewable clean energy.:::2017
