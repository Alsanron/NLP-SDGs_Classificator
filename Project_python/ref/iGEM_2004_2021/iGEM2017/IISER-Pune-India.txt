IISER-Pune-India:::Asia:::India:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::TB or not TB? A diagnostic tool:::Cheap and easily available diagnostic tool for tuberculosis is the need of the hour. Problems faced during TB diagnosis include the long culturing time and expensive microscopy. We aim to create an inexpensive device which can be used by diagnosticians on a day-to-day basis without using microscopic equipment. Our project has three modules: The Hijack module will facilitate faster growth of M. tuberculosis by increasing the frequency of oscillations of certain cell cycle proteins. The Detection module will make the bacteria express chromoproteins, which can be seen by the eye. The Termination module will ensure that the fast growing bacteria are killed after they reach a required population using quorum sensing based killer gene expression. The device will be delivered using a bacteriophage delivery system, and this entire diagnostic process will be carried out in a closed, handy device which we have designed.:::2017
