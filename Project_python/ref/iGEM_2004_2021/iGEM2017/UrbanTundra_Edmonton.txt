UrbanTundra_Edmonton:::North America:::Canada:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Cleaning an Interplanetary Toxin: Converting Perchlorate into a Breathable Alternative::: Perchlorate is a natural toxin that exists on Mars at high concentrations of ~0.5-1% and on Earth at significant concentrations of ~0.15-0.25%. However, perchlorate is also a by-product contaminant of several industrial processes. Certain soil bacteria degrade perchlorate to oxygen and chloride using the enzymes perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase. By exploiting this two-step enzyme pathway, our team hopes to bioremediate Martian soil for future human settlement and potential applications on Earth. Last year, our high school team UrbanTundra 2016 successfully expressed chlorite dismutase in E. coli, and showed that it could convert the chlorite intermediate to chloride and oxygen. This year, our plans are two-fold: 1) to complete the pathway by expressing perchlorate reductase, a challenging problem involving a large two-subunit membrane protein requiring multiple cofactors, and 2) the design of a self-contained bioreactor for the enzyme pathway that can be used on both planets.:::2017
