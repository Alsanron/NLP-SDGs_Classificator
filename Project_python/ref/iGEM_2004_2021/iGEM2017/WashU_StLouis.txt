WashU_StLouis:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Operation: Ultraviolet:::Due to numerous climate effects, photosynthetic organisms are being damaged due to increased levels of harmful UV-B radiation. Luckily, many organisms exist that have a natural resistance to this kind of radiation. Using genes from the tardigrade species Ramazzottius Varieornatus, the bacteria species Deinococcus Radiodurans, and a strain of cyanobacteria, we hope to induce resistance to UV-B radiation damage. In order to demonstrate proof of these genesâ€™ utility, our first step was to transform the genes into E. Coli. From there, we planned to test these transformed cells in our Environmental Simulation System by irradiating the cells and comparing their growth to that of a control. So far, we have found that E. Coli cells with Dsup are substantially more resistant to UV-B radiation, and we have also recorded preliminary data on uvsE as well. Currently, we are transforming the four genes into cyanobacteria and testing them under UV-B light.:::2017
