Stony_Brook:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacterioassassins: Development of hybrid bacteriocins to Target Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus:::MRSA is a prevalent threat due to its high resistance against multiple antibiotics, prompting health professionals to find alternative treatment options. Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria to selectively kill other strains of bacteria in their surrounding environment. Our study involves creating a hybrid of the bacteriocins, Lacticin Z and Aureocin A53 (or Epidermicin NI01) by connecting them with three glycine residues. These bacteriocins have shown effective inhibitory activity against MRSA strains; they form pores to penetrate the membrane of the pathogenic strain. We tested if the hybrid bacteriocins will have a synergistic effect and compared their cytotoxicity over time to that of the individual bacteriocins against MRSA. This was done by conducting two assays: minimum inhibitory concentration and the spot-on-lawn. Through development of hybrids, we aim to optimize the activity of bacteriocins and treat bacterial infections, particularly those with antibiotic resistance.:::2017
