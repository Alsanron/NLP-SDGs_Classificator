Aalto-Helsinki:::Europe:::Finland:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Porifi - Purify your pores from acne bacteria:::Acne vulgaris affects 85% of adolescents at some point of their life, influencing their self-esteem negatively. Currently, antibiotics are among the most common acne treatments. However, 50% of bacteria associated with acne are already resistant to the antibiotics used. Our project aims to develop a novel treatment for acne using an antimicrobial peptide, dermcidin, naturally found in human sweat. Dermcidin has shown to be active against Propionibacterium acnes, the bacterium associated with acne. Patients with acne also have reduced expression of dermcidin, which suggests that it might contribute to the condition. We aim to produce dermcidin tied to a cellulose-binding domain, which would enable the immobilization of the peptide on a cellulose surface. This would allow the usage of dermcidin in various skin care products, such as hydrogel masks and exfoliation pads.:::2017
