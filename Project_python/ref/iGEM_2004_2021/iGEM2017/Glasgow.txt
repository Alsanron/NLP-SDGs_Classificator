Glasgow:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Campylocator: Detection of Campylobacter jejuni for the prevention of food poisoning:::Food contamination and improper handling of raw poultry is the leading cause of food poisoning in the U.K. Campylobacter jejuni is native to poultry but is highly pathogenic to humans and cross-contamination of surfaces and other foods is common. The current detection methods are time consuming and costly and therefore we aimed to create a new cheaper, faster system for detection of this bacteria using synthetic biology. We designed and engineered a dual input biosensor using sensory aspects including campylobacter-specific sugars and quorum sensing to identify any C. jejuni present on a swabbed surface. We also developed an understanding of the legal aspects of using GMO biosensors within the EU. In the future, our biosensor is a potential solution in reducing the risk of food poisoning from Campylobacter.:::2017
