This phenomenon is called antimicrobial resistance, or AMR. As current diagnostic devices are not fast enough, this has resulted in the overprescription of antibiotics, leading to an increase in AMR. The aim of our project, BrightBiotics, was to create a cheap, rapid and user-friendly way to faster advise healthcare professionals, on what antibiotics to use. Our device, the BrightBiotics System, does this by measuring bacterial growth, as turbidity, in the presence of different antibiotics. Once the patient’s sample has been prepared and put in the device, photodiodes detect changes in turbidity, and the data is sent via WiFi to the Cloud. The healthcare professionals can then check the results allowing them to make a more informed decision about which antibiotic to give the patient.:::2017
