It is crucial to find a time and cost effective procedure that will catabolize some of the most prevalent, toxic PAHs -- fluorene, phenanthrene, and naphthalene -- to innocuous compounds, such as salicylate and phthalate, which are degradable in metabolic cycles. Certain bacteria contain intermediates in their degradative pathways that simplify gene combination and nucleotide sequencing. We proposed a novel methodology for the degradation of multiple PAHs through the implementation of these bacteria-derived pathways into E. coli. This methodology allows broad spectrum transformation of PAHs within an oil environment into safer residues. A broad host vector can be used to transfer the sequenceâ€™s degradation capabilities into strains different from E. coli. These bacteria can be incorporated in oil spill remediations and bioreactor use, achieving detoxification through combinatorial genetic bioremediation.:::2017
