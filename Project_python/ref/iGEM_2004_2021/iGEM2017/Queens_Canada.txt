However, biofilms also offer an attractive platform for the design of self-assembling biomaterials programmed for specific functionality. The amyloid protein CsgA accounts for the majority of the proteinaceous component, curli nanofibres, of Escherichia coli biofilms. CsgA has been shown to be tolerant of C-terminal fusions, allowing CsgA endowed with diverse peptide domains to be secreted and self-assembled extracellularly similar to normal curli nanofibres. We present the genetic engineering of CsgA to create a biofilm that binds ice and degrades hydrocarbons. A type I antifreeze protein, AFP8, will be fused to CsgA for ice binding, and a PA-14 adhesin domain will be fused, via the SpyTag-SpyCatcher system, to bind the hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus. Thus, the end-product will be a bifunctional biofilm capable of establishing itself on Arctic ice to degrade toxic hydrocarbons present in oil spills.:::2017
