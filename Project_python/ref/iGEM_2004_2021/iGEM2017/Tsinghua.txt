Often produced by molds when foods decay, AFT is easily found in everyday foods such as grains, oil and milk. However, its detection remains expensive and inconvenient, requiring special equipment. We developed a biosensor of aflatoxin easy for household use which gives a warning of AFT levels beyond safety limit in oil and milk. Utilizing the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay, we fused two partial antibodies (single-chain variable fragments) targeting aflatoxin with Y2H elements to drive the expression of the reporter gene in response to AFT. The reporter is a hexose transporter gene linking the level of AFT detected to the concentration of glucose in medium, easily read out by a glucometer. Thus we combine the sensitivity of antibody reaction, flexibility of Y2H assay and convenience of glucometer readout to facilitate household detection of AFT in everyday foods.:::2017
