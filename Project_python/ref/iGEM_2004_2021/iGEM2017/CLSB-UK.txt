CLSB-UK:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Project B.A.T.M.A.N. - Biosynthetic Applications of Toehold switches - miRNAs and nonsmall cell lung cancer:::Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a high mortality and no cheap screening test for early diagnosis. MicroRNA (miRNA) levels in body fluids are postulated to be effective, non-invasive biomarkers for many diseases. miRNAs hsa-mir-15b-5p and hsa-mir-27b-3p are differentially expressed in serum early in NSCLC. We designed two sequence specific sensors to quantify serum levels of these miRNAs using toehold switches, which regulate protein synthesis post-transcriptionally. Binding of an arbitrary RNA sequence to the toehold switch activates translation, producing a fluorescent reporter protein. Fluorescence intensity therefore indicates miRNA levels. This may enable miRNA level detection using toehold switches as a simple detection method for NSCLC. In future, we propose multiple switches used in tandem to detect differentially expressed miRNAs in multiple diseases simultaneously, or even several reporters with different emission peaks to create a multiplexing assay. This would allow for rapid and cheap diagnosis of many diseases from one sample.:::2017
