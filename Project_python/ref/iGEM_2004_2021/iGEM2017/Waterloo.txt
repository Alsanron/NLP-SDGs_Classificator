Waterloo:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Prions be Lit: Functional Amyloid as a Biological Tool:::Prions are perhaps most famous for their implication in neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are also proteins that bear strong similarities to prions while not being associated with an infectious disease. These proteins have been deemed “functional prions.” Here, engineered functional prions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provide a proof of concept for using prions as a tool in synthetic biology to co-localize different proteins. These engineered proteins have prion-like aggregative behaviour, as well as a fluorescent tag. They will be used to test the viability of using engineered prions to bring and keep proteins in close proximity to each other while maintaining their function.:::2017
