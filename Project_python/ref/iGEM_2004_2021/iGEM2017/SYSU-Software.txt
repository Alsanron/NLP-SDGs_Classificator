SYSU-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::S-DIN——Search engine and Design platform for Inspiration with Network analysis.:::With an exponential accumulation of circuit designs in synthetic biology, it becomes time-consuming to ponder out how to utilize the previous works in solving a new problem. This year, we create S-DIN for the ocean of projects facilitated by the power of network analysis and recommendation algorithms. It contains two main parts: Intelligent Search Engine and Embedded Design Platform. By drawing digital users portrait, our search engine can help users specify their needs and recommend related projects & parts. For the first time in synthetic biology, we introduced the big-data analysis to analyze the complex network of projects, parts, and topics, which supports our recommendation and search results in a global way. The embedded design platform allows you to search and edit a previous work simultaneously and related circuits & parts are recommended based on interaction database. Finally, the mathematical performance of circuits design will be simulated by our platform.:::2017
