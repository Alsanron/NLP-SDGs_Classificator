IIT-Madras:::Asia:::India:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A digital information catalogue of host organisms for synthetic biology, with supportive software tools:::With regard to construction of synthetic biological systems, it is observed in several iGEM projects and literature that E. coli could not express quite a number of interesting phenotypes that are native to specific organisms. In such cases it is advantageous to use those organisms and introduce synthetic circuits into them. Hence, it is desirable to have a catalogue of alternative host organisms with specific characters, and a database of protocols, parts and software tools to work with them. Our database will consist of a collection of organisms used as hosts, their physical attributes, protocols involved in culturing and transformation, and host-wise listing of biobrick parts and other vectors. It shall serve as a platform for synthetic biologists to exchange all relevant information about host organisms. Along with the database, a set of necessary computational tools such as codon optimisation will also be developed.:::2017
