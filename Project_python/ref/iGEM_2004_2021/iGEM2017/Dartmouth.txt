Dartmouth:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Construction of robust bacterial plasmid for ethanol production:::Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ADH2) are key enzymes for mediating ethanol production from pyruvate. A particularly well-characterized PDC-ADH system has been found in Zymomonas mobilis, and this pathway has been used to engineer a variety of bacteria for ethanol production. In some cases, this pathway works well, resulting in high levels of ethanol production. In other cases, however, the pathway does not work very well. To understand this, we aim to develop a set of BioBrick compatible expression vectors with different plasmid replicons to allow expression of the PDC-ADH pathway in a range of different bacteria. Organisms expressing the PDC-ADH pathway will be assayed for PDC and ADH activity by enzyme assay and for ethanol production by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). These new expression plasmids will be useful for other groups looking to expand their BioBrick engineering beyond the confines of current model or "chassis‚Äù organisms.:::2017
