AshesiGhana:::Africa:::Ghana:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Gold FEDS: Fluorescent Emitting Devices:::The objective of our project is to develop a bio-sensor for gold quantification providing a non-toxic approach for small scale mining to extract gold from refractory ore, and enabeling routine monitoring of the ore before a mining endeavour is undertaken. We will engineer E. coli with a gold specific FRET probe using a donor part which is made up of a gold binding protein (golB) attached to a green fluorescent protein (nowGFP) and an acceptor part made up of golB a red fluorescent protein (mRuby2). In the presence of free gold, the two parts will be in close proximity and thus an energy transfer can take place between the donor and acceptor proteins and the red protein will be excited giving off a fluorescent signal. Using calibration experiments we can relate the amount of fluorescence to the amount the gold present, and liberated by the organism from the ore.:::2017
