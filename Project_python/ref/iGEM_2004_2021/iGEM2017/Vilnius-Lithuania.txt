Vilnius-Lithuania:::Europe:::Lithuania:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SynORI â€“ a framework for multi-plasmid systems:::Gene copy number serves as a fundamental parameter in the dynamics of synthetic gene circuits, but is often not explicitly considered. Coupled with transcriptional and translational regulation, copy number control would offer an effective coordination and increased dynamic range of multiple gene expression. Therefore, we modified the ColE1 replicon to develop a synthetic origin of replication - SynORI - which enables the alteration of plasmid copy number. SynORI framework also incorporates a multi-plasmid regulation system based on uniquely barcoded regulatory RNA molecules, allowing to co-maintain different-group plasmids at preselected copy numbers in a standardized manner. In case certain plasmids are chosen to have a low copy number, an active partitioning system will minimize the risk of plasmid loss and increase the stability of our system. SynORI enables the creation of more complex metabolic pathways, smart assembly of protein complexes and a more precise information processing in synthetic biology.:::2017
