Kent:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::LuCas: the unique Cas13a mediated mRNA localization tool:::Cas13a is a RNA guided endonuclease which degrades RNAs based on alignment of its CRISPR derived guide RNA. To determine the sub-cellular localization of messenger RNA (mRNA) we fluorescently tagged a Cas13a that cannot cleave its target RNA (dCas13a). This was achieved by using four mutations, two in HEPN1 and two in the HEPN2 domains, which although ablating nuclease activity, still permitted dCAS13a to bind the target RNA sequence. In tandem we designed guide RNAs for targeting mRNA of four cytosolic proteins. Visualization of the dCAS13a was achieved by fusion with a GFP, and to enhance target detection, a nuclear localization sequence sequestered the dCas13a-GFP in the nucleus until needed in the cytosol, thus reducing background noise. We have performed verification tests, constructed mathematical models and developed multiple tools for public engagement. Our findings will lead to the development of a new tool for research and potentially in diagnostic laboratories.:::2017
