Franconia:::Europe:::Germany:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::B.E.A.M. - Biocompatible Elastic Artificial Muscle:::The human muscular system enables supremely precise body movements to perform everyday tasks. While robotic devices improve these capabilities for industrial purposes, currently used medical prostheses can only mimic basic functions of the muscular system. Therefore, we will develop biological synthetic muscles to provide ecological friendly tissue compatible with the human body. At first, we will fabricate biopolymers with integrated molecular machines that will form a tissue capable of a muscle-like contraction. Named molecular machines are based on azo dyes, which can contract by light irradiation. These will be attached to the biopolymer matrix fabricated by Escherichia coli via biotin based catcher-tag systems. Another approach is to express both conductive and elastic P-Pili from Geobacter sulfurreducens and Escherichia coli. Alternating layers of these biopolymers form the dielectric elastomer actuator and the resulting biological tissue can respond to an applied voltage.:::2017
