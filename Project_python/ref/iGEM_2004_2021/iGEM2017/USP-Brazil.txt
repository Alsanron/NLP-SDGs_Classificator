USP-Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: BioTrojan: Combining paratransgenesis and Synthetic Biology approaches to combat mosquito-borne diseases:::Paratransgenesis can be defined as a set of strategies to eliminate a pathogen from vector populations through the usage of genetically modified symbionts, thus controlling vector-borne diseases. For our iGEM Project, we have focused on generating a versatile molecular toolkit for endogenous detection and elimination of mosquito-borne pathogens. We have selected Pantoea agglomerans, a ubiquitous bacterium which is enriched in the midgut microbiota of anophelines, as a novel chassis for targeting malarial parasites. Two coupled genetic circuits have been designed (i) for sensing malarial infection biomarkers in the blood ingested by mosquitoes and (ii) for subsequent production/secretion of anti-Plasmodium synthetic peptides. A third module, consisting in an endogenous bacterial killer-switch was designed to control the population dynamics of the genetically engineered symbiont. This is the first study combining the conceptual frameworks of both paratransgenesis and Synthetic Biology, bearing great potential for the generation of novel approaches for combating mosquito-borne diseases.:::2017
