SDU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PowerLeaf â€“ a bacterial solar battery:::The PowerLeaf introduces a novel solution for long-term storage of solar energy, thus becoming an alternative to solar cells. This is accomplished without the use of environmentally harmful resources. The device is designed to resemble a plant leaf, which is meant to provide a nature-in-city ambience. This hypothetical implementation of the PowerLeaf in an urban environment, was developed through public engagement and collaboration.The bacterial solar battery is composed of an energy storing unit (1), and an energy converting unit (2). The energy storing unit (1) is defined by a genetically engineered Escherichia Coli, which fixates carbon dioxide into the chemically stable polymer cellulose. A light sensing system activates dormancy during nighttime, to reduce energy lost by metabolism. The energy converting unit (2) uses genetically engineered Geobacter Sulfurreducens to consume the stored cellulose. Retrieved electrons are transferred by optimized nanowires to an anode resulting in an electrical current.:::2017
