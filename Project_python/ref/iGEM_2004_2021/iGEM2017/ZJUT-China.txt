ZJUT-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::LiGeM: A Light-induced Genetically Engineered Machine for Cell Disruption:::In fermentation industry, numerous valuable products are intracellular metabolites. Thus, the cell disruption step is essential for product extraction. However, traditional cell disruption methods (including sonication and homogenization) usually need additional equipments and are laborious/time-consuming. To improve the efficiency of cell disruption and intracellular products extraction, a lysozyme-encoding gene was successfully integrated into a modified blue-light-controlled gene switch which was evaluated through eGFP gene expression. Subsequently, self-lysis of E. coli cells was assessed under blue light. To control the expression of lysis gene regulated by blue light, a model of light-emitting device was constructed and a layout of fermentor with light-emitting device was designed. Moreover, we made an economic analysis after consulting several bio-factories. It indicated that our design not only reduce the cost in cell disruption but also simplify operation process. Taken together, our project showed an exciting potential for cell disruption and intracellular products extraction in fermentation industry.:::2017
