SSTi-SZGD:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Guardian of the wheatland::: The aim of this project is to combine optogenetics and biotechnology, by using genetically modified organism as the core carriers, to develop a novel method for degrading pesticide residues in contaminated soil. We employed a novel light inducible/repressive system that can efficiently overexpress heterogenous hydrolases that are able to degrade chemical pesticides organophosphorus and parathion-methyl residues in soil . By using light control gene expression system, protein products can be produced without the need of using toxic and expensive chemical inducers (i.e. IPTG). In addition, we plan to develop a device that integrates monitoring and data-sharing functions that help applying this system to on-site pesticide residue detection and degradation. We hope to achieve a microbial degradation method with low toxicity, low cost and high efficiency that serve a positive role in maintaining ecological balance and sustaining development in China.:::2017
