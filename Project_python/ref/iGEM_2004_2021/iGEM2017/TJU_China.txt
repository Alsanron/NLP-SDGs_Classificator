TJU_China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Utilizing a Novel Infrared Fuorescent System to Track Intestinal Bacteria in Real Time:::In recent years, the researchers have revealed the key role of intestinal microbiota. There is an increasing number of evidences indicating that gut flora can really influence our thinking, mood, behavior, and feelings. However, there exists difficulties in tracking intestinal bacteria in a living body. This year we achieve this goal by using a novel fluorescent system. Several important enteropathogens and probiotics are on our list, including facultative anaerobe and obligate anaerobe, like EHEC O157:H7, Bifidobacterium longum and so on. We construct different shuttle vectors to express this fluorescent system and successfully prove that it works well. Through the expression system, bacteria with fluorescence can be detected in a living body, making in vivo imaging come true.:::2017
