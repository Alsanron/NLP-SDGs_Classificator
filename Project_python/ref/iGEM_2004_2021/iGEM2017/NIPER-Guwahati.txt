NIPER-Guwahati:::Asia:::India:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of synthetic Bio-conjugates for targeted down-regulation of Oncogenes.:::Our iGEM-2017 work involves evolution of Bcl-2 mRNA-binding peptides and DNAzymes for Bcl-2 mRNA cleaving activity, which can eventually down regulate the expression of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein in a very specific manner. The second part of the project is to evolve cell permeating peptides specific for skin cancer cells (A375) through phage-surface display random peptide library. We will eventually fuse the novel Bcl-2 mRNA binding peptides and mRNA cleaving DNAzymes with Cell-specific Cell Permeating Peptides (CPPs) to develop Bioconjugates which can target cancer cell through the CPP and inhibit the Bcl-2 protein expression through the novel Bcl-2 mRNA binding peptide and mRNA cleaving DNAzyme to induce apoptosis of the cancer cells. The work has a special significance as we try to boost the global efforts of developing "Complete" Drug molecules/Bio-pharmaceuticals; which can inhibit the target (Drug Action), guided by a CPP to Deliver the Oncogene-Inhibitor inside Cancer cells (Drug Delivery).:::2017
