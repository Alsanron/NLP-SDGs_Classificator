SVCE_CHENNAI:::Asia:::India:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ReguloGEM - the ideal regulatory BioBrick:::Synthetic biologists over the years have regulated protein expression using two types of regulators - transcriptional and translational. While transcriptional regulators are easily composable and are capable of regulating multiple genes(operons) and complex genetic circuits, they are difficult to engineer. On the other hand, translational regulators are not capable of regulating multiple genes and complex genetic circuits but can be easily engineered de novo using predictive thermodynamic models. Hence an ideal regulator is found wanting, one which is capable of regulating multiple genes simultaneously and at the same time easily engineerable. ReguloGEM provides such a regulator based on the tnaC operon. This regulator termed the Adaptor is capable of converting the translational regulatory property of riboswitches into transcriptional regulation. The Adaptor will be tested using temperature and pH sensitive riboswitches. We have also built a machine learning based tool that is capable of predicting the strength of sigma 70 promoters.:::2017
