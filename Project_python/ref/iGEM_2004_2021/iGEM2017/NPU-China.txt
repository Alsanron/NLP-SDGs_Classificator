NPU-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Glycerol-based Acrylic Acid Cell Factory::: Acrylic acid is a bulk chemical raw material,whose excellent polymerization capacity is widely used in many fields.This year, we chose to use glycerol as carbon source to achieve the all green production of acrylic acid. Based on the core enzyme Ceas2, high-yield acrylic acid cell factory was built through the Part,Pathway,System and Process. We designed the Ceas2 mutant by utilizing the AEMD platform. HPLC and HTS techniques were applied in screening for Ceas2 mutants of high catalytic efficiency.We devised GDC pathway, achieving complete synthesis from glycerol to acrylic acid. In addition, we add a reduction power module for this pathway.We constructed a new pathway in E. coli and S. cerevisiae respectively,and after prediction via metabolic flux modeling,we optimized the cell metabolism by using the RED and CRISPR-Cas9 technique. The cell production process was hereby bolstered by optimizing the fermentation process and screening the carbon source,Buffer,temperature,pH and other experimental conditions.:::2017
