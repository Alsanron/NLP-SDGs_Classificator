NTHU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::EDCs Terminator:::This year, our goal is to build a system that can detect and degrade EDCs. In many developing countries, factories spew toxic water into rivers, and farmers nearby may accidentally utilize it. EDCs can interfere with endocrine systems, causing harmful effect on organisms. In our project, we focus on two common kinds of EDCs, BPA and NP. For detection, we modified E.coli to express EDC receptor, ERα and GFP. Next, we assembled monobodies on gold surface. We can measure the fluorescent intensity of GFP or information of SPR via interaction between ERα and monobody, thus estimate the concentration of EDCs. For degradation, we modified E.coli to produce target enzymes which can degrade BPA and NP. We integrated target enzymes with activated carbon and bioreactor system to eliminate EDCs. In conclusion, our project aims to solve water safety issue for farmers in developing countries and create a more healthy agricultural environment.:::2017
