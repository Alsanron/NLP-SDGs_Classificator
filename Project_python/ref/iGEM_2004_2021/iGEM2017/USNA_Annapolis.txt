USNA_Annapolis:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Editing the Human Microbiome: Preventing Aerosolized Peptide Proteins:::Intercellular communication in biofilm microbial communities is a well-known natural phenomenon. Recently, it has been reported that cells in biofilms may also communicate long distances via ion gradients, mimicking neuronal networks. We believe such electrical communication could be important in pathogenicity of air-borne environmental toxicants if they interfere with natural ion fluxes in the human respiratory microbiome. If a microorganism were engineered to respond to an ionic change, the respiratory microbiome could detect and respond to an environmental toxicant exposure in real-time. Our project will demonstrate a cation responsive genetic sensor by regulating expression of GFP using the sodium responsive transcriptional regulator, NhaR. We will use the ionophore monensin, known to create a change in Na+ equilibrium across the cell membrane, as a proxy to imitate an ionic response within a biofilm. This will ultimately provide bioengineers a method to create alternate probiotic sensors for cell-communication and possibly ion homeostasis.:::2017
