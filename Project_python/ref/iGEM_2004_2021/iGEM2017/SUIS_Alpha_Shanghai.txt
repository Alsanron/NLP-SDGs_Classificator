E-cOILi: Recycled Waste Cooking Oil Treatment System.:::Recycled waste cooking oil exhibits amplified volumes of Malondialdehyde (MDA), a mutagenic and carcinogenic substance which reacts with DNA to form adducts to deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine. The illegal practice returning this recycled waste oil back into the food industry can result in the ingestion of unsafe quantities of MDA. Malondialdehyde can be broken down into benign metabolites via the sequential enzymatic action of aldehyde dehydrogenase (specifically mitochondrial ALDH2) and malonic semialdehyde oxidative decarboxylase. The products of the reaction are acetyl-CoA with the release of CO2. We designed a genetic circuit which expresses these two enzymes in equal amounts and is supports the expression system of E.coli, rendering our device useful for the development of a biological treatment system which could form part of standard protocols relating to the treatment of waste oil in industrial oil refinery plants.:::2017
