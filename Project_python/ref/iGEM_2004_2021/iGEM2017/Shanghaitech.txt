Shanghaitech:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A multilayer signal-processing system based on Quorum Sensing (Multilayer-QS):::In synthetic biology, building complex logic circuits are often difficult, especially in a single cell population. It requires many non-crosstalking information processing units such as quorum sensing (QS) factors, to work within a cell without significant interference. However, these non-crosstalking QS factors are very limited. Furthermore, even for simple circuits, one has to create de novo which can be difficult for beginners. It would be ideal to use modularized parts assemble directly into circuits. Therefore, we aimed to create a multilayer signal-processing system by using compartmentalized QS factors. We have provided proof-of-concept data and modeling to show that our system would allow faithful information flow between bacterial population. Also, we aimed to build QS part libraries to allow easily switching of parts, changing signal inputs and outputs without de novo cloning. Thus, our system may not only increase signal-processing power, but also make it more friendly to synthetic biologists.:::2017
