NKU_China:::Asia:::China:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Traffic Police in the Reservoir -- engineered microbes that control water flooding:::In the process of oil recovery by water injection, large water channels will be formed. Water mainly flows through these channels, avoiding brushing the oil stuck in the minor channels, so that the oil remains unexplored. Our project is aiming to engineer Enterobacter sp. FY-07 (which is separated from oilfield produced water and able to produce cellulose in anaerobic conditions) using toggle switch, so as to produce rhamnolipid and cellulose in an controllable way. The engineered Enterobacter sp. FY-07 acts as the traffic police controlling the oil flux. In large channels, cellulose is produced to clog the flowing water and help it enter into the minor channels and wash out the oil within them. In minor channels, rhamnolipid is produced to emulsify oil, so the oil can be easily washed out. Our project aims at improving oil recovery rate in the oil harvesting process using the engineered bacteria.:::2017
