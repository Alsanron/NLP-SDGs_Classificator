DEIAGRA:::Asia:::India:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bio-Beads For Removing Heavy Metal Toxicity From Industrial Effluents:::Heavy metals, also known as trace metals, are one of the most persistent pollutants in waste water. Biological remediation processes are indicated to be very effective in the treatment of heavy metal pollutants in waste water.The over-expression of metal binding proteins has been widely exploited to increase the metal binding capacity, tolerance or accumulation of heavy metals in bacteria and plants. An expression level of transgene/gene of interest depends upon strength of promoter. Hereby in our project we are focusing on over-expressing the "Top-4 metal binder protein" (iGEM part BBa_K1478002) and "Human Metallotheonin 3" by strong synthetic promoter designed by employing bionformatics tools which would be suitable for expression in microbes and plants. We will fabricate bio-beads by immobilizing, bacterial cells which strongly expresses our cloned metallotheonin. Our fabricated beads allows fast, easy and user handy purification of industrial waste water which can be further use for irrigation purpose.:::2017
