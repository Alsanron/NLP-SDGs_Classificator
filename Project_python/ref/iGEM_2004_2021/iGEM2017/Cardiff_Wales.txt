Cardiff_Wales:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BenthBioFactory: Using plant synthetic biology to generate therapeutics for the treatment of Graves’ Disease:::Our project involves expressing the human thyroid stimulating hormone antagonist (TSHantag) protein in the tobacco Nicotiana benthamiana. Using golden gate cloning, we are generating transcriptional units for transient expression of TSHantag after agrobacterium-mediated transformation in tobacco leaves. TSHantag has been used to treat hyperthyroid disorders such as Graves’ Disease, but has not been produced in large amounts appropriate for therapeutic use. The TSHantag protein works by inhibiting autoimmune autoantibodies, which in turn decreases elevated thyroxine levels and reduces pathologic symptoms. In addition, we are expanding the set of tools available for regulating gene expression in plant synthetic biology. Currently, only a small number of regulatory elements have been introduced into the iGEM Phytobrick standard. Therefore, we are generating novel inducible promoter Phytobricks that are responsive to jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The efficacy of these regulatory elements will be measured using a luciferase reporter system.:::2017
