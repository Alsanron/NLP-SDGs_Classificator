Emory:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Phosphate removal and detection for wastewater treatment:::The WaterHub at Emory University is a wastewater treatment plant on campus that utilizes bacteria and plants to recycle 400,000 gallons of water a day for non-potable use. The Emory iGEM team has utilized synthetic biology to try to help optimize their system by developing a phosphate accumulating organism that can help them combat the high orthophosphate levels in their wastewater. We have created a number of experimental strains of bacteria with variations in polyphosphate kinase and exopolyphosphatase expression. Their phosphate assimilation rates and growth rates in waterhub sewage with an added carbon source were tested. We have also created a phosphate sensor that takes advantage of a natural phosphate sensing mechanism regulated by promoters called pho regulon. This sensor will allow the cells to indicate when phosphate rates have been lowered by our engineered bacteria.:::2017
