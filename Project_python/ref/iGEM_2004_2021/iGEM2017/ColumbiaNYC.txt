ColumbiaNYC:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SilenshR: Bacteria-Mediated Oncogene Silencing as Living Cancer Therapeutic:::RNA interference (RNAi) therapies modulate endogenous gene expression in target cells through introduction of exogenous short interfering RNAs (siRNA) or their precursors, short hairpin RNAs (shRNA). Challenges for efficient and cell-specific RNAi therapies abound, like rapid renal clearance, degradation by serum nucleases, traversing the lipid bilayer and escape from the intracellular endosome. Bacteria innately colonize the hypoxic and immune-privileged cores of tumors and as such have been explored as potent delivery systems for RNAi-based cancer therapeutics. We are engineering an RNAi gene therapy, utilizing recombinant E. coli that invade mammalian cells and deliver an shRNA payload targeting the aberrantly expressed receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR and transcription factor c-Myc. Bacterial uptake by mammalian cells and endosomal breakdown are mediated by a quorum-inducible Invasin-HlyA operon. We are characterizing the circuit via gentamicin protection assays in vitro using HeLa and prostate cancer lines, and assessing target oncogene knockdown through flow cytometry and qRT-PCR.:::2017
