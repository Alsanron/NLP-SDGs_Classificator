Bordeaux:::Europe:::France:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Stargate WCC:::« Stargate WCC » is intended to control cell differenciation into muscular cells in the nematode C. elegans via a regulating mechanism using optogenetics and alternative splicing. We can obtain logical gates involving proteins from STAR family and the White Collar Complex which is a photoinducible system. At the same time, a bioinformatic part has been developed in connection with scientific project. This part is intended to create a workflow to streamline the study of the alternative splicing after the use of RNAseq technology. C.elegans is currently a great model used to study many diseases through foundational research. Our project strives to give necessary tools in biomedical research connected for example to stem cells therapy, bioprinting or research about genetic diseases.:::2017
