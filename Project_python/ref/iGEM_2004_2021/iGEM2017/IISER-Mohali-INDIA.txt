IISER-Mohali-INDIA:::Asia:::India:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::gEco: Paper based bio-synthetic system for detection and capture of noxious gases and phenolic compounds:::Pollution is a major problem worldwide and more severe in developing countries like India. According to WHO database, more than 80% of the people around the world are exposed to pollutants. These are measured by instruments like GC-FID, PTRMS which are costly and cumbersome to install. Therefore, alternative and cost effective approaches are required. So, we would like to develop a detector and capture system for pollutants by designing synthetic circuit in E. coli. For detecting and reducing/capturing salicylate, we designed a synthetic circuit and simulated it for its feasibility based upon kinetic equations. From simulation results, bacteria is showing color gradation from yellow to green on the basis of levels of salicylate present in the environment. We cloned a part of circuit for producing yellow color in bacteria. The cloning of other part for producing gradation of color and developing it as a paper based system is going on.:::2017
