Berlin_diagnostX:::Europe:::Germany:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Wormspotter - Applying Toehold Switch Technology to Tapeworm Diagnostics:::Infections with the pork tapeworm Taenia solium present without symptoms initially, but may cause severe long-term complications like blindness and epilepsy. The disease is endemic in rural Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Currently there is no suitable diagnostic screening test available to identify patients in need of treatment. We set out to develop such a test using toehold switches that generate a visible color reaction on a paper test-strip upon binding of specific tapeworm RNA. We have established SOPs to screen toehold switches using in silico design, nested PCR, and cell-free expression. First sensor candidates show positive results and we succeeded in immobilizing our detection system on paper strips. We have organized a conference with over 150 participants, providing a forum for leaders from academia, pharmaceutical companies, NGOs, and members of the German Parliament, to raise awareness about neglected tropical diseases and to win scientific and financial support.:::2017
