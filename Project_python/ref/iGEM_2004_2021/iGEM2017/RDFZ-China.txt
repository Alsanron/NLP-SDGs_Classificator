RDFZ-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Mobile Surfactant Factory – Combating Oil Spill With Engineered Bacillus subtilis:::Soil contamination due to crude oil causes environmental and health-related problems. Our project engineers Bacillus subtilis that function as surfactin producing units to remediate contaminated soils. Surfactin is a biosurfactant that can emulsify hydrophobic organic compounds and, in turn, enhance the biodegradation process. To synthesize and export surfactin more efficiently, we overexpress sfp, the 4’-phosphopantetheinyl-transferase, and YerP, a surfactin efflux pump. In addition, lmrA, a multidrug resistance transporter from Lactococcus lactis, is mutated and tested for higher surfactin specificity. We want our product to provide a greener and safer alternative to methods such as heat treatment and leaching. Biosurfactants and the introduction of Bacillus subtilis should have fewer impacts on soil microbiome, and should be more effective than relying on bioremediation alone. We hope that our project can contribute to the use of B. subtilis as a chassis in synthetic biology, and explore new methods of utilizing multi-drug resistance factors.:::2017
