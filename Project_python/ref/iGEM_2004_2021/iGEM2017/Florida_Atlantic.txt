Florida_Atlantic:::North America:::United States:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Welcome to the Machine: Developing a Novel Biosensor for Artemisinin:::Counterfeit drugs are one of the most serious problems in medicine. Not only do they prevent patients from receiving the treatment that they need, they are difficult for consumers to identify and can promote drug resistance. In order to address this problem, our team is developing a biosensor platform that can detect the presence of the antimalarial drug artemisinin. First, a genetic machine was devised that generates a large amount of protein and then rapidly lyses a cell, releasing that protein into solution. Then, a machine learning protocol was designed to determine if a protein can perform a specific function (in this case, bind artemisinin). Finally, a novel synthetic protein was added to the genetic machine to create a cheap, effective, and relatively foolproof biosensor. Because this system is not limited to artemisinin, it can be used to rapidly create a biosensor for different medications or compounds of interest.:::2017
