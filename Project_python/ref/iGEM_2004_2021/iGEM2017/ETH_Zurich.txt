ETH_Zurich:::Europe:::Switzerland:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CATE - Cancer-Targeting E. coli:::Treating cancer remains a challenge for modern medicine. Current treatments are often invasive, time-consuming and limited by toxic effects on healthy tissue. An ideal therapeutic should be effective, safe and targeted. We engineered a non-pathogenic strain of E. coli to approach this goal. The combination of autonomous targeting, visualization and externally controlled toxin release provides a novel non-invasive, quick and safe approach to treating cancer. Specifically, following intravenous administration, our E. coli preferentially populates solid tumors due to the properties of the tumor microenvironment. Intracellular accumulation of the cytotoxin azurin and the MRI contrast agent bacterioferritin is controlled by an AND gate which is activated once a population threshold is reached AND lactate, a tumor marker, is present. However, azurin release happens only if the physician confirms the correct localization of the bacteria via MRI and subsequently heats them via focused ultrasound, which activates a thermo-inducible cell lysis system.:::2017
