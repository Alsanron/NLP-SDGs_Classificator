Cornell:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Oxyponics:::Hydroponics is a rapidly growing area of agriculture that is projected to be a $400 million market by 2020. Despite its potential, hydroponics farmers face low crop yields due to diseases and nutrient imbalances. It is well-documented that a sufficient level of oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species (ROS) is necessary for and can enhance crop growth. To that end, Cornell iGEM developed a novel redox biosensor in E. coli that uses a redox-sensitive fluorescent protein reporter to couple an optogenetic transcriptional circuit to an external optics system. In addition to offering enhanced sensitivity to ROS, this system optimizes oxidative stress by controlling redox-sensitive transcriptional responses with greater precision through an external LED. We believe that this will be promising platform to overcome the drawbacks of hydroponics with potential applications in general agriculture.:::2017
