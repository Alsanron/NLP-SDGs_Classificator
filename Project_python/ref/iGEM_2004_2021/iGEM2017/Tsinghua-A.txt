Tsinghua-A:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.coli War:::During a war, what makes one side outcompete the other? Is it the more powerful weapons, more sufficient logistic supply or better cooperation and communication? Our bacteria can tell! Here we devise an interesting interactive system with E.coli from different ‘sides’, with each of them incorporated with functionally independent roles including warrior, farmer and beggar, based on certain gene circuit and the mechanism of quorum sensing. By combining experimenting and modeling, we monitor the ratio and capability of each category of individuals to obtain the factors to facilitate the victory of a group. With our efforts to explore synthetic biology as our tool, more ecological rules will be tested and more stories about inter- and inner-species cooperation and competition will be uncovered. From these, we can have a better understanding at the rules of competition or ‘warfare’ in the ecosystem as well as in the human society.:::2017
