CIEI-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Terminator of food waste:::Disposal of food waste is a huge concern in the society. Improper disposal brings serious pollution and causes tremendous nutrition loss. Considering the high salt concentration in food waste, which greatly influences the efficiency when we use microbes to decompose the waste, our team aims to transfer salt resistant genes into the functional microbes. In this research, we decided to modify the yeast, specifically saccharomycetes cerevisiae, by inserting the E.coli glutamate synthase (gltB) gene and trehalose synthesis related genes (ScTPS1 and SpTPS1) into it, to make the yeast not only decompose the food waste efficiently but resist high salinity. These genes help produce small molecular substances (glutamate and trehalose), which enable the cells to automatically adjust the osmotic pressure in high salinity environments. In this way, we can better take care of the troublesome food waste in a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly way.:::2017
