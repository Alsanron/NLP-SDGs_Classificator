Wageningen_UR:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mantis: Modular antigen-based test for infectious diseases:::Over the last two decades epidemics of infectious diseases have caused major harm to the world population. These outbreaks often originate from developing countries, where diagnosis can be problematic. The Mantis project aims to detect antigens in blood samples of patients using an in vivo bacterial system, allowing for efficient diagnosis even in rural areas. Mantis is fast, robust, modular, and requires little equipment. Moreover, the whole-cell system allows for more affordable production and longer storage compared to current systems. Detection is based on affinity bodies, an antibody mimetic that can be produced by bacteria. Through rational design, the system can be adapted to detect a wide range of pathogens. The addition of the affinity body to a bacterial receptor will rapidly generate a clear fluorescent signal, measured by our portable, 3D-printed diagnostic device directly in the field. This way, Mantis will help diseases come to light.:::2017
