SJTU-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BAT: BiobrickAssist Technology, a search & evaluation engine for biobricks:::As many accessable biobricks are not well annotated or documented even on some official sites, researchers especially novices are hard to find biobricks of high quality. Thus we have developed a web application named BAT(BiobrickAssist Technology) with Node.js. BAT mainly functions as a search and evaluation engine for biobricks. We are aimed to create a platform for researchers to learn and evaluate. Based on our work in 2016, BAT can do evaluation at different levels and evaluate completely new biobricks, and this year we do some optimization for the scoring algorithm. Users may search biobricks by categories, submission time etc. Considering the auto-evaluation may not be perfect all the time, we have been developing a small but useful community like Q/A for users to manually select best biobricks. If a researcher has used a biobrick, he(she) can score it on our site and leave a short comment.:::2017
