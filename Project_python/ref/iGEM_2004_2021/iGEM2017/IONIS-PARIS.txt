IONIS-PARIS:::Europe:::France:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SofterShock : a thermo-adaptive solution for fighting extreme climatic conditions on crops:::Recently displaced from its leading position among global wine producers with a 12% recession last year, France suffers from climate changes and their negative impacts on vineyards. The appearance of extreme temperature events threatens the agricultural economy and farmers have to deal with the unsatisfactory current solutions. Using synthetic biology, we are developing a thermo-adaptive biological product “SofterShock” for protecting grapevines against climatic hazards. We are engineering a microorganism to make it respond differently according to the temperatures. Below 15°C, anti-freeze proteins will prevent ice-crystal growth and above 37°C, light-reflecting compounds will limit evapotranspiration. Once applied on crops, our solution will possess a double protection: anti-drought and anti-frost. We elaborate a “killswitch” strategy to limit microorganism dissemination and DNA transfer. In order to not alter plant biodiversity or wine characteristics, we will select the best chassis to combine with novel properties and bring an innovative approach to global crop protection.:::2017
