Mingdao:::Asia:::Taiwan:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Sugar Crush — Probiotic-based glucose retrieval system::: According to research, in 2015, about 7 adults in 10 suffer the problem of overweight or even obesity, and it is expected that more people are going to get into this kind of unhealthy problem. One of the most major factors that lead to obesity is “sugar”, which could be easily found in beverages, dessert, and almost any kind of food. Thus, it is quite difficult not to absorb too much amount of sugar in our daily lives. In hope of preventing our bodies from absorbing too much glucose, our team aims to engineer bacteria that absorb glucose more efficiently. Our team constructed glucose active transporters on the membrane of E.coli, enabling the glucose uptake to become faster than intestine cells. On the other hand, our team has designed a suicide circuit ensuring the bacteria don’t absorb all the sugar and the body can get adequate amount of sugar.:::2017
