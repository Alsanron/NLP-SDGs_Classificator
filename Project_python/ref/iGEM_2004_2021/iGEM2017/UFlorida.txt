UFlorida:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Tryptophol Synthesis for Mitigating Amphibian Chytridiomycosis:::Amphibian populations worldwide are threatened by the disease Chytridiomycosis, which is caused by the aquatic fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Chytridiomycosis often leads to death; however, a few species of amphibians are resistant to the Chytridiomycosis infection. The resistance is conferred by symbiotic bacteria present on their skin that produce antifungal metabolites. The UFlorida iGEM team seeks to develop a new treatment for Chytridiomycosis based on these antifungal metabolites. One such antifungal compound, tryptophol, has been shown to be effective at combating Bd at low doses. Tryptophan is converted to tryptophol by three enzymes, Aromatic Amino Acid Aminotransferase II, 2-oxo Acid Decarboxylase, and Alcohol Dehydrogenase I. Our team modified E.coli with the genes comprising the pathway for tryptophol synthesis. The UFlorida team expects to demonstrate that the tryptophol from the genetically modified E. coli will show antifungal activity against the Chytridiomycota family as an antifungal treatment for amphibians.:::2017
