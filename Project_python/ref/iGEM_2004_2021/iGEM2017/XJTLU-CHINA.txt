XJTLU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Grenadier Guards —— using antimicrobial peptides to fight against Staphylococcus aureus:::Staphylococcus aureus develops resistance to various antibiotics and becomes increasingly difficult to be eliminated due to antibiotic overuse. Patients with intestinal S. aureus colonization tend to suffer from fecal incontinence, diarrhea and so on. Hence, our project aims to make the most of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which have a reputation for their efficient antimicrobial activity against bacteria, as new therapeutics. We genetically engineer Lactococcus lactis (Grenadier Guards) to closely detect the presence of S. aureus and throw AMPs (grenades) to eradicate them within a short time after infection. The mechanism includes utilizing the S. aureus’s own quorum sensing system as a sensor, or using the cells’ osmoregulatory system to control the expression of the AMP genes in tandem repeats, which can produce a relatively high quantity level, subsequently Lactococcus lactis will undergo autolysis controlled by a toggle switch to release AMPs to attack S. aureus, thus relieving the symptoms.:::2017
