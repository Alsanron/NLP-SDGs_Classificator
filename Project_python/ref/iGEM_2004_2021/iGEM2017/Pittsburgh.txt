Pittsburgh:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Droving with Dronpa: Rapid, Reversible Control of Escherichia Coli Motility Using Light:::Real-time controllable nanorobots are an attractive goal of engineering and robotics. However, current nanorobots are limited by the precision of control: most utilize magnetic or electric field based steering. Yet, light-based control through laser technology, offers precise spatial resolution at the diffraction limit. We seek to modify the chemotactic machinery of E. coli by modulating the activity of the critical chemotaxis protein CheY. The GFP-related protein Dronpa has been demonstrated to reversibly block kinase activity through light-induced dimerization [Science 2017, 355, 836-842]. Our team has designed a novel Dronpa-CheY fusion protein to precisely control the movement of E. coli with different wavelengths of light. Since Dronpa controls CheY activity directly, the effects after exposure to light will be rapid, compared to cases controlled by gene regulation. The control of E. coli that can be precisely ‘driven’ on the micrometer-scale may revolutionize targeted medical treatment, bioanalytical sensing, and nanomanufacturing.:::2017
