Harvard:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Optimizing Curli Fiber Production as a Scalable Materials Manufacturing Platform:::Curli fibers, the main proteinaceous component in E. coli biofilms, polymerize extracellularly to form a macroscopic agglomeration of material when isolated in sufficient bulk. It has been demonstrated that functional peptide domains can be fused to the self-polymerizing units of curli to form a variety of functional materials. Thus, curli fibers present a promising platform for the scalable production of programmable materials. Our project focuses on optimizing curli production on two fronts. First, we aim to increase curli export efficiency by optimizing the stoichiometric ratio of proteins involved in the curli pathway. Second, we aim to optimize the conditions for protein-producing cell cultures by growing them in a bioreactor. Our work along these two lines will inform the further development of the curli system as a feasible biosynthetic platform for producing materials at industrially relevant yields.:::2017
