BGIC-Union:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::dCasentry - A guardian against Lung cancer:::Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The technique of liquid biopsy is much better than the popular biopsy as it obviates pain and complication incurred to patients by detecting various tumor markup, including short strand circulating tumor DNA (CtDNA) in the blood. However, it still requires laboratory apparatus such as PCR instrument.Thus, our project uses paired dCas9 protein links with split T7 RNA polymerase, guided by SgRNA to carry out the procedure. DCasentry not only deals with low CtDNA concentration in blood but also capable of producing various kinds of signal output. We adopt freeze-dried paper chip as our vector of detecting system to simplify its operation as well as storage. The product will be presented as a kit containing all items necessary for detection and can be widely use on the medical field.:::2017
