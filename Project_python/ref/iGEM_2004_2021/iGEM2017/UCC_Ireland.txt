UCC_Ireland:::Europe:::Ireland:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MOOnshine; biosensors for antibiotics and methanol:::To ensure consumer safety, all processed food and beverages are subject to rigorous testing for contaminants that are hazardous to human health. This testing can be expensive, inaccessible and time-consuming. Since these sophisticated tests are often limited to large-scale producers, local dairy farmers, microbreweries and home-brewers remain vulnerable to penalties and poisoning should the level of contaminants in their products fall outside the regulatory guidelines. Our iGEM project aims to create a biosensor, specifically to detect antibiotic residues in milk and methanol in alcohol. The universal readout will incorporate a blue chromoprotein, AmilCP, which will correlate with the concentration of the contaminant and be quantified with a portable colourimetric device linked to smartphones. A cell-free system will be utilised to circumvent the risks associated with the use of genetically-modified live bacteria outside the laboratory.:::2017
