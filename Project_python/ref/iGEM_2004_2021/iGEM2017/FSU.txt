FSU:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bartii: Cell-Based Therapy for Celiac Disease:::Celiac Disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that affects approximately 75,000,000 people around the world. The disease is triggered by the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat. Common symptoms are abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and malnutrition. The current practice for treating Celiac Disease is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. Gluten-free diets are difficult to maintain, diminish the quality of life of CD patients, and on average are 242% more expensive than diets that contain gluten. We are proposing a new approach in the prevention and management of CD where patients are able to enjoy foods that contain gluten through population of the gut with engineered therapeutic cells. The cells will be able to: 1) Degrade gliadin, a peptide in gluten that elicits an inflammatory response 2) Sequester gliadin by binding it to the surface of the therapeutic cells 3) Sequester zonulin, a hormone responsible for enhancing inflammation.:::2017
