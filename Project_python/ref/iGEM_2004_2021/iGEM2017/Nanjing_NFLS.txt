Nanjing_NFLS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Fortified Aniline Killer - the Identification, Recombination, and Verification of Aniline Compound Degradation Genes:::The biodegradation solution to toxic substances in the environment has received general consent and considerable attention. Our project aims at the biodegradation of toxic aniline and its compounds (a type of chemical raw material and the intermediate metabolite of aniline herbicides). Currently the spectrum for aniline biodegradation genes is too narrow to effectively recover polluted soil and waterbody environments. Based on previously discovered relevant genes, we attempt to search for crucial genes for aniline degradation in Acinetobacter sp. strain YAA, and perform gene recombination and expression, meanwhile construct recombinant genetic engineering bacteria, and test the bioremediation effects in contaminated waterbodies and soil samples. Results show that recombined target gene could efficiently express in E. coli, and that the engineered bacteria acquired from three-parent hybridization express a wider range of substrate spectrum, thus laying the foundation for further bioremediation research.:::2017
