HBUT-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Nickel Hunter: a biosensor that detects nickel ions in the natural environment:::China is the world's largest producer and consumer of nickel ions. However, nickel and its compounds are one of the primary pollutants in China. They mainly derive from electroplating, nickel metal processing and battery manufacturing. Nickel and its compounds released from the industry have detrimental effects on the environment and hence threaten human health. Therefore, nickel is one of the heavy metals that are often monitored in the environment and food chains. The traditional nickel detecting method is to implement chemical measurement of nickel-containing samples in the laboratory, which is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to operate. Thus, we expect to create a cheap, user-friendly E. coli biosensor, a type of bacterium that produces fluorescence protein when it detects nickel ions in the environment. Consequently, we can find out the amount of nickel ions existing in a certain environment by examining the intensity of fluorescence produced by the probing bacteria.:::2017
