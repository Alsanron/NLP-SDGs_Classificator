REC-CHENNAI:::Asia:::India:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Latarcoli: A knight on guard against food pathogens:::The rise of the super bugs poses an imminent threat that looms large for the very existence of humanity, catching us off guard and weaving the web of extensive antibiotic resistance. Antimicrobial peptides have found a meteoric acclamation amongst research scientists owing to their lineament of resisting the resilience of bacteria. Latarcins are antimicrobial peptides found in spider venom. Latarcin-2a(M-Zodatoxin) is a 26 amino acid, highly cationic peptide that lyses microbes via a discrete, membrane-specific carpet mechanism. A proposed mutation to its native form eliminates its existing haemolytic and cytolytic activity thus rendering it innocuous to humans. In an attempt to overcome the lethal effects of Latarcin on our chassis itself, a quorum sensing mechanism will be incorporated into our host. Having identified a niche in the food preservative sector, we plan to enclose this engineered strain in a food wrapper to extend the shelf life of food.:::2017
