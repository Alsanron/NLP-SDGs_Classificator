OUC-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A bottle of algae Wine:::Algae Outbreak is a serious marine disaster for ocean life, which threatens economic interests and health of human. The periodically outbreak of Enteromorpha on the coastline has been a stubborn environmental problem in ShanDong, China. Here, we aim to utilize the cellobiose and xylose from waste algae and turn them into ethanol as healthy and tasty algae wine with resveratrol. Additionally, we achieved a new synthetic biology platform for artificial interspecific cooperation. E.coli and S. cerevisiae are engineered to organize together as multi-cell device. The co-cultured E. coli works as surface-display system of S. cerevisiae for enhancing its biological function. Simultaneously, we built a mini transcriptional unit of standardized promoters and terminators with concise structure in Yeast, providing more potential for large-scale SynBio operations. Our project can contribute to local environmental issue and enrich synthetic biology toolbox by novel interspecific cooperation platform and transcription regulatory elements.:::2017
