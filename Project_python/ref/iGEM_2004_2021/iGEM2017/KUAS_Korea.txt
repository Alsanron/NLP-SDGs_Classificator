A stool analysis is a cheap and useful pre-diagnostic tool for many human diseases by chemical and biological examinations of daily stools. For instance, the colon cancer can be pre-screened by checking the presence of occult blood in feces. However, the procedure of collecting samples and delivering it to the laboratory often makes people cumbersome and therefore causes a delay of the examination. This year at iGEM, team KUAS_Korea presents ‘POO-robiotics’, a do-it-yourself (DIY) stool analysis at home. We employ Lactobacillus plantarum L67 as a chassis, a probiotic with antiallergic activity and used as a yogurt starter. The designed genetic circuit will convert bowel conditions into color pigments. As a proof of concept, we focused on the screening of occult blood, pH variation, and bile salt residues. After ingesting our ‘POO-robiotics’, individuals can identify their own bowel conditions at home by simply checking the color of their feces.:::2017
