SDU_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cancer Slayer â”€ An invincible opponent of PD-L1:::Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death among the world with low overall survival rate. In NSCLC, immunotherapy has been indicated as a potential therapy for treating in situ solid tumor. Previous research has indicated that tumor cells can express programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1) to diminish T-cell effector functions and therefore to achieve immune escape. In our project, gene edition will be incorporated with immunotherapy to eradicate the immune escape occurred in NSCLC. By constructing plasmid with Crispr-Cas 9 system targeting the gene coding for PD-L1, the expression of PD-L1 will be inhibited to restore immune system supervision. To ensure the biosafety, another plasmid with Crsipr-Cas 9 system to cut off the housekeeping gene of two plasmids will be also constructed to suicide both plasmids when PD-L1 expression was not detectable. Better therapeutic effects of immunotherapy to conquer the NSCLC are hoped to be achieved.:::2017
