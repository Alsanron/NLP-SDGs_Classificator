NTNU_Trondheim:::Europe:::Norway:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Phage Age: Combating antibiotic resistant bacteria through bacteriophage mutation and selection:::Antibiotic resistance is poised to become one of the greatest dangers of our time. Widespread overuse of antibiotics coupled with minimal investment in new treatments have allowed pathogenic bacteria to develop resistances to many antibiotics. Our team sought to develop a platform that utilizes genetically modified E. coli DH5Î± to quickly evolve bacteriophages (phages). These phages should be capable of infecting the target bacteria in our coupled chemostat system. We have created a cheap, fast and simple system as well as a mathematical model for understanding its regulation. Photosensors capable of measuring real-time concentration of bacteria and phages were constructed. A plasmid to increase the mutation rate of host bacteria and thus also of invasive phages was designed. Additionally, a protocol for selecting and purifying phages from environmental samples has been developed by our team.:::2017
