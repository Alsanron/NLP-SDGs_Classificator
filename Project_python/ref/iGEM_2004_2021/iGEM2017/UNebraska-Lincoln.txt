UNebraska-Lincoln:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering E. coli to Reduce Methane Emissions in Cattle:::The excessive production of methane by cattle is harmful to both the environment and the cattle industry. The reduction of nitrate to nitrite by the rumen microbiota has been shown to compete with the methanogenesis process for hydrogen. Nitrate is an effective feed additive, but in large quantities it causes nitrate poisoning. To combat this we have engineered E. coli to express a nitrite reductase protein. When introduced into the cows' gut microbiome, it will make the cows resistant to nitrate poisoning. Seaweed has also been found to effectively reduce methane emissions when used as a cattle feed supplement. Bromoform was found to be the compound in seaweed that inhibits methanogenesis. We studied the possibility of producing bromoform directly in the cowsâ€™ gut by engineering E. coli to produce a bromoperoxidase enzyme. In further efforts we hope to replace recurring feed additive purchases with a one-time inoculation of food-grade bacteria.:::2017
