Currently, the control of the insulin market by a few large pharmaceutical companies has kept insulin prices very high, beyond the reach of many around the world who rely on insulin for survival. This year, the University of Sydney iGEM team aims to address this problem of worldwide insulin inaccessibility. Our project involves using synthetic biology to develop an insulin manufacturing system that is cost efficient and simple, using the bacterial species Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. We plan to have these microbes express proinsulin, the native human insulin, as well as our own newly designed open-source single-chain insulin, which we named ‘Winsulin’. We hope to develop a novel, cost efficient, and optimised pipeline for the production of proinsulin and Winsulin - a small step in making insulin affordable for all.:::2017
