Chalmers-Gothenburg:::Europe:::Sweden:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BREATHtaking:::Lung cancer is the cancer form with the highest death toll. Late occurring symptoms and limited expensive detection methods leads to late detection of the disease, which is the most important reason to the high death toll. Specific Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC)s are molecules that have been found in the breath of lung cancer patients. In our project we are creating a biosensor for two of these VOCs. Receptors natively present in the membrane of yeast are replaced with xenogeneic receptors that are able to recognize the VOCs. When the VOCs are sensed the pheromone pathway is initiated and a detection system triggered, ultimately leading to that the yeast cells turns red through interruption of the ADE2 gene. The goal of this project is to create a simple, cheap and harmless method enabling detection of lung cancer in an early stage, leading to more lives being saved.:::2017
