WHU-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Wow(WHU-iGEM operate wastewater)——biodegradation of halogenated phenol in wastewater:::Widely used in agriculture and various industries, synthetic phenolic compounds commonly exist in wastewater and have been troublesome in wastewater treatment due to their remarkable stability and acute toxicity. They can accumulate through food chains and serve as mutagens and carcinogens to people and other organisms. Among them, halogenated phenolic compounds are notablely more toxic and less bio-degradable. Even when the number of halogen atoms increases, the toxicity of the whole molecule is raised as well . To deal with this serious problem, our team aims to construct a Hybrid Membrane Bioreactor to assist the degradation of halogenated phenolic compounds in wastewater. In this device, we intend to apply an engineered Bacillus megaterium which can mainly express an original reductive dehalogenase RdhANP. And we will also make some genetic changes on this B. megaterium to scale up its efficiency in treating the wastewater containing halogenated phenols.:::2017
