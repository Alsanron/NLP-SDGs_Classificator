NYU_Abu_Dhabi:::Asia:::United Arab Emirates:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. coLAMP: A portable device for rapid detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli:::Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is one of the leading causes of food-borne illnesses. Shiga toxinâ€™s mode of action involves the inhibition of protein synthesis, consequently leading to cell death. While most countries have stringent food safety regulations to prevent the sale of contaminated foods, small scale manufacturers often do not have the access, time, or resources to ensure the safety of their food. Therefore, the aim of this project was to design a cost-effective, portable device that can readily detect the presence of STEC. The device functions by lysing the bacterial cell wall and amplifying a STEC-specific gene sequence using loop-mediated isothermal amplification. It is envisioned that the use of this device in the developing world would be an effective means of reducing the incidence of food-borne illnesses.:::2017
