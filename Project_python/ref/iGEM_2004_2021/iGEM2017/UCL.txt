UCL:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Light Induced Technologies (LIT): Advancing the Optical Control of Cellular Mechanisms:::We are developing optogenetic tools to improve two areas of human life: architecture and regenerative medicine. In contrast to current mechanical and chemical methods for gene control, our light-based strategies allow for the precise spatiotemporal and non-invasive control of complex gene circuits. To minimize the usage of electricity for illumination and fossil fuels for building materials, we are testing the feasibility of optogenetics to provide an eco-friendly and sustainable alternative. We are engineering bacterial cells that i) control their bioluminescence in response to day/night cycles and ii) can be directed by light to form physical structures out of biodegradable plastic. Additionally, to address the scalability and speed issues in tissue engineering, we are developing an optical guidance system for inter-cell adhesion and directed gene expression of mammalian cells for tissue generation. This will enable fast in situ cell adhesion for tissue-specific organ healing.:::2017
