TNCR_Korea:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Transformation of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4(DPP-4) to Intestinal Gut Microflora: A possible alternative of â€œGluten-free Diet":::Gluten-related disorders, including celiac disease(CD) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, are found worldwide. Currently available therapy for CD patients, permanent gluten-free diet(GFD), has drawbacks of restricted nutrition and lifelong remission. Thus, we considered a non-dietary therapy that utilizes synthetic biology targeting the gut microflora. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4(DPP-4) gene, which is known to decompose the gluten, was inserted to the iGEM provided vectors through infusion cloning based on the 3A Assembly method. Western blot analysis using Flag-tag was conducted to verify the expression of the target gene. Because excessive expression of DPP-4 may induce stress and inflammation, we added Anderson promoter that differentially regulates gene expression in three levels to achieve optimal expression of DPP-4 of an individual. The transformed dominant gut bacteria can be embedded into a bacteria-favorable yogurt for the subsequent probiotic administration. This study proposes a potential novel treatment of gluten-related disorders through recombinant gut bacteria:::2017
