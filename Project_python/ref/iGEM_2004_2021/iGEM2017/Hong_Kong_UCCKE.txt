Gout is formed due to uric acid crystallizes and accumulated at synovial fluid. Thus, we wish to develop a rapid detection method to confirm whether he is suffering from gout by measuring the concentration of uric acid in their blood. The cure or relieve gout by preventing the increase of uric acid concentration to a certain threshold is also in progress. Several parts have been designed to achieve the above goals. Assays are also designed to test and demonstrate the sensing or curing ability of our parts.:::2017
