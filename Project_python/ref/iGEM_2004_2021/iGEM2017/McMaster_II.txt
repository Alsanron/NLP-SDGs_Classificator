McMaster_II:::North America:::Canada:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::C12 Mediated Cancer Treatment: Dual Functionality as a Cytotoxic and Signalling Agent:::Current chemotherapeutic agents trigger apoptosis non-specifically and induce cell death within healthy tissues. We propose a novel therapeutic using a bacterial vector that expresses acyl-homoserine lactone C12, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa signalling molecule known to induce cancer cell apoptosis through a Bcl-2 independent pathway. Upon detection of hypoxia and low pH, known tumour microenvironment markers, C12 will be released by the bacteria containing our genetically engineered circuit to act as: (1) a cytotoxic agent that induces cancer cell death, and (2) a signalling molecule that coordinates actions between bacterial colonies. Furthermore, the quorum sensing properties of C12 have been manipulated to activate a kill mechanism that arrests bacterial growth upon destruction of the tumour and the ensuing loss of its microenvironment. Thus, we propose constructing a genetic circuit that not only removes tumours, but also self-regulates itself to mitigate the risk of bacterial infection in the absence of cancerous cells.:::2017
