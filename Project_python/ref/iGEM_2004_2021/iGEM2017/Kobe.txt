Kobe:::Asia:::Japan:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Tea Ceremony Master Bug: Evaluating Tea Quality with a Biosensor for L-theanine:::The aim of our project is to create a biosensor for evaluating the concentration of L-theanine. Theanine is an amino acid primarily found in particular plants, especially in tea plant (Camellia sinensis). Theanine boosts alpha brain waves, promoting relaxation. In addition, theanine is one of the taste ingredients of green tea, which is called as “umami” in Japanese, meaning pleasant savory taste. For these reasons, green tea containing the more theanine is considered to have the higher quality. Currently, the theanine content in green tea is measured by instrumental analysis depending on the expensive equipment. To reduce the cost and special technique required for the measurement, we aimed at developing a bacterial sensor to evaluate the theanine content in green tea based on identification of the genes in Bacillus subtillis that are induced in the presence of theanine.:::2017
