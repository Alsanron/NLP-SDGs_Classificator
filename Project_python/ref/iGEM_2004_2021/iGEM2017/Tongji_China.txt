Tongji_China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A new use of UAS/Gal4 system for pest control:::The spread of many diseases is related to mosquitoes, such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, which pose a threat to human health. And many pests also have a negative impact on agricultural production. Our project is focusing on addressing the growing number of pest-induced disasters and outbreaks by changing sexual orientation. We use Drosophila melanogaster as chassis organisms, and use the classic UAS/Gal4 system to regulate this character. Whatâ€™s more, we also build models to simulate the effects. Compared to other traditional ways, this method is heritable and continuable, and causes less impact on the ecosystem. In addition, the gene will be activated in summer, when pests thrived. We hope that our project will provide a new way to solve the problems caused by pest.:::2017
