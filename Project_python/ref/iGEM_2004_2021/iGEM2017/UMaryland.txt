UMaryland:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::An Apeeling Solution to Panama Disease In Bananas:::Panama disease, caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, poses a major threat to the world's banana population. Experts confirm that the most common banana cultivar could be wiped out, resulting in major agricultural and economic consequences. Our goal is to combat F. oxysporum with transgenic bacteria that sense fusaric acid, a toxin released by F. oxysporum, and respond by producing and secreting thaumatin like protein (TLP), an antifungal agent found in plants. Transferring the final genetic circuitry to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, a symbiont associated with the roots of the banana plant, will provide a soil additive capable of protecting banana crops from this threatening disease. This system can be tuned with a Cas9 mutagenesis screening method we developed. Finally, to increase awareness of the role of synthetic biology in protecting food and water, we fabricated an inexpensive “lab-in-a-box” system suitable for high schools along with a bacterial based metal detection system.:::2017
