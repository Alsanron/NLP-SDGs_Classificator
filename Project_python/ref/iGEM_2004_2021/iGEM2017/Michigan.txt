Michigan:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Thermolyze: A Temperature Controlled Kill-Switch for Containment of Pathogenic Bacteria in Research Labs:::Genetically modified and/or pathogenic bacteria used in research pose a concern to the public due to the potential consequences if they escape into the environment. Efforts to address this have led to the design of bacterial kill switches: biocontainment systems pairing environmental sensing mechanisms with circuit-based control of viability. Though successful switches exist, most require specific molecular signaling mechanisms, limiting their use. We designed a temperature-controlled kill switch activated below 34C using the temperature-dependent repressor TlpA36. Bacteria are lysed by constitutively expressed holin and endolysin unless counteracted by antiholin, which is under the control of TlpA36 and therefore only expressed in a narrow temperature range. This system should function with any gram-negative bacteria. We implemented our switch in E. coli as proof of concept. Promoters of varying strengths were tested to fine-tune the time until lysis, giving researchers a buffer period to work with cells at low temperatures.:::2017
