WLC-Milwaukee:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Phage Gauge: A novel method of detecting Escherichia coli in contaminated water.:::Escherichia coli infection is a common problem when water resources such as drinking water, beaches, or irrigation systems are contaminated with human waste. Infections by these bacteria can lead to severe gastrointestinal problems and even death if left untreated. Therefore, it is necessary to have water testing methods that can rapidly and accurately determine whether water sources contain these harmful pathogens. The WLC-iGEM team is working on developing a water testing kit that provides fast and accurate results using components of the Lambda Phage tail that are specific for their target bacteria. These bacteriophage tail components have been cloned and will be purified. By attaching a horseradish peroxidase enzyme (that will produce color when a substrate is added) to these bacteriophage components, E. coli should be able to be detected when present in a water sample. The high specificity and high concentration of bacteriophages should provide accurate and rapid results.:::2017
