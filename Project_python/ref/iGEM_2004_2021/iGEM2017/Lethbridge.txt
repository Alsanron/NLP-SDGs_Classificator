Lethbridge:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Next vivo: Cell-Free Synthetic Biology for the Masses:::We aim to develop a standardized, modular, and open-source ex vivo transcription and translation (TX/TL) system available for research and teaching communities worldwide. Ex vivo systems provide several advantages to cell-based platforms, including: simple input and output, non-proliferation, precise control of molecular interactions, and incorporation of unnatural amino acids. Thus, ex vivo systems are highly useful tools in making synthetic biology accessible to novices, providing enthusiasts with inexpensive cell-free synthesis, and empowering experts with modular control over robust expression systems. With our end-users in mind, we have designed, modelled, and built a plasmid-based multi-protein parts collection for the stoichiometric expression of all required biomachinery for coupled TX/TL reactions, as well as a novel purification method that makes these parts readily available from an inexpensive single-step elution. Lastly, we have created a software tool to preempt biosecurity challenges associated with genetic recoding in ex vivo systems.:::2017
