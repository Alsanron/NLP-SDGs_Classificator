iTesla-SoundBio:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Community Lab:::Accepted:::Eliminating PCB pollution in the Puget Sound by genetically modifying E. coli:::Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of man-made organic chlorine contaminants. Although their manufacture has been banned, they remain in the environment today. PCBs are probable carcinogens and toxic; cause immune system and thyroid defects; and its biomagnification up the food chain in the Puget Sound has been particularly detrimental to orcas. Though they persist because they are highly nonreactive, it has been known for several decades that PCBs slowly degrade in the environment. Recently, it was discovered that the bacterium Dehalococcoides mccartyi can break them down with a variety of enzymes, the genes for which were sequenced in 2014 by Wang. However, D. maccartyi is anaerobic and obtains energy through organohalide respiration. We planned to transform these genes into easier-to-work-with E. coli for potential PCB cleanup operations. The end goal was a process using the produced enzymes or technology containing the genetic pathway for use in PCB clean-up operations.:::2017
