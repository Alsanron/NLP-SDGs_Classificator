UESTC-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Tobacco. Degradation. TCP.:::1,2,3-Trichloropropane (TCP) is a new organic pollutant which has been introduced into our environment as a consequence of industrial waste disposal and widespread open use in agriculture.It's reported that TCP is intended to be pathogenic,carcinogenic and quite persistent in environment.To solve the pollution of TCP,the predecessors have tried to carry out TCP degradation by using E.coli and immobilized enzymes.Although its degradation efficiency is pretty high,long-term sustained environmental remediation outcomes couldn't be achieved.So as to solving this problem,this year we choose tobacco to design a phytoremediation system for TCP. Three kind of enzymes,DhaA in Rhodococcus sp, HheC and EchA derived from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1,are transformed into tobacco to degrade the TCP into non-toxic and harmless glycerin in the soil and sewage,and to achieve the sustained environmental remediation.:::2017
