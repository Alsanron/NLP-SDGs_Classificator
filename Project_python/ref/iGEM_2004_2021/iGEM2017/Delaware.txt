Delaware:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Narrow Spectrum Bacteriocins as Targeted Gut Microbiome Therapeutics:::The gut microbiome is an exciting field of research that has increased exponentially across the past few years. Many studies have found a correlation between imbalances in the gut microbiome and disease states. Can altering the gut microbiome at all change disease state? In order to evaluate this question, methods are currently needed that can allow researchers to make targeted manipulations to modulate the populations of specific microbes within a microbiome. The goal of our project is to overexpress bacteriocin genes (toxins that bacteria produce that affect other bacteria) in E. coli. The rationale for our methodology this year is to answer questions similar to "how much of a specific bacteriocin is needed to reduce the abundance of a single microbe by 60%?" Our intention is to generate data that will be used in computational modeling and future experimental projects towards developing gut microbiome therapeutics.:::2017
