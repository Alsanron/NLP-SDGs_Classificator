BostonU:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Using Toehold Switches to Drive Recombinase-Based Logic:::The presence of specific RNAs in cells can be indicative of their state. Detecting these RNAs on a small scale allows for identification of viruses such as Zika and Ebola, however measuring larger sets of RNA remains complex. Current methods of RNA detection are time consuming and require expensive machinery and technical expertise. Toehold switches, biological devices that drive the expression of a gene when activated by trigger RNA, present an alternative with high specificity, wide dynamic range, and ease of use. We present a platform whereby trigger RNAs activate toeholds and induce recombinase expression, driving downstream genetic logic. We integrate this RNA-inducible logic within a cell-free transcription translation system to reduce the experimental burden on time and supplies. This work serves to establish functionality of RNA-inducible logic in a cell-free system, and provides a platform for future implementation in applications that require detection of multiple RNAs, including disease diagnostics.:::2017
