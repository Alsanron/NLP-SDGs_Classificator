Caused by the parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, it is endemic to much of Latin America. Chagas disease claims over 12,000 lives per year, yet remains difficult to diagnose in its treatable acute phase. Existing diagnostics require highly-trained personnel and expensive equipment. Our solution is to develop an accurate, low cost, and portable cell-free diagnostic kit that detects the presence of cruzipain, a protease specific to T. cruzi. We have developed, modelled, and tested two designs: (i) a cell-free DNA circuit-based diagnostic utilising the TetR repressor system and (ii) a protein-based outer membrane vesicle (OMV) diagnostic using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system for localisation of our parts to the outer membrane and a split-protease-based protein circuit to amplify the signal. We believe this method will be applicable to numerous pathogens with specific proteases.:::2017
