McMasterU:::North America:::Canada:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::An RNA-cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme probe for simple detection of bacterial pathogens:::Current point-of-care diagnostics for bacterial infections are costly, time-consuming, and offer limited strain specificity. These challenges contribute to improper antibiotic usage, accelerating the propagation of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria. We are developing DNAzymes - catalytically active ssDNA generated via in vitro selection - to serve as inexpensive and sensitive probes for the rapid detection of AMR bacteria. In the presence of targeted strains, the DNAzyme cleaves a fluorophore-RNA-quencher motif at the RNA site, generating fluorescence. As a proof-of-concept, we have adapted a known E. coli K12 DNAzyme for use in a plate-based assay, and are generating a novel DNAzyme to detect resistant strains of C. difficile. Simultaneously, we are leveraging machine learning techniques to predict potential DNAzymes, and are developing kinetic models to describe DNAzyme behaviour. Our project addresses the need for novel approaches within AMR detection and active antimicrobial stewardship â€“ issues widely recognized by the experts in this field.:::2017
