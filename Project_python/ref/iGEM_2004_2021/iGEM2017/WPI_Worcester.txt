WPI_Worcester:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Go(a)t Lead? Bacterial Detection and Bioremediation of Lead Contamination in Drinking Water:::Lead contamination in drinking water is a major problem across the U.S. Our project aims to improve lead testing and treatment by developing a lead biosensor and colorimetric lead assay, as well as a lead-binding probiotic. Our lead biosensor improves the cost and efficiency of lead testing by producing specific chromoproteins that indicate benchmark levels of lead contamination in a sample. These benchmarks were confirmed by our assay. We are conducting proof-of-principle demonstrations of the biosensor in Escherichia coli, and will ultimately transform it into the Generally Recognized As Safe organism Bacillus subtilis. The probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, offers an emergency prophylactic solution for treatment by absorbing lead from the gastrointestinal tract after consumption of contaminated water. To achieve this, we are using selective pressure to evolve a probiotic with enhanced lead-binding capacity. Our project will improve the accessibility of lead detection and bioremediation for the general population.:::2017
