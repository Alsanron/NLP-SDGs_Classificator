Austin_UTexas:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Yo GABA GABA:::Since the discovery of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, there has been interest in using foods containing genetically engineered probiotics as alternative forms of medicine. Our project is aimed at designing a probiotic (specifically Lactobacillus plantarum) capable of producing high levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to treat patients with anxiety and bowel disorders. To make our probiotic overproduce GABA, we intend to overexpress gadB, which encodes glutamate decarboxylase, the enzyme that converts L-glutamate into GABA. Overexpression of gadB will be accomplished by placing it under the control of a Lactococcus lactis constitutive promoter. The efficacy of our probiotic in the human gut will be modeled using the gut of Apis mellifera. Additionally, we have created the Broad Host Range Plasmid Kit, a genetic toolset composed of part plasmids that can be quickly assembled into cassette plasmids, which can then be used to easily genetically modify Lactobacillus plantarum and other non-model organisms.:::2017
