GZHS-United:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Mos Quit X Cry:::Mosquito-related diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, cause thousands of casualties and tremendous economic loss every year. In most of the cases, Aedes and Culex are the major source of suffering, and governments around the world take diminishing Aedes and Culex as priority in mosquito-related diseases control. Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) and Bacillus sphaericus (Bs) are natural-occurring biological larvicides that are widely used in urban area because they are environmental-friendly and economical. In our project, two mosquito toxic proteins, Cry4Ba and Mtx1, which are derived from Bti and Bs respectively, are coexpressed via transcriptional and translational fusion. The recombinant protein has higher efficiency in larvae elimination and is more extensive insecticidal spectrum than any single of them. Our project has created a new larvicide that specifically target against the larvae of mosquito, and we hope our product could keep people away from the suffering caused by mosquitoes.:::2017
