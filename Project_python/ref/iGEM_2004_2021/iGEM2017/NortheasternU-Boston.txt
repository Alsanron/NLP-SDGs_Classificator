NortheasternU-Boston:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Expansion of Cell-Free Manufacturing with Post-Translational Modification:::Production of recombinant proteins has enabled or improved the treatment of numerous diseases including anemia, diabetes, and cystic fibrosis. However, recombinant protein production requires industrial infrastructure and the biologics produced in this manner typically have stringent storage requirements, including refrigeration. Many areas of the world lack infrastructure for local production or cold-chain infrastructure for effective delivery of recombinant proteins. Cell-free manufacturing based on freeze dried protein expression reaction pellets may be a solution. These pellets contain the molecular machinery to manufacture proteins and can withstand variations in temperature and humidity. Cell-free expression in this context has limited ability to produce complex proteins. Our project uses anti-microbial peptides as model molecules in order to characterize limits of cell-free expression of functional molecules. We then attempt to expand the production of functional molecules by introducing proteins for post-translational modification of expressed anti-microbial peptides to rescue functionality and demonstrate improved cell-free expression.:::2017
