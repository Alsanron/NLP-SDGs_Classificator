UCAS:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::We Fit Fish:::Aquatic products provide Chinese people with gourmet foods as well as high-quality proteins. In China, freshwater aquaculture products contribute up to 68% to total aquaculture products. Nevertheless, in freshwater aquaculture, there exists a major problem of excessive ammonia nitrogen in pond water, which is toxic to aquatic creatures. Although ammonia nitrogen concentration is critical in water quality evaluation, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring systems, causing fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production. This year, UCAS iGEM team engineered E.coli to sense ammonia in pond water and alert farmers to high ammonia concentration. Furthermore, to remove the excess nitrogen from water, we introduced human xanthine oxidase to transfer ammonia into uric acid precipitation. Consequently, breeding density can be raised and farming water can be recycled, thus reducing costs and increasing benefits. Our uric acid-producing microorganism can also serve as a platform to select effective drugs for gout.:::2017
