Hong_Kong_HKU:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Disease Diagnosis Using 3D Functional DNA Nanostructures produced in-vivo:::DNA nanotechnology utilizes DNAâ€™s chemical properties to produce nanostructures with novel functions. DNA diagnostic nanodevices are produced using the predictable and programmable properties of DNA binding. In our project, we will produce biobricks encoding a 3D nano device which detects diseases, like Huntington's disease and cancers, that produces mRNA biomarkers. The presence of target would induce a conformational change of our nanostructure, which we can be assessed through gel electrophoresis, colorimetric and fluorescence assay. Lastly, we will transform the construct with our biobrick , consisting of our oligos, and reverse transcriptase into E. coli that can facilitate the synthesis of our nanostructure inside the cell. By using E. coli, this will help us to mass produce a diagnostic tool for a specified disease.:::2017
