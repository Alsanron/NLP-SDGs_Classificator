SYSU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Stem Cell Woundplast:::Our goal this year is to provide a novel therapy for Ashermanâ€™s Syndrome (AS) with engineered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). AS is characterized by adhesions in the endometrium, and often associated with dilation and curettage of the intrauterine cavity. Current treatment remains ineffective for severe adhesions, which may lead to infertility, repeated miscarriages, obstetric complications, even endometriosis. Our Woundplast aims at treating AS with MSCs in a safe and effective manner. To target and maintain engineered MSCs to the wound, we use Pluronic F-127, an FDA approved material as supporting matrix. Besides, we engineered MSCs to over-express PVDF, bFGF and VEGF individually or in combination to further promote wound healing. We test our idea in vitro with rat model. More importantly, we believe our project has the potential to be used in other types of wound healing, not just AS.:::2017
