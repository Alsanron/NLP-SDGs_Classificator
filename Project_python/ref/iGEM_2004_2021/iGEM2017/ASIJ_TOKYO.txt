ASIJ_TOKYO:::Asia:::Japan:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Promoting CRC Detection:::Colorectal cancer is the second most lethal cancer in the United States, often beginning as benign polyps in the colon and rectum. Despite ease of treatment, cases of CRC are usually detected in its late stages, rendering care difficult. CRC results from the mutation of multiple genes involved with the regulation of cell proliferation and DNA repair, with the ASIJ iGEM team focusing on the Wnt pathway. The activation of the Wnt pathway inhibits the degradation of beta-catenin, a protein that triggers the mutation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Through detection of these mutated genes and subsequent downstream proteins, our team aims to develop an early screening method that can be adapted to a home detection kit. Building off of a rapamycin induced split-luciferase system characterized by the 2015 Peking iGEM team, our construct consists of a promoter reporter system that looks at two downstream products, C-myc and COX-2.:::2017
