We are developing pANDORRA, an assembly platform for modular RNAi-based logic circuits, capable of integrating multiple endogenous inputs to classify a cell by its miRNA expression profile and trigger a biological actuation. As a proof-of-principle, we are employing this strategy to build a cell-type classifier for colorectal cancer cells inducing fluorescence and/or triggering apoptosis. Simultaneously, in order to design a multi-pronged treatment approach for colorectal neoplasia, we are engineering a novel anti-cancer E.coli agent, facilitating selective adhesion and cell density-dependent invasion into cancer cells, as the delivery module for our classifier circuit. In the future, we envision our system to be employed in a variety of pathological conditions generating reporter signals or protein outputs of therapeutic potential.:::2017
