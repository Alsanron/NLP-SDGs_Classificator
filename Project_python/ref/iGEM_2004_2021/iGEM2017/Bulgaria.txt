Bulgaria:::Europe:::Bulgaria:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ACE of BASE - Accelerated Crispr-based EvolutiOn For BActerial SElection:::Directed evolution has been established as an effective strategy for improving the function of biomolecules for industrial and research applications. One of the major pre-requirements for a successful directed evolution of proteins is a simple, fast and cost-efficient method for generating genetic diversity. Many technologies have been used during the years to propagate mutations. One of them is mutator strains, which carry defects in one or more of their DNA repair genes. A large number of gene knock-out, transcriptional or translational silencing methods were applied for mutator strain generation. Regardless of its great potential, the CRISPR guided dCas9 targeting to transcriptional start sites of bacterial DNA repair genes was not among them. Our project is focused on adapting this promising system to manipulate the mutation levels in E. coli in an attempt to create a novel and efficient mutator strain with controllable mutation levels and high transformation efficiency.:::2017
