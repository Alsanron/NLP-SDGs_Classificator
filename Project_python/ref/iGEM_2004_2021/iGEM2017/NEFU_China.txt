NEFU_China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Coordinated Grease Eraser: Build a microbial trap for grease::: Civil sewage contains enriched grease with low biodegradability. To develop a novel approach for grease treatment, we designed a microbial cooperation system based on serine-mediated attraction and leucine-mediated repellent of bacteria. Our system consists of 3 Leaders (LA, LB, LC) and 2 Followers (FD, FE) that are engineered microorganisms. LA inducibly secretes serine, LB constitutively secretes leucine, and LC makes acyl-CoA synthetase long chain (ACSL) to metabolize fatty acids. Serine and leucine produced by Leaders can attract or repel FD/FE, respectively. FD secretes lipase to dissolve sewage grease into fatty acids and FE expresses a fatty acid binding protein on its membrane to carry fatty acids. When Followers are attracted to Leaders, a fatty acid-enriched microenvironment can be built to let ACSL from LC metabolize fatty acids. Thus, we developed a novel grease-degrading system consisting of differentially engineered microbial groups, similar to an assembly line in a human society.:::2017
