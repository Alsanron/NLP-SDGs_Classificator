Hong_Kong_HKUST:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genetic Containment Strategy: Preventing the Replication of unintentionally released Genetically Modified Materials through Recombinase-based Deletion:::Unintentional release of genetically engineered organisms (GMOs) has always been a major safety concern in the field of synthetic biology. Different approaches of genetic containment strategy such as kill-switches and auxotrophic mutants pose some issues of horizontal gene transfer of modified genes and metabolic cross-feeding that may limit the effectiveness of those approaches. To circumvent the shortcomings, we present an alternative safety circuit which is capable of sensing and amplifying a signalling molecule under a time-delay mechanism. After the time-delay, the circuit will trigger the production of a recombinase that splices out the genetically modified segment from the origin of replication (ORI) of the carrier vector, thus preventing replication of the genetically modified segment in the host. Through this genetic containment approach, we hope to create a standardized design to lower the risk of leakage of genetically modified materials to the environment and alleviate public concerns.:::2017
