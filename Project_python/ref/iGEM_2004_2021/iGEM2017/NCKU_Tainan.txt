NCKU_Tainan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NO Problem- A Biological Approach to Nitrate Sensing and Regulation:::Aquaculture is expected to become major fishery consumption for human upon the depletion of ocean resources, and to reach USD 202 billions by 2020 in a commercial sight. Keeping water unpolluted is crucial to aquaculture industry, with Nitrate the main target when monitoring water condition. Nevertheless, as to control its concentration, changing water continuously, the most common and affordable way for fish-farmers, is undoubtedly a burden for earth. So how to make monitoring and controlling of Nitrate inexpensive, precisely sensitive and with less manpower? Now, NCKU_Tainan brings a new idea — "NO Problem: A Biological Approach to Nitrate Sensing and Regulation." With a plasmid composed of PyeaR promoter and GFP for nitrate sensing, genes constructed for four enzymes — by which Nitrate transformed into glutamine, a harmless and valuable amino acid — and our own device for both sensing and regulation process, we turn traditional aquaculture into a sustainable industry.:::2017
