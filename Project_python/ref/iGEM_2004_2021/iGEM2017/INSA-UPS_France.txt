New exciting possibilities are expected to emerge by using synthetic microbial consortia. This way, the most interesting properties of microorganisms (e.g. detection, production, resistance) can be combined and modified to achieve new desired tasks. This is what we did in our iGEM project. As a proof of concept, we create a synthetic microbial consortium to fight against cholera disease. The players are modified strains of (1) Escherichia coli producing a quorum sensing (QS) molecule to mimic the presence of pathogenic Vibrio cholerae bacteria; (2) Vibrio harveyi producing diacetyl in response to QS molecule; and (3) Pichia pastoris yeast producing antimicrobial crocodile peptides in response to diacetyl. By crossing the border of the cell-to-cell communication between prokaryote-eukaryote, our project brings not only new perspectives to circumvent cholera epidemia but also to design new synthetic biology approaches using microbial consortia.:::2017
