SJTU-BioX-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Palette:::In our project, Palette, we develop a system which can detect multiple target substances and can read the result by naked eyes. We choose chromoproteins to provide rich colors for indication of multiple signals. Furthermore, by mixing two types of chromoproteins, we can create a third color taken as the characterization of the relative abundance of two signal molecules. We employed small transcription activating RNAs (STAR) to decrease the leaky expression of chromoproteins which we found in our experiment. We also introduced test paper and smartphone into our project to make our system more user friendly. With these designs, even ordinary people can easily tell the concentration of target substances. To test the system, we choose heavy metal ions as an example. Since heavy metal pollution is an urgent problem, we hope our application can be used widely.:::2017
