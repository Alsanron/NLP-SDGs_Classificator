The current pigments used to colour conventional inks are environmentally harmful to produce. Our goal is to produce biological pigments by putting the biosynthesis pathway genes encoding for black, cyan, magenta, and yellow pigments into Escherichia coli. Using synthetic biology to produce pigments may provide a cleaner and safer alternative to conventional pigment manufacturing. Costs of manufacturing methods can be compared and pigment production yields can be modeled mathematically. Pigments purified from bacteria are combined with a solvent and resin to create an ink mixture. Consultation with potential stakeholders indicated that pigments and inks produced by this method would need to be tested for bleaching, bleeding and colour consistency, among other characteristics. Additional human practices include analyzing the environmental impact of standard pigment production versus bacterial production and presenting iGEM and STEAM initiatives to members of our community.:::2017
