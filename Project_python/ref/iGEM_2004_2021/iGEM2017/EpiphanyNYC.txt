EpiphanyNYC:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Tackling Huntingtonâ€™s Disease with RNA Strand Displacement:::Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder that causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain, and currently has no cure. HD is usually adult-onset, and includes symptoms such as amnesia, involuntary movements, and physical incoordination, rendering the patient with a lifespan of a mere ten years after onset. The main cause is a trinucleotide repeat of CAG in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, where a repeat of 40 or more can cause the disease to manifestation. Our goal is to create a synthetic RNA strand displacement technology that targets and blocks endogenous faulty mRNA and releases a corrected RNA strand for proper protein synthesis of the HTT protein. For this, we aim to generate a plamsid with an identical sequence to the human mutant form of Huntington's disease. Ultimately, once technologies are developed to overcome endocytosis and blood brain barrier traversal, an injectable cure can be produced.:::2017
