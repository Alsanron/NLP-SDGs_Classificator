CU-Boulder:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Protein Microcompartments Engineered with a Light Activated Open/Close Switch:::The ability to control the compartmentalization of enzymes and biologics is needed for drug discovery. Bacterial Microcompartments BMCs are naturally occurring protein structures that act to either sequester harmful metabolic intermediates or concentrate critical cytosolic substrates. Light triggered release of toxic therapeutics from molecular compartments would activate them only where needed and potentially minimize their side effects. We have engineered a BMC with a light activated open/close switch that could be used for drug delivery. We did this by incorporating the light-sensitive compound azobenzene as a non-canonical amino acid into the structure of a BMC coat protein. This allows us to induce the disassembly of the BMC and release its enclosed cargo via photo-stimulation. Our work developing the first light activated BMC expands the synthetic biology toolkit and has the potential to help precisely deliver future therapeutics.:::2017
