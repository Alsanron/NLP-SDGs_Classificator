The most widely accepted test for detection is the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL), which is produced by harvesting the blood of horseshoe crabs and this has devastated their population. LAL detects concentrations as low as one part per trillion of endotoxins by using the natural clotting mechanism of the horseshoe crab blood in the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) found on the surface of gram-negative bacteria. Factor C is a component of LAL that self-cleaves in the presence of LPS to initiate clotting. We used the cleaving property of factor C to design a novel contamination biosensor. Producing a recombinant fusion of factor C with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), will allow us to detect our system using over-the-counter pregnancy tests creating a cheaper and more efficient way to detect endotoxins.:::2017
