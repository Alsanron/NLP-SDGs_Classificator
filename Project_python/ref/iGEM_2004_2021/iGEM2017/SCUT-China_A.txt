SCUT-China_A:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A reporter device based on SRRz lysis gene applied to heavy matel ions detection::: Our team tries to build a group of heavy metal bio-sensors: We standardize the lysis gene SRRz and the Î²-galactosidase gene, to build a visible and low-cost reporter which can detect chemical substances in aqueous solution qualitatively, and in a certain concentration range, it can detect the chemical substances quantitatively. Subsequently, we will link some specific inducible promoters of heavy metal ions to this reporter and transform these devices into Escherichia coli BL21 to verify the feasibility of the reporter and construct engineering bacteria that can rapidly detect heavy metal ions in aqueous solution.:::2017
