However, the current market price for such devices creates a high barrier of entry for many institutions. To make this key technology more accessible, the Penn iGEM team (2017) strives to create an open-source and cost-effective solution. The KAM-Spec is a ~$2K dispersion-based plate reader (up to 96 wells), in which full absorbance and emission spectra are rapidly resolved on a CCD line-array camera. KAM-spec automation and analysis is performed in Python. KAM-spec performance will be benchmarked using commercial fluorophores and common fluorescent bacterial strains used in synthetic biology and optogenetics.:::2017
