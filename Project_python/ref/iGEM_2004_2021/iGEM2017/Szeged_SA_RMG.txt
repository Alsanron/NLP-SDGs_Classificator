Szeged_SA_RMG:::Europe:::Hungary:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::METHUNGENY - Methane Biosensor Project:::Methane is a significant substance both in the environment and in the industry, thus indicating its presence has a great importance. Our aim is to develop a methane-biosensor. Our plan is to genetically modify a methanotroph bacterium (Methylococcus capsulatus) to produce lactate from methane or methanol. During its metabolism this bacterium produces pyruvate in the presence of methane. After having inserted the lactate-dehydrogenase gene, pyruvate is converted to have enough lactate for an enzymatic assay to change color when excess amount of methane is present in the environment of the bacteria. In the beginning the bacterium is cultivated in NMS medium containing methanol. For the genetic modification we use the lactate-dehydrogenase gene from Bacillus coagulans. First we transform E. coli with the cloned pMHE conjugation vector, which will transfer the LDH gene into M. capsulatus. The lactate concentration of the transformed bacterial medium will be determined with a lactate-assay.:::2017
