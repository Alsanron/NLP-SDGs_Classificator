SDSZ-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Automatic Synthesis of UDCA (Effective Ingredient of Bear Bile) Using Immobilized Enzymes:::Bear bile, a widely employed Chinese traditional medicine, has significant pharmaceutical effects on treating primary biliary cholangitis, hepatitis C, allotransplantation rejection, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and acute calculous cholecystitis. In order to find an alternative for extracting bile from living Asian black bear, our team works on the biological synthesis of UDCA( Ursodeoxycholic Acid, the effective ingredient of bear bile). By employing CBD(cellulous binding domain) to immobilize enzymes (7α-HSDH, 7β-HSDH, GDH, and LDH) on cellulous, we are able to convert CDCA(Chenodeoxycholic Acid), found in goose bile, into UDCA. Furthermore, we have designed a machine equipped with reaction efficiency measuring system and enzyme-adding controlling system. Our automatic biological synthesis will not only be more efficient but also be cheaper than the tradition extraction and the chemical approach. This approach relieves the pain of patients and the bile bears.:::2017
