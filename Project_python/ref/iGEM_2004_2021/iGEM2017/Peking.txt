Peking:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genetic Sequential Logic Programming:::Complex gene regulation requires responses that depend not only on the current levels of input but also on signals received in the past, enabling temporal variation in cell behavior. In digital circuit theory, this information-processing paradigm refers to sequential logic. We developed recombinase parts that can stably edit DNA sequences and demonstrated their capability of implementing sequential logic in cell. The core of sequential logic is the memory module to store past events. We built a bio-flip-flop with similar function as its electronic counterpart, which can store one bit of memory. By incorporating repressilator into the system, we aim to trigger cell state transition with an intracellular oscillation clock signal. We also developed an automated method to generate genetic sequential logic circuits according to customized specification of inputs and responses in different temporal states, namely the 3D truth table.:::2017
