CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AFLATOXOUT:::According to the report conducted by WHO, “aflatoxin” is a major contributor to the global burden of food-borne diseases. In this project, we focus on two things: firstly, we would like to prevent people from consuming aflatoxin-contaminated food. We would create a device which could detect the amount of aflatoxin inside the food, then transmit the information on to the internet. Therefore both the public and private sector could use the device and mobile application to track contaminated food throughout the nation. Secondly, we would like to create a enzyme-encoded yeast to eliminate the aflatoxin in the patients intestine.We would create a yeast that could produce enzymes that eliminate the aflatoxin inside the human intestine. This can help people suffering from the diarrhoea caused by aflatoxin. Additionally it can also be applied to animal foods, getting rid of the aflatoxin in the animals’ bodies that could potentially contaminate our food.:::2017
