UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB:::Latin America:::Chile:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Greenhardtii Project:::During the year 2015, the worldwide mean of atmospheric CO2 concentration surpassed the threshold of 400 ppm and will keep increasing. But can CO2 be thought of as an exploitable resource? Greenhardtii Project is an initiative that searches to generate a green microalgae with optimized capacity of carbon uptake, using this as cellular fuel to use it as a production platform of desired biomolecules. The optimization of the Calvin Cycle in our Greenhardtii platform (Green + Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) is produced by the expression of a cyanobacteria enzyme. Moreover, test of the kinetic behavior of a regulable promoter and pathways inhibition will be made in a mathematical model. To Greenhardtii Project, linking science with society is indispensable, so the design of a photobioreactor is being developed, in order to propose instalations in one of the sectors with the worst air standards in Chile:::2017
