MSU-Michigan:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biosensing Water Contaminants with Genetically Engineered Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 using Single-Chambered Bioelectrochemical Systems:::Pollutants in fresh water such as pharmaceuticals, hormones and heavy metals are rarely monitored and the need to detect and remove these compounds in an inexpensive way is what motivates this project. The marine bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 could be a part of the solution through its unique ability to transport electrons to an external acceptor such as an anode through its external electron transport chain (Mtr pathway). This can be utilized in bioelectrochemical systems to make a biosensor by removing the mtrB gene which allows electricity production then turning this gene back on in the presence of water contaminants. This biosensor will be engineered to be manufactured on a large scale to be used for research, education, humanitarian efforts and even consumer use. Although the proof of concept is currently tested in a single chambered bioelectrochemical system, an affordable and portable paper microbial fuel cell system is being developed.:::2017
