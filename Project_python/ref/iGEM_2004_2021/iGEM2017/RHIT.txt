RHIT:::North America:::United States:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::B-Fine: Characterization of Vitamin B9 and B12 Binding Riboswitches:::Enabling the ease of access to proper nutrition is vital for developing a healthy human population. Understanding the elements of nutrition will aid in engineering solutions to current -and future- nutrition concerns. One set of vitamins where deficiencies are presently a concern, especially among pregnant women, are vitamins B9 and B12. The primary goal of this project was to characterize and document riboswitches responsive to vitamins B9 and B12. Five riboswitches regulated by either vitamin B9 or B12 were selected and synthesized. E. coli were engineered to express the mRNA regulating GFP expression constitutively using the well-documented promoter BBa_J23106. The GFP expression when exposed to varied levels of the ligand were measured over time through fluorescence measurements, and the binding affinity of the ligand to each riboswitch was determined through isothermal titration calorimetry. These data and subsequent documentation will aid in providing a usable, documented part for further use.:::2017
