William_and_Mary:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Modular Control of Gene Expression Speed using Protein Degradation Tags:::It has become apparent that a fundamental principle of cellular signal processing is the encoding of information within the temporal dynamics of regulatory circuits. For synthetic circuits to achieve the versatility and effectiveness of endogenous circuits, it is necessary to develop simple, effective methods to control a circuit’s speed. Current approaches to speed control are too complex for widespread use— we lack a modular system that allows one to “swap out” a sequence to predictably change a gene’s speed just as swapping an RBS can change the gene’s expression strength. To address this need, we developed a BioBrick suite of degradation tags associated with an E. coli-orthogonal protease, providing the parts and characterization necessary for controlling genetic circuit speed in a simple, modular, and predictable way. Additionally, we created a searchable database of previous iGEM teams’ outreach projects, designed to better enable future teams to build upon previous outreach efforts.:::2017
