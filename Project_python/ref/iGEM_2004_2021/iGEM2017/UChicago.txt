UChicago:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Expression of Centromeric Activity by a Chromosomal Integration Plasmid in E. coli and Pichia pastoris:::Centromeric plasmids combine the stability of a chromosome and the flexibility of a plasmid to create the perfect tool for the biotechnical industry. Pichia pastoris, a strain of yeast often used in this field, lacks a centromeric plasmid, which limits the research that can be done with this species. The University of Chicago iGEM Team, GeneHackers, is conducting research to create a centromeric plasmid for Pichia pastoris. Such a plasmid that will be useful for a multitude of purposes, including bioengineering and industrial applications. We aim to find and incorporate the minimal sequence within the genome of Pichia pastoris that allows our modified version of the iGEM plasmid psB1C3 to behave as part of the yeastâ€™s chromosomes. The combination of DNA from both E. coli and Pichia pastoris will lead to the creation of a yeast centromeric plasmid that can act as a shuttle vector between the two organisms.:::2017
