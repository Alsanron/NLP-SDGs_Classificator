Uppsala:::Europe:::Sweden:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Crafting Crocin:::Crocin is part of a beta-carotene pathway that leads to synthesis of saffron, which gives the compound it’s beautiful crimson colour. In recent years Crocin has caught the attention of researchers worldwide as a potential treatment for various degenerative diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer’s. Besides treating diseases we also see potential of Crocin being used as a dye in different industries. The Zeaxanthin pathway is in the registry as well the beta-carotene pathway, but due to that the Zeaxanthin plasmid is quite large and unstable we decided to use lambda red recombineering to transfer it from the plasmid to the chromosome to make it more stable. When producing a compound synthetically and potentially cheaper than the actual plant, it is important to take the ethical aspects into account. That's why ethics has been a huge part of our project and with our Ethics manual hope to inspire more teams.:::2017
