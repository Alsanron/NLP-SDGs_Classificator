KU_Leuven:::Europe:::Belgium:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::HEKcite: Measuring frequency change of an artificial rhythm in HEK cells for therapeutic drug monitoring:::Lack of continuous therapeutic drug monitoring is associated with increased health costs, morbidity and mortality. A more dynamic sensing system could improve the therapy and quality of life of patients taking drugs with a narrow therapeutic range. Here, an electrically oscillating system consisting of genetically modified Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells is proposed. After transfecting HEK cells with genes encoding key ion channels, an intrinsic rhythm of subsequent de- and repolarization was obtained. Molecular substrates, such as drugs, can open or close these ion channels and thus affect the frequency of the rhythm. This change in frequency can then be measured in vivo by use of a multi-electrode array and correlated to the concentration of the drugs in the blood. Additionally, substrate specificity can be chosen by integration of a certain substrate-sensitive ion channel into the oscillating system. This multipurpose sensor could be developed for medical and biotechnological applications.:::2017
