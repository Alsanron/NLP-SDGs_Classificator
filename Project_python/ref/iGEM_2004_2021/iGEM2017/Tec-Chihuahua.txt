Tec-Chihuahua:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Erwinions: Quenching the fire out of Fire Blight:::Erwinia amylovora causes fire blight disease worldwide in some important crops such as apple, roses, pear and most Rosaceae's family members. For example, the largest Latin American apple producer has 3,000 hectare from which 50% are estimated to have the disease. This iGEM edition, Tec-Chihuahua presents its proposal to address this environmental/economical issue by using synthetic biology techniques to synthesize three enzymes that might inhibit most, if not all, of the virulence factors. The use of N-Acyl homoserine lactonase would directly affect the AHLs by hydrolyzing the main quorum sensing molecule. Then, the Cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase would linearize the c-di-GMP avoiding the formation of biofilm while encouraging motility. Nevertheless, Tec-Chihuahua proposes to arrest flagellar rotation with a glycosyltransferase. As these are intracellular proteins, the pathogen should be genetically modified and tested hoping for a descent. Afterwards, the commercial and technical viability of a theoretical biocontrol would be developed as real proposal.:::2017
