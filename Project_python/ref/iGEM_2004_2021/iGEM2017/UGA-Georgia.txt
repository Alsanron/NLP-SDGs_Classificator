UGA-Georgia:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of an Aptameric Biosensor for Aflatoxin B1 in Peanuts:::The University of Georgiaâ€™s 2017 iGEM team aims to engineer a biosensor for the detection of aflatoxin B1, a harmful mycotoxin peanut contaminant. As Georgia produces more peanuts than any other state in the United States, UGA iGEM recognizes that aflatoxin B1 contamination in peanuts is a regionally important issue. While other iGEM teams have developed detection methods for aflatoxin B1, these methods lack high specificity. To achieve a highly-specific biosensor, UGA iGEM has incorporated an aflatoxin B1 aptamer that has previously been used for an in vitro detection assay. By mimicking this system in vivo, UGA iGEM is developing a cost-effective two-component riboswitch aflatoxin biosensor. This technology could be utilized in the manufacturing process to cut costs in recognizing infected peanuts. Moreover, by creating an affordable aptasensor, this will both make peanut crop growth more accessible to developing countries and decrease aflatoxin-related deaths worldwide.:::2017
