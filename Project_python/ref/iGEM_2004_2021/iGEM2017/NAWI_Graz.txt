NAWI_Graz:::Europe:::Austria:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ColiBot – a robot-bacteria interface:::The aim of project “ColiBot” is to create a robot-bacteria interface in which information processing is done by a bacterial culture that forms a feedback loop with a mobile robot. Escherichia coli is cultivated in a bioreactor, which provides stable conditions. Communication from bacterial cells to robot, the output signal, is achieved by fluorescence proteins. The expression of those proteins is influenced by certain environmental conditions. For measurement, a small culture sample will be transported through a modular system to a measurement chamber that detects the fluorescence wavelengths of the culture. This procedure is repeated over and over again, while the robot moves accordingly through an arena. Our first approach of this project is based on thermosensitive bacteria for information processing. Until now, this project already shows satisfactory results. Now, we are primary focusing on the second part of our project, trying to achieve information processing by pH shift.:::2017
