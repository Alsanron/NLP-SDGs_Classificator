Shenzhen_SFLS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Targeting the Mutant BRAF in Melanoma Cells by CRISPR/Cas9 Technology:::Melanoma is the most malignant type of skin cancer with high metastasis potential and a low survival rate. It is reported that about 60% of melanomas contain a mutation in the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), and V600E (1799T>A) variation in BRAF is the main type of mutations in the cancer tissues, which plays a critical role in carcinogenesis of melanoma. In our project, we aim to disrupt the mutant BRAF in the two melanoma cell lines (A375 and G361) by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The data showed that the system significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration, and induced apoptosis in the two cell lines, which suggest that we could target a specific oncogene and achieve personalized therapy for different types of cancer only by simply changing the sequence of a sgRNA.:::2017
