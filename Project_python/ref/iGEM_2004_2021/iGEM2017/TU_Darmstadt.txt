TU_Darmstadt:::Europe:::Germany:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ChiTUcare:::Over the course of the last decades wound infections have become a major issue in daily medical routine. In this context we present a method combining continuous wound screening with next generation wound care. To accomplish fast wound screening, we introduce a tool to detect individual bacterial proteases. Here, non-toxic fluorophores are linked to chitosan oligomers by sequence-specific peptide linkers within a hydrogel matrix. This method excels by being painless, quick and non-invasive. Chitosans show antimicrobial and wound-healing supportive properties, making chitosan oligomers excellent plaster materials and fluorophor-carriers. De novo biosynthesis in E. coli makes it possible to produce chitosan oligomers with different defined deacetylation patterns which differ in their bioactivity and are therefore useful for various applications for instance plant protection and medical materials. For this purpose different chitindeacetylases, with unique deacetylation patterns can be individually expressed in E. coli by orthogonal regulation via a split-T7-RNAP regulation system.:::2017
