We have been depleting the worldâ€™s resources and filling the atmosphere with abnormal levels of CO2 for too long. Our team has decided to take on this challenge by creating photosynthetic cell factories, to directly use the pollutant CO2 as a resource for synthesizing fumarate - a versatile chemical traditionally manufactured from petroleum. We aim to stably produce, sense and export fumarate under conditions mimicking industrial settings. Stable production is achieved by activating and evolving different metabolic modules in response to natural day/night cycles. To detect fumarate, we developed a biosensor suitable for high-throughput screening. Finally, to allow optimal fumarate export, we investigate its transport mechanism. These efforts attracted attention from beyond academia, as our cell factories may help in taking CO2 out of thin air and into a bio-based economy.:::2017
