Grenoble-Alpes:::Europe:::France:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SnapLab, our portable kit that will detect cholera:::We are designing a pathogen sensitive detector, allowing an easier and more specific diagnostic of cholera. After extracting DNA from the feces and performing the analysis, a nucleic acid sequence will be detected if the patient is infected with cholera. Once these sequences are introduced into the bacteria, fluorescence will be emitted and captured by the camera of a smartphone. The application that we will design will perform the analysis and do the image processing. Plus, the temperature will continuously be monitored within the kit. The greatest advantage of this device will be its capability to communicate the results to its user and to map the cases of cholera. That way, we will be able to know which area is the most affected by the epidemic. Going forward, this kind of device will be replicable for different pathogens, thus allowing to widen the spectrum of this kitâ€™s use.:::2017
