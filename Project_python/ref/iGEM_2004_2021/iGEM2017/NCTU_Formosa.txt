NCTU_Formosa:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Parabase â€“ A Simple and Applicable Peptide Prediction System with Validation of Artificial Intelligence:::In the era of explosive information, the power of using a huge quantity of information is pivotal, so comes in the genesis of Parabase, which integrates A.I. based on Scoring Card Method into databases to achieve drug repurposing by the cross match of collection data and the quick prediction of the unknown in vast data sets. The system can be highly applicable in different topics, and we take fungal diseases for example. We have discovered new antifungal peptides and done experiments to validate their functions. After the antifungal peptides are set, IoT then gathers weather information responsible for the changing situation of reality and tallies out the spore germination prediction model. With the Parabase system composed of Database and IoT, farmers can easily opt for the antifungal peptides to eradicate the pathogens and the exact spraying timing.:::2017
