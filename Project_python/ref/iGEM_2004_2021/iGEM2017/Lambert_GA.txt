Lambert_GA:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::CLiP'd: Characterizing non-Lysosomal Inducible Protein Degradation:::In the development of genetic circuits, researchers often face issues with the overlap of protein expression. As a result, the 2017 Lambert iGEM team aimed to develop a clean way to “switch” off protein expression by further characterizing a proteolytic mechanism known as ClpXP. An inducible genetic construct was made to express tsPurple (a chromoprotein) and degrade via ClpXP upon induction of varying levels of IPTG, resulting in correlating amounts of protein degradation. Data was collected on the team’s engineered Chrom-Q, a 3-D printed camera-device that supports a constant light source for centrifuged cells; in turn the data was analyzed using Lambert iGEM's self-constructed software app to determine HSL values. The purpose and goal for this technology was to promote scientific research under any financial circumstance to quantify data in standardized conditions. Measuring relative strengths of protein degradation using self-engineered products will allow an economic approach in characterizing non-lysosomal proteolysis.:::2017
