TokyoTech:::Asia:::Japan:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Coli Sapiens: Co-Culture System of Human Cells and Bacteria Sustained by Cross-Kingdom Talk:::Gene therapy has been expected in cancer therapy for years. An interesting therapy for cancer using anaerobic bacteria as a carrier has been developed, but after the anaerobic cancer region is diminished, the bacteria cannot stay there anymore. If anti-cancer bacteria can stay in affected area, they promptly respond to cancer recurrence. Co-existence of bacteria and host cells should be quite difficult in our body or human cell culture systems, because bacteria grow so fast. It is important to control bacterial proliferation in them. So, we try to establish a new living system that human cells control the population of bacteria by engineering the both cells by creating two signaling pathways of 1) Bacteria-Mammals and 2) Bacteria-Plants. We expect that this system will lead to a new experimental approach and a new medical therapy. Moreover, we imagine about "A boundary between cellular groups and living organisms" with general public.:::2017
