UIUC_Illinois:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Sweet Giblets: A Homemade Gibson Assembly Recipe:::The aim of this project is to lower the cost of a common recombinant DNA technique, the Gibson Assembly. The concept revolves around the construction and expression of plasmids with DNA polymerase and DNA ligase as the insert genes. The constructed plasmids for these two proteins are transformed into DH5Î± cells for high cloning and then transformed into BL21(DE3) for high gene expression and production of the proteins of interest. Cell lysate from transformed BL21(DE3) cells is used as DNA ligase and DNA polymerase and the base level of exonuclease present naturally in the cell lysate serves as the T5 exonuclease. Using different combinations of the cell lysates for the DNA ligase and DNA polymerase, a plasmid with known sequence and properties is assembled to test the concept. Sequence results obtained after each trial are recorded as a measure of success or a need to modify the lysate ratios.:::2017
