SWITCH (Disease-associated RNA Switch):::Influenza A is a rapid changing disease that causes 5,000,000 of death annually worldwide. Among different subtypes, highly pathogenic avian influenza has the highest mortality rate. Challenges of disease control in the modern world with high population mobility remains at the speed and accuracy of diagnosis. However, nowadays influenza A subtyping method rely greatly on RT-PCR, which requires long time, expertise and laboratory space. Meanwhile, a novel type of riboswitch, namely toehold switch, shows its potential in subtyping Influenza A with quicker detection and lower production cost. Our project focus on developing an on-site subtypting method for Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 and H7N9 using toehold switches. An online software program was also developed for designing toehold switch.:::2017
