KAIT_JAPAN:::Asia:::Japan:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CAR: Cure Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever in Japan):::Hay fever in Japan is most commonly caused by pollen from Cryptomeria japonica and Japanese cypress. Which are native Japanese tree species. About 20% of the population currently suffer from this type of seasonal hay fever in Japan. The general symptoms are, sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy eyes. There is an opinion that the balancing of helper T cells which controls the immune system is involved. Helper T cells transmitï½“ antigen information to B cells, which are antibody-producing cells. And depending on the type of cytokine produced, it is roughly divided into type 1(Th1) and type 2(Th 2). Our aim is to create a system that produces IL12 to maintain the balance between Th1 and Th2 cells.:::2017
