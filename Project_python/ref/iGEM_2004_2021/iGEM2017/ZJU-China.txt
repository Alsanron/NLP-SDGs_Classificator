ZJU-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Guardian Trichoderma::: Trichoderma is a genus of fungi that has been used as biocontrol agents for many years.Although these species have a considerable inherent ability of antagonizing phytopathogen,like mycoparasitism,bacteriolysis,antibiotic production etc., the practical application is still limited.Our project has tried to solve this problem in a synthetic biological way. Trichoderma.atroviride is our selected guardian,we use it as our chassis, making it can respond to specified volatile organic compounds(VOC) and then synthesize new VOC to realize the communication between guardians just like QS in bacteria.We further build a hardware to detect the healthy condition of plants based on machine learning. We also express ferritin and TRPV1 proteins to try to make the guardians respond to medium waves emitted by the hardware when it estimates the plants are attacked, and then our guardians will protect the plants from phytopathogen,nematodes,or even herbivores.We use tobaccos and its nature enemy Phytopathora nicotianae to elaborate our works.:::2017
