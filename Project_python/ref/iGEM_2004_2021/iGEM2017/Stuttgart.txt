Stuttgart:::Europe:::Germany:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Light up the Pipe:::The clogging of drains and pipe systems by hair and fat is a serious problem in industry and private households. Currently many blockages are dissolved by toxic and reactive chemicals like sodium hydroxide and chlorine compounds. We want to engage this problem in a more sustainable way by developing a biological cleaner based on a holistic approach using E. coli. Our microbial system is targeted on producing and secreting enzymes to break down hair, fat and other pollutants. By optimizing the secretion of the selected enzymes, we are avoiding enzyme purification which can save valuable money and time. Additionally we want to produce a scent from the existing waste as an indicator of successful degradation. Involving mathematical modeling of enzymatic kinetics and degradation processes will support the experimental work. Concluding, we hope to reduce chemical waste and deal with an everyday problem more sustainably.:::2017
