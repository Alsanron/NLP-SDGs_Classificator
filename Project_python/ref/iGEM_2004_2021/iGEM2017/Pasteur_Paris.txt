Pasteur_Paris:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::æther : an innovative air-purifying biomaterial:::Indoor air pollution is a worldwide threat and existing solutions are limited as stated by experts we met. Our aim is to design an air purifying device. Not only will it capture toxic compounds present in the air, but it will also degrade them using enzymes. As a proof of concept, we have chosen Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) as targets, since they are some of the most dangerous volatile air pollutants. The enzymatic pathway we have elaborated will degrade PAHs into pyruvate, a physiological compound. Our system and its coating will not release any GMOs. After meetings and discussions with the general public, health specialists, air quality regulators, law and political actors, we have designed an affordable and user-friendly device, æther. Indeed, it consists of an energetically autonomous DIY kit based on simple materials, so that people with low income and restricted access to electricity can also benefit from it.:::2017
