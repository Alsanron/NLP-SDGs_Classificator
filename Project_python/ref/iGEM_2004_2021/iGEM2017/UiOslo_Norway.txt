UiOslo_Norway:::Europe:::Norway:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Achieving lasing in a GFP protein solution and yeast cells:::A bio-laser, which is a laser with a biological gain medium, was first described in 2011. In our project, we want to create and explore such a bio-laser. To achieve this, we will first attempt to use an external light source and mirrors to get stimulated light amplification in a solution of fluorescent proteins, and use that as a functional proof of concept. The second part is to transform S. Pombe yeast cells with said fluorescent protein, and try to achieve lasing in a solution of live yeast cells.:::2017
