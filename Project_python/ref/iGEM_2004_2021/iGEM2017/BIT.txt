BIT:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::JACOB: Just A Creative assay for the detection Of Biomarkers:::To facilitate early diagnosis, we contrived a biosensor of onset-pathological biomarkers with high sensitivity, affordability, and analyte modifiability. Detection of Alpha Fetal Protein (AFP, a well-studied cancer indicator) is an exemplar demonstration of this device. Here is how it works: first, lysine is attached to DNA segment that is complementary to AFP-bonding aptamers. When AFP is bonded with aptamer, complementary chain is released; then, trypsin detaches lysine, which then enters fluorescents-producing, lysine-deficient E. coli system. Results are recorded, analyzed, visualized by independently designed device. Here are three highlights: first, biosensor (aptamer) is able to be artificially designed aimed at target biomarker; second, bioamplifier (gene knock-out, strong promoter, cycle amplifier and dual-fluorescence) realizes improvement of signal to noise ratio; third, micro-fluidic chip and fluorescence detector make it possible that the assay can work in practical. Therefore, the performance of system indicates it could be a promising assay in in-vitro diagnosis.:::2017
