Minnesota:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Use of Cytolysin FitD Overexpression and Biocontainment Systems for the Control of Zebra Mussels:::Zebra mussels have a large impact locally in Minnesota as well as nationally. Zequanox is a new effective treatment composed of heat-killed Pseudomonas fluorescens, and it is very expensive. The Minnesota iGEM team has proposed a novel synthetic system that is based upon a toxin released by this Pseudomonas fluorescens strain, cytolysin FitD, that could be released into lakes. This designed system entails the creation of a modified Escherichia coli strain that expresses FitD and a biomolecular control system to allow for the release of live bacteria into the lake. With the continuous production of the FitD toxin, an increased number of zebra mussels will be killed, limiting the number of treatments needed. Minnesota iGEM experimented with several biocontainment strategies, including a thymidine auxotrophy system, purine auxotrophy system, SacB control system, and toxin activation system. These control mechanisms help to create robust and safe engineered biological systems for environmental applications.:::2017
