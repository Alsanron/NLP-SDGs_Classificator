Fudan:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SwordS: antigen density targeting with customized therapeutic responses via SynNotch-Stripe system:::Antigen density on tumor cells’ surface is heterogeneous, which constrains current solid tumor immunotherapy to target only highly expressed tumor associated antigens (TAAs). We designed an antigen density targeting immunotherapy platform, SwordS (SynNotch-Stripe system), that is capable of generating non-monotonic therapeutic responses. To demonstrate the concept, we took advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common malignant tumors and a leading cause of cancer-related death in China, as a potential target of disease treatment by SwordS. In combination with HCC associated antigen responding SynNotch, our genetically engineered cells would generate an antigen density-dependent, triple HCC therapeutic response patterns. Our approach is aimed to reduce the on-target/off-tumor effects and greatly expand the diversification and combined potency of tumor therapy. We believe that SwordS is promising to become a brand new generation’s customized therapy developing platform for optimizing cellular immunotherapy against cancerous diseases.:::2017
