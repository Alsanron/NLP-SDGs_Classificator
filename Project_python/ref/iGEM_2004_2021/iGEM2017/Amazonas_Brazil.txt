Standardization is a fundamental key to that goal. CRISPR/Cas9 machinery paves the way for precisely edit living cell genomes. Although revolutionary, SynBio community has an obstacle: CRISPR/Cas9 protocol is superficially standardized and requires a considerable amount of wet lab work due to the multi-plasmid system. We aim to build a toolbox for one-step genome engineering based on a standard BioBrick vector. To go further and beyond, we unified human practice with pattern recognition and machine learning in order to overcome boundaries in the way of SynBio advancement. We also bring the concept of computational repository for lab "algorithms", the protocols, developing an open and integrated platform to expand the iGEM experience. Our perspective is to leave a legacy and provide a bacterial genome editing machinery based on BioBrick parts assembly easy to engineer as A-B-Câ€¦ CRISPR.:::2017
