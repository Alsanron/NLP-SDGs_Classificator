UNOTT:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Key. coli: next generation security - protect your gems with germs!:::Numerous critical issues have begun to emerge affecting digital password security. Companies are increasingly turning to physical strategies, involving biometric and digital keys, to secure client accounts. Synthetic biology offers significant unprecedented security opportunities through synthetically generated biometrics. Consequently, we have developed a randomly assorting, fluorescent bacterial key. Separate genes encoding three distinct fluorescent proteins are expressed using different promoters that are capable of inhibition by dCas9. Null and functional sgRNA DNA modules were endowed with identical sticky ends to compete with one another during ligation, generating an ON/OFF fluorescent state and variance for distinguishable keys. Each combination is modelled from lab data, illustrating discernibility. We have designed a safe, portable device for storage of E. coli, paired to a streamlined authentication procedure tailored to be immune to current hacking frameworks. This system is scalable to include any type of protein, synonymously expanding the number of combinations and improving security.:::2017
