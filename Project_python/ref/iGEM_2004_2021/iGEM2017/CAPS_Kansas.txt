CAPS_Kansas:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Manipulating Omp pores & AcrAB-TolC efflux pumps using CRISPR/dCas9 to enhance E. coli antibiotic susceptibility:::Antibiotics are a hallmark of modern medicine having saved numerous lives since the discovery of penicillin in 1928. Bacteria resistant to antibiotics emerged shortly after their initial use, and is an increasing problem as pathogenic strains of bacteria evolve resistance to multiple drugs. In an effort to increase antibiotic susceptibility, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to disrupt intrinsic resistance mechanisms in E. coli. Specifically, we plan to enhance the expression of Omp pores while also inhibiting the functioning of AcrAB-TolC efflux pumps. Mechanism for effective delivery of a functioning CRISPR system in clinical settings will be explored.:::2017
