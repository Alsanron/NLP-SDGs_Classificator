NWU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Alkane Biosensor:::Our project for this year is developing a biosensor for alkane. As present methods dealing with oil spill cannot meet the requirement of environmental recovery, our team think that the best way solving oil spill problem is preventing it. We separated oil degradation bacteria from areas contaminated by oil, then we confirmed this bacteria is Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain by measuring its 16S rRNA and named it DN1. For oil degradation is an alternative metabolic pathway in bacteria, there is a manipulator for oil degradation gene, such as GntR. It codes GntR protein, which can bind with promoter on upstream of alkB2. When alkane exists, GntR will unbind with the promoter, and the RFP gene we added on downstream will express to show a signal. We used P.a DN1 and DH5Î± as our chassis to explore which bacteria will be a better chassis for our device.:::2017
