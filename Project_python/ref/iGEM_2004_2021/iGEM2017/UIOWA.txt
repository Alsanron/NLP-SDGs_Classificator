UIOWA:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of a 3-Hydroxypropionic Acid Biosensor:::Many industrial manufacturing processes utilize the metabolite 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) as a platform chemical for the synthesis of complex biofuels and plastics. Current companies engineering bacteria to overproduce 3-HP utilize high-performance liquid chromatography to assay concentrations, which is a precise method for established bioreactors but time-consuming for testing experimental strains. Recent studies identified 3-HP responsive genes in Pseudomonas denitrificans and Pseudomonas putida, which could be used as a viable biosensor for real-time monitoring of 3-HP concentrations in vivo. Our ongoing research project utilizes the 3-HP responsive genes found in P. putida and P. denitrificans as biological reporters which express luciferase in the presence of 3-HP. We will then adapt this system to Bacillus subtilis, which has shown potential as a 3-HP producer for industrial processes due to its high tolerance for concentrations of 3-HP that are toxic in other microorganisms. Our biosensor is a useful tool for metabolic engineering research.:::2017
