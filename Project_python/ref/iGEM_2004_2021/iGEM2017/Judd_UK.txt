Judd_UK:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::IonIron - a home-testing kit to keep an eye on your iron levels:::We are aiming to genetically engineer E.coli to detect iron concentrations in saliva as a biological sensor for iron deficiency and overdose. This would ultimately be developed into a cell-free, paper based system. According to the WHO, it is estimated that 1 billion people worldwide as well as over 50% of pregnant women in LEDCs are iron deficient. Iron supplementation programmes exist in 90 countries worldwide; however, most of these are not systematically monitored, implemented or evaluated. Excess iron supplementation can result in an increased risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes and arthritis. Monitoring these conditions requires a time consuming method involving expensive equipment and trained personnel which are difficult to find in LEDCs. Our construct will change colour depending on the iron levels in patientsâ€™ saliva samples. This would make our test inexpensive, unobtrusive and easy to use to help monitor these conditions across the globe.:::2017
