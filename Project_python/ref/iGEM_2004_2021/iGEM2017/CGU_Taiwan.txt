CGU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::INKOFF: Preserve Fibers to Save Nature:::Reprocessing paper is very important for reducing deforestation, but the current manufacturing process causes chemical pollution and substantial paper fiber losses. After extensive discussions with paper-making experts, we have devised a plan to replace the chemicals used in traditional paper reprocessing and to increase recovery of paper fibers. In our model, the paper sheets undergo image analysis to determine which spots have ink printed on top and will be sprayed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae which has been engineered to express deinking enzymes upon light induction. Instead of treating all paper pulp, only the spots with ink is shone with light to induce localized deinking. This procedure can remove ink efficiently while protecting most of the paper fibers from being digested. This design extends the lifetime of the paper fibers and reduces wood-logging for making paper.:::2017
