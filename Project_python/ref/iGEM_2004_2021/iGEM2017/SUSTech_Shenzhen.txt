SUSTech_Shenzhen:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::C.elegans in Skinner Box — the study of learning behavior based on optofluidics:::What is the distinction between the conditioned reflex of Pavlov’s dogs and the behavioral reinforcement of Skinner’s pigeons? What is the determination of the formation of behaviors and how to control it? Taking the response to alcohol of C.elegans as an example, a platform of optofluidics is established to provide deeper insights into these questions. Expression of two channelrhodopsins in the olfactory receptor neuron pair provides worms with the preference and aversion to specific wavelengths, and the lights are employed to reinforce their addictive or abstemious attitude to alcohol. The neo-behaviorism theory is expected to be verified in C.elegans, demonstrating the learning capability of model organisms based on both behavioral observation and quantification at the molecular level. Hopefully, downstream neurons of the new-learned behavior will be revealed by using this platform, and it depicts a future of training human brains through optogenetics.:::2017
