ManhattanCol_Bronx:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E(lectro) coli and the GOxLDEN nANODE:::We are maximizing the efficiency of a bioanode in a three-fold approach. First, we stably express the MtrCAB operon from Shewanella oneidensis, an electric bacterium, in E. coli. MtrCAB is responsible for the production of membrane bound cytochromes and known to generate bacterial nanowires. We anticipate that the MtrCAB system will allow for an electric E. coli that produces nanowire connections between the anode and bacterium for direct electron transfer. Second, we utilize variants of the Aspergillus niger enzyme, glucose oxidase (GOx), that are engineered for stability and affinity to gold (via the addition of thiol fusion tags). Finally, we synthesized a gold nanowire anode to increase the surface area for GOx affinity, bacterial nanowire connections and electron deposition. We envision a system that utilizes each approach concurrently in an effort to increase the electron shuttling of a biofuel cell at the anode.:::2017
