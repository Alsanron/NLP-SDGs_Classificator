FAFU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synergism of Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria-plant interactions for bioremediation of metalliferous soils:::We hope to establish a sustainable, regulable and reusable project to solve the soil polluted by heavy metals. Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria have important functions. In our project, we used the mechanism of the alliance between microbe and plant, by manufacturing Bacillus megatherium, which is a kind of phosphate-solubilizing microorganism exists in the root system, forcing it enhance the plant remediation from two aspects, accumulating heavy metals and defend adversity stress. To achieve the goal of spatial specificity, we make most of the expression system which is regulated by root organic acid. We also used MBP (metal binding peptide) to make accumulation of heavy metal in root systemâ€™s soil success. Finally, heavy metals will transfer to plant itself. A series of transformation we made in Phosphate-solubilizing microorganism in our project will solve the weakness of hyper-accumulators, therefore, the remediation method will be put into use widely.:::2017
