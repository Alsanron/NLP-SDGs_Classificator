Toronto:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Light, Lac and LOV: A light-regulated switch for control of gene expression:::iGEM Toronto has developed a genetic switch that will allow stringent control of transcriptional activity using LacILOV, a novel light-regulated transcriptional modulator, and cI, a viral repressor. Using blue light as an input, our tool will enable users to manipulate desired gene outputs. As a proof of the utility of our switch, we propose a system that will permit spatiotemporal control of CRISPR activity using blue light. By integrating anti-CRISPR proteins and sgRNAs as our outputs, we demonstrate the applicability of our design to CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. Given the foundational nature of our project, we have devised a guide that will aid researchers in considering the ethical, legal and socio-economic implications of the various applications of our system. Using human gene editing as an example, we aim to create a framework that facilitates reflexive dialogue, incorporating feedback from various potential stakeholders.:::2017
