ITB_Indonesia:::Asia:::Indonesia:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Dewaruci - Removal of Microplastic Pollution in the Ocean Using Biofilm-based Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Degradation:::Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-based plastic pollution in the ocean is a very concerning environmental issue. These plastics are extremely difficult to degrade. Moreover, harsh ocean environment breaks down these plastics into tiny fragments called microplastics. Microplastics are commonly ingested by marine life, causing poisoning which could lead to deaths. While larger-sized plastics are easy to collect for recycling, microplastics are impossible to collect, making them an untreatable pollution. ITB_Indonesia team will create a synthetic bacterium which has the ability to remove plastic pollution from the ocean efficiently. This bacterial machine will do its action in four main steps: 1. detection of microplastics; 2. attachment to the microplastics through biofilm formation; 3. plastic degradation using PETase enzyme; 4. conversion of PET-degradation products into nutrition source. Additionally, this bacterium will be designed to survive marine conditions. Through this breakthrough, microplastic pollution would be treated and marine wildlife would be saved.:::2017
