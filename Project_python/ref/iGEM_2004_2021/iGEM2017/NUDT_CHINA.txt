NUDT_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MiRNA Locker: A Modularized DNA Assembly As miRNA Inhibitors:::Nowadays, sequence-specific microRNA (miRNA) inhibitors have been extensively demanded in miRNA loss-of-function studies and gene therapies, whereas current developed inhibitors still suffer from high cost and poor scalability. Seen new approaches needed, our project attempts to demonstrate a novel design of miRNA inhibitor, named as miRNA locker, which can be easily assembled using modularized DNA parts from a set of chemically synthetic oligo DNA library. The microRNA lockers we assembled were proven to be able to bind miRNAs in an Ago2 dependent manner, and were able to trigger gene expression and phenotypic changes consistent to commercialized miRNA inhibitors while decreasing costs significantly. We also demonstrate a computer-aided designing software to facilitate the lockers design and optimization. With its unique advantage and potential on multi-targeting and convenience, we believe that our design might provide an alternative approach for miRNA inhibiting for research, diagnostic and therapeutic uses.:::2017
