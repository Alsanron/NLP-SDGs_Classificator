UST_Beijing:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cyclase of Nature & Pangu Algorithm:::Out of 500 some existing amino acids nature only picks 20 as major building blocks to make proteins. To analyze these 20 molecules, a Matlab computer algorithm is scripted to measure physical-chemical distance among them, which is then summed up to score homologous proteins. We called the program Pangu, a Chinese legendary figure, to reflect the shared-common ancestor of life on earth. We hope programs like Pangu would supplement standard methods of analyzing phylogenetic relationships between proteins and species. Guided by Pangu algorithm, we will synthesize an artificial squalene cyclase in cultured human cells to study basic physiology of cholesterol and related analogs. We hope the result will help to develop new methods to identify micro-nutrients importance for human health. Last but not least, we will continue our 2016 iGEM program iGUT, an E.coli-expressed beta-glucosidase for notoginseng processing to improve bio-availability.:::2017
