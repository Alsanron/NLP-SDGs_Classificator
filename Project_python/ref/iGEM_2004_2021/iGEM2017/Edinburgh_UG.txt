Edinburgh_UG:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SMORE: A Site-specific, Modular Recombination Toolkit for Genetic Engineering:::Site-specific recombination is widely utilized for genetic engineering; however, a synthetic biology approach is needed to facilitate its use in a rational and bottom-up way. Therefore, we created SMORE, a toolkit containing well-characterized recombinases, their respective target sites, and recombinase activity assay constructs, with their utility demonstrated by three constructs: a gene randomizer, logic gates, and a pulse generator. Among other applications, these could be applied to metabolic engineering to improve the industrial production of high-value compounds. Our human practices concerns the accessibility of SMORE, making it easier to use. First, we systematically reviewed iGEM team composition in previous years to determine whether diversified teams enjoyed more success; second, we built a microfluidic device and had its protocols open-sourced to promote its use outside of the discipline of engineering; lastly, we adjusted the readability of our promotional material and created animations to facilitate the understanding of the concept of SMORE.:::2017
