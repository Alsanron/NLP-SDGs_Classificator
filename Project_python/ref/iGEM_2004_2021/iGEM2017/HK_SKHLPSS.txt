HK_SKHLPSS:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::A Self-Assembled DNA Nanocube for the Diagnosis of H3N2 Influenza:::DNA is always used a genetic material for information transfer over generations. It's programmability also allows the application in fabricating various objects for diagnostics and therapeutics as the field of DNA nanotechnology. This year, we used DNA to fabricate a three-dimensional cube that is responsive to the presence of H3N2 influenza mRNA biomarker. We used DNA and RNA oligos of the same sequence of the target for detection. From the result, we found that the DNA nanocube specifically responses to the presence of target leading to the opening of the lid. This results in the disassemble of the quadruplex formation and reduction in hemin-mediated peroxidase activity. We proved that a three-dimensional nanodevice can be used for quick diagnosis within 30 minutes and it is applicable for the detection of different biomarkers and we wish to largely produce this diagnostic device with engineered bacteria.:::2017
