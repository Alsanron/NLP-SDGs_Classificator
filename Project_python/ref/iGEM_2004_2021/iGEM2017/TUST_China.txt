TUST_China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Research into Increasing Yields of Bacterial Cellulose via Methods of Synthetic Biology::: Bacterial cellulose is a novel nano-material synthesized by microbiology. BC has a unique three-dimensional net structure with high degree of biological histocompatibility and degradability. Therefore, it has a wide range of application.However,low yield and high cost of producing BC makes it way behind reaching practical need of production and application.Hence, we intended to implement synthetic biology to improve the yield of bacterial cellulose. 1.Refinement of fermentation conditions. It has been proved by research that G.xylinus can reach its highest yield of bacterial cellulose when pH=4.8.Therefore, we intend to control the continually descending pH of the environment during fermentation and maintain its pH to around 4.8. 2.Partial alternation of carbon flux distribution. We hope we can redirect and improve the carbon flux distribution to the pathway of producing bacterial cellulose via over-expressing some key enzymes during the fermetation of G.xylinus.:::2017
