Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::B.xylophilus Busters-the attempt to kill pine-wood nematodes by feeding RNAi:::Pine-wilt disease caused by Bursaphelenchus xylophilus causes tremendous damage to pines in Asia and Europe. However, the existing counter-measures are not only insufficient, but also cause environmental and ecological damage. We engineered a solution to killing nematodes effectively and specifically by focusing on the nematode's diet: yeast living inside pines. We selected target genes which were both nematode-specific and predicted to be essential for survival. We then engineered yeast which express dsRNA targeting these genes, with the goal of feeding the engineered yeast to the nematodes to knock down their genes (feeding RNAi). Furthermore, we predict that engineered yeast may be used to colonize healthy pines, functioning as a preventive measure against nematode infestation. The behavior of dsRNA in yeast is still not well understood, and establishment of a feeding RNAi system in pine-wood nematodes is unprecedented. Thus, our method will also support fundamental research on RNAi and pine-wood nematodes.:::2017
