Botchan_Lab_Tokyo:::Asia:::Japan:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Amino Acid Synthesis Model from Nitrogen - The Air, New and Innovative Food:::Among some kind of nutrients, proteins are important for body formation. However, it is difficult for people in poor areas to continuously obtain protein rich foods. Therefore, in addition to these ingredients, we propose "air" anyone can easily take it into the body. We got the idea from Papuans living in Papua New Guinea. Despite their low-protein diets, they have muscular bodies. It is thought that nitrogen fixing bacteria in their intestines are influencing on protein nutrition. We thought to construct a pathway to synthesize amino acids from nitrogen in E.coli, introduce it into the intestine in the future. To synthesize amino acids, we first express nitrogenase to convert nitrogen to ammonia. We then express amino acid dehydrogenases to synthesize glutamate and phenylalanine from accumulated ammonia. This makes it possible to make people available to protein sources by breathing the air. This will contribute to the solution of protein shortage.:::2017
