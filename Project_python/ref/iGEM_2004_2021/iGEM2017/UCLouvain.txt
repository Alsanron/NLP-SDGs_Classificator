UCLouvain:::Europe:::Belgium:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BactaSun : Detecting UV with bacteria:::Nowadays, exposition to harmful UV rays has led to an ever growing number of skin cancer cases, amongst other sun-related diseases. Our aim is to design a biobadge detecting excessive UV exposure and therefore warn us to seek sun protection should it become necessary. This badge would work as a capsule holding E. coli cells, changing colours as the UV intensity increases. Therefore, we investigated two approaches using photocaged tyrosine (o-nitrobenzyl tyrosine). In both cases, UV-rays will release the tyrosine and enhance a reporter signal. (1) Starting with a tyrosine auxotroph E. coli strain, a reporter RFP will be synthetized once tyrosine is liberated from its cage. (2) Using a photocaged peptide and a specific transcription factor called ComR, we also aim at UV-controlling the expression of the reporter gene. The capsule would also work as a safe and reliable containment, destroying the engineered microorganisms once the biobadge is discarded.:::2017
