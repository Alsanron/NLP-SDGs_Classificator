HUST-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::REEBOT:::The rare-earth elements (REEs), essential in many high-tech products, are becoming increasingly important. However, mining, refining, and recycling of them may yield hazard by-product if not properly managed. Therefore, we have attempted to apply synthetic biology strategies for its proper usage. Here we have proposed REEBOT, the REE robot, which could sense lanthanide ions by its membrane protein, and then catch those ions with the artificial peptides on its surface. After its enriching process, REEBOT would be adsorbed to silicon with the help of Si-tag, enabling us to recycle it. To enhance its efficiency and specificity, we have also designed an awakening system: only under the presence of rare earth elements could REEBOT start its enriching and recycling system, which could also ensure its safety.:::2017
