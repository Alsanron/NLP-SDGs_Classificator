Potsdam:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Two novel approaches to metabolic channeling to increase the efficiency of the Indole-3-acetic acid pathway:::With metabolic channeling, the speed of the reaction of a metabolic pathway is raised by putting the enzymes close together, thus the diffusion distances for the intermediates are reduced. Therefor we have two approaches. In the first approach, we are utilizing the DNA-binding property of the dCas9-protein to put the enzymes next to each other on a DNA-scaffold. The proteins bind via Aptamers and specific binding proteins to dCAS9. This approach is tested in E. coli while the second one will be implemented in yeast. The second approach works with liquid-liquid-phase separation. In this process, membraneless organelles are formed, induced by specific variable domains of Ddx4. We want to investigate, whether fusing the enzymes for the pathway with Ddx4 enables droplet formation and thereby induces metabolic channelling.:::2017
