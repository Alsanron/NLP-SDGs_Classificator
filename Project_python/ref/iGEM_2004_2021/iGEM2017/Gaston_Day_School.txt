However, when the alcohol level in the growth medium nears the toxic concentration for the bacteria, the bacteria will start to break down the alcohol they have created. Therefore, the toxic threshold determines the maximum alcohol production. This year, we have started a new project to increase alcohol resistance in bacteria, which should also increase the toxic threshold. This, in turn, would allow the bacteria to produce higher concentrations of the desired alcohol. E.coli is a good platform for biofuel production because the pathways to produce alcohols such as ethanol, isobutanol and isopropanol already exist. We plan to clone several genes in E.coli, such as GlmY and GlmZ, that are associated with alcohol resistance.:::2017
