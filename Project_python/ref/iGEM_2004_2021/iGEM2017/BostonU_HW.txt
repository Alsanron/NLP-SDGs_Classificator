BostonU_HW:::North America:::United States:::Hardware:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MARS: Microfluidic Applications for Research in Synbio:::Microfluidics is often an underutilized technology in the field of synthetic biology because designing and using microfluidic chips requires specialized knowledge. Our project, MARS (Microfluidic Applications for Research in Synbio), aims to increase the accessibility of low-cost and easy to use microfluidic systems for researchers in synbio. MARS will comprise of designs for nine chips adapted to our low cost system that perform fundamental synthetic biology procedures, as well as video tutorials, PDFs and protocols for using these chips or fabricating your own. Furthermore, MARS includes a troubleshooting and verification framework for microfluidics allowing researchers to quantitatively grade microfluidic chip designs. Using our end to end system, microfluidics can become a more accessible and practical tool for synthetic biologists to integrate into their labs.:::2017
