SIAT-SCIE:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Tardi-Guards:::Genetically engineered organisms designed by iGEM teams have the potential to serve in wide range of fields. And when it comes to application, resilience of these organisms is an important factor that needs our attention. Hence this year, our project seeks to improve the stress resistance ability of engineered organisms. Our solution was built upon Tardigrades, an organism famous for their extraordinary ability to survive in harsh conditions. The resilience comes from some unique protective proteins. We express these proteins in vivo, test its ability to increase the survivability of bacteria under water deficient and radiation conditions, eventually it will be used on eukaryotic cells like yeast, multicellular organisms like nematode or even mammal cells and organs. Our products can be easily used by many teams whose engineered organism have to work in extreme environments, with numerous potential use such as in culture collection and protection of transplant organs.:::2017
