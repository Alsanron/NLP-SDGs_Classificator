BOKU-Vienna:::Europe:::Austria:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::D.I.V.E.R.T. - Directed In Vivo Evolution via Reverse Transcription:::In vivo continuous directed evolution offers significant advantages over classic in vitro methods as it drastically reduces the amount of time and actual lab work required. Most current approaches, however, are based on globally accelerated mutagenesis inevitably leading to unwanted off-target mutations. D.I.V.E.R.T. represents the concept of a new continuous in vivo evolution strategy that allows full spatial control of mutagenesis by building systems that resemble the retrotransposon life cycle: The gene of interestâ€™s mRNA is reverse transcribed in an error prone way and reintegrated into the genome at the respective locus replacing the original gene for several cycles. To demonstrate the generalizability of the process we plan on carrying out our proof of concept experiment in yeast and E. coli. By the end of August we are still in the cloning stage. Additionally, we are working on a single plasmid system for CRISPR-enhanced chromosomal integration in E. coli.:::2017
