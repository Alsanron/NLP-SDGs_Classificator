CMUQ:::Asia:::Qatar:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Developing an eco-friendly approach to reduce the use of biocides for preventing Microbial Induced Corrosion.:::Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) cause significant damage to marine oil pipelines necessitating the use of biocides for reducing the Microbial Induced Corrosion (MIC) and potential for great environmental harm. Our team will focus on developing an eco-friendly approach to limit the use of biocides, which are used for targeting the SRB. SRB require high salt and low oxygen so first we plan to genetically engineer a strain of bacteria that would report the osmolarity in oil pipelines, thus act as a biosensor for salt concentrations. The ratio of salinity in the seawater flowing in versus the seawater flowing out of the well will be used to estimate SRB populations in the pipelines, thus limiting the amount of biocides added in times of high Microbial counts. In order to further reduce the environmental impact, we will inactivate the biocides prior to the oil well water being released back into the ocean.:::2017
