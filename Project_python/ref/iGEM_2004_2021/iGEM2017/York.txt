York:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Hardware:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::QWACC: a Quicker Way to Analyse Co-Cultures:::Co-culturing of microorganisms is an extremely promising approach, in Biology, for understanding natural and synthetic cell population interactions, and for applications in Industrial Biotechnology including manufacturing and drug research. However, the maintenance of stable and productive co-cultures is technically challenging, expensive, and can be time consuming. We aim to develop a Digital In-line Holographic Microscope (DIHM), along with associated software, that will be able to monitor co-culture counts in a closed loop, in real time, and inexpensively. To complement the microscope, we will also develop a synthetic co-culture. This comprises Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Escherichia coli, two visually distinct organisms. Chlamydomonas will be engineered to export maltose to feed E. coli, creating a sustainable production platform. We believe that our DIHM and co-culture is a promising start to streamlining the development of co-cultures for industrial applications.:::2017
