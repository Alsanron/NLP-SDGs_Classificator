Warwick:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Application of optogenetic control mechanisms for manipulating biopolymer synthesis in advancing 3D printing technologies:::By providing a well-defined, biocompatible surface coating, the risk of bone and dental implant failure will be greatly reduced. We aim to accomplish this by controlling the spatial production of extra-cellular cellulose with light. Our modified E.coli builds on previous teams work, utilising a transmembrane protein complex, which upon exposure to red light, phosphorylates a promoter and initiates the synthesis cascade. Using this technology, our team will be able to build a 3D printer where living bacteria act as the bioink. Our team will then be able to produce cellulose structures, featuring micrometer pores, which mimic the surface of broken bone, for implants. This structure has been shown to promote osseointegration, helping to reduce overall failure rates.:::2017
