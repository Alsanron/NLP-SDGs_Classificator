SMS_Shenzhen:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Pesticide Mate:::This year, SMS_Shenzhen develops a pesticide mate which can reduce copious quantities of pesticides using and is free from side effects to the environment. Scale insects are pests which threaten agriculture and gardening industry. Because of its harmfulness and tenacity, a large amount of contact pesticide is used yearly to repress its outbreak. In this project, E. coli was applied to selectivity degrade the thick shell of scale insects. Three kinds of enzymes are expressed in E. coli to degrade the chitin, protein and wax shell, which make it possible for pesticide to penetrate the shell. To avoid hurting plantsâ€™wax-protein surface, a sucrose-induced enzyme release system is introduced, which utilizes the insect's honeydew secretion. Though pests may not be killed directly by E. coli, there is a huge decrease in pesticides needed in the killing process, which saves much money and brings numerous benefits to environment.:::2017
