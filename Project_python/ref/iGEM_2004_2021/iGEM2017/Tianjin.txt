Tianjin:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Romantic Switcher:::We developed a novel gene switcher based on the mating-type switch and the mating behavior of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, namely “Mating Switcher”. Two groups of MATa haploid yeast with different functional genes initially work separately. Then by activating the inducible promoter in one group, the MATa yeast in this group will become MATα yeast to mate with another group. With vika/vox system, the original function can be shut off, and new function can be launched after mating. We applied our mating-type switcher to a controllable system of heavy metal enrichment for further disposal. To realize the separation of different ions in polluted water, we designed a gene circuit enabling the adsorption of different metal ions (Cu2+, Cd2+ ) in chronological order. And thanks to the flexibility and feasibility of our mating-type switcher, there will be more applications waiting us to exploit and develop.:::2017
