Manchester:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Phosphostore:::Phosphate supplementation is essential for maximizing plant yields in many agricultural settings. However, phosphate runoff from fields often causes eutrophication, leading to the deterioration of aquatic ecosystems. Moreover phosphate rock is a finite and increasingly scarce resource. Together, these two issues suggest a closed-loop solution. IGEM Manchester aims to address this issue using a bioengineered device: Phosphostore, genetically-modified bacteria that accumulate phosphate from wastewater in protein-based microcompartments for future recycling. In interviews with a wide range of stakeholders, we explore the economic and regulatory constraints that would influence the implementation of this system in real-world water treatment plants, as well as utilize a Design of Experiments approach to design a system with the required properties (e.g. the correct shell protein ratios for proper microcompartment formation) that would make our solution feasible on a larger scale.:::2017
