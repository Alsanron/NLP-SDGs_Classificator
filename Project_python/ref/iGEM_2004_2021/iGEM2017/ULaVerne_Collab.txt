However, due to natural biochemical processes and human activities, ocean temperatures are rising by 1-2% every year. This results in coral bleaching, the loss or expulsion of zooxanthellae from its tissue, due to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced from photosystem I. ROSs can be converted to less toxic chemicals by superoxide dismutases (SODs), however it does not react as quickly with ROSs as does other chemicals in the cell. Our research aims to reduce the production of ROSs by characterizing three SODs. We will determine which SOD is most efficient based on its placement in the cell under abiotic stresses, such as light and heat. We will also create a chassis for Symbiodinium and construct biobricks for each individual part. In addition, a controlled water tank will be created to simulate environmental conditions.:::2017
