Utrecht:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::OUTCASST: Out-of-cell CRISPR Activated Sequence-specific Signal Transducer:::We aim to create a DNA detection kit for diagnosis of diseases caused by microorganisms, such as Chagas disease. Current test-kits for Chagas disease lack in specificity or sensitivity and require trained personnel and a well-equipped laboratory, which are often not available in rural areas. Our system, called OUTCASST, detects pathogen DNA, allowing for direct diagnosis in a simple, robust and inexpensive manner that can be used in absence of laboratory equipment. It works through DNA binding and colocalization of catalytically inactive Cas9 and Cpf1 fused to membrane proteins and exposed to the extracellular medium. To assemble OUTCASST, we generated inactive Cas9 and Cpf1 variants and checked for functionality. In parallel, several modelling techniques were employed to identify venues for optimization. OUTCASST can be adapted easily to detect any desired DNA sequence and is therefore a valuable addition to the pool of toolkits for disease diagnosis.:::2017
