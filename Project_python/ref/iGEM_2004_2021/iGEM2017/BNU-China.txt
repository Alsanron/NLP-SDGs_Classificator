BNU-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MonKeYeast::: Our project aims to improve the loading capacity of yeast surface display system by displaying the microtubules and the flagellar filaments, respectively, onto the yeast surface. To start with, By using the agglutinin system, we anchored subunits of fibrous polymers which are represented here by microtubulin subunits or FilC, on the cell wall of yeast. Since the particular polymers self-assembly can take place outside cell membrane, we provide the engineered yeast with an environment rich of pre-secreted polymersâ€™ subunits. In this way, an extracellular tridimensional display system could be formed, which can enlarge the loading capacity by roughly an order of magnitudes. Moreover, we remodify the structure of FliC, substituting its D3 domain by the particular enzyme. By means of display and assemble specific combination of FilC-enzymes, the co-display ability can be greatly enhanced. As a result, a highly efficient, whole-cell biocatalyst system would be established at the meantime.:::2017
