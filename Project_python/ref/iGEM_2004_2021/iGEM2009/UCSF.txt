UCSF:::North America:::United States:::Health/Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering the Movement of Cellular Robots:::Some eukaryotic cells, such as white blood cells, have the amazing ability to sense specific external chemical signals, and move toward those signals. This behavior, known as chemotaxis, is a fundamental biological process crucial to such diverse functions as development, wound healing and immune response. Our project focuses on using a synthetic biology approach to manipulate signaling pathways that mediate chemotaxis. We are attempting to reprogram the movements that the cells undergo by altering the guidance and movement machinery of these cells in a modular way. For example, can we steer them to migrate toward new signals? Can we make cells move faster? Slower? We hope to better understand how chemotaxis works, and eventually build cells that can perform useful tasks. Imagine, for example, therapeutic cell-bots that could home to a directed site in the body and execute complex, user-defined functions (e.g., kill tumors, deliver drugs, guide stem cell migration).:::2009
