Tokyo_Tech:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::2009 Space Odyssey: Terraforming of Mars with genetically engineered bacteria:::Have any life forms existed on Mars? If so, what kind of features could they have possessed? Today, the Martian environment is severe for any life to inhabit because of some constrained conditions. For instances, the surface temperature having a range from -80? to 15?, CO2 occupying 95% of the atmosphere and the absence of organic substances on the surface don't allow aerobic organisms or heterotrophic bacteria to grow. Our project objective is to create a genetically engineered iron-oxidizing bacteria surviving on Mars and to establish a new model organism playing an important role to terraform Mars. We engineered Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans by introducing a synthetic pathway of both Melanin and Anti Freeze Protein with temperature-regulated systems. Anti Freeze Protein contributes to enhance tolerance of cryogenic condition and Melanin to blacken the Martian surface eventually resulting in melt of ice cap and generation of atmosphere and sea.:::2009
