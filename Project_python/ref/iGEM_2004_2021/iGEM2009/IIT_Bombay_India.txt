IIT_Bombay_India:::Asia:::India:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Analysis of multiple feedback loops using Synthetic Biology:::One of the major objectives of synthetic biology is to unveil the inherent design principles prevailing in biological circuits. Multiple feedback loops (having both positive and negative regulation) are highly prevalent in biological systems. The relevance of such a design in biological systems is unclear. Our team will use synthetic biology approaches to answer these questions. Our team comprises of nine undergraduates, 3 graduate students as student mentor and two faculty mentors, one each from biology and engineering background. The project specifically deals with the analysis of effect of single and multiple feedback loops on gene expression. This project will involve theoretical and experimental studies. We have designed synthetic constructs to mimic multiple feedbacks. The focus of our experimental work will be to visualize the effect of multiple feedback loops on the synthetic construct using single cell analysis. The project will provide insights into the roles of multiple feedback loops in biological systems.:::2009
