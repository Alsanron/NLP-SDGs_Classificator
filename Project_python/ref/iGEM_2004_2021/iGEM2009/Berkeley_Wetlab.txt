Berkeley_Wetlab:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Automated assembly of cell surface display devices:::The University of California Berkeley iGEM team has developed an automated approach to large-scale parts assembly that is accurate, high-throughput, reduces labor, and decreases cost. As a test bed for our system we have chosen to explore novel applications of cell surface display within Escherichia coli, the gold standard organism for bacterial engineering. Displaying peptides and proteins on a cell's surface is difficult, and many attempts may have to be made to generate a given functional protein. By automatically generating and testing a large set of diverse proteins paired with various display methods, we can search a large design space and develop guidelines for rational design of projects involving surface display.:::2009
