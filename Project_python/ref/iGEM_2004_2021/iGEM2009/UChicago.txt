UChicago:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::An enhanced yeast-based system for detection and decontamination of organophosphate neurotoxins.:::Organophophates (OPs) are highly toxic compounds used as pesticides and chemical ware-fare agents around the world, including sarin, soman, and VX gas. To combat these toxins, which act as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, we designed a highly efficient whole-cell S. cerevisiae sensor and biocatalyst system for the detection and remediation of the model organophosphate compound paraoxon and its degradation products. For our biosensor device, reporter constructs were incorporated into the genome downstream of paraoxon and paraoxon-hydrolyis sensitive promoters. Our degradation device was designed in three parts, targeting paraoxon through expression of organophosphate hydrolase from Flavobacterium, sp and two of its degradation byproducts p-nitrophenol and diethyl phosphate. Each device was genomically integrated in order to bypass selective the need for selective condition, while the degradation devices were constitutively expressed for maximum efficiency. Combined, this two-part system allows for both the detection and remediation of a broad range of common and deadly neurotoxins.:::2009
