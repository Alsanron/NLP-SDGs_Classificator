Cambridge:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. Chromi: Triggering Pigment Production in E. Coli:::Previous iGEM teams have focused on genetically engineering bacterial biosensors by enabling bacteria to respond to novel inputs, especially biologically significant compounds. There is an unmistakable need to also develop devices that can 1) manipulate the input by changing the behaviour of the response of the input-sensitive promoter, and that can 2) report a response using clear, user-friendly outputs. The most popular output is the expression of a fluorescent protein, detectable using fluorescence microscopy. But, what if we could simply see the output with our own eyes?  The Cambridge 2009 iGEM team is engineering E. coli to produce different pigments in response to different concentrations of an inducer.:::2009
