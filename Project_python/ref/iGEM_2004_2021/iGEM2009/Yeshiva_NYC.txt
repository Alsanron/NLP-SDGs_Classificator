Yeshiva_NYC:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Spatially encoding temporal information: using diffusional escape of periplasmic reporter proteins as a clock.:::We were inspired by iGEM projects that utilize colored or fluorescent reporter molecules. Specifically, we thought “wouldn’t it be nice to be able to leave a plate out in the field, collect it a day or two later, and be able to tell at what time the synthesis of the reporter molecules was triggered?” Ideally, protein reporters would leave the cell and diffuse through the agar, leaving a clear history of their expression. To this end, we are 1) creating a library of Sec and Tat leader sequence biobricks for directing expressed proteins to the periplasm, 2) making an E. coli expression strain with a weakened outer cell wall that leaks most of the periplasmic proteins to the environment, and 3) measuring and modeling the diffusion of small molecules and proteins in agar to ascertain the ability to derive the times and conditions under which they originated.:::2009
