DTU_Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The redoxilator, and the USER fusion assembly standard:::The Redoxilator: By in silico design and computer modelling followed by gene synthesis, we have constructed a molecular NAD/NADH ratio sensing system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The sensor works as an inducible transcription factor being active only at certain levels of the NAD/NADH ratios. By the coupling of a yeast optimized fast degradable GFP, the system can be used for in vivo monitoring of NAD/NADH redox poise. A future novel application of the system is heterologous redox coupled protein production in yeast. The USER fusion standard: Another part of our project is the proposal of a new parts-assembly standard for Biobricks based on USER(TradeMark) cloning. With this technique, not based on restriction enzymes, all parts independent of function can be assembled without leaving any ‘scars’ from the restriction enzyme digestions.:::2009
