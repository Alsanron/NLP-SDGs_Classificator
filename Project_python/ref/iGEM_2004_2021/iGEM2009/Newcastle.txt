Newcastle:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bac-man: sequestering cadmium into Bacillus spores:::Cadmium contamination can be a serious problem in countries where polluting industries are located close to agricultural sites. Our team developed a design to address this problem using the resiliant spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We engineered B. subtilis to sense and sequester cadmium from the environment into metallothionein containing spores, rendering it bio-unavailable. Germination of the spores can be disabled, making retrieval of the cadmium unnecessary since they can persist intact for thousands of years. We computationally simulated the life cycles of individual cells and entire cell populations, to estimate the parameter values necessary to maintain sustainable populations of sporulating, germinating and vegetative cells. Our design required us to engineer stochastic differentiation processes at a single cell level. A sporulation rate tuner was developed and we also engineered a tuneable stochastic invertase switch to stochastically control cell differention and fate.:::2009
