Todai-Tokyo:::Asia:::Japan:::Health/Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Prevention of Lifestyle Diseases Using Synthetic Organisms:::Lifestyle diseases, diseases caused by unhealthy living habits, comprise one of the major problems in modern society, especially as they may lead to fatal heart problems or even cancer. However, preventing or curing these diseases is presently of extreme difficulty. Our team, Todai-Tokyo, has been tackling treatment of lifestyle diseases such as hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, circadian rhythm dysfunction, and bad smoking habits by using synthetic living systems, utilizing their ability to incorporate complex logic functions and dispensability of external control once in operation. To do this, we aim to create the following:  cells that ingest cholesterol to decrease blood cholesterol levels, healthy low calorie breads, a system in which periodic gene expression is controlled, and bacteria that encourage smokers to quit smoking, respectively. By applying similar synthetic biology  methodologies to these, prevention of numerous lifestyle-related diseases may become reality, serving as a first step towards their eradication.:::2009
