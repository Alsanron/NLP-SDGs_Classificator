Victoria_Australia:::Asia:::Australia:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::An environmentally sustainable biological lighting system:::Our aim is to build a biological lighting system via cell free transcription and translation. We will be focusing on developing a prototype using two cell free systems: E. coli and wheat germ in which the proteins will fluoresce. We are using the fluorescent proteins BFP, GFP, Vic green, blueberry, yellow and cherry in the cell free systems. Our main aim was to develop an alternative light source, which could possibly be powered by a waste material as simple as grass clippings (cell lysate). We are also attempting to develop a new registry part that is a blueberry fluorescent protein using the yellow protein (part # BBa_E0030) through mutagenesis.:::2009
