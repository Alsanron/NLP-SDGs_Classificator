McGill:::North America:::Canada:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Activation?inactivation signaling in one?and two?dimensions:::Intercellular signaling constitutes the foundation of may disparate research fields such as neurophysiology, embryology, cancer research, and several others. We investigated a simple representational intercellular signaling network where a population of cells synthesizes and secretes an activator molecule capable of activation a second population of cells into synthesizing and secreting an inhibitor molecular which feeds back and inhibits the production of the activating molecule. This is known as an activation-inhibition system. We began by using a partial differential equation model of the system to explore the effect of varying the separation distance of the two populations of cells. We found that three types of dynamics were present: steady states, periodic oscillations, and quasi-periodic oscillations. We further designed two strains of E. coli capable of interacting with each other as an activation-inhibition system and endeavored to validate our modeling results in a biological system.:::2009
