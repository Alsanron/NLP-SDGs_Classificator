USTC:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. coli Automatic Directed Evolution Machine: a Universal Framework for Evolutionary Approaches in Synthetic Biology:::Evolution is powerful enough to create everything, from biomolecules to ecosystems. The ultimate goal of E. coli Automatic Directed Evolution Machine (E.ADEM) project is to manage the power of evolution, by engineering a robust system framework that can automatically create anything we want in synthetic biology, from various types of parts to complex systems. Each demand can be converted into designing a scoring function to give the evolution process a direction. E.ADEM is designed by implementing evolutionary algorithm back into biology. The core of E.ADEM is a self-adaptive controller that can adjust variation rate and selection pressure, based on fitness score, population size and average fitness score calculated by a quorum sensing device. After comprehensive measurement using constitutive promoter family stimulus signals and modeling of the components, a prototype machine is built. Modular design and PoPS device boundary standard will ensure the extensibility and universality of the machine.:::2009
