MIT:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Photolocalizer:::There has been growing interest in designing fast and reversible switchable controls over all steps of gene expression, from transcription to post-translational modification. Our project involves engineering S. cerevisiae to localize proteins to various points in the cell in response to light exposure. Under red light, a tagged protein of interest localizes to a specific target, while exposure to far-red light causes the protein to rapidly delocalize and diffuse throughout the cell. This is accomplished using the PhyB-PIF3 system, a light-based transcriptional regulation system found in Arabidopsis. This project has two components. 1) Metabolically engineering yeast to endogenously produce PCB, a tetrapyrrole necessary for system activation, and 2) adapting the PhyB-PIF3 system to localize proteins of interest to different targets in the cell. The versatility and applications for this system are vast, ranging from cellular diffusion studies to easily synchronizing cell division for entire populations.:::2009
