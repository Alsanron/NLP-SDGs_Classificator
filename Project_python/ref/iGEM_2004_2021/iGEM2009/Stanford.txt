Stanford:::North America:::United States:::Health/Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Immuni-T. coli: A Probiotic Approach to Diagnosing and Treating Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD):::Homeostasis relies on the balance between immune cell types, disruption of which leads to autoimmunity. The Stanford team has applied synthetic biology to a longstanding objective of immunotherapy: restoration and maintenance of homeostasis. Stanfordâ€™s Escherichia coli-based probiotic will polarize T cell differentiation along antagonistic fates - immunosuppressive Treg and inflammatory Th17 phenotypes - in response to local conditions. Our device design consists of two parts: one that modulates deleterious Treg-driven immunosuppression and another that engages Th17-mediated inflammation. Through specific sensors and effectors, therapy will oscillate between dampening pathologic inflammation and immunosuppression until a balance in the local T cell population is achieved. Securing such homeostasis between these populations has therapeutic implications for autoimmune disorders like IBD, HIV and cancer. We envision our novel and directed probiotic therapy for IBD as acting at the interface between commensal bacteria and human lymphocytes, integrating cutting-edge immunology with synthetic biology.:::2009
