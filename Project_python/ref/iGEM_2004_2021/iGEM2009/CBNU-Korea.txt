Without the assistance of computing tools, moreover, it would be much more difficult to make the synthetic genome. We here propose a key tool to help the creation of a genome as the essential step. The goal of Essarker is to help users design a minimal genome synthesized through the fundamental frame comprising the essential genes of replication. Essarker is a standalone software to manage and retrieve required sequences of genomes, and explore the essential gene order and direction and the related orthologous genes. It also identifies and visualizes the positions and orientations of genes. In addition, it shows optimal ordering of essential genes and orthologs by statistical analysis.:::2009
