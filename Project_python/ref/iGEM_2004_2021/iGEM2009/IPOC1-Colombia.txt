IPOC1-Colombia:::Latin America:::Colombia:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Molecular Device to Detect Sea Salinity:::Different gene parts are being assembled in order to construct a device that is able to detect different salinity levels in the sea. The device is tested against different concentrations of sodium chloride, fluoride, calcium, and magnesium. Different parameters, such as reporter fluorescence, DNA concentration, growth of bacterial device will be used to measure the efficacy of the device. Computational modeling will be used in the project to complement the laboratory work. Importance of project: Colombia borders two oceans: the Atlantic and the Pacific.:::2009
