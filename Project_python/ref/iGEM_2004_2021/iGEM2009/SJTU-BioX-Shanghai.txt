SJTU-BioX-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hypnos' Curse: E.coli the napper:::Inspired by the natural regulator of circadian bioclock exhibited in most eukaryotic organisms, our team has designed an E.coli-based genetic network derived from the toxin-antitoxin system (TA system). The relE protein?toxin?, is an RNase that preferentially cleaves mRNA stop codons, severely inhibiting translation and preventing colony formation. Whereas expression of relB protein?antitoxin? and tmRNA forms a rescue system to reverse inhibitory effects. Based on these mechanisms our network functions as a bacterial bioclock oscillating between the two states of dormancy and activity. Potential applications of our project include lifespan prolongation of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, since the metabolic process of microbes is vastly decelerated during the dormancy state, just like that of bears and hedgehogs in their hibernation.:::2009
