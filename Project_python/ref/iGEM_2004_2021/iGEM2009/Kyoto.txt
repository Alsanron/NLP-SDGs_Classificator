Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Time Bomb & Cells in cells:::We have two projects. The first is “GSDD”, the project to make a "time bomb"---a unique system to control the time of cell death.  We create timer mechanism by taking advantage of the end-replication problem and the protecting effect of lacI (bound to each end of DNA) against exonuclease digestion.  As the cell divides, due to the end-replication problem, the "timer" DNA gets shorter, and eventually, the repressor expression level falls.  Then the downstream killer gene becomes expressed. The other one, “Cells in Cells” is the project to make a cell.  We defined making cells as making liposomes that can divide like mitochondria do.  To approach our goal, we set two subgoals.  One is to enable cells to take in liposomes.  The other is to enable the liposomes to import proteins needed for mitochondrial division.  We suppose this could be the first step to create artificial cells.:::2009
