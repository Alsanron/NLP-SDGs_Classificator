Tianjin:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cyanobacteria convertor & Microcystins detector:::Project 1: Inspired by several features of cyanobacteria, which is low-grade, fast-growing, photosynthetic and easy to operate. We aim to construct an pathway in cyanobacteria so that when it is carrying photosynthesis?carbon dioxide can be transferred into target production, ethanol. Project 2: This project is to design a Yeast Two-hybrid system aimed at Microcystins(MCs) detection in waters. The MCs detection device we design takes the advantage of Gal4 promoter, which consists of two domains, one is AD, the other is BD. When AD and BD are close enough to each other, the report gene transcription LacZ will be trigged. We selected and modified two peptides that have specific interactions with MCs and engineered them into two vectors to construct the Yeast Two-hybrid system. In the presence of MCs at different concentrations, blue dots in different shades of colors can be seen directly.:::2009
