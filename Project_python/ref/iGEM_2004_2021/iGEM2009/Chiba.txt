Chiba:::Asia:::Japan:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. coli Time Manager Since 2008:::Since 2008, we have been constructing the bacteria timer that "work together". The mechanism is very simple; (1) the "Transmitter cells" generates the signal molecules, whose concentration gradually increases, (2) when it reaches a certain level, the "Receiver cells" switch on the expression of any given genes. Precise control of the time of delay of this entire process, one can pre-set the time of expression of genetic functions in a predicable manner. By using Asyl-Homoserine Lactones(AHLs) that can freely pass through the cell membrane as signal molecules, the time can be shared, in real time, by all cells within the pot. This way, receiver (timer) cells would take the action all at once in right timing, minimizing the distribution in each cell's response time. This year, we are trying to make a platform for generating an animated pictures using series of new timer cells we have constructed.:::2009
