UC_Davis:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Bacterial Secretion System Motivated the Goal of Managing Celiac:::The current estimate of the number of Americans with Celiac Disease/gluten intolerance is one out of 133. Not being able to digest gluten properly inside the small intestine leads to an immune system response that leads to a variety of symptoms. We have designed a bacterial secretion system that could be used in a probiotic organism to secrete an enzyme to degrade the allergen gliadin before it reaches the intestine. A putative advantage a probiotic treatment over direct enzyme therapy approaches is the potential for administering fewer doses, thus making it less troublesome, less costly, and more convenient.  Our secretion system consists of an inducible promoter, ribosome binding site, an extracellular anchor (ompA/INPNC), cleavage signal sequence, 6 HIS Tag and a terminator.  We have tested its behavior in E. coli on two proteins of varying sizes (GFP/Luciferase).:::2009
