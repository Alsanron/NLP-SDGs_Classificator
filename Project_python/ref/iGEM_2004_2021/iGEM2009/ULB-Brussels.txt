ULB-Brussels:::Europe:::Belgium:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::GluColi, a new generation of glue:::Whether you want to stop a leaking shipâ€™s hull, or repair a fractured bone, you will need a top quality, strong adhesive. Our project aims to create a new generation of glue. In contrast to most glues, ours is natural, biodegradable, efficient on wet surfaces and has exceptional resistance (up to 3 times better than super glue). It is composed of a polysaccharide released by a Gram-negative bacterium, Caulobacter crescentus. Our aim is to use BioBrickTM standard biological parts in order to create a new strain of Escherichia coli which will synthesise this adhesive material. Moreover we are going to use a new plasmid stabilisation technique, the StabyTM system developed by Delphi Genetics. This system allows us to avoid the use of antibiotics and has been shown to be more efficient as far as protein secretion is concerned.:::2009
