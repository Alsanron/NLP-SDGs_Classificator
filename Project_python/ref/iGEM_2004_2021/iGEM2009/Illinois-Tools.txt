Illinois-Tools:::North America:::United States:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Interactive Metabolic Pathway Tools:::Interactive Metabolic Pathway Tools (IMP Tools) is an open source, web based program that involves model-guided cellular engineering where new metabolic functions can be added to existing microorganisms. This program will assist in the design stage of synthetic biology research. IMP tools is written primarily in python using the Django web framework. It takes a user-defined input compound, output compound, and weighting scheme and determines the ideal pathway from the starting to the ending compound. Our program presents an exciting capability to help transform important processes in the world for applications ranging from bioremediation to biofuels.:::2009
