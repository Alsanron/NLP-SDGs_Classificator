Osaka:::Asia:::Japan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ColorColi: Painting tools toward bio-art:::Bio-art has appeared as a crossover of life science and art in 21st century. Such artworks can give rise to a number of issues and metaphors accompanying the advance of science and technology. Astonishingly, there are still few collaborations between bio-art and synthetic biology. In this context, we engineered Salmonella enterica cells to function as new painting tools in bio-art. Specifically, we try to program cells to automatically form various pattern and gradation of colors by sensing cell identity and density by means of quorum sensing. Moreover, we will extend these tools for actual paintings and artworks to consider the ethical implications such as ’view of life’. This collaborative project can show the social situation or question of life science.:::2009
