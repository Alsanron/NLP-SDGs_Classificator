Berkeley_Software:::North America:::United States:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Eugene, Spectacles, and Kepler: Managing Synthetic Biology Device Development:::Three crucial activities in synthetic biology are the creation of standardized parts, the construction and specification of devices from these parts, and the automatic assembly of these devices. Each of these activities requires software tools. Tools give users access to data as well as provide algorithmic support and abstraction to design large scale systems. We have created three software tools for these tasks. The first is a domain specific language called Eugene for the specification of biological constructs and rules for their creation. The second contribution is a visual design environment for device creation called Spectacles. Finally, we have created workflows for the Kepler design environment. This work is integrated within the Clotho design framework. We show that together they offer a powerful solution to the problems of today while also providing a path to the more exotic design activities of the future.:::2009
