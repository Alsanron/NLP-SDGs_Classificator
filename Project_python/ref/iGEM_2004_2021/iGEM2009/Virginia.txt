Virginia:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Arsenic Sequestration for Groundwater Decontamination:::As many as 137 million people in 70 countries may be affected by groundwater contaminated with arsenic. Existing treatment options are too expensive for the majority of affected areas. Therefore we are developing a bioremediation tool using Escherichia coli to absorb and bind arsenic and remove it from its surrounding environment. Natural and synthetic peptides are employed to sequester the toxic ions and a pump knockout ensures that arsenic stays in the cell. Measurement of growth capacity of the engineered strain in arsenic containing media and quantitative analysis of arsenic sequestration will be performed. Characterization and integration of an arsenic-responsive promoter will allow the sequestration system to dynamically adjust to current conditions. A simple, well-implemented system for biosequestration of arsenic may become part of a solution to a problem denying access to clean drinking water for many.:::2009
