Aberdeen_Scotland:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Synthetic Biology Approach to Pipe Repair: The Pico-Plumber:::Damage to inaccessible pipe systems, such as computer cooling circuits, is difficult to rectify. An Escherichia coli synthetic biology circuit for pipe repair was designed. Pipe breach detection and the restoration of pipe integrity were implemented through exploitation of chemotaxis, and cell lysis that releases a two-component protein-based glue (lysyl oxidase and tropoelastin). Control was achieved using an AND gate with quorum sensing and the lac inducer IPTG (released from the breach) as inputs. Deterministic and stochastic models of the genetic circuit, integrated with an agent-based model of E.coli cells, were used to define the effective radii of cell migration and timing of lysis. Constructed AND gate, quorum sensing and lysis timing modules were experimentally tested. The two-component glue concept was successfully validated using in vitro alpha-omega complementation of beta-galatosidase activity. Finally, a proposal for an igem.org-based parameter database was developed to aid the rapid identifation of BioBricks parameter values.:::2009
