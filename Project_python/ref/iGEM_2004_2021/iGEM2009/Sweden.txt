Sweden:::Europe:::Sweden:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Linguistic Cell: Sentence Parsing Bacteria:::Language is an essential part of our civilization. But making sense out of a series of words can only be achieved by certain rules that underlie the language. This set of rules is called a grammar. A grammar tells us how to order words in a meaningful way. These rules can be implemented as a Finite State Automaton (FSA), which for every new word input moves from the current state to the next until it reaches the end of input. We propose in our project a biological model which is based on this con- cept of language parsing from computational linguistics.:::2009
