TzuChiU_Formosa:::Asia:::United States:::Food/Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Midnight Apollo:::In Taiwan there are 9 power stations generating energy by coal, and produce 269.1 million tons of CO2 every year. Power stations are major causes of global warming. Therefore, we would like to create a ” biolight” system that can reduce CO2 production and attenuate degree of global warming. We plan to create a new organism that doesn’t need electricity and cause no pollution. We named it “Midnight Apollo”.  The “Midnight Apollo” will be turned on when surrounding area turns dark and will be turned off automatically when the environment becomes bright. The idea is based on two systems, Cph8 and aeoquorin/GFP. The Cph8 is regulated by visible light that can activate protein translation of an illuminating system. Subsequently, this illuminating system would use aeoquorin/GFP to light up the environment. We hope The Midnight Apollo could be applied in producing energy-saved Bio-streetlamp, emergency Biolighting, or Biosearchlight.:::2009
