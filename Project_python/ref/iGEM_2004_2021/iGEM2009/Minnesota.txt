Minnesota:::North America:::United States:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Computational synthetic biology: How the Synthetic Biology Software Suite can guide wet-lab experiments:::Synthetic biology has all the characteristic features of an engineering discipline: applying technical and scientific knowledge to design and implement devices, systems, and processes that safely realize a desired objective. Mathematical modeling has always been an important component of engineering disciplines: models and computer simulations can quickly provide a clear picture of how different components influence the behavior of the whole, reaching objectives quickly. Our presentation focuses on sophisticated mathematical models of synthetic biological systems that connect the targeted biological phenotype to the DNA sequence. The activities for iGEM 2009 included the development and testing of simulation tools that connect multiple levels of organization from molecules and their interactions, to gene regulatory relations, to emerging logical architectures in bacteria. We connected out tools to the Registry and validated the simulations with a significant experimental component, constructing and testing these synthetic biological systems in Escherichia coli.:::2009
