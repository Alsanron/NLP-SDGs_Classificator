Duke:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::One-Step Construction of a Bioplastic Production Pathway in E. coli:::A convenient ligation-free, sequence-independent one-step plasmid assembly and cloning method is developed [Quan J, Tian J (2009) Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning of Complex Gene Libraries and Pathways. PLoS ONE 4(7): e6441]. The strategy, called Circular Polymerase Assembly Cloning (CPEC), relies on polymerase extension to assemble and clone multiple fragments into any vector. Using this method, we are able to quickly assemble a metabolic pathway consisting of multiple enzymes and regulatory elements for the production of a biocompatible as well as biodegradable plastic polymer in E. coli.:::2009
