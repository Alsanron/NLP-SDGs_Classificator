VictoriaBC:::North America:::Canada:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Signal Integration: Applications of RNA Riboregulator Capabilities:::This project explores some of the ways that the secondary structure of messenger RNA can be used to control the rate of protein expression. The 32oC ribothermometer made by the 2008 TUDelft team will be coupled to fluorescent proteins to visually confirm temperature-dependent translation. The "ribolock" made by the 2006 Berkeley team will be tested at various temperatures to determine if it could double for use as a ribothermometer. Finally, a proof-of-concept NAND logic gate will be constructed: a ribolock will be used to interpret two concurrent environmental signals into an on/off control for mCherry output.:::2009
