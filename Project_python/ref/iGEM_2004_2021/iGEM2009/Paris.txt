Paris:::Europe:::France:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Message in a Bubble: a robust inter-cellular communication system based on outer membrane vesicles.:::Sending a message across the oceanâ€¦ Outer membrane vesicles (OMV), naturally produced by gram negative bacteria as E. Coli, are strong candidates for long-distance messaging. Our engineered communication platform consists of controlling OMV production by destabilizing membrane integrity through over-expression of specific periplasmic proteins (e.g., TolR). In order to control and modulate message content, we used fusions with OmpA signal sequence and the ClyA hemolysin as delivery tags. A targeting system was developed, based on the outer-membrane expression of Jun/Fos leucine zippers to control the vesicle flux between donor and recipient cells. Once received, the signal from incoming vesicles is transduced through a modified Fec pathway, whereby the receptor is provided by the OMV. Computational models provided insight to all of the above steps. Such reliable communications systems have wide biotechnological implications, ranging from targeted drugs delivery and detoxification to advanced division of labor or even cell-based computing.:::2009
