Valencia:::Europe:::Spain:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::iLCD: iGEM Lighting Cell Display:::The Valencia Team project consists of developing a “bio-screen” of voltage-activated cells, where every “cellular pixel” produces light. It is known that for instance neurons, cardiomyocites or muscle cells are able to sense and respond to electrical signals. These cells use a common second messenger system, calcium ion, which promotes a defined response when an electrical pulse is supplied to them. Nevertheless, these cultures present several technical disadvantages in order to make a handily use of them. Valencia team uses this property on yeast to produce luminescence as a response to electrical stimulus. This project constitutes the first time in which the electrical response of Saccharomyces and its potential applications are going to be tested. The obtained results will be used to build the first iLCD in history. We will reflect the perception that different groups of people have about Synthetic Biology in the survey http://igemvalencia.questionpro.com.:::2009
