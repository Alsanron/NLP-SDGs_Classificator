Tsinghua:::Asia:::China:::Health/Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Syn-genome Based Gensniper:::Our aim is to construct a targeted gene therapy vector with high cellular specificity, considerable capacity and the potential for mass production and universal modification. Analogizing the characteristics of bacteriophage lambda and adenovirus, we genomically engineered the fiber protein of adenovirus with the pC of bacteriophage lambda, with the knob region modified by cell-specific peptides generated by phage display (called targeted biobrick). After inducing the vector genome (generated by bottom-up or top-down approach) into BL21 DE3 E.coli strain, we applied a co-transformed therapeutic DNA (namely a cosmid with a capacity of 40-50 kb) for mass production of our targeted gene therapy vectors containing the desired genes to be delivered. With the targeted biobrick immediating the attachment and RGD domain immediating the internalization of the targeted vector, we are able to accomplish the targeted gene therapy.:::2009
