MoWestern_Davidson:::North America:::United States:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Rolling Clones: Can't get no SATisfaction:::Our team goal was to advance the developing field of bacterial computing. The Satisfiability (SAT) problem was the first mathematical problem proven to be NP-complete. A SAT problem is formed by connecting true-false variables with OR to form clauses and connecting clauses with AND. The goal is to determine if true-false values can be assigned to each variable to make the overall logical expression true. Our designed system uses frameshift suppressor tRNAs as inputs and frameshift suppressor leaders (FSLs) that process the inputs to enable the translation of fluorescent proteins exactly when an appropriate combination of inputs is present. The results illustrate the potential of engineered living cells to evaluate challenging mathematical problems. Our project also explored two aspects of synthetic biology education: a survey and analysis of public opinion and teachersâ€™ knowledge of synthetic biology and the design and construction of physical models of a frameshift suppressor.:::2009
