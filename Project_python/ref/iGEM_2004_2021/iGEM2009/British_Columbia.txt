British_Columbia:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of a modular, analog E. coli biosensor:::To date, efforts to design a whole-cell biosensor capable of detecting levels of one or more biological inputs and responding in an analog mode has been elusive. We have designed a system of synthetic constructs implemented in an E. coli chassis that will allow detection of continuously varying levels of a single metabolic input and report on the concentration with qualitative output depending on threshold levels of the input. Our system design utilizes RNA-level hairpin hybridization and antisense technologies linked to various reporters. Because our approach is modular and does not depend on either endogenous protein processing or exogenous RNA, we envision that such a system could find applications in many different fields, including environmental sensing, detection of diagnostic of therapeutic biomarkers, and systems biology.:::2009
