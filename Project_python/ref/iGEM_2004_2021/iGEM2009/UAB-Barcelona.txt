UAB-Barcelona:::Europe:::Spain:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A toxics biosensor. Could bacteria detect instantaneous and simultaneously several types of pollutants?:::We would like to construct a recombinant /Escherichia coli /strain that/ /could detect different aggressive pollutants, like toxics compounds. The first approach was the halogenated compounds (and more specifically chloroform) detector. Tap water usually contains it due to the chlorination process in drinking water production or other activities like swimming pools, etc. and it can become harmful to public health at high concentrations. /Nitrosomonas/ /europaea/â€™s promoters (/mbla/ and /clpb/) are specifically sensitive to chloroform, so coupling them with an output (a fluorescence protein) should allow quantifying its concentration. This was our first approximation towards our final aim of making a complete circuit that would allow to assign simultaneously to every pollutants family a certain color (fluorophore) thanks to the selective activation of different promoters.:::2009
