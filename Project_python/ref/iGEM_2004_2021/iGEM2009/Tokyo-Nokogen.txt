Tokyo-Nokogen:::Asia:::Japan:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Escape tedious work with Escherichia coli Auto Protein Synthesizer (ESCAPES).:::Tokyo-NokoGen has developed the Escherichia coli Auto Protein Synthesizer (ESCAPES), an E. coli machine that greatly simplifies the production of your favorite protein. We created a green light-activated actuator to respond to external light signals, as well as a riboregulator-based signal counter to count the number of flashes. In ESCAPES, the first green light flash induces the E. coli to self-aggregate, while the second flash causes them to auto-lyse, thus greatly simplifying the protein preparation process. The light-activated actuator was constructed by fusing the light responsive domain of the Synechocystis photoreceptor CcaS with the EnvZ histidine kinase domain. Self-aggregation is achieved by the induction of the Antigen43 gene, which we isolated from E. coli, while autolysis took advantage of the available BioBrick parts endolysin and holin. ESCAPES helps you “escape” from tedious protein preparation steps, such as centrifugation and cell disruption.:::2009
