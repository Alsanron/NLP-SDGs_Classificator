UNICAMP-Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Food/Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Microguards:::Industrial production processes based on microorganisms, such as biofuels, fine chemicals and enzymes, are threatened by contaminants that cause losses of up to 10% of the gross production. To solve this problem, the aim of our project is to engineer strains of the industrial workhorses E. coli and S. cerevisiae to recognize and destroy contaminants. The engineered yeast will recognize lactic acid bacteria contaminants, which greatly affect BrazilianÂ´s ethanol production. The presence of lactic acid will activate a lysozyme-based killing mechanism, effective against gram-positive contamination. The engineered E. coli will recognize contaminants based on a non-self recognition mechanism and a percentage of the population will differentiate into a killing lineage releasing colicins and endonucleases. The killing mechanisms will be regulated by promoter Py, probably activated by conjugation. The characterization of Py and a lactate-inducible promoter that is not subjected to glucose catabolic repression are the main challenges of our project.:::2009
