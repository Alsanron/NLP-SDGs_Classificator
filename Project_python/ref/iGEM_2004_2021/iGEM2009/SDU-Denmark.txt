SDU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Health/Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacto Bandage - Quorum-quenching S. Aureus Biofilm Formation, One Peptide at a Time:::Our goal is to create an E. coli strain, which inhibits Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation in wounds by producing RNA III-inhibiting-peptide (RIP). S. aureus is one of the largest causes of hospital infections, each year infecting millions of people around the globe. S. aureus is normally commensal, but can create biofilms on implanted medical devices and in post-operational wounds. Biofilm is increasingly hard to treat, as a result of growing resistance to many types of antibiotics. By manipulating E. coli to express a synthetic RIP peptide tagged with an export signal, we hope to reach this goal. RIP has been shown to hinder the quorum-sensing processes essential for biofilm development in S. aureus, thereby making it harder for the bacteria to cause infections. We propose making a bandage that contains our engineered bacteria behind a semipermeable membrane, allowing only small peptides such as RIP to pass through, into the wound.:::2009
