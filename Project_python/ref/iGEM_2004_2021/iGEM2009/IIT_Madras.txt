IIT_Madras:::Asia:::India:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PLASMID: Plasmid Locking Assembly for Sustaining Multiple Inserted DNA:::Any episome introduced into the cell shows segregational asymmetry accompanied with differential growth rates in the absence and presence of episome leading to an overall loss of the episomal unit in the absence of any selective pressure. We have designed a versatile system which maintains any given plasmid DNA in E.coli by using user-defined selection pressures, limited only by the presence of a response element to said pressure, like most antibiotics, certain chemicals and physical conditions. Depending on this selection pressure, a custom plasmid retaining system can be designed and co-transformed with the plasmid of interest to maintain it.  A similar system can be used to “lock” the function of a gene of interest, like a combination lock, which is unlocked only when the cultures are grown in a pre-determined order of selection pressures. In principle, using this locking system, multiple plasmids can be maintained using a single selection pressure.:::2009
