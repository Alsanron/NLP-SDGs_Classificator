NTU-Singapore:::Asia:::Singapore:::Health/Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Plaque Out!:::The NTU iGEM â€™09 team is proud to be working on a proposed alternative treatment for atherosclerosis. Our system, pLaqUe Out!, ideally based in a macrophage chassis, when introduced into the bloodstream, will be activated by a symptom typical of plaque buildup. Upon activation, our system will release a cholesterol degrading enzyme, a novel reporter protein and a vasodilator. The cholesterol degrading enzyme will break down the plaque. The reporter protein was chosen for expression because of its unique fluorescent property. This allows the plaque site to be identified in a manner similar to X-ray visualization. Finally the vasodilator will simultaneously dilate the blood vessels for better flow, as well as switch off the extended activity of our system. In the interests of time, this system is first modeled using E.Coli.:::2009
