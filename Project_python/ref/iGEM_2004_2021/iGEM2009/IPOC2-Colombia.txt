IPOC2-Colombia:::Latin America:::Colombia:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Molecular Device that Biodegrades Pesticides:::Different gene parts are being assembled, in order to construct a device that is able to mineralize and biodegrade recalcitrant pesticides. The device will be tested against different concentrations of different recalcitrant pesticides. Specific chassis will be assembled with gene parts from different metabolic pathways in order to finally reach mineralization of the pesticide. Different parameters, such as DNA concentration, ATP concetration, fluorescence of reporters, growth of bacterial device, and reduction of pesticide concentration, will be used to assess the efficacy of the device. Computational modeling will be used in order to complement the laboratory work.:::2009
