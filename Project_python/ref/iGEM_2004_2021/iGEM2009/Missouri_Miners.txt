Missouri_Miners:::North America:::United States:::Food/Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Synthetic Biology Apporach to Microbial Fuel Cell Development Utilizing E. Coli:::Optimization of electron shuffle to external surfaces such as anodes was a primary goal. Geobacter sulfurreducens happened to be our model bacteria due to its ability in nature to efficiently export electrons extracelluarly. E. coli was the chassis for this experiment due to its well documentation and the fact that its genome already containing some key proteins in our preferred pathway. The proteins, such as extracellular pilin, MacA, and many other cytochromes, which E. coli does not have were isolated from Geobacter sulfurreducens and introduced into E. coli to formulate the most optimal pathway for generating electromotive force in a microbial fuel cell apparatus. Some problems were faced concerning plasmid engineering and the simple fact that Geobacter is anaerobic and E. coli is aerobic. The current work includes production and optimization of a microbial fuel cell into which our modified bacteria will be placed.:::2009
