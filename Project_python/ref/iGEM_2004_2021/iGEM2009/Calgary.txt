Calgary:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Reprogramming a Language and a Community:::iGEM Calgary contributed a second quorum sensing (QS) system to the Registry. The Vibrio harveyi AI-2 QS signalling system has been engineered in Escherichia coli . Coupled with quorum quenching, our system allows us to target biofilm maintenance. The robustness of AI-2 signalling in E. coli was characterized in the lab and compared to data from mathematical models of the system built using the Matlab Simbiology toolbox and the emerging Membrane Computing framework in Mathematica. We also undertook community outreach projects in order to enhance the synthetic biology community. Specifically, the Second Life platform was used to create an educational tool to train future synthetic biologists in an accessible, user-friendly, virtual environment. Moreover, we examined the implications of our project in light of the recently proposed proactionary and precautionary frameworks with special focus on ethical, environmental, economic, legal and social (E3LS) impact.:::2009
