SupBiotech-Paris:::Europe:::France:::Health/Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Double vectorisation system (DVS):::As a part of the iGEM competition, we decided to develop a new process, allowing the protection of the active biological principle. This type of process exists already, and it is called a vector. It may be biological as viruses, or chemicals as polymeric nanoparticles. Whatsoever its nature, the vector encounters many problems : Stability, targeting, membrane passage, and the immune response. Therefore, we tried to achieve the ideal vector, being the most stable as possible, can easily penetrate its targets, and outwit the immune system. We have created a double vectorization system, by using jointly a bacteria and a phage. The first vector which is bacterial, will target the tissue, and resist to the immune system. The second vector is a phage, will be used for cell targeting and  membrane penetration. The combination of the two systems improves the intrinsic abilities of vectors, and offers new possibilities for applications.:::2009
