HKU-HKBU:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biomotor:::Much hope has been laid on nanorobots in their application in therapeutics in this era of catheters and minimally invasive surgery, but the problem remains that purely mechanical nanorobots lack sufficient locomotive power to perform their intended tasks. Our 'bio-motor' aims to breach this gap to bring a foundational advancement. In our model, Escherichia coli cells are engineered to specifically express streptavidin at pole(s), which allows cells to adhere in the same orientation to a microrotary motor through biotin-streptavidin interaction. Thus, with the propulsion generated by bacterial flagella, this synthetic device is capable to convert biological energy into mechanical work. Furthermore, the propulsion energy was programmed to be adjustable by controlling E.coli swimming speed, i.e. putting E.coli cheZ gene under the control of ptet. This technology has tremendous potential to be applied in various fields including biomedicine, bio-energy, and bioengineering.:::2009
