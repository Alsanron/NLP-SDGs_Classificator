Washington:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Ideal Protein Purification System:::The use of recombinant protein production using E. coli-based expression systems has revolutionized the fields of biotechnology and medicine. However, the ability to utilize such proteins hinges upon their capacity to be isolated from their expression systems. Our project aims to create an all-in-one protein expression and purification system using BioBrick standards to greatly simplify protein production for synthetic biologists, reducing the time and cost involved in standard protein purification methods. Our method uses a novel combination of two systems: secretion and display. By fusing two tags to the protein it can be secreted into the expression media, and subsequently directed to bind to the outside of the cell. To collect the pure proteins, cells only need to be spun down and then resuspended in an elution buffer, releasing the protein of interest. Our research exhibits the utility of synthetic biology for developing new techniques that improve upon established practices.:::2009
