Imperial College London:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The E.ncapsulator:::For iGEM 2009 the Imperial College London team present you with The E.ncapsulator; a versatile manufacture and delivery platform by which therapeutics can be reliably targeted to the intestine. Our E.coli chassis progresses through a series of defined stages culminating in the production of a safe, inanimate pill. This sequential process involves drug production, self-encapsulation in a protective coating and genome deletion. The temporal transition through each of these stages has been individually optimised by both media and temperature. The E.ncapsulator provides an innovative method to deliver any biologically synthesisable compound and bypasses the need for expensive storage, packaging and purification processes. The E.ncapsulator is an attractive candidate for commercial pill development and demonstrates the massive manufacturing potential in Synthetic Biology.:::2009
