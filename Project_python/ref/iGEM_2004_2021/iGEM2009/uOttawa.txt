uOttawa:::North America:::Canada:::Health/Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A probiotic Lactobacillus strain which produces cellulose:::This yearâ€™s project focuses on genetically engineering the bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum to produce cellulose, as a food additive. L. plantarum was selected as it is already commonly found in yogurt. The aim of generating this novel probiotic is to reduce human morbidity via the subsequent increase in dietary fibre in the gut. The sequestering of glucose for fibre production by L. plantarum provides the additional benefit of effectively reducing dietary sugars. We have successfully extracted the four genes that code for cellulose synthase from the Acetobacter xylinum. These genes were then placed under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, and transformed into Lactobacillus plantarum. Plasmid and genome based expression of the synthase genes are being evaluated and characterized. In the future, cellulose production assays, evaluation of biofilm formation, and in vivo testing will be performed to determine viability as potential health benefits.:::2009
