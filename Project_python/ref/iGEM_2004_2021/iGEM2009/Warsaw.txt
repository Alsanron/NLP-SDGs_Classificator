Warsaw:::Europe:::Poland:::Health/Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BacInVader â€“ a new system for cancer genetic therapy:::The main aim of our project is to design a model system based on genetically modified Escherichia coli, capable of entering into eukaryotic cells. We have developed a regulatory system composed of three distinct functional modules.  The whole system is activated by thermal degradation of the repressor protein, which leads to internalisation of E. coli by mammalian cells. When in endosome, pH-dependent two-component regulatory system activity enables the bacterium to escape to cytoplasm. Once the bacterium is in the cytoplasm some proteins are secreted due to expression of specific genes. In our case, secretion of p53 or bax proteins to mitochondria leads to apoptosis without cell cycle arrest thus enabling complementation of traditional chemotherapeutical agents, which affect only proliferating cells.:::2009
