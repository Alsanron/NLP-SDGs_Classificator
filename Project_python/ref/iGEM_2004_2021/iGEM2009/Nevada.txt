Nevada:::North America:::United States:::Health/Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cinnamicide: Producing a Natural Insecticide against Mosquito Larvae in E. coli and Duckweed:::Cinnamaldehyde is a natural insecticide against mosquito larvae that shows low toxicity towards other organisms. The objective of this project is to engineer the cinnamaldehyde biosynthetic pathway into E. coli to develop an inexpensive and readily available source of this compound. By introducing the genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate-CoA ligase, and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, it should be possible to produce cinnamaldehyde from available phenylalanine in E. coli. Once we have proven that we can produce cinnamaldehyde in E. coli, we will engineer cinnamaldehyde production in duckweed, a small aquatic plant. Because mosquito larvae feed on duckweed detritus, the engineered plant will serve as an excellent vehicle to deliver cinnamaldehyde for mosquito control.:::2009
