Johns_Hopkins-BAG:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synthetic yeast genome Sc2.0 and Build-A-Genome:::The JHU team will present the work of the Build-A-Genome course, powering the fabrication of synthetic yeast genome Sc2.0. Build-A-Genome provides students tools to meld seamless arrays of DNA into predesigned synthetic chromosomes. Our team develops new technologies for synthetic genomic fabrication. We developed a new standard, the Building Block, allowing production of much longer DNA sequences that can encode for more complicated cellular operations than allowed by current iGEM biobrick standards, as well as more standard iGEM-y devices. Through multiple rounds of homologous recombination we can create chromosome segments and eventually full chromosomes. We will present our improved methodology for building block synthesis, the software we have created to aid in our synthesis, applications of the yeast genome redesign and the new standard we have created. We will emphasize the Build-A-Genome course and its implications on future genomic technologies that both rely on and teach students.:::2009
