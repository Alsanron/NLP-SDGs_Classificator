RMIT_Australia:::Asia:::Australia:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Recombinant Peptide Expression System That Exploits Taq Polymerase as a carrier Molecule:::The RMIT 2010 iGEM team has attempted to create a biological system that will produce peptides at a low economic cost. This biological machine includes the use of a T7 promoter regulated by the Lac elements to express a soluble thermostable protein carrier molecule with an attached peptide of interest. Taq polymerase will be attached to this peptide via a thermolabile bond allowing the peptide to be cleaved using just temperature. The polymerase has furthermore been mutated in such a way to avoid interactions with nucleic acids, thus diminishing the effects it may have in the bacterial host cell. This system can be adopted and enhanced to produce libraries or large scales of peptides/drugs without the high price tag attached to then be distributed to large communities that otherwise cannot afford the cost of research nor treatment.:::2010
