Weimar-Heidelberg_Arts:::Europe:::Germany:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Super Cell - the synthetic biology supermarket:::Super Cell is a fictional supermarket offering speculative products which are all based on Synthetic Biology. The Super Cell website already gives us a glimpse of the products that will be available in local stores in the near future. By putting already existing and far-out in the future applications next to each other in a familiar environment such as a webshop, the project aims to improve public awareness about Synthetic Biology and at the same time foster a debate on how we want to see it manifested in our everyday lives. This kind of discussion, we feel, is urgent to have if we as a society want to influence how this powerful science will affect our future lives.:::2010
