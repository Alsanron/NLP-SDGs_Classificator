Toronto:::North America:::Canada:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Enhanced Catechol Degradation via Metabolic Channeling in E. coli:::Oil sands, consisting of a mixture of clay, sand and bitumen represent a significant fraction of remaining petroleum reserves. However, extracting the hydrocarbons requires large volumes of water which are then contaminated with naphthenic acids, heavy metals and residual hydrocarbons. These 'tailings' are acutely toxic to higher organisms, though some bacteria and algae can survive in these environs. Our knowledge of metabolic pathways capable of degrading such contaminants (bioremediation) is limited. However, the known pathways tend to be slow and inefficient. The breakdown of many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons generates a common intermediate, catechol that is further degraded to Acetyl-CoA. Metabolic channeling is an effect whereby intermediates are shuttled between enzymes in a pathway circumventing free diffusion into the cytosol. Here, we present a design, modeling and baseline experiments aimed at demonstrating optimization of catechol degradation using the principle of metabolic channeling in an E. coli proof of concept system.:::2010
