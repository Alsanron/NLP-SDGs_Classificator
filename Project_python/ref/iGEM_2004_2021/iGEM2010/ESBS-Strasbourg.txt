ESBS-Strasbourg:::Europe:::France:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A light-controllable specific protein degradation system as new standard for synthetic biology:::The aim of our project is to engineer a new fundamental component that could be universally used to build more complex or more controllable biological circuits inside chassis organisms. This new component consists of the E. coli protease ClpXP to which the phytochrome B (PhyB) of Arabidopsis thaliana is fused. Any given protein can be degraded as long as it is fused with the Phytochrome Interacting Factor (PIF)-degradation tag biobrick. The activity of this system is tightly controlled and switchable by light inducement.:::2010
