Duke:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering a Robust Genetic Switch:::Our project aims to produce a genetic transistor which, unlike most bistable switch mechanisms available to synthetic biologists, does not exhibit basal regulatory noise. The transistor will be based on a protein sequestration pathway that uses leucine zippers (bZIPs) Fos and Jun alongside synthetically designed dominant negatives thereof, eliciting a response dynamic similar to a signal titration. Furthermore, we intend to apply such transistors to function as signal amplifiers due to the ultrasensitive responses that can be generated in this mechanism. For the application of this project and others, we are also developing a high throughput gene expression screen for synthetic gene libraries and codon variants, allowing for the possibility of tunable gene expression levels.:::2010
