Slovenia:::Europe:::Slovenia:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DNA coding beyond triplets:::Slovenian iGEM team is designing a cell based system in which we will be able to control the sequence of steps in a multi-step biosynthetic pathway. Our novel approach is designed in such a way that it will enable control of the order and sequence of reactions in a particular biosynthetic pathway. Our goal is to use synthetic biology approach to significantly increase the speed , efficiency or direction of a particular biosynthetic reaction. We will also attempt to use our approach to create a novel chemical product of the existing biosynthetic reactions. This novel cell based device represents a universally applicable principle and offers a significant improvement of current industrially important biotechnological processes. Similar approach will be applied to demonstrate the advantages for cell based oscillators and information within the cell.:::2010
