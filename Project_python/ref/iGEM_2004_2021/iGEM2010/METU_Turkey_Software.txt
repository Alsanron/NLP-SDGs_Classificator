METU_Turkey_Software:::Europe:::Turkey:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BIO-GUIDE:::As Synthetic Biology is on the rise, iGEM also grows up and part numbers in partsregistry increase with submission of more constructs each year. Our first milestone is to perform more useful standardization on parts-entry due to facing some difficulty while running our algorithms. We also used Software Requirements Specification, Software Design Description and Quality Plan approaches to define requirements for each part and building blocks, risks and design art elements of the designed software program. Next, we have used graph theoretic modeling to visualize relations between parts and to standardize representation of the parts as much as possible. It will help us while trying to find input-output relations between either biobrick parts or constructs. By this way, our program as a Biobrick Guide will provide alternative pathway choices to users for construction of the most reliable devices with respect to given inputs and expected outputs.:::2010
