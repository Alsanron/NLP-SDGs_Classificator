Stanford:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::EscheRatio coli: Novel Sensors to Detect a Ratio of Environmental Inputs:::The majority of sensors currently used in synthetic biology respond to the absolute concentration of a chemical. However, many important biological processes are governed by the ratio between the concentrations of multiple chemicals. To create systems capable of responding to more complex input data, the Stanford team designed two types of ratio-measuring sensors. The first sensor utilizes two unique small RNAs to inhibit the transcription of two operons, each responding to an environmental factor and having a specific flourescent protein (or output gene). By manipulating the number of small RNAs produced, a tipping point between outputs can be established for different input ratios. The second sensor uses a phosphorylatable protein to control the transcription rate of an output promoter. By linearly associating two chemical inputs to the production of a kinase and a phosphatase, the ratio of the two environmental factors indirectly dictates the activity of the output promoter.:::2010
