Bielefeld-Germany:::Europe:::Germany:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MARSS - Modulated Acetosyringone Receptor Sensor System Defining Spiciness since 2010:::The iGEM-Team Bielefeld is going to modulate an Agrobacteria receptor in Escherichia coli in order to detect capsaicin which is responsible for the hot taste of chilies. The intention is to make the spiciness in fare visible using a gradient light signal. The original receptor is the acetosyringone detection system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. By using directed evolution, we aim to modulate the receptor binding domain to enable the interaction with similar phenolic substances like capsaicin. Brought into E. coli, this modulated system will induce light effects of different intensities - depending on the concentration of capsaicin respectively the spiciness of the sample. The capsaicin detection is a proof of principle concept. We aim to establish a system, which is characterized by a high sensitivity and specifity and is capable to replace slow and high priced diagnostics or analytic methods. The targets of the system could be allergy-triggers, explosives and toxins.:::2010
