Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Fantastic Lysisbox:::Genetic engineered cell death is imperative for biotechnological usage, such as bioremediation area. For controlling cell death, we designed 'Lysisbox' consists of a pair of modules: 'Killer gene' and 'Anti-killer gene.' As the Killer gene for E.coli, we noted the lysis cassette [SRRz/Rz1gene] of lambda phage coding for a holin and an endolysin. The holin forms pores in the inner membrane, and the endolysin access to and degrade the peptidoglycan by passing through the pores, leading the E.coli to death. As the Anti-killer gene, we chose S-TMD1 coding for a dominant-negative holin that inhibits the formation of the fatal pores. The balance of these two genes expression level has a key of the E.Coli's life or death. In addition, such controllable membrane pores must show critical functions for all living organisms with lipid membranes. 'Lysisbox' will contribute a lot to future projects, thus you must say 'FANTASTIC!!!':::2010
