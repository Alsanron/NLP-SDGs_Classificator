KIT-Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.coli Pen: Draw with your own color:::Our team, KIT-Kyoto suggests an 'E.coli Pen' as a new Art Tool. This brand-new pen uses no ink but medium in which genetically modified E.coli has been cultured. The Pen is able to express more than four colors in various intensities with single bacterial culture. This will be achieved by constructing plasmids carrying genes coding for four different fluorescent proteins under the control of seven promoters having different sensitivity to oxidative stress. The E. coli carrying these plasmids will produce different colors with various intensities by differentially responding to the gradient of hydrogen peroxide treatment. Different from previous passive BioArt in iGEM, the genetically engineered 'E. coli Pen' provides an active and wonderful tool for us to purely enjoy the Art having a feeling for biotechnology.:::2010
