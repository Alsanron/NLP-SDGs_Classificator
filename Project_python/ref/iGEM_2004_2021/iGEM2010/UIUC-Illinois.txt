UIUC-Illinois:::North America:::United States:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::sRNAs in Artifical Gene Circuits and Bioremediation Applications:::Previously, the majority of engineered, genetic regulation within bacteria has been achieved through the use of transcriptional regulators. However, the recent explosion of interest from the emerging field of RNA regulation provides new insights into the dynamic nature of genetic regulation. Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) comprise the chief regulatory mechanism for eliciting primary responses to environmental stresses. Acting in conjunction with proteins such as hfq (RNA chaperone), sRNAs provide a cost-effective, specific and rapid response that is essential in targeting gene transcripts for regulation. The Illinois iGEM team has worked to create a set of endogenous and artificial sRNA regulator Biobricks to be used in cellular stress responses and which contribute to bistability in artificial gene circuits. A bacterial metal detection system of arsenic and gold demonstrates the capacity of sRNA regulation in artificial gene circuits.:::2010
