British_Columbia:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Multi-pronged Approach to Eliminating Staphylococcus aureus Biofilms Using Recombinant Bacteriophage and Biofilm-Degrading Enzymes:::Biofilms are ubiquitous microbial communities that often display greater resistance and pathogenicity compared to individual microbes. Biofilms commonly cause complications in both industrial and medical settings and represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality. A synthetic biology approach to tackling biofilms has only recently been applied to Escherichia coli biofilms. To eliminate the more clinically relevant Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, our team aims to break new ground at iGEM by using S. aureus as a model host and developing a standard for genetically engineering bacteriophages. Our design incorporates DspB, a biofilm matrix-degrading enzyme into the _13 phage genome, which is altered to operate under the regulation of the S. aureus agr quorum sensing pathway and thus upon contact with biofilms. As a complement, we have also developed a mathematical model that simulates the dynamics of our system under different conditions.:::2010
