Tec-Monterrey:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of a genetic frame for the creation of a concentration-sensitive bacterial sensor:::Bacterial reporters or whole-cell bacterial sensors have always been an area of application for genetic manipulation and synthetic biology. The first bacterial reporters appeared 20 years ago, although these early tests didn't use genetically modified microorganisms. Further research and development in the area of genetic engineering has resulted in newer and more sophisticated bacterial sensors, capable of detecting the presence of contaminants, sugars and amino acids in different media such as soil and water. However, most bacterial sensors can only detect the presence of a compound at a certain concentration and currently there are few documented bacterial sensors that can detect and report different concentrations of the compound of interest. Our objective was to develop a genetic frame, compatible with the BioBrick standard, for the creation of a concentration-sensitive bacterial sensor. In the process we also developed and characterized BioBricks for two new families of phage activators.:::2010
