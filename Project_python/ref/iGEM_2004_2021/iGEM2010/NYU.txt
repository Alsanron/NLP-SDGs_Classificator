NYU:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ImmunoYeast : antibody discovery and production in one simple system:::The goal of our project is to increase the speed and efficiency of the antibody discovery process. We constructed a yeast strain that is capable of screening a library of antibody fragments against an antigen of interest, processing the antibody genes through recombination and secreting an easily-purified form of antibody protein for research use. Our hope is to demonstrate the feasibility of using the yeast cell to not only discover antibodies but to provide a streamlined processing unit that can quickly and easily transition from antibody discovery to protein production.:::2010
