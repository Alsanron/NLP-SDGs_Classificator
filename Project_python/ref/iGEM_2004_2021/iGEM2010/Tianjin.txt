Tianjin:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Lignin degreadation yeast:::We make some Saccharomyces cerevisiae which could synthesize lignin degrading enzymes and put them on the out surface of the yeast through the yeast surface display technology. Those cells, which propagate themselves rapidly, could affix to the wood cellulose material and begin to degrade the lignin quickly with the enzymes of their surface. This yeast will make the lignin degradation pretreatment more secure to our environment and lower the cost. The products of this process are celluase and hemicellulase, which could be used to produce alcohol fuels and papermaking in the next steps. Yeast pharmacist: What we what to design is a model which can facilitate the discovery of various drugs in the traditional Chinese Medicine, the active components of which are usually unknown. Since nicotine receptor is the target of many medicines, especially medicines for smoking cession, our system aims at helping to find medicines that could act as partial agonist.:::2010
