Tokyo_Tech:::Asia:::Japan:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The 'Wolfman' Coli:::Have you heard the legend of 'The Wolfman'? They're ordinary man at daytime, but suddenly transform into a ferocious wolf in the full-moon night. Our project aim to imitate the character of Wolfman, more specifically, designing two types of E.coli that help each other to survive at daytime, whereas competing at nighttime when cocultured. Firstly, two cells have different types of antibiotic-resistance, however this expression is repressed in absence of outer stimulation. Two factors of stimulation, cell density and light, are required at once to activate the antibiotic resistance. We took advantage of photoregulation system (Cph1-EnvZ) to make sure downstream promoter is activated with light. This promoter is followed by circuit designed to sense the cell density of its counterpart and activate the counterpart cell's antibiotic-resistant gene. With this entire system, we could observe the 'Wolfman' Coli in our laboratory working by AND gate of two stimulation.:::2010
