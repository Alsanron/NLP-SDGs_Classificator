NYMU-Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SpeedyBac:::For iGEM2010, our NYMU-Taipei team is interested in resolving the fundamental need of rapid reporting response from bacterial gene expression. Our goal is to speed up the reporting response of bacterial gene expression through shortening the time needed for routine iGEM experiments. We intend to construct systems aimed at reducing experimental time and increasing efficiency of construction production. To achieve the goal, our design process is split up into three parts: Riboswitch, mRNA Binding, and SsrA. (1) Riboswitch - faster production of proteins by inducing the translation of pre-transcribed RNA molecules. (2) mRNA Binding - using mRNA aptamers and split GFP/RFP-eIF4A reporter systems to show faster promoter activity or the expression of mRNA transcripts. (3) SsrA - fast, specific, and constitutive proteolysis achieved by engineering fluorescent proteins with LVA tags.:::2010
