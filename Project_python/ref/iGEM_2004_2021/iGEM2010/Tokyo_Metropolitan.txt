Tokyo_Metropolitan:::Asia:::Japan:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Life Design: Fine Clothing, Color Housing and Delicious Food by using E. coli:::Our team theme is 'Life Design.' We make our life comfortable by following three projects. [E. coli Fiber Project - Fine Clothing] Bacteria cellulose is very useful material. People try to get bacteria cellulose. But it is high cost and low efficiency. Aim of our project is to make low cost and high efficiency cellulose factories where E.coli works! [E. coli Pattern Formation Project - Color Housing] Give an experimental proof of Turing pattern. We use two kinds of E. coli and make various patterns! The patterns are dynamic and stereoscopic!? [E. coli Rice Master Project - Delicious Food] Japanese like rice, our staple food. We are particular about the quality of rice. Rice Master of E. coli judges the quality of rice. In future, other kinds of food 'Master' provide us some information about quality of foods.:::2010
