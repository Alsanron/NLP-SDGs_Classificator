UPO-Sevilla:::Europe:::Spain:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacterial Crowding:::The possibility of specifically targeting bacteria to biological or abiotic surfaces is a promising technology of potential use in therapy, pest control and bioremediation, among others. However, since in most cases bacteria are not drawn towards their targets, the possibility of specific interaction is limited to those bacterial cells that randomly collide with the surface, thus requiring a high bacterial population to achieve efficient targeting. On the other hand, most bacteria are specifically attracted by gradients of a variety of chemicals, thus achieving high cell densities in the areas where the chemoattractants are present at higher concentration. The aim of 'Bacterial Crowding' is to exploit chemotaxis for directing a relatively small population of bacteria to interact efficiently with a non-diffusible target exposed on a biotic or abiotic surface.:::2010
