VT-ENSIMAG_Biosecurity:::North America:::United States:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Design and development of the GenoTHREAT gene sequence screening software:::In order to mitigate the biosecurity risks associated with the potential dual use of gene synthesis, the U.S. Government published a draft version of a 'Screening Framework Guidance for Synthetic Double-Stranded DNA Providers.' This document outlines a minimal DNA sequence screening protocol that gene synthesis companies are encouraged to use prior to fulfilling an order. The protocol relies on the 'Best Match' method developed in response to the limitations of other screening protocols previously proposed by trade organizations. The objective of the 'Best Match' method is to identify sequences which are uniquely related to Select Agents or Toxins. The GenoTHREAT software is being developed in accordance with the Government guidance and, to our knowledge, is the first implementation of the sequence screening procedure outlined in the guidance. Although software characterization has elucidated both strengths and limitations, GenoTHREAT appears to be a viable tool for sequence screening.:::2010
