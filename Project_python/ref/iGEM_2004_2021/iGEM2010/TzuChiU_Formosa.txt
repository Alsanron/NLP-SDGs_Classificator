TzuChiU_Formosa:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Nutrient synthesizer:::Global nutrient deficiency issue has never been solved for centuries, 5.6 millions children died from malnutrition and hunger yearly(UN statistics). We aim to create a synthetic biological device to produce nutrient for people who needed. The device contains sensing, synthesis, and lysis system which is operated in E.coli. When the device senses appropriate signal, it will activate synthesis system to produce nutrient. When products reach a critical mass, the lysis system will take over to release nutrient. We take_-carotene as one of our source of nutrient, as it is the precursor of vitamin A. 40 millions people worldwide suffer night blindness each year because vitamin A deficiency. In our device, we use hydrophobic promoter as our sensing system (_-carotene is lipid soluble), and lysogenic enzyme as our lysis system. Our next step is to transform our synthesizer to lactobacillus which is harmless to human so we could solve the global food crisis problem.:::2010
