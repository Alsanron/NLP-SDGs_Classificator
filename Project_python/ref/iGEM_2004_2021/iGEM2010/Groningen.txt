Groningen:::Europe:::Netherlands:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hydrophobofilm --- a self assembling hydrophobic biofilm:::Surface hydrophobicity is a useful property and has many applications. Hydrophobicity keeps a surface clean and dry preventing micro-organisms from attaching to a surface. Most chemical coatings used presently are costly or harmful to the environment. Our idea is to engineer Bacillus subtilis which when applied to a surface, automatically forms a hydrophobic biofilm coating. Succesful biofilm formation will serve as a trigger for the expression of hydrophobic proteins called Chaplins. The result of this process will be a rigid biofilm with embedded hydrophobic proteins, leaving a coated surface which is extremely hydrophobic. Producing a self-assembling hydrophobic biofilm is cheap, there is no high-tech treatment involved and there are no hazardous chemicals necessary to attain a hydrophobic coating. Applications of this hydrophobic biofilm range from anti-fouling coatings on ships to anti-corrosion coatings used to protect sensory equipment.:::2010
