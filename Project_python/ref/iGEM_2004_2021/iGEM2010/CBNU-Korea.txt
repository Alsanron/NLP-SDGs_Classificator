CBNU-Korea:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Design and Construction of Synthetic Minimal Chromosomes:::Most of all bacteria have single circular chromosome. But some bacteria have two or more circular chromosomes. In Vibrio cholerae, there are two circular chromosomes, chromosome I and chromosome II, and each perfectly works as a chromosome. We've been motivated by V.cholerae's two chromosome system. So we employed some essential genes, parA, parB, parS, dif, and origin of chromosome II and contstructed a tiny miniature of V.cholerae's two chromosome system in E.coli, using BioBrick assembly method. Also, we built software and database of essential genes for designing of minimal synthetic chromosome and genome. Essential gene informations were gathered from some databases, DEG, EGGS, NCBI and java language was used. Our final goal is making useful, safe and stable synthetic minimal genome for Synthetic Minimal Cell. Although our project is feeble, we extremely believe that our project in this year will be worth first step for that.:::2010
