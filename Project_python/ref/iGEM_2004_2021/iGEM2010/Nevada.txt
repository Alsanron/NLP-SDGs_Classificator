Nevada:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of Plant Biosensors for Environmental Monitoring Using Nicotiana tabacum Protoplasts as Transgenic Plant Models:::The 2010 Nevada iGEM team has three objectives for this year's competition. One, we want our highlight to be the first team to provide the iGEM registry with stress-inducible promoters to be used in plants. These promoters can be valuable tools in monitoring the environment for salt, heavy metals, temperature, and more. Second, we want to develop a real-time monitoring model of these stress-inducible promoters by having fluorescent reporters linked to their expression. Current research typically uses microarray, a technique that takes a 'snapshot' of a system, where as we want to hold a 'video camera' up to specific genes. Third, we will show the advantages of using Nicotiana tabacum protoplasts (NT cells). Our NT cell system provides a faster, cheaper, and safer method of obtaining a transgenic plant model than transforming an actual plant, benefits future iGEM teams may want to take into consideration.:::2010
