Stockholm:::Europe:::Sweden:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Spot on Treatment:::For our first participation in iGEM, Team Stockholm have explored the possibilities to fight skin disorders using novel cell-penetrating peptides. We have focused on vitiligo in where pigment cells are destroyed, resulting in white patches on the skin. Studies have shown that vitiligo patients have decreased levels of antioxidants and elevated levels of antibodies targeting the pigment cells in the skin. We have used synthetic biology to fuse cell-penetrating peptides to proteins that are deficient in skin of vitiligo patients. The cell-penetrating peptides will aid in passing the proteins through the skin and target the pigment cells to reach repigmentation. Currently there are no treatments like ours for vitiligo patients. However, we strongly believe that synthetic biology can help bacteriotherapy getting a major role in fighting several skin disorders in the future, and that our first explorations in this field inspires others to continue exploring.:::2010
