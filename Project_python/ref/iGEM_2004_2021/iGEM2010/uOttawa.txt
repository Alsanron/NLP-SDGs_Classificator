uOttawa:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Characterization of toggle switch components for use in engineered, tunable networks:::The generation rate of complex genetic networks has slowed in the past decade due to a lack of characterized components. We aim to solve this issue by contributing a library of well-characterized yeast toggle switch components with varying dynamics. In order to characterize these switches, each of the two repressors, driven by mutually repressible promoters, is tagged with a distinct fluorescent protein that can be detected and quantified using flow cytometry. To expand the BioBrick database we will submit functionally-tested yeast-enhanced fluorescent proteins, repressors, and a library of repressible promoters. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of these components in fine tuning genetic networks, we hope to use these toggle switches to build a DNA damage sensor with varying levels of sensitivity. We also describe novel methods for BioBrick construction based on natural homologous recombination mechanisms in S. cerevisiae.:::2010
