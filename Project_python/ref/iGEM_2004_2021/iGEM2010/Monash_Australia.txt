Monash_Australia:::Asia:::Australia:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Design and construction of a biological ethylene generation device:::The Monash University iGEM team has identified that ethylene, a common organic compound, is under increasing production demands by the plastics and food industries. Current methods of production are energy intensive, and rely on processing of non-renewable fossil fuels. However many plants produce ethylene from L-methionine by use of the Yang cycle, which has lower energy requirements. We aim to introduce the genes that are required for ethylene production into Escherichia coli under the control of an inducible promoter, in an attempt to develop a cleaner and non-energy intensive method of production. At lower yields, this device may also provide a useful module for signal transduction between the E. coli and plants.:::2010
