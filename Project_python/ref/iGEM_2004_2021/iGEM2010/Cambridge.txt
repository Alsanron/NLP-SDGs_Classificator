Cambridge:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.glowli: a bioluminescent future:::Bioluminescence is one of the most striking spectacles in the natural world. Taking genes from fireflies and Vibrio fischeri, the Cambridge team have constructed BioBricks which allow light output at a wide range of wavelengths. Firefly luciferase is already used as a reporter, but requires continual addition of the expensive substrate luciferin. We have created codon-optimised operons combining luciferase with a luciferin regenerating enzyme (LRE). This allows recycling of luciferin for sustained light output. In addition, we have submitted the first lux operon to the registry, taking genes from bacteria which form symbiotic relationships with squid. This is the first BioBrick to emit light without addition of substrate and can be used as a reporter with any promoter. These two approaches will allow cheaper assays with brighter signals. We also hope they will lay the foundations for natural light sources that help to address the energy crisis facing our planet.:::2010
