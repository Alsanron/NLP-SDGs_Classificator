HokkaidoU_Japan:::Asia:::Japan:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Dr. E. coli: World Smallest Protein Injector:::Our project is on Type lll Secretion Apparatus which is one of the most amazing biological devices. It can pass a whole protein molecule from a bacterial cell to a target eukaryotic cell. This apparatus which looks like a syringe is an organelle of pathogenic gram-negative bacterium such as Salmonella and Yersinia. We are aiming at making this device available for E. coli. Because it will not involve usage of pathogenic strains, it will be safer to use. To transfer T3SS functionally from Salmonella to E.coli it is essential to integrate at least 40kb of DNA fragment coding more than 20 proteins. So we will make suggestions about how to optimize E.coli transformation method for large size DNA fragments. Also we will show how to construct protein for secretion and how to measure if it is really secreted using GFP.:::2010
