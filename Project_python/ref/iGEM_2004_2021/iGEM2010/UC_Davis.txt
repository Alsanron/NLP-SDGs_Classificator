UC_Davis:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering a Spatial Oscillatory Network for Spontaneous Two-Dimensional Pattern Generation in E. Coli:::Genetic circuits regulating spatial pattern formation play vital roles in organismal development throughout the eukaryotic domain. We believe that we can use related design principles to synthesize spatial patterning in bacterial populations. Previous genetic devices have allowed bacterial lawns to faithfully reproduce spatial patterns and, with the inclusion of of cell-cell communication, to construct of a bacterial edge detection device. Our device builds on these ideas but differs significantly by aspiring to produce complex spatial patterns in response to simple stimuli rather than by copying the input stimulus. This genetic circuit could drive the creation of biological systems capable of generating spatially varying gene expression profiles in response to simple chemical stimuli. Such devices should have application in fields such as nanofabrication, environmental engineering and tissue engineering.:::2010
