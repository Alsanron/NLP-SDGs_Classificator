Tsinghua:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.mmunology: Bacteria-based Antibody Production System:::Tsinghua iGEM 2010 team focus on simulating antibody generation and selection technology with Bacteria, thus develops a new Antibody Production Method. Traditional antibody production method is expensive and time consuming. Thanks to the simple and easy-to-industrialize nature of prokaryotic systems, our antibody production system, once established, will facilitate the cheap and efficient production of antibodies. Production of antibodies in the mammalian immune system involves two steps: Random production of a large numbers of antibodies; Selection of a specific antibody matching the antigen. Therefore, our Antibody Production System would be composed of two devices: Module I: Generation of antibody library; Module II: Selection of specific antibodies.:::2010
