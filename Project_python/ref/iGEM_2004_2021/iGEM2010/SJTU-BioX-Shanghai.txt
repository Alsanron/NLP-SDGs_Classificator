SJTU-BioX-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synthetic-biological Approaches to Osteoarthritis:::Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease in which joint matrix is degraded and chondrocytes undergo disordered and hypertrophic differentiation, symptoms including joint pain, tenderness and stiffness. We proposed two synthetic-biological approaches to OA, one with a eukaryotic genetic circuit and another prokaryotic. Both circuits are composed of three systems: 'Detector', 'Actuator' and 'Supervisor'. As for Detector, we built tissue-specific promoters in the eukaryotic circuit, while inflammation factors are employed as signals of OA in the prokaryotic circuit. The same Actuator shared by two circuits generates proteins col2a1, which replenishes the degraded matrix, and oct4, which reverses the disordered differentiation. The eukaryotic Supervisor part has an original design in which a photo-sensitive cation channel crosstalks with certain cellular signaling pathways, resulting in the light-controlled expression of col2a1 and oct4; in the counterpart of prokaryotic circuit, both injected inducers and over-population lead the engineered bacteria to suicide, thus attenuating possible side effects.:::2010
