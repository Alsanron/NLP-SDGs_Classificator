UT-Tokyo:::Asia:::Japan:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.coli solves SUDOKU:::Information-processing by means of cellular machinery has flourished recently, as exemplified by the creation of bacteria capable of counting or performing AND/OR boolean logic. However, the successful assembly of organisms that integrate multiple (>3) pieces of information into an elongated AND gate has yet to be seen. Our '4C3 leak-switch' realizes such a tool with the use of homologous recombination and leaky transcriptional terminators. This switch turns on only when three of four types of information are transmitted, regardless of the order of transmission, and outputs differently depending on the combinations of input. Our current project aims at creating bacteria that collectively solve the popular puzzle game Sudoku. This aim is achieved by combining this switch with our second subproject, the 'signal-virus,' which relays information only to the relevant targets, based on an antisense-RNA key system. This system realizes parallel-computing and we believe will greatly advance the field of information-processing.:::2010
