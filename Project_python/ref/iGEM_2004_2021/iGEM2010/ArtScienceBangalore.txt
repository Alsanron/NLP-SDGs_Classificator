ArtScienceBangalore:::Asia:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synthetic and Post-Natural Ecologies:::In our second year as artists and designers at IGEM, we have decided to investigate the consequences of creating a Synthetic Ecology: an ecosystem in which organisms designed for a techno-scientific environment interact with organisms in the wild. C.elegans live on a diet of a variety of bacteria, E.coli being such strain. Genetically-modified E.coli can be fed to C.elegans which can then express any double stranded RNA of interest. The dsRNA can knock off specific genes in C.elegans. In our experiments, we are using C.Elegans as a marker to expres a range of external factors in two sets, temperature and IPTG. On a utilitarian level, our project investigates the use of C.elegans as a visual marker for changes in environmental conditions. On a more critical level, C.elegans is used to study the consequences of interactions between engineered organisms and the 'natural' world.:::2010
