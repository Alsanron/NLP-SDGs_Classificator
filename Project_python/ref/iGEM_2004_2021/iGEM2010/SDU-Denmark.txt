SDU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Flow-E, a bacterial flow inducer:::When generating flow through a microcapillary tube, engineers are met with problems in generating force and keeping fluids mixed or separated. Inspired by an article by Kim et al on bacterial carpets that could generate flow, we have designed a biological system in E. coli that can induce flow and increase mixing in a fluid, essentially working as a microscopic flow actuator. The actuator uses E. coli's flagellas and can be switched on and off using light. Our system is composed of several novel parts: a photosensor, that controls the tumbling frequency of E. coli's flagella via chemical pathways; a hyperflagellation part, to increase the number of flagella and the power of the system; a retinal producing part, that works with the 2009 Cambridge's iGEM team's _-Carotene brick, which we have helped further characterize. Our human practices focused on watermarking synthetic genetic material and improve security in synthetic biology.:::2010
