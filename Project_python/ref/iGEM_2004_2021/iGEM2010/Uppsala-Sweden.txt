Uppsala-Sweden:::Europe:::Sweden:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Living Clock:::The Living Clock project aims to build a biological entity that could process a specific input signal and responds accordingly. We designed a set of concentration detectors that measures different range of the input signal and respond only to a specific concentration interval. By combining and spatio-temporal coordinating such concentration detectors we attempt to construct a biological clock that display time. The concentration band components themselves would work as a quantitative sensor that can work in combination other chemical sensors, such as toxic metals to life saving enzymes, which previous iGEM teams have come up with. Apart from this utility, we believe the concentration band detect sensor in different configurations can allow the creation of complex circuits ranging from simple oscillators to complex data processing machines which can exist on the same system without affecting other components of the system owing to its concentration band specificity.:::2010
