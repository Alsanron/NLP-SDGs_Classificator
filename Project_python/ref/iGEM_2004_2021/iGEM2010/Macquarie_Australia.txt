Macquarie_Australia:::Asia:::Australia:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering a Bacteriophytochrome switch - creating a controllable E. coli chameleon:::Photoreceptors are utilized by almost every organism to adapt to their ambient light environment. Our aim is to engineer a novel, reversible molecular 'light switch' within E. coli by introducing a photoreceptor from non-photosynthetic bacteria (Deinococcus radiodurans and Agrobacterium tumafaciens). By cloning the bacteriophytochrome coupled with heme- oxygenase, an enzyme producing biliverdin, the created colonies are able to respond to red and far-red light environments. This novel approach will result in the colour of E. coli to 'switch' from blue to green reversibly. Our E. coli chameleon will serve as a fundamental 'bio-brick' for future applications by providing a simple and photo-reversible switch.:::2010
