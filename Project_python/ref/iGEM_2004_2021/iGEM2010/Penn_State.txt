Penn_State:::North America:::United States:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacterial Fireworks: Oxygen Bio-sensing and Signal Amplification:::Oxygen contamination can be a challenge for many anaerobic processes. To monitor these processes we created and oxygen bio-sensor in E. coli which produces an anaerobic fluorescent protein. The task of creating an oxygen bio-sensor is compounded by the fact that oxygen diffusion through many substances is very limited; so oxygen contamination can be undetected due to a response which is too 'soft' . To combat this, we enabled our sensor to induce this response in non-oxygenated bacteria via the lux system; thus amplifying the signal and producing a bio-alarm which is sufficiently 'loud' to not be missed. To accomplish this goal we characterized the response characteristics of the many different Lux components in the parts-distribution. This system can be easily inverted to monitor oxygen depletion in oxygen dependent processes.:::2010
