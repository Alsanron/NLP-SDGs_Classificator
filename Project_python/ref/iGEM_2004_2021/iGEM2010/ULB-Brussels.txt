ULB-Brussels:::Europe:::Belgium:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hydrocoli : How to make wastewater our new green energy source:::Current hydrogen production processes are not sufficiently energy-efficient to provide a viable source of green energy. Our project is to design a genetically engineered Escherichia coli which could be used for hydrogen production. To offset the low yields of hydrogen production through dark fermentation, the substrate would be the organic compounds found in wastewater. The mixed acid fermentation pathway, leading to hydrogen production, can be improved by both the overexpression and the deletion of several genes involved. In addition, we would like to implement various features to enable the strain to perform other tasks related to wastewater treatment, such as biosensor, eliminating nitrogen compounds, or hindering hydrogen consumption by methanogenic bacteria, as well as a planned death system in order to prevent its proliferation in the environnement. We also plan to adapt to iGEM standards the homologous recombination tool used for the deletions.:::2010
