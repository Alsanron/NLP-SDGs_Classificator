The_Citadel-Charleston:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Appetuners: A System for the Expression and Control of Appetite Regulation Peptides in E.coli:::Appetite can shape a person's life, from body composition to mood (to budget!), yet the means for controlling appetite are very limited. Imagine if a complex neurological state such as the desire to eat could be influenced by an engineered strain of intestinal microflora. In this regard, Peptide Tyrosine Tyrosine (PYY) and its associated molecules offer a unique opportunity for synthetic biologists. These peptides permit microorganisms native to the gastrointestinal tract to interact with the central nervous system and to influence the perception of hunger. The Citadel-Charleston Team is working to express the PYY family of peptides in E.coli, to implement a secretion pathway for those peptides, and to ensure that their expression is strictly controlled by means of a cellular population limit.:::2010
