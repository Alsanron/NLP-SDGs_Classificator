Sheffield:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::iCOLI: A water-borne pathogen detection system and an exploration of identity in synthetic biology:::The Sheffield iGEM 2010 team organised its activities around a general theme: 'identification'. This notion, for instance, is at the heart of the scientific and modeling projects, which have made steps towards the design and production of a multi-target, water-borne pathogen detection system. Identification is also central to the human practices projects, which explicated and analysed the concept of identity in relation to the disciplinary backgrounds brought together in the project and the field of synthetic biology itself. Vibrio cholera was chosen as a test-case, giving us two potential routes to engineer E.coli to recognise the pathogen: 1. Fusion of cholera's receptor (CqsS) for its quorum sensing molecule (CAI-1) with the internal apparatus of one of E.coli's general stress detecting systems (BarA). 2. Engineer the whole cholera quorum sensing system into E.coli.Each of these would then be connected to a representation system (GFP or E.chromi) to visualize the pathogen.:::2010
