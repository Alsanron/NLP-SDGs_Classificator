Calgary:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Translating Stress Into Success:::The majority of projects in synthetic biology involve the over expression of recombinant proteins in microorganisms. A major stumbling block however, is often an inability to express functional protein. This situation is difficult to manage and troubleshoot as it is often unclear why expression is failing. We have designed a system that can accurately and visually report whether a gene is being transcribed and/or translated. The system also differentiates whether expression is failing due to misfolding in the periplasm or cytoplasm. In the case of misfolding, our system can also fine tune expression levels of a given protein to optimize production, increasing the likelihood of obtaining functional protein. To further understand protein misfolding we have built an equation-based, multivariant model of inclusion body formation. Finally, we used a series of podcasts to explore the social implications of our project in the context of the growing synthetic biology industry.:::2010
