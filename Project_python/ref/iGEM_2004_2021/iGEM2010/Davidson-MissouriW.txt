Davidson-MissouriW:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Foundational Advances in Biology and the Knapsack Problem:::We focused on the Knapsack Problem which asks, 'Given a set of weighted items and a knapsack of fixed capacity, is there some subset of these items that fills the knapsack?' Weighted items are represented by TetA alleles that confer measurably distinct levels of tetracycline resistance in E. coli. Excess TetA kills the cells; insufficient TetA can be screened by plating on tetracycline plates. Each TetA allele is coupled with a distinctive fluorescent gene, and both are flanked by variant lox sites. Cre protein can invert or excise floxed DNA, yielding different combinations of expressed TetA alleles. We constructed different TetA alleles by altering codon optimization and characterized the consequence of changing the order of two genes (TetA and RFP). Furthermore, we designed and tested a total of 11 new lox sites for site specific recombination. We developed several open access software tools for the wider synthetic biology community.:::2010
