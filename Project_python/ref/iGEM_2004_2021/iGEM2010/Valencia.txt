Valencia:::Europe:::Spain:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mad yeast on Mars:::We present an intermediate scenario in the pathway towards Mars Terraformation. The project is focused in two essential conditions on this process: Increase the planet temperature, resistance of microorganism to thermal changes. The proposal is that dark yeast cells retain the arriving radiation and heat the surface. But, once the temperature reaches its optimum on the planetary surface the color production should be switched off. In order to achieve that and taking advantage of Synthetic Biology principles, a switch based on prion proteins (on mad yeast!) will be used. The work will be complemented with the implementation of the expression of LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) 'antifreeze' protein. Summarizing, we are going to build a engineered yeast resistant to temperature changes and able to produce a dark pigment which will be the responsible of a global temperature increase on Mars.:::2010
