USTC:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::An Integrated Platform Based on Bacterial Microcompartment for de novo Proteinaceous Artificial Organelles:::In synthetic biology, we are in great need of an independent compartment and an integrated line to assemble disparate elements in cells. Thus we design, model and construct a platform for artificial organelles. The shell genes of Citrobacter freundii pdu bacterial microcompartment (BMC) were first constructed into BioBrick parts, assembled and expressed to form an empty porous multi-protein shell of ~100nm. Then target protein can be located either inside or outside the empty shell by fusing the protein with signal sequences, using a novel and convenient assembly standard compatible with the RFC 10. Onto this platform, artificial organelles with different functions can be constructed. With enzymes or binding proteins inside the shell, different nanoreactors or nanoreservoirs can be produced. Modifications outside the shell can be applied to build multi-protein super-complexes or facilitate downstream purification with affinity tags. Such a platform will make E. coil an integrated factory.:::2010
