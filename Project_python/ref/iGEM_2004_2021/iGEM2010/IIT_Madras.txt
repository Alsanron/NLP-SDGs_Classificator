IIT_Madras:::Asia:::India:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Pro-biotic Sweetener, under the control of a pseudo AND gate:::We aim to use synthetic biology to engineer pro-biotic lactic acid bacteria to produce Monellin, a heat and pH stable sweetening protein. If we are successful in engineering Lactobacillus lactis, a Gram positive bacteria to express and secrete Monellin, we will be able to produce dairy products low in poly-saccharide-based sweeteners, radically reducing the calorific content of these products. In order to be able to control the level of expression in this system, we plan to develop a regulatory system(s) that simulates a logical AND gate in response to two bioloical inputs. We plan to use the decreasing pH during curdling and the addition of nicin as the two inputs. To achieve the AND gate we will be using the CRE gene in combination with loxP sites. By placing the loxP sites appropriately, we will create an expression system that will produce the Monellin in a window of conditions.:::2010
