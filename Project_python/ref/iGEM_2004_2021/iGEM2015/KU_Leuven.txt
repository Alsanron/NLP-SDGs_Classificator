KU_Leuven:::Europe:::Belgium:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Spot E.Shape: Pattern Forming Bacteria as a Foundation for New Applications:::Pattern formation is omnipresent in nature, nevertheless the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Attempting to explain this phenomenon, a genetic circuit that couples cell motility and chemotaxis in Escherichia coli was built. The transmembrane receptor dependent chemotactic signaling pathways in E. coli are well described. But so far, most of the pattern formation research focused on the Tar receptor together with its attractant aspartate. Here however, the attention goes to the function of another chemoreceptor, the Tsr receptor and its corresponding repellent - leucine. This novel approach, in combination with the controlled expression of the motility regulating protein CheZ, enables precise steering of the swimming behavior. All together, this system allows the formation of periodic circles and stripes of high-low cell densities. Based on theoretical analysis, the formation of spatial structures arising from the aggregation process of cells A and intermediate stripes of cells B is expected.:::2015
