HAFS-Korea:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Engineering an E.coli that transforms cellulose to alcohol by using gene from trichoderma reesei:::In solving the dilemma of the “Food Versus Fuel Debate”, an approach that uses bioengineering to utilize the potential ubiquity and adaptability of microorganisms has not been made in prior. Here, we suggest and test a method that creates a new type of E. coli combined with the genetic characteristics of the Trichoderma reesei. Combining the Lpp gene sequence, ompA gene sequence (from E. coli), bgl I gene sequence (from Trichoderma reesei), and the signal sequence, we aim to create a particular strand that enables the E. coli to ultimately produce cellulase through a cell membrane protein. Nco I and Hind III with the sequence signal-lpp-ompA were inserted in the given vector.:::2015
