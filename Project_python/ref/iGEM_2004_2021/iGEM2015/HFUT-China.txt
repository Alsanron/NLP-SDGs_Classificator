HFUT-China:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioDesigner:::For a long time, Synthetic Biology experts are struggling with the decision of BioBricks and the efficiency of gene expression. These two things should be done with a better methodology. And that is what BioDesigner provides. BioDesigner is a design system for Synthetic Biology, with which the user can search and check parts, design device and system, get recommendations and simulations. For additional assistance, BioDesigner provides part and system recommendations, which can be a great assistant for user while designing their own Synthetic system. Recommendations are generated based on existed data and userâ€™s behavior. User can also get simulation about the gene expression process. Synthetic Biology is a creative, forward thinking work, and BioDesigner is a creative assistant tool.:::2015
