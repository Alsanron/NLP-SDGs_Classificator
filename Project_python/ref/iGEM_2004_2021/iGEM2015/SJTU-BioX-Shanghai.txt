SJTU-BioX-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cyano Pac-man:::This year, we will engineer a recombinant cyanobacteria to achieve “biodesalination”, which means to extract sodium chloride from seawater through biological membranes. There are already some methods to convert saltwater into freshwater, such as distillation and reverse osmosis. However, the high energy consumption of these technologies has limited their application. Therefore the development of an innovative, low-energy biological desalination process, by biological membranes of cyanobacteria, would be very attractive. Many cyanobacteria possess salt-tolerance mechanisms, among which sodium export is the most important one. Halorhodopsin is a light-driven inward-directed chloride pump from halobacteria. We will functionally express it in cyanobacteria to drive influx of chloride together with sodium, thus conferring cyanobacteria the ability to absorb salts to a significant degree.:::2015
