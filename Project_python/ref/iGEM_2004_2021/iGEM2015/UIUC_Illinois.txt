UIUC_Illinois:::North America:::United States:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genetic Tape Recorder: Using SCRIBE to Gather Analog Data from the Environment:::Cellular memory devices are currently limited in their scalability and the ability to efficiently utilize the recording capacity of DNA. In order to record analog information in a way that takes advantage of the storage capacity of DNA while maintaining scalability, we are introducing SCRIBE (Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biological Events) into the iGEM registry. Developed by Dr. Farzadfard and Dr. Lu at MIT, SCRIBE is a modular device that can be engineered to produce single-stranded DNA in vivo in response to transcriptional signals. Furthermore, a recombinase is coexpressed in order to introduce precise mutations across a population of cells, which accumulate as a function of the magnitude and duration of these signals, thereby creating a long-term and stable system for analog cellular recording. We then demonstrate SCRIBEâ€™s potential as a biosensor by characterizing constructs that record environmental pollutants.:::2015
