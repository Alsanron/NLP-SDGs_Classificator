Hamburg:::Europe:::Germany:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Flu Fighters:::The honeysuckle plant (Lonicera japonica) has been used against influenza infections in traditional chinese medicine for hundreds of years, but only last year the active compound, the microRNA 2911, has been identified. The mechanism remains to be verified, but it seems to interfere with genes from most influenza A virus strains, inhibiting their replication. While the traditional way of producing the compound is to grow the plant, dry the leaves, cook a bitter decotion from them and drink that decotion, we want to establish a biotechnological production in E. coli. The production shall furthermore be induced by light, for which we plan to use BioBricks from the Registry like the Cph8-EnvZ system. After our bacteria have produced enough of the miRNA, we want them to lyse themselves after a heat-induction. We plan on using the GroEL promoter in combination with a lysing cytotoxin, which remains to be chosen.:::2015
