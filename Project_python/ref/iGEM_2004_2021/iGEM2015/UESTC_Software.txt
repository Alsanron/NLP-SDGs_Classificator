UESTC_Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Minimal Cell Construct and Analyse Panel:::Essential genes are indispensable for the survival of living entities. The minimal cell only contains essential genes and both of them are the cornerstones of synthetic biology. MCCAP (Minimal Cell Construct and Analyse Panel) is a software targeted for screening the essential genes, based on new method which means: if the number of organisms which have this essential gene have reached 50 percent or more, it will be reserved. Then you can utilize the minimal gene set, which consists of the essential genes that the software has filtered, to structure the metabolism network for modularization analysis. What is more charming is its functions in different fields, varying from biological research to pharmacy. MCCAP will inspire your interest by producing antimicrobial drug targets, making the chassis of artificial cell, promoting the synthesis of bacterial strain which is more adapted to the needs and helping determine the last universal common ancestor(LUCA).:::2015
