This years iGEM project was to develop a cheaper, non-toxic, alternative to conventional fuel cells; using synthetic biology. Biological photovoltaics (BPV) are a promising candidate to provide an alternative. Our BPV uses the Cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as the electron source. Using a purpose built fuel cell and Synechocystis, which has been genetically modified to improve interactions between the bacterium and the anode surface, enables the BPV to generate a greater voltage. This BPV will be considered for large scale usage in homes and communities worldwide as a cheap, simple and clean alternative to conventional energy sources.:::2015
