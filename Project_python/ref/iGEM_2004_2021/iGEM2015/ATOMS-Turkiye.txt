ATOMS-Turkiye:::Europe:::Turkey:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::< Fast & CuR(E)ious >:::< Gastric ulcer is a disease that caused by a gram negative bacteria called H. Pylori. As far as we know, ½ of human population is effected with H. Pylori and these people’s risk of having ulcer is %80-%85. Furthermore ulcer causes gastric cancer. In our Project, we aimed to build mechanisms to cure both of these diseases, as one is causing each other. We decided to modify E. Coli to cure ulcer by producing Pexiganan(an antimicrobial peptide which is effective on H. Pylori), showing chemotaxis to damaged part of stomach, having a faster flagella for penetration.To cure the cancer, we designed switch system which is based on differences of miRNA concentrations,which are down-regulated or up-regulated in cancer cells leading to the final process of apoptosis. We hope that, our approaches will find new ways about classifying cancer cells and modifying E. Coli to cure ulcer. >:::2015
