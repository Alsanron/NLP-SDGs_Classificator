Northeastern_Boston:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Standardization of Antibody Production:::Northeastern's team will attempt to standardize the production of research and therapeutic antibodies. Part of this will come from the creation of a plasmid for nuclear transformation of microalgae to make glycosylated antibodies, and the other will be from the production and characterization of single-chain fixed variable regions (fused to fluorescent proteins) in E coli. Cumulatively, the project will open the door to new means of manufacturing.:::2015
