Featuring both a digital and a wet-lab component, the exhibitâ€™s aim is to provide a novel bio-tinkering platform for non-scientists that will foster learning of biological design concepts. The premise of the exhibit is that museum visitors will take on the role of a scientist and engineer bacteria that can help explorers on scientific missions in extreme environments, including Mars, Antarctica, and the Deep Sea. Museum visitors will tinker with tangible representations of BioBricks from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts to design bacteria that can produce necessary resources. The exhibit will then display the transformation and multiplication of the engineered bacteria, and allow users to deploy and test it in the new environment.:::2015
