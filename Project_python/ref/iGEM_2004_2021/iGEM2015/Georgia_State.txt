Georgia_State:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Protein Products from Plants and Pichia: Novel Manufacturing of Analgesics and Cannabinoids:::Cannabinoids and opiates are widely used classes of pharmaceuticals; unfortunately, these drugs have strong psychoactive effects or can be addictive. Our project consists of two ideas, both revolving around utilizing bioengineered microorganisms to create non-psychoactive cannabinoids and non-addictive analgesics. To achieve this we developed two projects: (1) Manufacturing a protein expression system to produce CBDA synthase in tobacco plants using agrobacterium, (2) Engineering the pGAPÎ± vector system to express the mambalgin in Pichia Pastoris as a continuation of the 2014 GSU iGEM project. Simultaneously, we developed a proof of concept using horseradish peroxidase. By the end of this project we hope to have produced a synthetic biological system to manufacture pharmaceutical alternatives for patients that suffer from diseases such as epilepsy, cancer, or chronic severe pain.:::2015
