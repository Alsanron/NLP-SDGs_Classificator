This is met with an ongoing shortage of donor organs, in part, limited by preservation technologies. A human heart can currently be stored for 6 hours before significant tissue damage results in a non-viable organ. QGEM aims to use antifreeze proteins (AFPs), natural proteins that enable certain organisms to survive in sub-zero climates, to rectify this limitation. We have engineered two classes of AFPs focused on improving protein function and stability, respectively. Our primary objective has been the development of an anchoring system to increase local concentration of AFPs by attachment to a self-assembling scaffold. This system increases the probability of favorable interaction with ice surfaces thereby improving AFP activity. Our secondary project structurally modifies an AFP, enabling the protein to withstand a more diverse chemical environment. This increases potential industrial applications in food and energy sectors.:::2015
