Due to human error, oil leakage is bound to occur, and because agriculture and the oilfield are closely intertwined, contamination is a cause for concern. ECOS, alginate beads containing modified E. coli, detects crude oil in a sample of soil or water. Detection of oil spills is a major issue because if oil contamination goes unchecked, the carcinogens found in oil can damage the crops and health of animals in the area. The current system for oil detection takes weeks before a sample is tested and returned. By this point, the result is invalid. ECOS allows detection of contamination on site and is easy to use. Testing can be done simply and accurately, allowing us to take action quickly and minimize health hazards in communities worldwide.:::2015
