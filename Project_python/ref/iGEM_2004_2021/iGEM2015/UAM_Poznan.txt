UAM_Poznan:::Europe:::Poland:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::EcoFactory, a multipromoter explorer expression system for Escherichia coli:::Ideally the expression level should be tuneable, induction – non-toxic, mRNA translation – free of mistakes, recombinant protein – soluble and homogenous, its purification – fast and reproducible. Producing recombinant proteins of high purity and free of toxic compounds is a hallmark. For this purpose we generated a series of constructs with tagged superfolder GFP proteins expressed under the control of promoters for non-toxic sugar inducers: arabinose, melibiose, rhamnose and xylose. We have focused on promoters, because these minimal, independent regulators of expression levels are important tools for synthetic biology to build complex but still compact genetic systems. This experiment was conducted using CPEC cloning method (circular polymerase extension cloning) which is suitable for assembling small contructs from five DNA fragments at the same time. Moreover, we wanted to improve chromatography system by generating rapidly releasing fluorescent proteins produced from our designed vectors in Escherichia coli.:::2015
