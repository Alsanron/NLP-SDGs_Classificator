SPSingapore:::Asia:::Singapore:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Controlled missiles: Targeted treatment of tumors with engineered E. coli:::Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs are unable to penetrate the tumour core, and a drug delivery vehicle is needed for effective delivery of therapeutics. Facultative anaerobic bacteria possess the ability to colonise the tumour core, and pose as suitable vectors. To ensure specific control of bacterial vectors, we intend to implement a two switch regulatory system, consisting of an anaerobic-responsive FNR promoter and a quorum-sensing system (QS). An anaerobic-responsive FNR promoter can be used to localise transcription of the target gene in the hypoxic tumor core. The second switch will use the esa QS system from Pantoea stewartii to activate bacterial density induced transcription of genes. The above two systems could be coupled to drive the expression of invasin and listeriolysin, which facilitate bacterial invasion and endosomal escape into the cell cytosol. The bacteria vehicle would then be able to deliver an encoded therapeutic into the target tumour cells.:::2015
