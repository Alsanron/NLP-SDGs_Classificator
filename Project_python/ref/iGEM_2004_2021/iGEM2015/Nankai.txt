We improved γ-PGA production in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 and the produced γ-PGA was made into drug releasing hydrogel. In this study, two strategies were employed to improve B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 γ-PGA production. First, we constructed a metabolic toggle switch to control the expression of odhA (encoding 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase), thus interrupting the TCA cycle and favoring the metabolic flux toward γ-PGA precursor-glutamate synthesis. Second, in order to balance the increase of endogenous glutamate production, we optimized the expression level of pgsBCA genes (responsible for γ-PGA synthesis) by replacing its native promoter with seven different promoters with various transcriptional activities. We finally constructed a γ-PGA production improved B. amyloliquefaciens strain. In the meantime, the drug releasing hydrogel, Pudding Health Kit, functioned well protecting the exposed skin and healing the wounds.:::2015
