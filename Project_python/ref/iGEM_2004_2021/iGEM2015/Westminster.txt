Westminster:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Energy production in Escherichia coli using exoelectrogenic genes (Mtr-pathway) found in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1:::“Energy is the single most important problem facing humanity today” as quoted by Richard Smalley, late Nobel laureate, in 2002. Hence, the reason for exploring the use of synthetic biology for modifying Escherichia coli for microbial fuel cells. Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a dissmilatory metal reducing bacterium. One of the several electron transport chains found in Shewanella oneidensis is the Mtr pathway. This specific pathway is involved in the accepting of electrons which then carries a potential electrical charge. By cloning this pathway into E.coli, the aim is to produce an efficient electric producing microbial fuel cell (MFC). The efficiency of the MFC is down to the biofilm which is formed when cells adhere to a surface and stick to each other. Shewanella oneidensis is capable of transferring electrons through extensions known as nanowires. We have explored electron transfer through the use of flagella found in E.coli K-12 derivative, DH5-α.:::2015
