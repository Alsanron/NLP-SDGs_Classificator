Our project is based on the recently reported paper-based sensing platform in which cell-free extracts were freeze-dried on paper with synthetic gene networks. Previous sensors were shown to be stable for over a year with refrigeration and able to give a readable gene output within 1hr. Our group is using this framework to sense new classes of biomolecules from human samples including hormones, proteases, and antibodies â€“ specifically, estrogens in water sources, matrix metalloproteinases found in urine of patients with kidney, prostate, and colorectal cancers; Mucin 1-specific antibodies in human serum, a prognostic marker for colorectal, breast, and pancreatic cancer outcomes. Finally, we are also creating higher-order signal processing devices allowing conversion of analog gene circuit signals to a digital yes/no output.:::2015
