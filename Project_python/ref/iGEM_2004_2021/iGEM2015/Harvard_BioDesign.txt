Harvard_BioDesign:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BACTOGRIP:::Even under shear stress, pathogenic E. coli bacteria manage to invade the gut to cause disease every day. The secret to their success is a hair-like appendage called Type 1 Pili which is remarkably adept at binding to human epithelial cells in rough conditions. Inspired by nature, our team has adapted this system in a non-pathogenic strain to make E. coli into a specific binding machine for customizable targets. We will use it to address colon cancer. By fusing heterologous peptides to the adhesin domain, we first show that our mutant E. coli can be regulated to grab heavy metals like Nickel out of water. Next, we show a knock-out of the adhesive domain's pathogenic binding activity and introduce a peptide known to bind to colon cancer. We imagine our system might be used to localize an anti-cancer drug or toxic compound to early-stage cancerous growths within the colon.:::2015
