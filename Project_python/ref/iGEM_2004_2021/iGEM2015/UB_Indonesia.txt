UB_Indonesia:::Asia:::Indonesia:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DE(NGUE)TECTIVE:::Dengue fever is an infectious disease mediated by mosquitoes with the fastest transmission rate worldwide. In Indonesia, it is estimated that there are more than 120,000 cases with 800 deaths from dengue fever each year. To solve that problem, we will construct scFv (single chain fragment variable) antibody that can detect dengue virus antigen. This scFv can be produced by E. coli by means of plasmid transformation that has been fused with OsmY. That scFv antibody will be put in construction diagnostic kit. The kit will be able to detect dengue virus in the patientâ€™s sample rapidly and accurately. The kit will also have an integration with our mobile-based software aimed at supporting the interpretation of detection results from our diagnostic kit and providing data of dengue fever cases in various areas.:::2015
