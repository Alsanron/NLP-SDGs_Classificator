BIOSINT_Mexico:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Art & Design:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Coliroid:::This project aims to develop an organic genetically modified machine that have the capacity to function as a biosensor. This biosensor will be useful in biotechnological and research processes. Thanks to Synthetic Biology techniques, it is possible to create a microorganism with the ability to percieve luminescent stimuli in order to visually reproduce them through chromoproteins production. Since it is a modular project, it is very likely to adapt it with the main goal, which is to have the capacity to respond to other stimuli, as pollution agents and other chemicals. Since the light receptors and the corresponding transcription factors are not a natural part of the Escherichia coliâ€™s genome, it is necessary to synthesize them with constitutive promoters in order to have them all the time included in its normal replication and transcription process. These receptors are specifically blue and red light receptors, and both of them phosphorylate the corresponding transcription factors in darkness or absence of light. As the receptors sense, not the light, but the absence of it, we have design our devices to inhibit the production of the chromoproteins of the respective colors. In a few words, if blue light it is not iluminating the culture, the production of pink proteins starts, and if there isn't red light, the production of yellow proteins starts as well.:::2015
