UGA-Georgia:::North America:::United States:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genetic and Metabolic Modeling of the Methanogenic Archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis:::Methanococcus maripaludis is a model organism for Archaea, which affords researchers the beneficial qualities such as (1) producing methane used as biogas and (2) manufacturing isoprenoids as precursors for high-value biochemicals. However, there are few genetic tools available for metabolic engineering Archaea. Our goal is to develop some useful tools for synthetic biology of Archaea. Building on our past M. maripaludis projects, which created and characterized a mCherry reporter system and a recombinant mutant making geraniol, our team is now working to (1) create, characterize and model a ribosome-binding site (RBS) library using the mCherry reporter system and (2) model geraniol production of the recombinant M. maripaludis using flux balance analyses. Preliminary results have shown varying levels of expression in the RBS library, and increased geraniol yield from some growth substrates. Additionally, our team has initiated an Archaeal InterLab Study to further characterize the reproducibility of our mCherry reporter system.:::2015
