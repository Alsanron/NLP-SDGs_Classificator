Birkbeck:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Medical diagnostic system based on modular bacteriophage lambda chassis:::Many diseases remain endemic in the developing world due to a lack of advanced laboratory equipment and trained medics. Although diseases such as multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), leprosy and syphilis primarily pose a threat to those living in the worldâ€™s poorest countries at present, increasing globalisation is rapidly transforming these diseases into a worldwide problem. This issue can only be addressed by developing an affordable diagnostic method that requires minimal training. Enterobacteria phage lambda is a well-characterised virus of Escherichia coli, which has previously been used in the development of biotechnological tools. We aim to use this bacteriophage as the basis of a modular chassis with a variable host range. To facilitate identification of host cells in patient samples, these bacteriophages will deliver a chromoprotein gene into cells and drive expression, allowing diagnosis of a range of bacterial diseases by the simple observation of different colour changes.:::2015
