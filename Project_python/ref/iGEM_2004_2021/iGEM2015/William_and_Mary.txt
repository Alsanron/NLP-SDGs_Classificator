William_and_Mary:::North America:::United States:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Measurement of Promoter-Based Transcriptional Noise for Application in Gene Network Design:::In order to provide teams with information that will be crucial in future gene regulatory network design, William & Mary iGEM is measuring the transcriptional noise inherent to the promoters commonly used in synthetic biology. Through the use of a dual-fluorescent reporter system we are able to quantify the intrinsic noise for each promoter tested. Additionally, we are creating a suite of gRNAs that will allow for CRISPR/dCas9-mediated transcriptional repression.:::2015
