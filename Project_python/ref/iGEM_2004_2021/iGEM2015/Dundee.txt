Dundee:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CSI Dundee: The Synthetic Forensic Toolkit:::Forensic science is key partner in the modern world of law and civil liberties. The field now requires new trustworthy, quantitative technologies that complement DNA-based evidence in court. Our project will tackle this urgent need by employing synthetic biology approaches to build ‘The Synthetic Forensic Toolkit’. Our discussions with law makers, law enforcers, and forensic scientists inspired three specific areas. First, the ability to pinpoint exactly when a fingerprint was made would have serious implications for delivering justice. We have designed a synthetic enzyme-based system to tackle this. Second, detection of different types of bodily fluids at a crime scene, while leaving DNA uncontaminated, would be of benefit. We therefore designed a cell-free synthetic spray to highlight traces of blood, semen, saliva, and nasal mucus on surfaces. Finally, the quantification of traces of stainless steel on bone. For this, a chromate sensor form a previous iGEM project has been adapted.:::2015
