UMass-Dartmouth:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Novel inhibition of Helicobacter pylori through peptide-assisted urease suppression:::Helicobacter pylori is a stomach dwelling bacterium that inhabits the stomach of more than half of the world’s human population. With antibiotic resistance genes spreading among microbial communities, common antibiotics used to treat H. pylori induced gastric distresses are losing efficacy. UMassD proposes to create an alternative. An enzyme released by H. pylori which cleaves urea and releases ammonia as a byproduct – creating a pH buffered microenvironment. It has been shown in previous studies that various peptides can inhibit urease activity in vitro. The aim of our project is to engineer E. coli with a plasmid encoding a positively regulated, pH sensitive promoter. The low pH will initiate the transcription of an inhibitory peptide coupled with a twin-arginine translocase leader sequence. As a result, the decreased production of ammonia should inhibit H. pylori’s buffering capacity, reducing its ability to persist within the stomach.:::2015
