China_Tongji:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::C.elegans' fancy world---controlling C.elegans:::In our project, we practice the technology of optogenetic on C.elegans and use the light source assembled by ourselves to construct a movement controlling system and bulid an amusement park of C.elegans. We design parts to express channalrhodopsin in specific C.elegans' neurons with the help of special promoters and cre-loxp system. We not only use the traditional channalrhodopsin,chR2, but some novel ones which have never been tested in C.elegans such as Blink. Then we use computer controlling our DIY light source to regulate channelrhodopsinâ€™s activity and control the behaviours of C.elegans such as moving forwards or twisting effectively. We also express GFP,YFP, mcherry in E.coli. By combining the colorful microorgasims and C.elegans, we construct some interesting scenes to form a C.elegans' fancy world. This technology will help in researches on neuron's function and interaction. It may also be used in mechanical controlling system and the theraphy of movement defect.:::2015
