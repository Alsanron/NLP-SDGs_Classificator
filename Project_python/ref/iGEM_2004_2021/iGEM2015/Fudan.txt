Fudan:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cyclize it!:::Circular RNA is a type of RNA which forms a covalently closed loop. They are known to be resistant to RNases due to lack of ends, and thus have extraordinary stability. Recently several naturally generated circular RNAs are found to act as miRNA sponges, and they are a new type of tumor suppressors, because the miRNA the regulate are linked to cell proliferation and cancer. Our team has designed fusion proteins to promote miRNA sponge circularization, which can make miRNA sponges more stable and potent. Our circular RNA sponges can be used as a new tool to regulate gene expression, and in the future, it may be used as a new type of anti-cancer drug.:::2015
