NEFU_China:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Yogurt Guarder:::Yogurt gets bacteria contamination more easily when stored with improper approaches. In this case, shelf-life is not that reliable. Considering the adverse effect that may be caused by bad yogurt, our team aims to create a handy detector for pathogenic bacteria in yogurt. Autoinducer2 (AI-2), a signal molecule in quorum sensing system, serves as the key of our project. We constructed the AI-2 response pathway of Salmonella in Lactobacillus. Produced by pathogenic bacteria, the extracellular AI-2 will enter the cytoplasm of our engineered bacteria, and then lead to the expression of the report gene. As pathogenic bacteria produce AI-2 constantly, our engineered bacteria will make the existence of pathogenic bacteria visible to naked eyes. Furthermore, our genetically engineered Lactobacillus can be used directly in yogurt fermentation, which will make the detecting process even more convenient.:::2015
