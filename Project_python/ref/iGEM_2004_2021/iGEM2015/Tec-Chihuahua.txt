Tec-Chihuahua:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Carbon Carriers: Cell Transformation and Transfection by Carbon Nanotubes:::The manipulation of genetic material is key to the development of synthetic biology. The introduction of genetic material into different cell types is indispensable for the creation of genetically modified organisms which provide different benefits to society. However some techniques used for gene delivery into the cells have low efficiencies, can be expensive, or use complex equipment and are complicated to do. That is why in recent years it has sought new strategies for effective transformation of cells at low cost. One of these strategies is the use of nanotechnology, which has the potential of crossing cell membranes and increase solubility, stability and bioavailability of biomolecules, thereby improving efficiency of release. Here, we intend to evaluate the efficiencies of gene delivery of DNA-CNTs in Escherichia coli cultures, embryos in early development of Bos taurus and calluses of Nicotiana tabacum and compare them with the traditional methods used in the laboratory.:::2015
