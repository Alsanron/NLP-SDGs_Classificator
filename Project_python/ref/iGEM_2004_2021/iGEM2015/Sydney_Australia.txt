Coli:::The enzyme ethene monooxygenase (EtnABCD) catalyses the epoxide reaction that converts ethylene to ethylene oxide by incorporating a hydroxyl group. EtnABCD is of great interest for biocatalytic epoxide production to replace current organic chemistry methods which present safety and environmental concerns. Mycobacterium smegmatis is the only organism that endogenously expresses ethene monooxygenase, yet is a poor cloning host. To enhance the heterologous expression of the EtnABCD enzyme, a mathematical model was developed taking into account the differences in codon frequencies between organisms. The M. smegmatis gene encoding EtnABCD was modified using this model in order to obtain optimized sequences for expression in both Pseudomonas putida, as an intermediate host, and Escherichia coli. The altered EtnABCD sequences will be cloned into appropriate vector inserts. Once stable expression of EtnABCD is established in Pseudomonas putida, the E. coli optimized sequence will be expressed to give a high activity monooxygenase enzyme.:::2015
