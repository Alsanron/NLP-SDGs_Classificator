IIT_Delhi:::Asia:::India:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Eco Coli:::According to a recent WHO report, about 15-20 million people in India are asthmatic.It has been found that oxides of Nitrogen and Sulphur oxides are important air pollutants and the culprits behind a large number of respiratory . “Eco.coli” is a system of genetically engineered E.coli bacteria, equipped with genes to combat NO2, NO, SO2 and N2O, all of which are major components of air pollution. This bacteria is to be placed in a bioreactor prototype which takes in any polluting exhaust (e.g. from a diesel generator, automotive engine, or chimney) with a controllable flow rate. This is then passed through the media containing our genetically engineered bacteria, which reduces all the above mentioned harmful gases to harmless by-products. Bubbling of the exhaust through water before going into the bioreactor also takes care of soot and other unburnt hydrocarbons.:::2015
