BABS_UNSW_Australia:::Asia:::Australia:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Endosynbio:::Intracellular bacterial symbionts are useful allies for a wide range of eukaryotes. Endosynbio aims to lay the groundwork to recreate this powerful relationship for therapeutic use. Endosymbionts endowed with the ability to enter, survive, and replicate stably within the mammalian cytoplasm could provide hosts with in vivo protein production. This technology would have the potential to treat monogenic disorders - in lieu of genome-level modifications - as well as a broad range of peptide-related conditions. This year, we optimised entry of three bacterial species (E. coli, Synechocystis PCC6803 and Lactococcus lactis) into mammalian cells and assayed them for intrinsic compatibility to the cytosolic environment. In the future, endosymbionts will be used as synthetic organelles, enabling a whole new field of synthetic biology - endosynbiology.:::2015
