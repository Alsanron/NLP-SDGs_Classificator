Berlin:::Europe:::Germany:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Enzymatic Flagellulose:::iGEM Berlin is trying to clear our water of plastics, which pose a threat to our environment. In detail, we are focusing on microplastics present in various everyday products, which find their way into the wastewater treatment plant before ending up in the oceans. Now we are constructing the Enzymatic Flagellulose to degrade microplastics into biodegradable compounds. It consists of a surface made up of cellulose, which acts as a biocompatible carrier, to which bacterial flagella will be immobilized via a cellulose-binding domain. The single flagellum subunits, also known as flagellin, will be interlinked with plastic degrading enzymes. Using flagella as a scaffold for enzymes has two major advantages. Firstly, it enables the creation of a three-dimensional reactive nanostructure that has an increased specific surface with highly catalytic activity. Secondly, flagella may consist of various different active sites, which will enable the combination of multiple enzymatic steps in close proximity.:::2015
