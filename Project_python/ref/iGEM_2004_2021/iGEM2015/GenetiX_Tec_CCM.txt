GenetiX_Tec_CCM:::Latin America:::Mexico:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::PseudoColi: Denitrification & O2 Biosensor:::Xochimilco, one of the most important aquatic systems in Mexico City, has a huge environmental and social importance. It is home to many endemic species, as well as the main economic drive of the southern area. Due to its historical background, it is considered World Heritage by UNESCO since 1987. Currently, it presents several pollution issues such as an excessive amount of nitrites and nitrates, which in turn causes an overpopulation of Nymphaea, and thus anoxic conditions. As a consequence, flora and fauna endemic to the lake are dying. Our biosystem will activate a denitrification pathway taken from Pseudomonas stutzeri whenever O2 levels in the water are sensed as critical, using an O2 promoter. This enhances water conditions by reducing NO2 and NO3 into N2, and therefore algae and water lilies. Successfully implementing our biosystem will lead to a better future for the biodiversity in Xochimilco.:::2015
