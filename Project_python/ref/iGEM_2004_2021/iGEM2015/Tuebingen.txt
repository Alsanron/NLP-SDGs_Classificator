Tuebingen:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Crellumination - Committing Biosensors to Memory:::For this yearâ€™s project Team Tuebingen designed a system aimed at capturing a snapshot of an expression controlling biosensor. In order to permanently memorise the sensor state of the snapshot time point in cells we use an altered version of the DNA recombinase Cre to switch on a luciferase reporter. The ability to quickly capture the current state of the sensor is achieved by fusing Cre with two copies of the protein Dronpa, that oligomerises after illumination and thereby cages and inhibits the recombinase. Because the oligomerisation of Dronpa is reversible through another wavelength, we can control the activity of the recombinase and fine tune the read out of the luciferase reporter.:::2015
