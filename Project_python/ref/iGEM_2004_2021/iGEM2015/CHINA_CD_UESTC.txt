CHINA_CD_UESTC:::Asia:::China:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The magical magnetotactic E.coli (MTE) generating electricity:::The magical bacterium-magnetotactic bacterium(MTBï¼‰with the property of magnetotaxis has attracted many scientists'interest to explore its application value.But most of MTB are anaerobic.The hard culture condition and complex operation in molecular level makes it difficult to be put into use. Our project is to create a magnetotactic E.coli (MTE) through synthetic biology methods.The previous researches have confirmed that the four main operons are essential for the magnetosome formation in other organisms! Firstly,we clone the relevant genes from genome-wide of Ms. gryphiswaldense strain MSR-1.Then we construct two plasmids containing the four operons. Finally co-transforming them into E.coli lead to magnetotaxis.The magnetotactic E.coli has a variety of applacations, such as targeted therapy,dealing with environmental pollution and so on.We focus on the application of microbial fuel cell(MFC).Fixing the laccase protein on the MTE membrane can make the laccase adhere to cathode stronger.Therefore we can replace the conventional platinum anode with biology catalyst.:::2015
