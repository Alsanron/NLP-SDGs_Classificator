Uniandes_Colombia:::Latin America:::Colombia:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Building a Bio-Electronic Clock:::We are currently working on a bio-digital clock as a proof-of-concept project dealing with the integration of biological and electronic circuits. We plan to modify the circadian clock Kai protein system of cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus by hooking it to the AHL-producing half of the Lux quorum sensing system of Vibrio fischerii. The sensing portion of the Lux system will reside in modified Shewanella oneidensis, engineered to produce changes in its electrical resistance in response to changing levels of AHL using this species's control of cytochrome production. Finally, another key component of our project is the design and construction of the eletcronic hardware necessary to measure S. oneidensis's changes in electrical conductance and act as an interface between this biological circuit and any electronic circuit it is to be coupled with, in this example, a digital clock.:::2015
