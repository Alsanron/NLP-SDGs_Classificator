TAS_Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::To Granzyme B or Not to Granzyme B: Protecting Extracellular Matrix Proteins:::Granzyme B is a serine protease that is an essential part of the immune system. In response to inflammation or tumors, Granzyme B is overexpressed and enters target cells to induce apoptosis. However, high levels of Granzyme B also result in random cleavage of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as elastin and decorin, which help to maintain tissue structure and elasticity. Our team has constructed a system that inhibits Granzyme B activity in the ECM without affecting its intracellular functions. In humans, Antichymotrypsin (ACT) is an extracellular protease inhibitor, which we have modified to allow for Granzyme B inhibition. Of the many diseases associated with ECM degradation, we focus on preventing damage from both arthritis and prolonged wound healing. We've engineered a semipermeable bandage to deliver the Granzyme B inhibitor topically without bacterial contamination. Our system is capable of maintaining a healthy immune system response while protecting ECM proteins.:::2015
