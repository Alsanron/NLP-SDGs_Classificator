SVCE_Chennai:::Asia:::India:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MINICINS:::In 2009, the WHO estimated that there were 2.5 billion cases of gastrointestinal diseases in children, with most of them from developing countries. Pathogens have evolved to develop resistance towards antibiotics, which is the common option for treatment. Antibiotic mode of treatment can be replaced by bacteriocins. Bacteriocins are novel peptides synthesised by an organism and have specific detrimental effects on the surrounding microbial community. These peptides can be produced by minicells which are achromosomal cells formed due to aberrant cell division, in this case induced by the overexpression of ftsZ. Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be used as the model organism for our studies. This strategy can also be used against organisms in biofilms. We have planned to study the effect of bacteriocins on Staphylococcus aureus which is the major organism in biofilm. Further we extend our work to a range of applications like strain selection, preventing botulism and animal husbandry.:::2015
