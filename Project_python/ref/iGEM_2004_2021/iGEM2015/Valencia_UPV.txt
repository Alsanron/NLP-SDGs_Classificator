Valencia_UPV:::Europe:::Spain:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AladDNA:::Conventional production methods require huge and specialized infrastructures, making the establishment of new production facilities in remote locations complicated. What if we could just send information that could unfold on site? AladDNA is a new revolutionary system able to process genetic information and give a response based on the userâ€™s needs just like a genie in a lamp! This system uses DNA to store information inside a plant seed, acting as a miniaturized and flexible biofactory capable of producing a myriad of bioproducts such as interferon alpha or anti-choleric vaccines. Equipped with a multiplexed-optogenetically controlled circuit, AladDNA can activate the production of different high-added value products upon the reception of external signals based on combinations of light stimuli. AladDNA allows bioproduction in any condition avoiding prohibitive costs due to infrastructures. No matter where you are or what you need, just ask your wish! Because AladDNA has no frontiers!:::2015
