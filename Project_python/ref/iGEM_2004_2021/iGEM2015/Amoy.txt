Amoy:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Efficient RBS for NADH Production:::L-tert-leucine is important in developing chiral pharmaceutically active chemicals. Many methods have been used in L-tert-leucine synthesis, but products are usually racemic. Scientists developed enzymatic reductive amination to product L-tert-leucine by using leucine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase. Initially, they used isolated enzymes, which can be disadvantageous for that enzymes are always destabilized in the isolation and purification process. What's more, the cofactor-NADH is rather an expensive raw material, which will enhance the cost. So scientists introduced whole-cell bio-catalysts to L-tert-leucine production. Whole-cell biocatalysts could stabilize enzymes and reduce the addition level of co-factor NADH. However, the NADH consumption rate does not equal to its regeneration. The criminal is different strength of enzymes, we regulate the efficiency of RBS to control its strength. With mathematical modeling, we will get the most suitable efficiency of RBS of leucine dehydrogenase to decrease additional NADH.:::2015
