Vilnius-Lithuania:::Europe:::Lithuania:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Controlling the Lifetime of GMOs using ColiClock:::We are Vilnius iGEM - the first team from Lithuania and the Baltic States. Our goal is to tackle one of the biggest problems of Synthetic Biology – the regulation of the spread of GMOs in the environment. The aim of the ColiClock project consists of creating a bacterium with an integrated “count-down timer” triggering a self-destruction mechanism. The idea would apply to cells that need to have a limited lifetime outside of a laboratory environment. The mechanism is achieved using the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system, controlled by LuxR and cI, that is navigated to important genes in the genomic DNA. In addition, we aim to present and discuss this globally relevant topic with Lithuanian industries, policy makers and the general public.:::2015
