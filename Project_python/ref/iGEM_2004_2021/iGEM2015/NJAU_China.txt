NJAU_China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Horcrux::: The most cellular memories are limited to protein levels currently, which are transient, instantaneous and unapparent. To overcome these shortcuts, we design a system to achieve the storage of information by a transient stimulation but use a long-lasting response. The two processes are divided into separated bacterial strains to play as the “Recorder” and the “Saver”. The system is designed to be activated and deactivated via light- regulated fusion proteins, which then active protein synthesis to complete the process. The information storage would be accomplished by conjugation, which cannot be carried out in usual time because of the specific gene deletion. When the memory needs to be erased, the CRISPR-Cas9 system in the “Saver” would be activated. By design such a cellular memory technology, we make a bacterial memory storage device. And together with biological transistor and other bio-electronic component, we can preview the prototype of the biological computer.:::2015
