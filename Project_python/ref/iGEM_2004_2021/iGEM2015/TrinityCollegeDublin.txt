TrinityCollegeDublin:::Europe:::Ireland:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.artemisia:::Semi-synthetic artemisinin is perhaps the poster-child achievement of synthetic biology. Before its introduction, the sole artemisinin supply was from a plant; Artemisia Annua. The production was expensive and highly variable. Artemisinin is currently the front line treatment for malaria, a disease transmitted in the bites of Anopheles mosquitoes. One of the deadliest diseases in human history, malaria now claims over 600,000 lives a year. The majority of these lives are young children, and residents of developing countries, where people are unable to afford the drug. Our mission is to investigate the production of affordable antimalarial drugs. Our team is working with artemisinic acid producing e-coli cells, obtained from Amyris, with the support of Zagaya. We have constructed biobrick components of the system, which should allow for easier research and development in the future.:::2015
