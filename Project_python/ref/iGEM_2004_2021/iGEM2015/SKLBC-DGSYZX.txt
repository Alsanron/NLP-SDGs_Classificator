SKLBC-DGSYZX:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Synsketch - An innovative solution for standardized genetic circuits:::Genetic circuits display the essence design of an iGEM experiment. However, the diversity in visual styles of circuits not only hinders learners of synthetic biology, but also costs iGEMers lots of time in completion of genetic circuits with current graphic design tools. Synsketch is our solution to design, modify, learn and share standardized genetic circuits easily and efficiently. With additional functions including personal account, multi-language interface and well-classified tags, Synsketch is able to inspire scientific curiosity among the public. We further develop it into an freemium educational business model for self-paced learning in project design of synthetic biology. As a result, in combination of technology and business model, we manage to create a online genetic circuits designing tool bringing iGEM to everyone, everywhere.:::2015
