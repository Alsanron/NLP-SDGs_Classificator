Missouri_Rolla:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Defending Against WNS:::North American bats are suffering from an emerging fungal disease called White Nose Syndrome. During the crucial winter months, the fungus wakes bats from hibernation. Affected hibernacula often face mortality rates in excess of 80%, an unsustainable loss in animals which only have one offspring per year. As it spreads, the disease impacts many bat species with roles in pest control and pollination. Anti-fungal agents are typically indiscriminate, affecting native species which may be beneficial to the bat, while creating a strong selective pressure for future resistance. We have instead decided to develop a system using compounds which slow and inhibit the fungus, giving bats a better fighting chance. We are modifying E. coli to produce ocimene, a terpene compound in orange fragrance, which has been shown to have inhibitory effects against fungi. We plan to explore enzyme inhibitors and fungal sensing for next year's competition.:::2015
