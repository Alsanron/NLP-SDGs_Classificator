NUDT_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering of an multi-enzymatic reaction accelerator based on TALE:::Prokaryotic cells have been widely applied in synthetic biology and bio-engineering as the host organism. However, lacking of the compartmentation of the heterologous metabolic enzymes may cause a low production or efficacy of the product, especially when producing through a complex multi-enzymatic cascade. In this study, we developed a new method to accelerate a multi-enzymatic reaction by integration of a TALE-based scaffold system into the bacteria chassis. In this system, different TALE proteins, which could specifically target the corresponding DNA binding motifs, were generated and fused with fragmented GFP or multi-enzymes (e.g., IAAM and IAAH). The results showed that TALE-based scaffold system could not only efficiently guide the fragmented GFP around the DNA scaffolds and display strong fluorescence, but also promote the rate of IAA production. To our knowledge, this technique might provide a powerful way in synthesizing multi-enzymatic reaction programs in prokaryotic chassis for a wide range of application.:::2015
