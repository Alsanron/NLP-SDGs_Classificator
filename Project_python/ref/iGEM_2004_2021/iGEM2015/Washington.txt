Washington:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Lab on a Strip: Developing a Novel Platform for Yeast Biosensors:::Biosensors for detecting small molecules have many applications in medicine, food, and the environment. Our project aims to combine the emerging fields of synthetic biology and paper diagnostics to create an affordable and accessible platform for a new class of biological sensors that could detect a wide variety of molecules. We first developed a paper microfluidic device housing Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which was then modified to accommodate two different biological detection systems. In one system, the Auxin/IAA-Degron pathway is used in conjunction with beta-galactosidase to produce a visible signal in response to the plant hormone auxin. In the other system, aptazymes, a combination of RNA aptamers and ribozymes, are used to bind theophylline and allow fluorescent protein to be produced. Both pathways serve as models for future real-world applications of our device, including the detection of marine biotoxins in the Pacific Northwest.:::2015
