To clean chewing gum, specific machines are used but they are heavy and expensive. The time required is long and they use a large quantity of water. Besides economical aspects, chewing gums have an environmental impact. They are dangerous for the wildlife such as birds which thinks that it is bread, eats it and choke. In view of these alarming facts, we have decided to create a new environmentally-friendly way to clean our streets.   Our project is to create an E.coli strain that produces enzymes , which can degrade rubber polymers. We will use a combination of three enzymes: a laccase, a lipoxygenase or latex clearing protein (LCP) and a cytochrome C. The laccase known will oxidize the cytochrome C which will be previously light excited. Coupled with this later, the LCP will degrade synthetics polymers.:::2015
