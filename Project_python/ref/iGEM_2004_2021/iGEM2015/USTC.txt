USTC:::Asia:::China:::Hardware:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NDM: Nanomachine Detecting Microbiotics:::Abusing antibiotics has caused severe antibiotics contamination and resistance issues worldwide. Therefore, we USTC develop a device NDM with OD detector and optical interference path, recognition program based on RasberryPi and Arduino to detect antibiotics in natural water bodies. In NDM, there are two bacterial systems for measurement: ROSE, an engineered bacterial reporter system integrated with permeability modification, logic amplification circuit and quorum sensing, is able to adjust EGFP expression level, and NDM reads fluorescence intensity from ROSE to send results in high resolution. CACCI, chemotaxis and transmembrane protein-modified bacteria, are chemically covalently adhered to a polymer membrane. Deformation caused by CACCI motility can be recognized with optical interference and the interference pattern recognition program inside NDM will analyze the deformation, thus antibiotic situation in sample can be accurately told. Hope with our project, antibiotics issues can be solved in an accelerated way.:::2015
