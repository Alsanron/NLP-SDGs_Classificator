Korea_U_Seoul:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The pathfinder for Synthetic Biologists::: Our team’s goal is to make a handy tool for synthetic biologists. We made a program named ‘Gil’ which helps you with finding and constructing bio-chemical pathways. Given only reactants and final products, you can get several possible pathways using our program. It has significant feature of biological scoring system that based on meaningful compounds in energy such as ATP, number of carbon, and NADP. This scoring system can guide you like navigation to find the most efficient pathway or to build a plausible de novo pathway. Our program also provides gene sequence information of the pathways so it will be more easy to synthesize your pathway. Using this program, we designed a wetlab experiment, making an agar utilizing EFC. We found a pathway that starts from agarose to galactose, producing NADH during its process. This NADH is then oxidized by diaphorase and produces electricity.:::2015
