SF_Bay_Area_DIYBio:::North America:::United States:::Community Labs:::Community Lab:::Accepted:::BioSunBlock - Evolved Sunscreen for Bacteria:::Cyanobacteria and several other organisms have evolved microbial sunscreens to survive in environments with high UV-A and UV-B radiation. These protective compounds, specifically mycosporines and mycosporine-like amino acids, defend against oxidative stress by quenching free radicals and preventing cellular damage. A putative mycosporine-synthesizing gene cluster in the cyanobacteria Anabaena variabilis has been characterized previously. Our team seeks to optimize these genes for high-volume expression in E. coli and study their effects on bacterial survival rates under high-UV environments. The standardization of these genetic components into the iGEM registry will help foster collaborative research into the potential applications of mycosporine-like amino acids as alternatives to toxic synthetic sunscreens, protection for terraforming bacteria in harsh UV environments, and as antibiotic-free selectable markers for genetic engineering.:::2015
