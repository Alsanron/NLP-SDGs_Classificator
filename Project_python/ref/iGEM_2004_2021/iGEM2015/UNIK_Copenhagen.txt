UNIK_Copenhagen:::Europe:::Denmark:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SpaceMoss: Using synthetic biology for space exploration:::Space Moss is working on the quest to colonize Mars by bringing together Astrophysics and Synthetic Biology. The idea of Martian colonisation have captured our minds for generations. Creating a sustainable environment on Mars where humans could survive, however, is not a trivial problem. Synthetic biology could help provide a solution by creating genetically modified organisms capable of producing essential compounds for Mars-colonist survival. Our first step has been to make moss able to produce compounds essential for it to thrive on Mars. We focus on an antifreeze protein, as it could help the moss to survive the extreme temperatures found on the surface of the planet. Our second step is to produce compounds useful to colonists. Therefore, we have been working on getting it to produce resveratrol, as a proof-of-concept of medical applications.:::2015
