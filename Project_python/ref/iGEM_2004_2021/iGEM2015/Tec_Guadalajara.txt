Its molecular structure gives it unique physical and chemical characteristics. One method to synthesize graphene involves the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) into functionalized graphene (rGO). This method requires the use of dangerous chemicals that threatens the environment and our health so its use is limited only to laboratories that produce it in small scale. We were able to successfully reduce GO into rGO using an organic molecule derived from glucose and evaluate the physical properties of the obtained rGO. Our plan is to transform P. pastoris GS115 so it can express glucose oxidase (GOD) and gluconolactone oxidase (GLO) enzymes and the reducing agent can be synthesized from glucose. We hope that this projectâ€™s results allow the production at an industrial level of graphene in order to help trigger the technological revolution of graphene.:::2015
