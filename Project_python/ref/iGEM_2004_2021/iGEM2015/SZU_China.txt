SZU_China:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: AND GATE genetic circuit based on UAA Orthogonal system to detect bladder cancer:::Nowadays,bladder cancer is one of the most urologic tumours in the world.However,theconventional therapy of cancer such as  chemotherapy and radiation,have focused on mass cellkilling  without specific targeting and often cause side effects and frequent failures. Here we present the Synthesizing AND GATE genetic circuit based on UAA (Unnatural Amino  Acid) and Orthogonal system  that will detect and induce  the apoptosis of bladder cancer cell. The system encompasses two parts.One is the synthesizing gene circuit which only operates  in bladder cancer cells that behaves  as a logical AND gate on two input promoters.Another part is to insert the synthesized unnatural amino  acids in the bladder cancer cell to continue the protein translation at TAG(amber mutation) in order to activate the effectors. This methodology is based on the orthogonal system which enable the unnatural amino acids  to generate protein without affecting  other partsâ€™ work. As a result, the output gene will hinder the tumour growth and induce  apoptosis.:::2015
