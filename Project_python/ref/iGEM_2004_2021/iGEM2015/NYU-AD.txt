NYU-AD:::Asia:::United Arab Emirates:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Self-sustaining, E. coli-based mosquito trap:::The NYUAD iGEM team aims to create a self-sustaining mosquito trap. The trap attracts mosquitoes by secreting indole and lactic acid, both of which are highly attractive to a broad range of mosquitoes. Indole is produced from tryptophan by E.coli with the genes tnaA and tnaB. Similarly, lactic acid is produced from fructose by E. coli with the gene lldD. After being attracted by the two organic compounds and flying into the trap, the mosquitoes will be stunned and electrocuted by an electric mesh. They will fall onto the medium containing the E.coli. The hard exoskeleton of the mosquitoes is digested by chitinase (produced by the gene ChiA in E.coli). With the hard outer exoskeletons removed, the mosquitoes serve as a carbon source to maintain E. coliâ€™s growth, hence creating a self-sustaining system. We hope that this trap will provide a cheap, sustainable alternative to current mosquito traps.:::2015
