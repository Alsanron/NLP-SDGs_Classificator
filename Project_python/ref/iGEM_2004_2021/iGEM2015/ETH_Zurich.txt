ETH_Zurich:::Europe:::Switzerland:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MicroBeacon: A Microbial Beacon for Cancer Detection::: Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are indicators of the initial stages of metastasis. However, most state-of-the-art detection methods target only a few cancer-type-specific markers. We developed a bacterial signal processing system for sensitive and selective single-cell detection of CTCs in blood samples. We start by selectively inducing apoptosis in CTCs using sTRAIL before adding our engineered Escherichia coli, called MicroBeacons. Through the expression of the Annexin V protein on their outer membrane, MicroBeacons bind to the apoptotic CTCs. Upon binding, MicroBeacons detect the increased lactate production of the CTCs via a lactate sensor and trigger quorum sensing between each other, which results in expression of fluorescent protein. Overall, the MicroBeacons selectively generate stronger fluorescence on the surface of sTRAIL-sensitive and lactate-secreting tumor cells compared to healthy cells. We anticipate our device to be a reliable, fast, and cheap method for the detection of metastasis for a wide range of cancers.:::2015
