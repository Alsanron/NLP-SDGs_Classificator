NCTU_Formosa:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: The APOllO E.Cotector:::Targeted therapy is a kind of cancer treatment that uses medicine or other substances to more precisely identify biomarkers and attack cancer cells. Currently, several targeted therapies are simultaneously used to accurately treat cancer patients. Thus in our project, we established a multiple targeting detection platform. We modified Escherichia coli (E. coli) to display single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies from targeted drug monoclonal antibodies on the cell membrane to bind with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) antigens. The three separate anti-EGFR, anti-VEGF, and anti-HER2 E. coli systems can be unified to apply a multi-marker concept before, during, and after treatment. This novel detection approach can help medical professionals by generating more accurate diagnoses, which leads to a better prescription for patients.:::2015
