CAU_China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Herbicide vs Herbicide Resistant Gene:::Every year numbers of pesticide is used in agricultural industry.large part of the pesticide is herbicide. However,the weeds have somehow developed to be resistant to the herbicide because of the more and more extensive use of the herbicide. Therefore, people have to raise the amount of herbicide used in agricultural industry year by year, but the increased amount of herbicide have caused a lot of harmful effect such as toxic substance remaining, crop growth being inhibited and so on. In order to solve the problem, a novel use of herbicide has been figured out—— the mix of herbicide. The mix use of the herbicide has plenty of benefits including decreasing the dose, increasing the efficacy, decreasing the poison residual and expanding the weed control spectrum. In order to adapting the novel use of herbicide, our team created four new genes, all of which have the resistance to two different herbicide.:::2015
