One of the factors that limit the application of contraceptive device is the convenience. Contraceptive pill needs to be consumed every day in the same hour, moreover, there are hormonal side effects to the pill such as obesity. Observing these problems, team UI_Indonesia try to create more convenient contraceptive method, we call it; BaContraception, short for Bacterial Contraception. We sought to add spermicidal property to these Lactobacillus sp. Inhabiting the vagina. Thus, the woman inoculated with our engineered Lactobacillus sp. Are always on contraception. We also sought the device to be able to be switched to not producing the spermicidal protein. Thus, we design a toggle switch circuit that can be switched back and forth between producing the contraceptive protein and not by addition of simple sugars such as lactose and xylose.:::2015
