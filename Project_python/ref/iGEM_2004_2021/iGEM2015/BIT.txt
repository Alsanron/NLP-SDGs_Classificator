BIT:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Disease Alarm [When Matchmaker Comes to Help]:::This project is aiming at using synthetic biological engineering bacteria, connected with the aptamers, to make engineering bacteria able to detect the macromolecules, thus providing biological solutions in the field of medical science, biology，chemistry, and so forth. Comparing with current chemical or physical detecting method, biological detecting method has the following advantages. One is that the cost of microorganism is much lower, and it reproduces efficiently. On the other hand, the genetic circuit, which is modified based on the synthetic biology, is able to amplify the micro signals, and improve the accuracy. Most importantly, it’s more convenient for users to operate with our hardware. In the future, the project will focus on detecting accuracy, detecting range and detecting type. The detecting method will be applied to POCT and be launched on the market ultimately.:::2015
