UMBC-Maryland:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Copper Bioremediation Using Genetically Engineered E. Coli:::Copper is a major pollutant in a variety of freshwater ecosystems. When copper is oxidized from Cu+ to Cu2+, it often produces a free radical known as a reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is capable of severely damaging biological molecules. E. coli have the ability to uptake copper, but after a certain threshold, the copper becomes toxic to the cell. Due to the toxicity of copper, E. coli quickly saturate and are unable to uptake more than a small amount of copper. Our goal is to increase the efficiency of copper uptake in E. coli for the purpose of bioremediation in freshwater ecosystems. We engineered E. coli to express the yeast CUP1 gene in an attempt to increase copper tolerance. CUP1 encodes a metallothionein protein that binds 11 copper atoms, thereby preventing formation of the ROS. In addition, metallothionein detoxifies hydroxyl radicals with its cysteine groups.:::2015
