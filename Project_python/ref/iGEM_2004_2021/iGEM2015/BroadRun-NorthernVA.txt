BroadRun-NorthernVA:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Industrial Wastewater Treatment: Secretion and Synthesis of Bacterial Alpha Amylase by S.cerevisiae:::Industrial construction manufacturers recently switched to using paper instead of trees in some of their products. This leads to an excess of short chain cellulose fibers in the factoryâ€™s water system. Microbes feed off the starches and produce odorous butyric acid. The current solution is to use biocides, but this is expensive, short term, and environmentally unsafe. Our solution is to engineer a S.cerevisiae cell to produce the alpha amylase enzyme from B.amyloliquefaciens. The alpha amylase breaks down the starch molecules in the water, removing the food source of the butyric acid producing microbes. The genetically modified yeast were tested in both soluble starch concentrations and industrial water samples. The amount of starch dropped from .006% to 0% within two hours. The amylase enzyme is able to degrade starch effectively in industrial water samples, making it a viable, sustainable, and environmentally safe treatment of industrial wastewater.:::2015
