TU_Darmstadt:::Europe:::Germany:::Hardware:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Building with Light:::3D-printing has become a highly applicable technique, improving numerous engineering processes including rapid prototyping. The technique allows the production of almost any imaginable structure. A variety of 3D-printing methods have been developed, for instance Stereolithography (SLA) - enabling the realization of many utilization options. We produce monomer compounds in E.coli, nominal xylitol, itaconic acid and ethylene glycol by metabolic engineering. Those compounds were combined by a chemical hydrolysis reaction creating a pre-polymer. The final polymerization reaction is promoted when defined light waves hit the pre-polymer liquid transforming it into a solid polymer. We want to use this technology to advance medical engineering. In cooperation with Synenergene, we developed an application scenario to identify the best way to provide an accurate on-site matching prosthesis to victims of forced amputations. Fast and accurate production of those parts in one piece could render quick and easy help, especially in crisis areas.:::2015
