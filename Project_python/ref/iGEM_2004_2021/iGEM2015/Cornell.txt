Cornell:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::fishPHARM: A Genetically Engineered Solution to Bacterial Coldwater Disease in Salmonid Fish:::Salmonid fish are among one of the leading agricultural exports worldwide. Unfortunately, thousands of these otherwise viable or edible fish are wasted each year to bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD). BCWD is a potentially lethal bacterial infection that currently lacks an effective industrial solution and is caused by the pathogen Flavobacterium psychrophilum. Our fishPHARM system offers a comprehensive treatment for BCWD and is composed of a biologically synthesized peptide integrated into a fish tag drug delivery mechanism to safely administer our treatment to infected fish without environmental harm. Recent research has shown that the entericidin B peptide provides resistance against F. psychrophilum, thereby acting as a curative agent for infected fish. In order to determine the most effective BCWD biological treatment, we aim to engineer E. coli for the production of over twenty different entericidins and to test their activity against F. psychrophilum.:::2015
