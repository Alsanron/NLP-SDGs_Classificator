NEAU-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Enzyme Brick——Scaffold Protein-mediated Assembly of Immobilized Enzyme:::Immobilized enzyme technology is a far more efficient process which allows enzymes to be held in place throughout the reaction, therefore,they are easily separated from the products and is widely used in industry for enzyme catalysed reactions. Cellulosome are muti-enzyme complex present by a variety of cellulases, hemicellulases relying on the specific interaction of cohesion-dockerin. Based on the cellulosome structure, we propose a method: cellulose as immobilization substrate, CBM(cellulose-binding module)as fixed labels, using three pairs of specific cohesion-dockerins to build scaffolding protein structure in order to improve the amount of enzyme immobilization, increase the catalytic efficiency of the immobilized enzyme and reduce the cost of purification enzyme. The project is not only a new attempt of immobilized enzyme technology, but also for building multi-immobilized enzyme complex to explore new avenues.:::2015
