IIT_Madras:::Asia:::India:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A system to tackle anti-biotic resistance leveraging the power of natural selection:::Our iGEM project aims to tackle the emerging problem of antibiotic resistance by leveraging the power of natural selection. It is known that higher exposure to antibiotics leads to the resistance against that antibiotic in bacterial populations. Here, we come up with a solution to this problem. We will synthesize a bacterial system that: Senses the cell density of pathogenic bacteria Releases anti-microbial peptides(to mimic anti-biotics) which kill pathogens, when it has sensed high cell density As the population goes down we release a peptide that neutralizes the activity of anti-microbial peptides, resulting into a stress free environment. The stress-free environment would be favourable to the wild type pathogen compared to the mutant pathogens which have developed antibiotic resistance, hence eliminating antibiotic resistence from the pathogenic population.:::2015
