BIT-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::pH-Controller:::Precise artificial pH control is a worldwide concern because fluctuation of pH can tremendously influence the cellsâ€™ performance. So BIT-CHINA designed an intelligent pH-Controller inside the cell. Our pH-Controller contains two sub-systems. One is resistance system, and the other is fine-regulation system. Resistance system can make bacteria survive in an expanded range of pH. Fine-regulation system is used to adjust the environmental pH by synthesis of acid or alkali. Several kinds of recombinase were applied in this sub-system to achieve various regulation effectiveness. The two sub-systems working together allows for lowered artificial pH regulation costs in industrial fermentation, meanwhile the two systems also can regulate the pH of soil, because the hosts with our pH-Controller will maintain high efficiency when the environmental pH is not optimal and they can adjust the environmental pH as we expect. Combined with the projects we did before, our project can achieve more functions.:::2015
