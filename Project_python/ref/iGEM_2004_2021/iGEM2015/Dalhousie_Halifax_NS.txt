The anthocyanin delphinidin is plentiful in ripened blueberries and is responsible for giving them their blue color. Our goal is to engineer a biosynthetic pathway in the model organism Escherichia coli that produces delphinidin. Nine genes are required for the conversion of phenylalanine, which occurs naturally in E. coli, to delphinidin. We have cloned or synthesized all nine plant genes. Our approach is to assemble the nine plant-derived genes into 3 operons and express them in E. coli. Production of specific enzymes will be verified by immunoblotting and production of intermediate compounds will be monitored by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Production of delphinidin in E. coli will provide a robust phenotype that may be exploited to identify factors that can increase production of useful pigments such as delphinidin and also related compounds.:::2015
