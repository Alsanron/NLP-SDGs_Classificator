Carnegie_Mellon:::North America:::United States:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BEAM, Biosensor Emission Analysis Machine:::Biological systems contain diverse receptors that can be coupled to a reporter and a device to measure output. To enable the design and fabrication of DIY biosensors we are creating schematics, a parts list and detailed instructions on how to build a low cost luminometer and fluorimeter. The precision, accuracy, and sensitivity of the instrument will be demonstrated using a set of luciferase and fluorescent protein reporters. An estrogen biosensor was constructed that responds to 17-Î²-estradiol at concentrations ranging from 1nM to 100uM. The system was then modeled in BioNetGen to inform lab experiments. The luminometer is a simple photodiode detector with the signal being integrated using an Arduino and output data being processed with open source software. The fluorimeter is an extension that includes an LED light source and emission/excitation filters appropriate for the fluorescent protein to be analyzed. The entire device is encased in a 3D printed shell.:::2015
