PacificU-Oregon:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Creation of Novel Construction Materials from Insect Cuticle Proteins:::We are investigating the use of several insect cuticle proteins for use as a novel, 3D printable protein matrix to be used in construction and consumer products. Insect exoskeletons have a wide variety of properties and strengths that make them ideal for use in construction, particularly those found in the beetle elytra. Some elytra have been measured to have a greater strength-to-weight ratio than concrete, and at sufficient density make for formidable armor. Our research has shown that by controlling the expression of phenoloxidases, the hardening of the cuticle proteins can be indirectly controlled. This provides us with a mechanism to harden a 3D printed cell suspension into a high-density concrete-like protein matrix.:::2015
