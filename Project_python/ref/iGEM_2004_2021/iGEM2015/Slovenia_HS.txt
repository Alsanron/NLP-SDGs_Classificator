In nature, bacteria of Clostridium genus have been shown to produce butanol from butanoic acid. In the present study, C. acetobutylicum metabolic pathway for butanol production was introduced into E. coli via a construct, consisting of three genes (CtfA, CtfB and BdhB). Polypeptide CtfAB converts butyrate to butyryl-CoA, which is then transformed to butanol by means of BdhB dehydrogenase. Butyrate is formed as an intermediate product in a reaction pathway of direct biological conversion of waste. We successfully composed an optimized system of bioreactors to produce pure butanol and use all side products formed. In the first stage the waste is converted to biogas, natural fertilizer and butyrate, the latter being efficiently transformed to biobutanol in the second stage.:::2015
