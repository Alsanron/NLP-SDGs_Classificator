Virginia:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::House of Carbs: A Novel Solution to Minimizing Postprandial Hyperglycemic Spikes:::Postprandial glycemic spikes (PGSs) occur when the concentration of blood sugar rises and falls following a meal. For diabetics, complications resulting from PGSs are the leading cause of death. Of the 100 million U.S. hyperglycemic patients, twenty-six percent regulate spikes through self-administered insulin, which is costly or easily misdosed. To reduce the amplitude of PGSs, we designed a sugar-concentration-dependent microbial system that delays and reduces the absorption of glucose and fructose from the small intestine. To show proof of principle, we introduced two genetic devices into E.coli to polymerize glucose into glycogen, to polymerize fructose into levan, and to induce cell lysis to release the polymerized sugar into the gut, thus reducing the amplitude of the glycemic spike. This microbial system, as a one-dose-fits-all solution, dynamically adjusts to glycemic spikes of fluctuating amplitudes. This system is a safer alternative to dosage-dependent drug therapies to stabilize blood sugar levels.:::2015
