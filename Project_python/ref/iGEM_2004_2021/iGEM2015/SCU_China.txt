SCU_China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. pangu: The Pioneer of Mars:::The discovery of Kepler-452b called public attention on space migration again. As a matter of fact, the immigration to Mars, the most earthlike planet in solar system, still should be considered as priority. It is noticeable that CO2 and N2 occupy almost 98% of Martian atmosphere. Thus, we engineered two types of E.coli, which carry out anaerobic carbon fixation with Acetyl-CoA Synthetase/Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase(ACS/CODH) system, and nitrogen fixation with Paenibacillus nitrogenase respectively. Based on this purpose, they are called E. Pangu collectively, which is named after the creator of universe, Pan Gu in Chinese mythology. E. pangu is designated to play the role of pioneer organism on Mars immigration. In addition, we used CRISPR-Cas 9 technique to confirm the reliability of our carbon fixation system and verified a promoter part which can be induced by Rhl and repressed by Las.:::2015
