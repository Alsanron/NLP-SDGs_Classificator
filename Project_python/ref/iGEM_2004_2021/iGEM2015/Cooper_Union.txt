Cooper_Union:::North America:::United States:::Hardware:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Loomino: Your personal DNA synthesizer.:::Loomino is an enzyme based DNA synthesizer that combines the de novo synthesis capabilities of the enzyme TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase), along with the controllable addition of 3’ reversible protective group nucleotides (3’ RPG-dNTPs). By programming Loomino to perform sequential addition, decoupling and wash steps with user specified 3’ RPG-dNTPs, an ssDNA molecule can be synthesized de novo, to the user’s specifications. The synthesized ssDNA can be readily flanked with 3’ and 5’ ends containing BioBrick compatible sequences, along with universal primer sites, enabling the final formation of a user defined RFC compatible dsDNA product.:::2015
