Bordeaux:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cur'd vine:::European vineyards are threatened by an oomycete called Plasmopara viticola, which infects and drains the resources of grapevine tissues, mainly through leaves and creates irreparable lesions. The most common preventive treatment is called “Bouillie Bordelaise” and is composed of copper sulfate but has toxic effects on the surrounding soils. Our team proposes to produce an alternative ecological treatment called Curdlan in two host organisms. This β1,3 glucan stimulates the plant’s immune system therefore protecting it from mildew attacks. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae we plan on overexpressing the Curdlan synthase gene (FKS1) to maximize production, while in Escherichia coli we will be inserting three genes: the Curdlan Synthase gene (crdS), and two genes which assist the transportation of nascent polymers in the cell (crdA and crdC). We then plan on optimizing the production and sulfating the Curdlan molecules since it has been shown that this enhances its protective capacities.:::2015
