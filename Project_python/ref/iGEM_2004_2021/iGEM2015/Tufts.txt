Tufts:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing platform into epithelial cells using Clostridium difficile toxin B:::Our goal is to functionalize the CRISPR-Cas9 system as a therapeutic for the targeted disruption of deleterious genes in human cell cultures. This will entail the delivery of the Cas9 endonuclease and guide RNAs through the cell membrane and into the nuclei of somatic cells such that double-stranded breaks can be induced at the desired loci. We seek to leverage the cellular penetration capabilities of the atoxic Clostridium difficile toxin B (aTcdB) which very efficiently mediates endocytosis and escapes endosomal capture. By adding Cas9 upstream of the catalytically inactive glucosyltransferase domain of the toxin, we hope to develop a recombinant fusion protein that will deliver into the cytoplasm an NLS-tagged Cas9 bound to a guide RNA. We aim to express the Cas9-aTcdB protein in Bacillus megaterium, transcribe the guide RNAs in vitro, and incubate this complex with HeLa cell cultures to excise a repressor and allow GFP to be expressed.:::2015
