WashU_StLouis:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Construction of a minimal nif cluster and computational modeling to optimize nitrogen fixation:::Fixed nitrogen is an essential component of artificial fertilizers. However, given the heavy environmental and economic costs of fertilizers, interest in biological nitrogen fixation has recently increased. One possible alternative to artificial fertilizers is to transfer the highly active Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 nitrogen-fixing (nif) cluster to plant chloroplasts. However, further characterization of the cluster is needed before that can be done. We attempted to determine the set of genes from the large Cyanothece nif cluster necessary for nitrogen fixation and inserted our selected genes into two plasmids. In order to further characterize our minimal cluster, we developed CRISPR/dCas9 knockdown plasmids and overexpression plasmids. Additionally, we studied a genome-scale model of nitrogen-fixing E. coli through flux balance analysis that will help us optimize cofactors necessary for nitrogen fixation. We identified potential genetic interventions and media modifications that could improve cell energy levels, growth, and production of fixed nitrogen.:::2015
