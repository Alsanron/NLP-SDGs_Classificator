GeorgiaTech:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Solution That Clicks!:::The copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction has been widely used in the laboratory for tagging or labeling biological molecules, but it cannot be directly applied in living organisms because of the toxicity associated with excess or free copper ions. No enzyme exists to catalyze the CuAAC reaction, but its development would perfectly complement the growing ability of scientists to introduce azide- and alkyne-labeled molecules into biological systems. Our goal is to discover a protein to bind Cu ions safely in vivo and perform the CuAAC reaction. We will attempt this by generating a large library of Cu-binding proteins, developing a reliable phage display system to screen for the desired CuAAC activity, and evolving any active enzymes for improved function.:::2015
