Scut-Champion-Park:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: Research on Biosensor of Tetracycline in food by Synthetic Biology:::The misuse of antibiotics is endangering human health and ecological balance. In terms of medicine use, we can develop standards to use antibiotics reasonably. But agricultural uses of antibiotics produce environmental exposures in a variety of reservoirs, which are impossible to be guarded against. Our group has developed a simple, reliable and efficient method to measure the antibiotics.Our Tetracycline biosensor can detect the tetracycline residues in agricultural products (such as: meat, eggs, milk, etc.). Our group constructed the tetracycline inducible expression system. And through plasmid mediated, the system was transfected into Escherichia coli TOP10 and GS115 Pichia pastoris. It can generate a rtTA transcription activation factor in cells. RtTA combining with tetracycline antibiotics can activate the fluorescent protein expression system, which can indicate the residue level of tetracycline by fluorescence detection.:::2015
