Gifu:::Asia:::Japan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Circular mRNA ver.2.0:::In last year, we succeeded in designing the sequence which synthesizes circular mRNA and long chain protein in Escherichia coli. In this year, we had 2 purposes in our study. One was an efficiency of the circularization. The efficiency was lower in our previous study. This was why the splicing was hard to happen because two sequences to act as ribozyme for splicing were far each other. So we incorporated complementary sequences around the ribozyme regions. We thought that the treatment brought two regions close and the efficiency of the circularization improved. The other was to synthesize useful proteins. In our previous study, synthesized long-chain proteins lose their function because the folding of the proteins was broken. So we incorporated linker sequences into circular mRNA to synthesize the functional long-chain protein.:::2015
