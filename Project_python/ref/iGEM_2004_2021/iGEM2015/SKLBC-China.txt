Targeting iGEM community, we upgraded WEiGEM 2.0, a cloud-based bio-brick search engine, by new features including optimizing the search algorithm, personalized search options, auto-addition of prefix and suffix and instant mark-and-share your bio-bricks on your mobile phones. With in-time and well-sifted biology articles, WEiGEM 2.0 serves as an educational and social media center where iGEMers’ ideas flow toward biology lovers. We further developed an education tool kit “1kg Bio-Box” to engage potential millions of students in remote areas of China into synthetic biology. In conclusion, we manage to build bridges in connecting thousands of bio-bricks to iGEM community and public.:::2015
