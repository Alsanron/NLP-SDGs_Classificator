Linkoping_Sweden:::Europe:::Sweden:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Go nuts, without peanuts!:::Peanut allergy is the deadliest food allergy. We aim to help those suffering from peanut allergy by designing a portable and intuitive detector available to anyone. The detection system utilizes a protein complex which recognizes the peanut allergen Arah1. It is composed of our own constructed protein attached to an Arah1 specific antibody conjugated to FITC. The constructed protein consists of epitope 2 from Arah1 and RFP. Arah1 has higher affinity than epitope 2 towards the binding site. Therefore, the constructed protein will be replaced and leave the antibody, if Arah1 has contaminated the food sample. We can measure if the constructed protein is attached by using FRET, a mechanism utilized to determine if two different fluorofores are at a close distance, in our case FITC and RFP. The different wavelengths emitted is measured and processed by electrical components. We also have a side project, replacing RFP with a quencer.:::2015
