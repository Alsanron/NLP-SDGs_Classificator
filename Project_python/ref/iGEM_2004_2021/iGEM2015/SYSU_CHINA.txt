SYSU_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Micro-Timer::: This year, we develop a plug-in for microbes, a system that can build up a living clock for microbes and guide them to live regularly as well as to work efficiently. Also, microbes with the system inserted acquire the concept of life span so that some dangerous bacterias will come to death in time before they cause any biohazard. Inverted components which based on recombinase system are introduced in our system. One inverted component is able to calculate a period of time, while several inverted components comprise of one time cycle. When we combine several time cycles together, a sequence with a timer's function has been successfully formed. Through altering recombinases and their specific sites to different matches, we can get distinctive time cycles. We believe that the system will be of great importance to biological devices with time-related concepts.:::2015
