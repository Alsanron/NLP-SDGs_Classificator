Mingdao:::Asia:::Taiwan:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Fire Retardant Bio-Coating:::Fire can kill life when it gets out of control. Fire is an oxidation-reduction reaction of chemical process. Flame combustion starts from three main elements, so-called fire triangle, that is, heat, oxygen and fuel. Fire can expand further by the chain reaction induced by active free radicals made from the combustion. Fire retardant materials have wide applications to slow or even stop the fire. However, the major of these materials are synthesized from chemicals, and many of them have been proven as toxic. As a result, natural biomaterials with fire retardant properties are increasingly important. Casein and wool have been reported as effective fire retardant biomaterials. This year, we are going to analyze the components in casein and wool as well as figure out why they can retard the fire. By this knowledge, we can design and genetically engineer the bacteria to be novel fire retardant biomaterials without toxicity.:::2015
