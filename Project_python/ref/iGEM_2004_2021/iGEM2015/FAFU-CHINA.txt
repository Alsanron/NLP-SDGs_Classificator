FAFU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CSBV.silencer:::Sacbrood virus(SBV) is one of the main causes of the significant honeybee colony losses. FAFU-China team aims to investigate the possibility of controlling this disease through silence of CSBVâ€™s RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) gene by using RNA-interference technology. We have created two recombinant plasmids and transformed them into brewer yeast. This yeast is responsible for the production of dsRdRp fragment. After being cut by the dicer, the dsRNA become siRNA (Small interfering RNA), which cause silence of RdRp gene, and the goal of virus control can be achieved.:::2015
