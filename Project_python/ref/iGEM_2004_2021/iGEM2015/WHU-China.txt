WHU-China:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Limbo: Criticality Detector:::We intend to construct a threshold detection system which could generate pulse output when the input reaches predefined threshold. This type of module is very important in biology systems, because it can function as a signal filter, a signal multiplier or a time-frequency domain signal convertor (like the Hodgkin-Huxley model in action potential generation). To achieve threshold detection, we set up a red light sensor to obtain input and a negative feedback circuit to generate pulse output with good intensity and modularity. In our case, along with the other two systems we built, the module is proved to have potential application in biological computer and homeostasis maintenance. The former aids in storing addressable binary data in living cells while the latter helps prevent dental caries (tooth decay) by controlling the population of Streptococcus mutans at a satisfactory level.:::2015
