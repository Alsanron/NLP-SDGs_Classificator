IISER_Pune:::Asia:::India:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mycobacterium Revelio : Overclocking the Cell Cycle:::Tuberculosis, an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, affects nearly two billion people all over the world. India has the highest burden of TB with World Health Organisation statistics for 2013 giving an estimated incidence of 2.1 million cases of active TB. Culture-based detection requires 4 weeks, hindering rapid detection in patient samples. We aim to develop a robust and self-sustained genetic device for rapid diagnostics, with the speed of PCR combined with the robustness of a growth assay, even in resource poor settings. With a joint approach of experimental testing and modeling, we are targeting factors that regulate the cell cycle of M. smegmatis and E. coli as model organisms. Our genetic device, comprising of Detector, Oscillator and Terminator modules, will reduce the time span for TB diagnosis from weeks to hours in a cost-effective manner.:::2015
