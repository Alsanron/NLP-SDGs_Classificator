SYSU-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CORE -- Crowdsourcing Open Redesign Engine:::The complexity in biological systems has limited genetic circuit design in synthetic biology. Without co-development and an open, proof-of-principle engineering platform, it is hard for synthetic biologists to manage this complexity. To address this problem, we developed CORE, an open and extensible software that allows users to design, share and cooperate in synthetic biology. CORE mainly consists of two closely interconnected modules. One is the open, crowdsourcing platform. It helps users design and redesign, share and reuse previous work according to the principle of modularized design. The other one is the design module embedded in the platform, which promotes genetic design automation based on ODE (ordinary differential equation) models and assists wet-lab practices through protocol management. In conclusion, the combination of a crowdsourcing platform and a novel design module makes complex design more accessible to synthetic biologists.:::2015
