York:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Phil Phosphate: Filling Escherichia coli with phosphate.:::Phosphate pollution from wastewater causes eutrophication, resulting in environmental damage. Current methods routinely used to remove phosphate involve chemical approaches, which themselves can be polluting. Our project builds on the enhanced biological phosphate removal process, using natural bacterial communities as an alternative to these chemicals. We are engineering Escherichia coli to enhance its phosphate acquisition. This will be achieved by upregulation of the native phosphate transport and metabolism genes. We will also add heterologous genes from proposed phosphate accumulating species. Target gene selection is assisted by computer based metabolic modelling. We are improving assays used to determine the phosphate accumulation levels, achieved by our genetically engineered bacteria. New European legislation will require water companies to decrease their maximum phosphate concentrations from 3 mg/L to 0.1 mg/L. Here we hope to engineer an organism which helps to achieve this in a clean and economical way.:::2015
