OUC-China:::Asia:::China:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Magthero coli:::This summer, we are trying to design a platform responsed to electromagnetic signal. This platform is composed of 2 sessions : magnetic receiver and thermosensitive regulator. For magnetic receiver, we chose ferritin, the iron-storage protein in organisms, which could synthesize ferric oxihydroxide core in its hollow protein shell. When exposed to electromagnetic field, the ferric oxihydroxide core would be heated, which would trigger thermosensitive regulator. For thermosensitive regulator, we chose RNA thermometer and constructed a thermosensitive T7 RNA polymerase. RNA thermometer is a structured RNA which could expose RBS only when heated. The thermosensitive T7 RNA polymerase is a normal T7 RNA polymerase at the selected locus of which was inserted by a temperature-sensitive intein, which could self-splice at specific temperature.:::2015
