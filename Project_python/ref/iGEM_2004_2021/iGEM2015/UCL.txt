UCL:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mind the Gut: developing psychobiotics to target the brain-gut-microbiota axis for mental health treatment:::Current research suggests that gut microbes secrete neuroactive compounds that act on the gut-brain axis and play an important role in healthy brain function. The UCL iGEM team has developed novel synthetic psychobiotics that mimic these neuromodulatory strategies identified in endogenous intestinal strains. We have designed safe therapeutic devices that target metabolic pathways for neurochemical biosynthesis. Additionally, we have assessed biocontainment and integrated a sensor detecting mood-related physiological changes in the gut environment. In any year, mental health conditions affect one in four of us and available small molecule treatments have associated stigma and side effects. We believe that, besides aiding in the better understanding of the communication between gut microbiota and brain, our work will also lay a foundation for novel user-friendly treatments for mental health conditions.:::2015
