NYU_Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::Art & Design:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SYNTH:::This Bacterial Music Generator translates the color and positions of bacteria colonies on a plate into sound composition. Integrating the unpredictable nature of life with digital technology, we aim to introduce new forms of bio-data into the sound domain. We engineered E. coli expressing chromoproteins, fluorescent proteins, or luciferase to produce colors visible under white light. Processing converts an image of the bacterial plate into binary data and grid-form. Using the grid as a step sequencer, we can generate patterned sounds.:::2015
