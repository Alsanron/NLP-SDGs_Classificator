Manchester-Graz:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DopaDoser: The Self-Regulating, L-DOPA-Producing Gut Bacteria:::iGEM Manchester-Graz’s aim is to take the first steps in the development of a novel technology for drug delivery by developing self-regulating, drug-producing bacteria. In the future, they could be incorporated into patients’ gut microflora to secrete medicines directly inside the body. We focused on the treatment of early stages of Parkinson’s disease, for which the current treatment involves oral administration of L-DOPA. To control the bacterial L-DOPA production in the gut, we plan to develop a multidimensional, cell density-dependent auto-regulation system that could also be used to control other multistep enzyme pathways. Since Manchester-Graz is an inter-European Team, the Manchester sub-team is working on L-DOPA biosynthesis in E. coli BL21(DE3) and Nissle 1917, while the Graz sub-team is developing the regulation system in the aforementioned strains. The project will be combined in a way that the regulation system would control the rate of biosynthesis for the accurate dosage.:::2015
