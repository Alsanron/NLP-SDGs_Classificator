Exeter:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Design and adaptation of toehold riboswitches to detect specific RNAs with immediate application to M.bovis:::Toehold switches are a novel type of RNA riboregulator that binds a specific trigger RNA sequence. Binding causes conformational changes, revealing an RBS and allowing the expression of a reporter. We aim to design a toehold collection with varying reporters including chromoproteins, fluorescent proteins and bioluminescent luciferase. Our project therefore set out to create a diagnostic test to detect a given RNA sequence in a safe, low-tech and cost-effective manner. The trigger-recognition region of the toehold can be altered to bind different specific RNA targets, changing the application. Our project is tailored towards detection of RNA from Mycobacterium Bovis. A problem prevalent in the southwest UK, it is the cause of bovine TB with current testing unable to distinguish between Mycobacterium strains. Expression of our toeholds will utilise S30 cell-free kits and reporter data will be collected using FACS/TECAN. This data will be used for simulation and model fitting.:::2015
