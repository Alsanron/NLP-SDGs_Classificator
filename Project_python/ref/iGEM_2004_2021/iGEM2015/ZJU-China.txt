ZJU-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::TERMITE TERMINATOR:::The aim of our project is to create a brand-new system to kill termites. We chose two kinds of toxins which are safe and environmentally friendly to eliminate termites. We have cloned genes coding insecticidal toxic proteins from Photorhabdus luminescens TT01, a bacteria poisonous to numerous insects, and express them in E.coli. We enhance the production of Avermectin in S.A. Then, we prepared cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) , and generated the nanofibrous microspheres (NCM) self-assembled from CNC as bacteria carriers, in order to reduce the loss, improve transport efficiency, and target the carrying to aimed location and preventing bacteria from releasing into the environment. Finally, a series of simulation experiments have been conducted. They can help us to understand the cellulase, and confirm the terminator are efficient. Based on the result of simulation, we improved a device to monitor and terminate termites for better achieving.:::2015
