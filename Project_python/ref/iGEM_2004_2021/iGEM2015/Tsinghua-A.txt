Tsinghua-A:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Esophageal cancer test paper.:::Our aim is to build a convenient and harmless method for early diagnosis of esophageal cancer. Studies have confirmed that miRNA expression is highly concordant cross individuals.Comprehensively considering the performance of each miRNA, we finally chose miR-144 and miR-21 as our biomarkers for esophageal cancer. Our test paper can react to MIR144 and MIR21 present in the saliva whose content are proportional to the cancer.To make our detection quick and convenient, we designed synthetic gene pathways based on paper. It will only require some saliva to complete the detection, which will do no harm to human body. And this techniques can be expanded to be used in the detection of many other diseases which has specific miRNA expression pattern in saliva.:::2015
