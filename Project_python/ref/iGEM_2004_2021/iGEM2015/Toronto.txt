Toronto:::North America:::Canada:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Genetically Engineered Solution for Oil Sand Tailings: Enhanced Bioremediation by Toluene Degrading Bacteria:::The concentration of toxic chemical by-products from oil sands exploitations has been increasing since 2012. Recent efforts to address environmental pollution converge towards bioremediation as the most promising solution. While endogenous bacteria such as Pseudomonas Putida F1 can degrade toluene, we optimized E. coli to be more efficient at breaking down 3-methylcatechol, a rate-limiting step in the toluene degradation pathway. We did so by creating 2 plasmids that once co-transformed into E. coli would achieve the metabolization of toluene down to water and carbon dioxide. Additionally, a web application for visualizing, manipulating, and comparing genome-scale metabolic models of bacterial consortia was developed and used to analyse the introduction of our synthetic E. coli into the Athabasca river microbiome. We have created a framework to analyze the optimal solution to the problem present, by considering designs, associated cost profiles, and political risks in the context of Albertaâ€™s soil sand industry.:::2015
