Tokyo-NoKoGen:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ExTermite coli: A new system to exterminate termites using engineered E. coli and pseudo egg:::"ExTermite coli” is a novel system to exterminate termites, which combines an engineered Escherichia coli and a unique pseudo-egg delivery system. The E. coli was engineered to overexpress glucose-3-dehydrogenase (G3DH), which converts trehalose into the trehalase inhibitor 3,3’-diketo-trehalose (3,3’dkt). Because trehalose is a major termite blood sugar and trehalase is essential for trehalose metabolism, G3DH essentially converts trehalose into an insecticide. The pseudo-egg delivery system takes advantage of a habit termites have of carrying their eggs to their nests and licking them. Termites recognize their eggs by sensing β-glucosidase and lysozyme, which act as egg-recognition pheromones. The pseudo eggs, containing both termite egg-recognition molecules and engineered E. coli, will be delivered to their nests and then licked by the termites present, thus allowing the G3DH produced by the E. coli to convert trehalose into insecticide inside the termite bodies. Consequently ExTermite coli can effectively exterminate termites in their nest.:::2015
