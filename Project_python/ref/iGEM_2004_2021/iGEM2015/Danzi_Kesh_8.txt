Danzi_Kesh_8:::Asia:::Israel:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Alergln Project:::The Project's Goal: Develop an innovative biological method for identifying gluten in food. The focus is on developing a gluten binder protein. Principles - A protein changes conformation in response to ligand binding coupled to a reporter gene. The Gln_H protein is a protein which is able to detect glutamine. The two ends join a half-reporter enzyme called HAD. each half of the enzyme is attached a molecule such as color coded GFP. When the Gln H comes into contact with glutamine the closed ends, when the two halves of HAD enzyme connect the enzyme becomes active, followed by a color reaction which can be seen by the human eye. The source HAD enzymes comes from TERMOTOGA MARITIMA ,This bacteria is found in regions of hot springs and is therefor an extra Thermopile bacteria, and its enzymes are very stable.:::2015
