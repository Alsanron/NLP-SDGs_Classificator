Brasil-USP:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RubberBye â€“ Degrading rubber to fuel:::The accumulation of waste tires and rubber products represents a significant environmental problem worldwide. Current recycling techniques demand high energy consumption, and are completely overwhelmed by the annual amount of rubber waste. In addition, natural rubber degradation may take up to 1000 years. Here we aim to accelerate natural rubber degradation by genetically engineering Escherichia coli expressing two enzymes: RoxA (Rubber oxygenase) and Lcp (Latex clearing protein). For degradation of vulcanized rubber, the project includes a pre-treatment using Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, a bacterium that naturally devulcanizes rubber. Both of these processes will be scaled up in bioreactors. The major resulting compound of the designed process is ODTD (12-oxo-4,8-dimethyl-trideca-4,8-diene-1-al), a triisoprene unit that we are working to transform in fuel, a product of high commercial interest. Consequently, besides enabling faster rubber degradation and decreasing final pollutant emission, our project also grants the final product a considerable economic interest.:::2015
