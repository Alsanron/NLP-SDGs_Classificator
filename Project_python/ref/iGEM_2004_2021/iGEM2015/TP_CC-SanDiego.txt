TP_CC-SanDiego:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Engineering E. coli Capable of Extracellular Secretion of Chitin Degradation Enzymes:::Fungi capable of producing harmful mycotoxins flourish on a variety of widely consumed crops, notably bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, and grains. Such fungal infections significantly reduce sustainability and food production in developing countries, where lack of advanced food storage and mycotoxin exposure are responsible for severe economic losses and 40% of diseases. As such, our team focused on developing a secretable chitinase capable of hydrolysing the glycosidic bonds which compose the polysaccharide chitin, a key structural component in fungal cellular walls. By fusing LbCHI31 chitinase-encoding genes with a secretion signal peptide from alpha-amylase, we successfully generated an escherichia coli line that secretes chitinase specific to fusarium oxysporum, a major pathogenic fungi. LbCHI31 extracellular secretion and effectiveness were further quantified through characterization and analysis. This project will allow for easily accessible, cost-effective methods for producing effective chitinases that combat fungal infections, thereby increasing crop yield, stabilizing financial growth, and reducing famine globally.:::2015
