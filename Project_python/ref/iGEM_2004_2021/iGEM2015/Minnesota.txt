Minnesota:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Eukaryotic Expression: Microscopic Translation to Macroscopic Communication:::Both technical and social obstacles hinder widespread use of synthetic biology approaches. One technical challenge is optimization of multi-enzyme pathway gene expression. Viral 2A sequences can improve translational efficiency of polycistronic encoded proteins. Here we demonstrated the utility of this technology in yeast by expressing genes to produce compounds in the beta carotenoid pathway. Furthermore, we have developed a mathematical model to estimate gene order for optimal biosynthetic production using 2A sequence and present it as a community tool to streamline future applications. Finally, accurate and widespread public knowledge regarding the use of genetically modified organisms is vital for increasing social acceptance of synthetic biology. We have correlated word usage to opinions regarding biotechnology to inform future efforts to engage the public.:::2015
