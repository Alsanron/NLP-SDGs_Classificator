Chalmers-Gothenburg:::Europe:::Sweden:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A study in Scarlet:::Biologically based manufacturing can produce numerous types of complex products. One of the biggest problems is the robustness of the system. Great progress has been made with industrial production techniques, but contaminations are still a considerable problem the industry faces. Insufficient control of contaminations in bioreactors could compromise entire batches, resulting in high expenses. Team Chalmers Gothenburg will solve the contamination problem once and for all using a novel strategy to detect and combat contaminations in yeast based bioreactors. The solution involves two genetic systems, one signaling and contamination detection system and one repair system for survival after contamination termination. These two systems are made from innovative uses of ESDSA repair, CRISPR technology and MAPK cascades. The two systems also set the foundation for a whole range of new applications, from DNA assembly to laboratory markers. More will be revealed in this study in scarlet.:::2015
