Stony_Brook:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Nephrotides: Regulating Blood Glucose Levels with Peptide Secreting Microbes:::Current treatments for diabetes are effective in the short term but require patients to constantly monitor their blood sugar. We aim to create a durable system that can independently regulate blood glucose levels to prevent hyperglycemic crises and improve the quality of life of type II diabetics. We engineered E. coli that can detect changes in blood osmolarity and release pharmacologically active tripeptides in response. The tripeptides act on the kidneys by inhibiting the SGLT1 and SGLT2, two channels proteins that re-uptake glucose out of the urine. By inhibiting this reabsorption, the body is able to excrete excess glucose to counteract hyperglycemia. As of now, our system relies on a general sensor for blood osmolarity, but future studies will implement a more specific sensor for glucose through a modification of the lac operon.:::2015
