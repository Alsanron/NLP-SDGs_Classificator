Duke:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DNA Sequence Sensing with dCas9 Applied to Antibiotic Resistance Detection and Elimination:::dCas9 has been used for extensively for transcriptional repression but has been shown to be less effective as the amount of decoy bind sites increases. This phenomenon is explored as a circuit for sensing DNA sequence rather than protein. If a sequence is present, dCas9 will titrate away from a synthetic binding site upstream of a report gene to the desired sequence. In our project, we looked at this gene circuit in the context of detecting antibiotic resistance to activate a cell death gene. In preparing for this, we also performed a review of existing BioBricks and novel cell death genes in terms of their efficacy and safety. Other projects include the creation of a $200, garage bio thermocycler and further study of dCas9 repression with multiple orthogonal guide RNAs.:::2015
