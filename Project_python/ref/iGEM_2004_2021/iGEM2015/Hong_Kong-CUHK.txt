Hong_Kong-CUHK:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Magneto-bacter vinelandii â€“ Magnetosome-forming Azotobacter vinelandii with Downstream Applications:::Magnetosome, an organelle encapsulating magnetic iron crystal (magnetite), originates from magnetotactic bacteria. However, with the difficulty to maintain micro-aerobic condition under normal setting for optimal growth, we aim to produce magnetosome in a rapidly grown aerobe, Azotobacter vinelandii, which provides an intracellular anaerobic environment. Not limited in migrating biogenesis machinery to foreign organism, we also developed TWO new downstream applications: (1) Fusing recognition elements with transmembrane protein tightly bound on magnetite. Example includes metal-binding peptides for removing heavy metals from polluted water by biomagnets. (2) Controlling Azotobacter by external magnetic force as a component in microbial fuel cell (MFC). We designed a self-sufficient system by producing hydrogen with mutated nitrogenase, while releasing electron to anode and recycling protons for ATP production by membrane-bound hydrogenase. We expect an electricity production at 30 mA in 0.83 m2 electrode surface area, a 2-fold increase compared to a stainless-steel-mesh bio-cathode MFC.:::2015
