XJTLU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacteria World Map Simulates Global Warming:::This year, XJTLU_China proposed to design E.coli that can simulate the global warming process on the agar plate. The earth has blue marine, green continent and white polar region, and our E.coli, with implanted RNA thermometer, chromoproteins and signal molecules exchange system, will display the original state and the change of each part under the effect of elevated temperature. As we know, global warming will lead to ice melting, sea level rise and land desertification. When sensing the raised temperature, marine bacteria will open RNA thermometer and release signal molecules to ‘erode’ costal and polar bacteria, gradually making them blue and showing the submersion of these regions. Meanwhile, when inland bacteria get warmed, they will turn yellow from green, showing the process of desertification.:::2015
