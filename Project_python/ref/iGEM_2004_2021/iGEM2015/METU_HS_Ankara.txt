METU_HS_Ankara:::Europe:::Turkey:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Repellent Effect of Cinnamaldehyde on Varroa:::Bees are one of the major organisms of ecosystem because of their role on pollunation, food chain and sustainability of life. Varroas attack the honey bees; Apis cerena and Apis mellifera. The European Commission laboratories reported Varroa as the largest single cause of bee mortality. This parasitic mite sucks bees' hemolymph. The hemolymph contains Juvenile Hormone which helps development and reproduction of Varroa mite so it can maintains it's life cycle. There are many drugs for Varroasis treatment but they have some disadvantages; like bee deaths, colony collapses or changing taste of the honey. The purpose of our study is to repell the mites by synthesizing essential oils by Escherichia Coli to get cheaper and more natural solution. Transforming winter green, lemonene, pinene and cinnamyl alcohol (C9H10O) to cinnamaldehyde (C9H8O) are four pathways of our project. The efficacy of each pathway was compared.:::2015
