UCSC:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering the Future of Biofuel:::The project focuses on designing microorganisms that will be able to convert plant waste into viable replacements for fossil fuels. To achieve this goal our team has four main focuses for the experiment each dealing with specific portions of the project. Our Breakdown team is dedicated to producing cellulases within our desired microorganisms to convert the cellulose in plant waste to sugars. The Fermentation team is working on altering the fermentation pathways within our microorganism to convert sugars into alcohol products by transformation of genes found in other alcohol producing microbes. Our Field team is responsible for identifying novel cellulose digesting microorganisms from high saline test sites.:::2015
