AUC_TURKEY:::Europe:::Turkey:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Bactocooler 2: The Revenge of Catalase:::Heat management and regulation is one of the biggest issues of 21st Century. Especially after the development of the refrigeration technologies, the world has adapted to thermo-regulation systems in real-life application, industry and science. This continuing adaptation has led to the dependence on temperature wise systems and their maintenance. The system we wish design in this occasion hopes to combat the issue of heat regulation that contests scientists and firms alike. 'Mr. Pyrofrost' will maintain the temperature of the system at a specific temperature through the functioning of two inversely affecting reactions regulated by the temperature of the system itself. The system stimulates an endothermic reaction pathway in higher temperatures and an exothermic reaction pathway in lower temperatures with one system inhibiting the other during function. The heat conditions of the system will both affect the functioning of 'Mr. Pyrofrost' and also be regulated by 'Mr. Pyrofrost'.:::2015
