Pretoria_UP:::Africa:::South Africa:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Switch-coli:::Transcriptional switches form an integral part of synthetic biology. In the absence of positive feedback loops these systems are unstable since they require the maintained presence of a regulator. DNA switches based on heritable genetic modifications can allow for a permanent change in gene expression even in the absence of the initial signal. The Cre-Lox recombinase system from the P1 bacteriophage has been successfully used in genetic manipulation to excise targeted DNA fragments. Our aim is to use the Cre-Lox recombinase system to trigger a heritable genetic switch that allows for irreversible ON/OFF programming as an alternative to positive feedback loops. We are testing different approaches relying on the inversion and excision of lox-flanked DNA parts. Our long term goal is to integrate this system with signals from quorum sensing and a logic gate to program conditional chemotaxis in motile E. coli.:::2015
