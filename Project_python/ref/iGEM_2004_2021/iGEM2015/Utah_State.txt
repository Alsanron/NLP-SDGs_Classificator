Utah_State:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::LactoWare:::The cheese industry generates billions of dollars each year, and no wonderâ€”cheese is delicious! One of the greatest difficulties that the cheese industry faces is bacteriophage (virus) infection, which kills bacteria used in the manufacture of cheese. The industry utilizes a variety of approaches to deal with this problem, each having their own drawbacks. The 2015 USU iGEM team is implementing a synthetic biology approach to design and create phage resistant Lactococcus lactis, a commonly-used cheese starter bacteria. The genetic mechanism behind this phage resistance functions by pairing a promoter that is activated in the presence of phage with a kill switch to terminate infected cells before phage are able to propagate.:::2015
