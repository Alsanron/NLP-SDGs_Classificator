Jilin_China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Formaldehyde Terminator:::Formaldehyde is one of the most dangerous cancerogen which can be easily found in newly decorated houses or new cars. Because there is no simple and convenient way to detect and degrade formaldehyde, we hope to design biobricks to solve this problem by using microorganism. We find that there is a special promoter called hxlR in Bacillus subtilis, which can be induced by formaldehyde and express downstream genes. First, we use special features of pET vectors to express two key enzymes, named formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and formaldehyde dehydrogenase (PADH). Then we add the gene of T7 RNA polymerase in the downstream of promoter hxlR in PSB1C3. Finally, when T7 polymerase is expressed, Vector pET-DUET can express PADH and FDH. In this way, the whole system can be induced by formaldehyde and express PADH and FDH to degrade it.:::2015
