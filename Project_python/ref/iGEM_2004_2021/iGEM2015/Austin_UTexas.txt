Austin_UTexas:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Evolutionary Stability of Genetic Devices:::After an organism is reprogrammed with a genetic device, the device will often mutate, or “break”, decreasing the metabolic load on the organism and giving it a competitive advantage. This commonly allows the organism with the broken genetic device to dominate the population, undermining the purpose of the original reprogramming. Our goal is to characterize sequences within genes and plasmids that are more likely to mutate, since our research suggests that certain devices are more easily broken than others. We expanded on this research by transforming four E. coli strains with fluorescent protein plasmids. Breaking times varied noticeably between strains, suggesting that the host’s own genetic material also influenced device stability. Based on our findings, we decided to increase the stability of a few genetic devices, including the pDCAF3 plasmid, which the 2012 UT Austin iGEM team designed to allow E. coli to measure caffeine content through caffeine metabolism.:::2015
