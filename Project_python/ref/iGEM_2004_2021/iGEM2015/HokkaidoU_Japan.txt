HokkaidoU_Japan:::Asia:::Japan:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Microbusters:::Main immune system of insects, antimicrobial-peptides (AMPs), is known to have very high potentials and work toward wide range of microbes. Thanks to AMPs, insects prosper around the world even without complex acquired immunity like we humans. Good point of AMPs is that it has less chance of getting resistant microbes since they affect on cell membrane. Our project this year is “Microbusters”. Microbusters are biological device which secretes AMPs. They can be applied to making anti-microbial products or foods. Characteristics of each Microbuster depend on what AMP it secretes, so Microbusters with variety of functions can be designed. We designed two Microbusters. One is Escherichia coli that secrete thanatin, a kind of AMP while it is toxic to its chassis. Second is Lactobacillus casei with α-defensin, which only attacks non-residential flora. Microbusters are going to be a new way to avoid harm from microbes.:::2015
