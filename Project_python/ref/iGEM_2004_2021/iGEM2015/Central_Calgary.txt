Central_Calgary:::North America:::Canada:::High School:::High School:::Accepted::: :::Central iGEMâ€™s project is based on the idea of using antiangiogenic proteins, such as angiostatin, to potentially starve out cancerous growths. Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels develop via cell-signalling pathways. In a healthy body, angiogenesis process is part of normal wound healing, however, it is also often exploited by malignant neoplasms in order to proliferate. Initially, tumours begin as small 1-2mm cubed structures that are harmless, but when there is an imbalance of proangiogenic factors, tumours are able to acquire their own blood supply. One of the most important proangiogenic factors is vascular endothelial growth factor:::2015
