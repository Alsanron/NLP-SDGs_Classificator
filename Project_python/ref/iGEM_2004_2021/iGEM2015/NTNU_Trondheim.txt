NTNU_Trondheim:::Europe:::Norway:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Alginate Encapsulated Glucose Sensors:::Team NTNU Trondheim is constructing a novel glucose sensing system, in which the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida expresses the red fluorescent protein mCherry upon glucose detection (as a proof of concept). To achieve this, the promoters of operons commonly found in P. putida are used. These are negatively controlled; the release of the repressor and thus the expression of subsequent genes is initiated by derivatives of glucose. Further, the engineered bacteria are encapsulated in alginate, a polysaccharide from brown algae. The capsule properties are tailored to best suit our engineered cells and possible applications. Agent-based modeling is conducted to model genetic networks, multiple-physics and growth models. In addition, the iGEM Matchmaker tool is deployed and enhanced with new functionalities.:::2015
