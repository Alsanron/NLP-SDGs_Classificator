FAU_Erlangen:::Europe:::Germany:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SpyCatcher-Associated, Tal-effector-Transmitted Euchromatin Regulation (SCATTER):::Histone remodeling complexes including e.g. deacetylases or acetylasetransferases are fundamental for the control of gene expression by regulating the chromatin structure. Therefore a DNA-binding and a histone modification domain are required. Up to now, these domains are connected pre-transcriptional as fusion proteins. Alternatively, our team is developing a modular system consisting of SpyCatcher and SpyTag that forms a post-translational covalent isopeptide bond. To ensure sequence specificity, we fused a SpyTag to three different TAL effectors. For the epigenetic modification RPD3 was chosen, a histone deacetylase from S. cerevisiae highly conserved among eukaryotes, to which the corresponding SpyCatcher was added. Compared to established methods, this technique greatly simplifies the epigenetic applications that require the control of several gene loci simultaneously.:::2015
