TU_Eindhoven:::Europe:::Netherlands:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Clickable Outer Membrane Biosensors (COMBs): An aptamer-based approach to a universal and modular biosensor platform:::Accurate and early diagnosis of diseases is at the forefront of the medical sciences. Although many biosensors have already become available, a universal biosensor platform is lacking. As a first step towards such a platform, we are introducing a transmembrane biosensor which may in the future be incorporated into signaling pathways. The system is characterized by three modules, aptamers as recognition elements, outer-membrane proteins as the scaffold and signaling components which can translate ligand binding into a measurable signal through heterodimerization. Aptamers can be clicked onto the outer membrane proteins post-translationally using SPAAC click-chemistry, making the system inherently modular. The biosensors can be employed in a wide range of applications: from detecting biomarkers to the overuse of pesticides. We believe that in the future, the system can go beyond its function as a biosensor and may be able to trigger cellular responses.:::2015
