UNITN-Trento:::Europe:::Italy:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Solar pMFC: a Microbial Fuel Cell with a light-driven E. coli engine.:::Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) technology is rapidly evolving due to interest in producing sustainable electricity. Typically, MFCs exploit complex mixtures of microorganisms in which the identity of the microorganisms are unknown. The undefined nature of the source of electrons leads to limitations in the control and optimization of the MFC. We, therefore, attempted to improve the MFC platform by exclusively using E. coli engineered to survive under stressful conditions. E. coli cells were modified to express a light-driven proton pump, which required the assembly of a cofactor synthesis pathway. The proton gradient generated upon the exposure of light was then used by the bacteria to synthesize ATP, thereby turning E. coli into a type of pseudo-autotroph. Furthermore we investigated different genetic approaches to improve the secretion of electrons from E. coli. We built an MFC prototype with our engineered bacteria that are driven by light, which we called “Solar pMFC.”:::2015
