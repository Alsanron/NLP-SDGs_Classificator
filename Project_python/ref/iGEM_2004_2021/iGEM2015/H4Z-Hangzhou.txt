H4Z-Hangzhou:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Cell-fate decision making:::Microtubule associated protein light chain 3(LC3) is a ubiquitin-like protein that binds to autophagosomes (AVs). We engineered this marker as a Bio-Brick Part which can be used in tracking and following the fate of AVs in the cell and to measure autophagic flux. We constructed the plasmid in E.coli.:::2015
