Macquarie_Australia:::Asia:::Australia:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: Solar Synthesisers: Engineering the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway and photosystem II in E. coli:::Photosynthesis is a key biological pathway utilized by plants and algae to generate useable energy from sunlight. Chlorophyll is a green pigment in photosynthetic organisms that aids in the manufacture of energy. Our aim is to engineer and express 13 genes of the chlorophyll-a biosynthetic pathway from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in E. coli. While this pathway has been well characterised, reproduction of this process in non-photosynthetic organisms has not been successful. Our second goal is to synthetically engineer Photosystem II in E. coli, which consists of 17 genes. Photosystem II is a multi-subunit protein complex that generates oxygen and electrons, by oxidation of water molecules. Transferring these electrons to a hydrogenase would potentially lead to production of hydrogen on an industrial scale. Our goals are the first step towards clean and sustainable hydrogen production as a viable future energy source.:::2015
