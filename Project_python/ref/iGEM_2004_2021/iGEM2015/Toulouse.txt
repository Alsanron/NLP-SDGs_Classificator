Toulouse:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Beware Varroa: ApiColi is guarding the beehive:::The parasitic mite Varroa destructor, through the detrimental effects it exerts, is one of the main causes explaining the dramatic decline of bee colonies worldwide. Our project aims at limiting its proliferation in hives, thus we designed a trap adaptable to the hive entrance. In this device, our Escherichia coli strain named ApiColi will be used as bait. During the day ApiColi will express butyrate as an attracting molecule to lure Varroa destructor in the trap. By night butyrate expression will be replaced by formate production, a deadly molecule for the mite. This circadian rhythm is based on a chimeric red light receptor, which enables our trap to be in line with the honeybeeâ€™s life cycle and optimizes the lifespan of the device. Completion of this project will provide a solution to tackle the Varroa destructor in a way that is both respectful of the environment and the bees.:::2015
