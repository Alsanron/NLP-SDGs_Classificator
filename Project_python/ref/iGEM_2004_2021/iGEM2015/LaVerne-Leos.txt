LaVerne-Leos:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Using Zeaxanthin and Tocopherol to protect cyanobacteria from the toxic effects of free fatty acids:::Free fatty acids are biofuel precursors. We focused on using zeaxanthin to counter the toxic effects of increased free fatty acids in an altered Synechococcus elongatus 7942 strain. Zeaxanthin acts as an antioxidant, stabilizes the membrane, and is needed for electron transport chain function. To increase the concentration of zeaxanthin and its precursors, we introduced a circuit containing parts of the zeaxanthin synthesis pathway. The La Ca√±ada subset of our team focused on tocopherol, a metabolite that has similar properties to zeaxanthin in cyanobacteria. Tocopherol acts as an antioxidant, protects the cell from lipid peroxidation, and enhances photosynthesis. A circuit was made with the gene p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase to catalyze the formation of homogenistic acid, the rate limiting step of tocopherol synthesis. In an attempt to further increase the production of fatty acids, both zeaxanthin and tocopherol circuits are dynamically regulated, utilizing a fatty acid-sensitive promoter-repressor system, pLR and FadR.:::2015
