EPF_Lausanne:::Europe:::Switzerland:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: Bio LOGIC: Biologic Orthogonal gRNA-Implemented Circuit:::Engineering transcriptional logic gates to program cellular behavior remains an important challenge for synthetic biology. Currently, genetic circuits reproducing digital logic are limited in scalability and robustness by output discrepancies and crosstalk between transcriptional pathways. We propose to address these issues using RNA-guided dCas9 fused to a transcription activation domain as a programmable transcription factor. Fusion dCas9 targeted upstream of the transcription starting site (TSS) recruits RNA polymerase. Yet, dCas9 may also sterically hinder transcription initiation if bound too close to the TSS. The guide RNA acts as a “biological wire”: it determines dCas9’s binding site and enables specific regulation of homogenous synthetic promoters. Exploiting these properties we aim to build biocompatible transistor-like elements whose assembly may allow for the creation of chainable and parallelizable bio-logic gates. Ultimately, we hope to create a toolkit facilitating the design and implementation of bio-logic circuits thereby enabling more complex decision-making in cells.:::2015
