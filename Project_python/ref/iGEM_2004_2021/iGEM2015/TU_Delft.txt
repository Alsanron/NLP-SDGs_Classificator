TU_Delft:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Hardware:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::3D micro(be) printing with do-it-yourself K’NEX printer:::Various microorganisms can aggregate and attach to surfaces, thereby forming biofilms. Certain biofilms pose problems in fields such as healthcare and industrial processes. Currently, several methods are used for testing biofilm formation and removal. However, these processes can be improved by adding reproducibility and standardization. Therefore, our goal is to print biofilms in a reproducible and automated way. We achieved this by engineering E. coli cells that link to each other through nanowires upon induction and we printed these cells by means of our “do-it-yourself” K´NEX printer. Next to biofilm-removal testing, this technique can be used for industrial production processes. For example, as structured printing of microorganisms that catalyze different production steps or enzyme immobilization on the nanowires. To summarize, we aim to develop a new standard for biofilm production, develop our own printer and analyse the market potential of our system.:::2015
