Technion_Israel:::Europe:::Israel:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Be Bold: Hit baldness at its root:::Hair loss affects roughly 1.5 billion people worldwide. The trigger for male pattern baldness is believed to be dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a derivative of testosterone. We have created a system in which two different engineered bacterium are combined in a custom-made comb manufactured in a 3D printer, working together to break down DHT, treating the problem at its root. We engineered Bacillus Subtilis, to secrete 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3-α-HSD), an enzyme which reduces DHT to a non-steroidically active compound, using NADPH and NADH as cofactors. In addition, we genetically engineered Escherichia Coli to overproduce NADPH, enabling the enzymatic reaction to take place and driving it in the right direction. The two strains can be combined easily and cleanly with the help of our comb, providing a user-friendly tool and a novel, promising direction for future hair loss treatments.:::2015
