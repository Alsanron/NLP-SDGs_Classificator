SZMS_15_Shenzhen:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Real live models of different stories from various cultures:::Our project serves as real live models of different stories from various cultures. Our genetically engineered E. coli bacteria is able to perform a series of reactions visibly and distinctively in order to represent the plot in different stories. We have chose three particular stories to be the basis of our project: “The Ugly Duckling”, “The Fox and the Grapes”, and “Houyi Shoots the Sun”. All of these stories are well known by people. Our ultimate purpose of our project is to further publicise the idea of bioengineering as well as serve as an educational model for the young to observe and experience.:::2015
