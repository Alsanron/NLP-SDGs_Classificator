uOttawa:::North America:::Canada:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Simulating stem cells for tomorrow’s treatments:::Cell differentiation is the focus of much exciting research, but the current hypothesis on how cells specialize depends on epigenetic modification – the activation and suppression of a large part of the genome at once. However, this approach does not explain many complex and finely-tuned phenomena in the cell. We believe that a special genetic network, known as a “tri-stable switch,” can model cell differentiation. This network would allow a cell to “specialize” from a quasi-pluripotent state to one of two differentiated states. By repurposing native transcription factors, we can build such a switch in the organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or baker’s yeast. If this network can indeed achieve tri-stability, it may give us insight on the mechanisms of differentiation in stem cells, and bring us a step closer to construction synthetic stem cells in the lab.:::2015
