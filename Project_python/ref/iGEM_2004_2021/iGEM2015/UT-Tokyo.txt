UT-Tokyo:::Asia:::Japan:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Pattern Formation Game:::How do Zebrafish get their stripes? Why do we have only 5 digits on each hand? Here's one possible answer: Turing Pattern. Turing Pattern is a type of spatial pattern suggested by the British mathematician Alan Turing. He proposed that these patterns could be created by the network of two chemicals which have different diffusion rates. This mechanism has been investigated for a long time. However, it was not easy to analyze patterns found on living systems because of its complexity and technical difficulty. We therefore reconstructed a Turing system using two advantages of synthetic biology; controllability and biological directness. By letting whole E. coli cells, whose motility were controlled, communicate with each other, we designed a system that works more ideally than any previous researches. This project should surely be a great step for understanding more about morphology and some other related fields of science.:::2015
