TecCEM_HS:::Latin America:::Mexico:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::SDSeeker: Bioremediation of Lago de Guadalupe:::Lago de Guadalupe is the most extensive water body in State of Mexico. It is surrounded by industrial, agricultural and residential areas, the last one being responsible for 25% of the total contaminants. Among these is SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), which is the principal component of detergents used in mexican households. The residues of detergents change the water's pH, turning it into a toxic and dangerous environment for more than 150 species that depend on this lake. Although there have been some studies for its treatment, nothing has been achieved. Our project consists in developing a bioremediation system to lower SDS levels in the water using two immobilized proteins, alkyl-sufatase and ferritin.:::2015
