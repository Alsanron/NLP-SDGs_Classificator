Santa_Clara:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Achieving greater microbial aciduricity through the Escherichia coli cyclopropane fatty acid system.:::Cyclopropane fatty acid (CFA) synthesis is triggered as a response to acid stress in Escherichia coli in order to chemical modify its lipid bilayer and decrease its permeability to surrounding acids. The addition of the cyclopropane ring to fatty acid chains creates a sterically hindered path for acidic compounds attempting to cross the plasma membrane, thereby reducing the passive entrance of unwanted acids. We are aiming to standardize this acid defense system so that it may be implemented in other microorganisms to increase their survival under low pH conditions. By utilizing acid-resistant microbes, it is possible to decrease the running costs of bioreactors that are hindered by acid buildup from metabolic processes. Moreover, given that microbes often transition to stationary phase during acid stress, this CFA system may enable higher cell densities and biosynthetic yields in cell cultures because genetically modified microorganisms may more readily tolerate acidic conditions during growth.:::2015
