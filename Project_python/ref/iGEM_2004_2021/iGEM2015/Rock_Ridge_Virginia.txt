The ability of Lyme to adapt to its different hosts’ environments has made this disease difficult to treat and detect. Our project, uses this ability to specifically target Lyme when it is found in Ticks. Our construct expresses three proteins: OspA, which binds to the tick's TROSPA in the gut and prevents Lyme infection, Wolbachia Surface Protein, which allows for vertical transmission of the Live Vaccine bacteria and it also tempers the insect’s immune system, and GFP, which is used as an indicator protein. The construct is transfected in DH5Alpha E. Coli and it is tested in Drosophila (to check for vertical transmission) before being inserted into ticks. Since Lyme disease is not the only vector-born disease originated in insects, this Live Vaccine can be used for other diseases such as West Nile Virus, Dengue, Malaria, Yellow Fever etc.:::2015
