Liceo_Eugenio_Hostos:::Latin America:::Chile:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Silisform alert silica!!:::One of the biggest economic activities in the world is mining, which uphold many countries since mineral exportation generates huge profits that are useful for their economy development. This sounds great and from the mining point of view is perfect making everyone happy, but here is the problem that has not been boarded. Who does this job? The main job is done by miners who crush, dig, and process the minerals for their commercialization. This job exposes them to plenty of dangers like the inhalation of crystalize silica particle expelled in the mine causing a sickness called silicosis, which consists in an inflammation and cicatrization of the lung tissue preventing the proper oxygenation from the air we breathe causing physical disability and eventually death. The implementation of protection of protection by the miners in their working hours is rarely used and they do not care about the risks. to address this problem, we as LICEO_EUGENIO_HOSTOS iGEM created a genetically modified bacterium that upon contact with silica particles produces red luminescence, in order to alert workers of the presence of silica dust in the environment and raise awareness about the risks to which workers are exposed in the mining.:::2015
