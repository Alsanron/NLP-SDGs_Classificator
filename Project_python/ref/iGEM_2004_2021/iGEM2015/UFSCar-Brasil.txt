UFSCar-Brasil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bug shoo:::As different insects with varying habits generate different diseases, repellent becomes an effective solution to combat this insects.The high toxicity related to high concentrations of the current topical insect repellent in the market (DEET) and the relationship between concentration and longevity generate the need for more efficient and durable products.The D-limonene, compound also proven safe for use on human skin. To extend the duration of the limonene, the use of synthetic biology for continuous production was proposed by this project. However, the limonene production in predecessors attempts using bacterial were not efficient, probably due to the fact that the enzyme responsible for the production of geranyl phosphate in limonene was insoluble, the limonene synthase. The gene circuit comprises a promoter activated by osmotic shock inducing production of the enzyme limonene synthase. An osmotic shock is a simple way of inducing the production of chaperones and foldases, creating our repelent.:::2015
