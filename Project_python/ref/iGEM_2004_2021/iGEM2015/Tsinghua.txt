Tsinghua:::Asia:::China:::Hardware:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Developing light-controlled systems to manipulate genetic information in prokaryotes:::We the team Tsinghua 2015 have originated and developed light-controlled systems to manipulate genetic information in prokaryotes by combining the site-specific recombination system with light switchers integrated from red, blue and green light systems. Through the On/Off commands from light switchers, genetic manipulation can be achieved when diverse combinations of light signal are provided. Specifically, three light-mediated platforms are established: bio-imaging platform, genetic editing platform and information storage platform. For the first part, the expression of fluorescent protein can be precisely controlled by the incoming light, forming pre-determined image pattern with drastically high resolutions. For the second part, dCas9 and DNA-binding-domain-deleted recombinase are linked together to smoothly alter genetic information without introducing double strand breaks. For the third part, artificial information can be stored and retrieved easily via light-mediated systems. We designed CRISPR-recombinase screening systems, measured fluorescent protein expression parameters and developed a light-emitting electronic device to support our project.:::2015
