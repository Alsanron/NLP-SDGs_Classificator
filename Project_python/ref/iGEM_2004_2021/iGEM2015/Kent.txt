Kent:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Envirowire: Conducting nanowire self-assembled using cytochrome-linked functional amyloid.:::Our project aims to produce self-assembling conductive nano-wires using a functional amyloid system synthesised by E.coli. We use the export machinery of the endogenous curli amyloid system of E.coli, normally responsible for biofilm formation, to produce functional extracellular amyloid nano-fibrils composed of the amyloid-forming domain of the yeast prion protein Sup35. Our engineered BioBrick plasmid will contain the amyloid-forming domain of Sup35, Sup35NM, linked to the curli signal sequence for extracellular amyloid protein export, and also to cytochrome b562 to allow for electron transport. Once exported, the Sup35NM monomers will polymerise to form the amyloid fibrils decorated with cytochrome b562. Exogenous addition of haem will allow cytochrome b562 on Sup35NM fibrils to fold into its active conformation, allowing electron transport along the length of the amyloid fibres. Our project has the potential to provide a source of both renewable nano-material and energy.:::2015
