USTC-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioBLESS-Biological Boolean Logic Evaluation & Systematization based on Simulation:::Hoping to generate a more direct rational circuit design, we develop BioBLESS that can automatically computes the structure of a digital gene circuit. Instead of looking for a general solution to the computational design challenge, we focus on digital circuits. Given a truth table where the inputs and outputs of Boolean gates take only 0/1 values, we convert it into Boolean Formula and get possible circuit schemes. To get reliable circuits, we select well-behaved circuits with the introduction of fitness scores which sufficiently consider the practical realizablity. Performance simulation and robustness analysis constituting the core of our evaluation module will shed light on how our devised circuits behave and examine the correspondence with truth tables. Moreover, our software keeps the compatibility of various methods or algorithms and reserves the space for users to redesign.:::2015
