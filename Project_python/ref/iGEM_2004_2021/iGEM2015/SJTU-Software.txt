SJTU-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BASE: a multi-level biobrick evaluation and visualization system:::Many existing biobricks are not well documented, which make it challenging to use them. Here we present a web-based tool BASE (Biobrick Auxiliary Selection Explorer) to search, evaluate and visualize biobricks at part, devise and system levels. At part-level, similar to our work last year, biobrick parts are scored according to their current status, user comments and reviews, times of citation and etc. At device level, features, such as the order of parts and the co-existence frequency of two parts in a device, are added into the scoring system. At system-level, the regulation relationship between devices is added to the scoring system. At each level, the biobricks can be searched, evaluated and ranked according to their scores. A visualization function is also provided. In addition, the score can also be calculated according to a user-defined configuration, and an automatic adjusting system is also provided to incorporate users' selection preference.:::2015
