SCUT-China:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Myocardial Guard:::Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in many developed countries. Cyclic  guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a critical second messenger molecule involved in myocardial diseases such as  hypertrophy.This summer, we try to use synthetic biology to modify the cGMP metabolic pathway in a human cell line. We hope that our work would provide the proof of principle for future gene therapy. cGMP can transduce nitric oxide and natriuretic peptide coupled signaling and remit the myocardial hypertrophy by relaxing the blood vessels. We up-regulate the soluble guanylate cyclase(sGC), an enzyme that synthesize cGMP from GTP，by overexpressing the α and β subunits of sGC in a mammalian cell line. However, elevated level of cGMP leads to the feed-back expression of PDE5A, a cGMP-specific phosphodiesteras that degrades cGMP. Thus, we further modify the pathway by knocking down the PDE5A gene. To achieve controllable up-regulation of cGMP level in the cell, we also propose a hypoxia-inducible operon,HRE,as a switch to up regulate cGMP only in hypoxia situation.:::2015
