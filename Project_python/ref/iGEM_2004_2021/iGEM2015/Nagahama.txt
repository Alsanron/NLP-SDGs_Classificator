We considered a new food preservation method "Flavorator" to solve the food problem. "Flavorator" is a method of preserving food in an antimicrobial volatile substances (terpenoid :geraniol and farnesol) derived from plants .E. coli has a non-mevalonate pathway. therefore, The E. coli, there are metabolic pathway for synthesizing a precursor of farnesol and geraniol. E. coli can synthesize "geraniol" by introducing Ocimum basilicum geraniol synthase (ObGES). E. coli can synthesize "farunesol" by introducing the enzyme reaction rate-limiting step (ispDF, idi, dxs, ispA). A non-mevalonate pathway device is the enzyme reaction rate-limiting step operon. Gene involved in the enzyme reaction rate-limiting step to be introduced towards the E. coli. MarA is introduced towards E. coli in order to increase the antibacterial substance resistance. "Flavorator" is a way to solve food storage problem.:::2015
