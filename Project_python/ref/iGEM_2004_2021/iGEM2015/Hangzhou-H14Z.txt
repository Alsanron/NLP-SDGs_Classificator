Hangzhou-H14Z:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::The Preservation and Cleanse of Lithic Cultural Relics with Mineralisation Method in Hangzhou::: The Inscriptions on Precipice are one of the greatest traditional Chinese relics. Due to having been carved in open areas plus the exposure to sunshine and acid raindrops, the Inscriptions are weathered readily. Currently methods to solve this phenomenon are not used properly sometimes which occasionally cause the damage to the Inscriptions. We aim at using microorganism method, which is putting a plasmid that has the ability to convert bio-oriented Oxaloacetic Acid to Oxalate Acid into the E.coil, inducing the cell and reacting with one component of the Inscriptions--Calcium Carbonate--to generate nearly insoluble Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate to adhere to the Inscriptions for protection. Another E.coil with the ability to secrete lipase has also been constructed; adding this cell when we cleaning the Inscriptions will resolve the oil substance on the surface. By constructing these products, we are able to protect the relics both from human errors and from natural damnification.:::2015
