WLC-Milwaukee:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::tolsee:::Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem facing both patients and physicians worldwide. Phage therapy, the focus of WLC-Milwaukee, is a potential alternative to antibiotics. We sought bacteriophages specific to the gram negative protein tolC, an outer-membrane efflux pore protein. TolC is of interest due to its role in certain antibiotic resistances, as bacteria use it to pump antibiotics out. TolC homologs are found in a variety of gram negative bacteria, including those causing diarrheal diseases. We focused on expressing tolC found in pathogenic bacteria, such as Cholera and Salmonella, in E. coli. The transgenic strains of E. coli were used to search for bacteriophages specific human GI tract pathogens. Once bacteriophages are identified for this tolC receptor, we hope to combine this phage therapy with an antibiotic resisted via efflux. Bacteria which become resistant to the bacteriophage through gene downregulation or function-destroying mutation risk increased sensitivity to the antibiotic action.:::2015
