Edinburgh:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Class-A-fiED: Looks Safe On Paper:::In 2015 it was estimated that over 80 million adult European citizens had tried an illicit drug, with 20 million of these cases occurring in the UK alone. Of these drugs, opiates contribute to the most deaths due to acute poisonings, whilst a number of contaminants in so-called ‘party drugs’ have recently been implicated in a spate of fatalities in Scotland. It is the aim of The University of Edinburgh iGEM team to develop a multiplexed, enzyme-based biosensor to semi-quantitatively measure heroin levels, detect PMA in MDMA and DNP in diet pills. With this biosensor the team hopes to contribute to the efforts in harm reduction related to illicit drug use. We have engaged with both Drug Consumption Rooms and pill testing services with the goal to have them utilise our biosensor in their attempts to lessen morbidity and mortality.:::2015
