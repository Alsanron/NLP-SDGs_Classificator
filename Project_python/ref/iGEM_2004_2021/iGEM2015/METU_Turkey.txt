METU_Turkey:::Europe:::Turkey:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Gluten, You Shall Not Pass!:::People with celiac disease have to consume gluten free food because gluten creates an auto-immune response in their body. However, gluten free food is a lot more expensive than normal food. That is why, we decided to find a solution to this problem by taking kumamolisin and putting it in a vector of yeast that has alpha secretion factor then putting the plasmid in yeast. The yeast will produce and secrete kumamolisin enzyme to its external environment and will destroys gluten while the bread continues to be fermented. We also prepared a gluten detection kit using green fluroscent protein in PQLP aminoacid sequence. If kumamolisin cuts the gluten it will have cut GFP as well so there will be no colour but if it does not cut the gluten than it also has not cut GFP so green color will be observed.:::2015
