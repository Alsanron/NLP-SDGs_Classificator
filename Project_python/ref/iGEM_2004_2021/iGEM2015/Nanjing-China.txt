Nanjing-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Metallosniper—innovative total solution for heavy metals:::Global problems concerning heavy metals, including metal contamination and metal recovery, have become increasingly significant in the aquatic environment. Among numerous heavy metals, such as toxic metals, noble metals and radioactive metals which can be viewed as potential resources, we focus on lead, gold and uranium. Here by using Bacillus subtilis as a bioreactor, we are working to devise a way to absorb and retrieve heavy metals. A “Metallosniper” targeted at lead, gold and uranium has been successfully engineered. With the feature of producing endospores, we have made it possible for B. subtilis to absorb heavy metals under both benign conditions and adverse circumstances. In a gesture to further improve the efficiency of binding metals, biofilm, cell surface-display system and degradable materials for immobilization are applied in our project. We have also combined all these elements into a unique device for future industrial applications.:::2015
