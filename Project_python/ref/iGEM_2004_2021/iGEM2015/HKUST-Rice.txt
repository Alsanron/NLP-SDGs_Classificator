HKUST-Rice:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Potassium, Phosphate and Nitrate Biosensors:::To ensure healthy growth of crops, farmers must carefully control the levels of macronutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K)) in their soil. Currently, farmers monitor soil macronutrient levels with chemical assays. We hypothesize that PNK biosensors based on genetic circuits refined through millions of years of evolution will measure the nutrients available to a growing plant more accurately. We are building on the work of previous iGEM teams on soil biosensors and characterizing new parts. We have developed and tested new nitrate-, phosphate-, and potassium-responsive promoters to produce a colorimetric output in a low input environment and added these parts to the registry. We are working on deploying our NPK biosensor in a colorimetric cell-free system and in biofertilizer strains of bacteria. It is our hope that this NPK biosensor technology can be used to optimize the farming and fertilizing process.:::2015
