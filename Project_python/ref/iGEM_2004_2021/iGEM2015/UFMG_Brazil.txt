UFMG_Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::LeishMANIA:::UFMG_Brazil iGEM team project aims to create a new system of drug production and delivery based on an attenuated strain of the protozoan Leishmania donovani. This protozoan may be a good new chassis, because of its ability to infect macrophages efficiently and expresses proteins with proper post-translational modifications, delivering these proteins inside macrophages. INF-β is used to treat autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, as well as inflammatory joint diseases, such as gout and rheumatoid arthritis. However, INF-β is an expensive drug, making the treatment costly. Moreover, the current treatment is systemic and has several side effects. Therefore, our team aims to use the non-virulent strain of Leishmania donovani to constitutively produce and deliver INF-β directly at the inflammation site. Since Leishmania is cultivable in large scale, so it could become an actual pharmaceutical product. Thus, we would decrease the treatment’s cost and minimize significantly the side effects.:::2015
