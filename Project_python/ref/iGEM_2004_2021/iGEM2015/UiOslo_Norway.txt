UiOslo_Norway:::Europe:::Norway:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Methane Incorporated:::Methane is the third most prevalent greenhouse gas in the earth's atmosphere. In a time span of 20 years has it a global warming potential that is about 84 times that of carbon dioxide. Techniques for the reuse of emitted methane are cost and time-intensive and are therefore rarely used. Our goal is to limit the emission of methane by developing an Escherichia coli (E. coli) based model that filters methane out of the air and converts it into biomass. The first part involves breaking down methane to methanol with the enzyme complex, soluble methane monooxygenase from Methylococcus capsulatus. The second part is converting methanol into biomass by establishing the Ribulose-Monophosphate pathway from Bacillus methanolicus in E. coli. Lastly, a filter will be created that contains the modified E. coli and filters the surrounding air to facilitate methane uptake and breakdown; to be used in any closed air system!:::2015
