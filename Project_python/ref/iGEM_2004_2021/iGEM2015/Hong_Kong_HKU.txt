Hong_Kong_HKU:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Controllable cell death and DNA degradation by CRISPR cas system:::While the future of synthetic biology hinges upon overcoming biosafety concerns, the accidental escape of synthetic organisms due to unpredictable behaviours can pose a major threat to our environment. Hence, a tightly regulated switch is needed to induce suicide by the leaked organisms, ultimately leading to destruction of undesired genetic material. In our project we design and engineer two biological circuits based on the versatile CRISPR Cas systems as replaceable killing switches. To minimize basal expression, arabinose and tryptophan help repress the expression of Cas associated proteins, gRNA and crRNA. In order to achieve biosafety, destruction of essential genes will be activated when the synthetic organisms leave their specified working environment. We sought to investigate the regulation of the circuits and compare the killing efficiency of the two Cas systems using E. Coli BL21 DE3 as the chassis.:::2015
