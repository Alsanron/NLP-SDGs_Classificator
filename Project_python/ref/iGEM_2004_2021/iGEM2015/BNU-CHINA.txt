BNU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synthetic Intelligent Ranger E. coli for Nematodes (SIRENS):::Diverse kinds of chemical pesticides were used in last decades because pests are seriously detrimental to crops. However, these pesticides can pollute the environment and increase the pest resistance substantially. Such that, environment-friendly biological pest control methods are needed badly. Our project, which concerns mainly on the crucially pathogenic organism nematode first, intends to build a kind of novel engineering bacteria which contain a switch promoter that controlled by the light intensity. It means that our bacteria will express organics to allure pests at night, and synthesis specific toxin to kill the pests after they devour them during the day. Furthermore, the bacteria will initiate suicide to avoid the damage to environment. After a sophisticated nematode trap system is built, we will continue and expand our systems for other kinds of agricultural pests, aiming at building the bait and the toxin database of various pests.:::2015
