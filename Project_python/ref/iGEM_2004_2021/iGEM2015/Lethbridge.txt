Lethbridge:::North America:::Canada:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RNAiCARE:::Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a fungal disease that reduces grain yields and seed quality across the world. Fusariumâ€™s airborne spores land on spikelets of flowering crops, producing trichothecene mycotoxins that inhibit cell processes. Gastrointestinal problems and feed refusal in livestock also occur if ingested. However pesticides controlling diseases like FHB have numerous economic and environmental costs. Our project represents a species specific and widely applicable solution to global agriculture problems using the synthesis of highly pure dsRNA as a topical fungicide. It has been shown that insect midgut cells taking up double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the Dicer enzyme. If the siRNA is complementary to a certain gene, RNAi can silence its expression. This project will target and silence essential Fusarium genes. Our design involves a scaffold where any dsRNA sequence of interest may be inserted for gene targeting within a specific species.:::2015
