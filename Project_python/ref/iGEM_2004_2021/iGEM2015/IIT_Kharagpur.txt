IIT_Kharagpur:::Asia:::India:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Detection of Food Spoilage Using Quorum Sensing Systems in E. coli:::Problems like food spoilage are a major concern in our lives mainly because they have a direct impact on the health of a person. Food spoilage renders a product undesirable for consumption and is the outcome of the biochemical activity of a microbial community. It is known that bacteria often communicate with each other through quorum sensing, where the communication is through certain signal molecules (auto-inducers) that freely diffuse into the environment.The enzymatic activities that account for quality degradation of food products are regulated by quorum sensing activity. Our engineered organism can be used as a marker of freshness in different kinds of food (dairy and other packaged products) by detecting the presence of Acyl Homoserine Lactones using the Lux operon system in E. coli and rendering a visible colour change (through lycopene production), thus preventing the consumption of such food and aiding healthy living.:::2015
