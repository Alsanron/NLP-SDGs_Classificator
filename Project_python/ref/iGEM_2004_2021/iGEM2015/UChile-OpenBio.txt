A sustainable initiative is to produce biodegradable plastics; however its synthesis process (chemical and biological) is complex and expensive. The team UChile-OpenBio is designing two populations of Escherichia coli to produce a biodegradable plastic called PLA (Polylactic acid) from easy to assimilate renewable resources. The first population will convert glucose into lactate and will self-regulate its production by sensing the pH. The second population will polymerize lactate into PLA and will export it into the medium. In addition the team is planning to replace the glucose by Chilean brown macroalgae (kelp), a renewable resource to sustainably produce PLA. In this way, the team would help fighting against pollution, contributing to a better world!:::2015
