Oxford:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Release of biofilm-disrupting and antimicrobial proteins from E.coli via targeted secretion and host cell lysis:::The project aims to investigate how bacterial biofilm-disrupting and antimicrobial proteins can be exported from E. coli, to include an analysis of their respective functions against pathogenic bacteria. The proteins Dispersin B, Microcin S, DNase, and Artilysin will be expressed from commercial pBAD expression vectors with N-terminal fusion tags to target them for export via the DsbA (Sec), YebF (Porin), and flagellar export pathways in E. coli. Additionally, the holin gene will be expressed under the control of bacterial quorum sensing-responsive promoters in conjunction with the Artilysin to cause host cell lysis and release of these proteins from the cytoplasm on detection of a target cell density.:::2015
