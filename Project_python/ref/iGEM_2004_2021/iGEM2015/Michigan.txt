Michigan:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Aptapaper - Detecting Any Protein On Paper Test Strips:::In the past year, paper-based transcription and translation, reconstituted from freeze-drying, have been adapted in a variety of ways and shown to be effective after a year of storage at room temperature. However, currently, this technology is severely limited in its applications because protein detection requires a different strategy for each individual protein. Aptapaper uses the targeting specificity of aptamers to create a modular protein detection system that can easily be adapted to any protein. A DNA aptamer is bound to a DNA trigger and becomes unbound in response to its protein of specificity. This frees the DNA trigger to turn on an RNA toehold switch, resulting in a 40 fold change in reporter protein expression, with more results to come. This system, when freeze-dried on paper, is cheap and portable, making it well suited to tackle the unmet needs for disease detection in remote areas.:::2015
