UC_San_Diego:::North America:::United States:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Rapid construction of stoichiometrically controlled metabolic pathways to identify in vivo rate limiting steps:::Given the number of possible cellular conditions, existing approaches/mathematical models are limited in how they can predict and optimize metabolic pathways. The ability to stoichiometrically control enzyme levels allows for empirical testing of rate limiting steps. As a proof of principle, we tested our ability to identify rate limiting steps using the bacterial LUX system, a bioluminescent reaction, in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. We have expressed several permutations of the bacterial LUX metabolic pathway to empirically determine its rate limiting steps by measuring the resulting light production. The identification of rate-limiting steps then allows us to optimize the pathway. Furthermore, with these findings, an improved and experimentally validated mathematical model of the LUX pathway will be constructed. By strategically altering biosynthetic gene expression, we have gained a means to tailor the reporter/sensor to better suit our needs (i.e. make it brighter) and a generalizable method to rapidly optimize metabolic pathways.:::2015
