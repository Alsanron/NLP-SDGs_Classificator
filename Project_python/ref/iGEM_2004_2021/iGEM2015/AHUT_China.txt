However, in natural plants, APeGs' low production and great difference have led to great disparity of food quality, making it hard to be effectively used. In order to control and ensure the quality of products more effectively, we have used biotechnology to look into physiological metabolic pathways of APeGs, and influences on the products exerted by the regulation and control of different key enzymes. Thus plants whcih contain more stable APeGs can be gained to benifit human beings in a better way.:::2015
