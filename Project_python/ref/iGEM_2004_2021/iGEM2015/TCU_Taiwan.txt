TCU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AMP. coli:::When wound appears on the skin. Infection will set in and hinder the healing process. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have an extensive ability to disinfect and facilitate wound healing. We selected two types of AMPs: Epinecidin-1(Epinephelus coioides) and Signiferin (Crinia signifera) are constructed into a potential material of wound dressing. We use E.coli as host to express these peptides. We attach a signal peptide to facilitate secretion. After purifying, we will test the functions of these two AMPs for their abilities to disinfection and in vitro wound healing. We will carry out in vivo experiments in mice test if these two AMPs work in healing wound in animal.:::2015
