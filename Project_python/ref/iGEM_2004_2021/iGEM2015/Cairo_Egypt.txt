Conventional anticancer therapies are toxic to normal tissues & have incomplete tumor targeting. E.coli can selectively colonize solid tumors, providing a selective colonization in tumor tissue. Azurin blocks breast cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. lUX qurom sensing system will be integrated into E.coli K12 expressing Azurin. A standard curve with known concentrations of dead cells and their relative color intensities (Digitally; RGB values) will be settled up to detect dead cells different concentrations. The generated data will be saved as a library in a microprocessor. A device will be fabricated using a color sensor to detect cellâ€™s death rate. This will allow a selective expression of Azurin in the tightly packed colonies present within tumors, inducing apoptosis to tumor cells. Then creating a simple, Cheap & harmless device that measure the cell's death rate almost instantaneously.:::2015
