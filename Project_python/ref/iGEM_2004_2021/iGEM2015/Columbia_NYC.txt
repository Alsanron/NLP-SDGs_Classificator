Columbia_NYC:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering An Edible Probiotic Consortium To Improve Digestive Health:::Microbial consortia plays an essential role in nature - being involved in processes ranging from biogeochemical cycling to immune system development. The shared characteristic these consortia is the specialization of individual populations of microbes within the community. Given the specialization and regulatory controls available, a greater range of tasks and durability is made available. After all, cooperation and division of labor is the driving force behind emergent properties. Here, we present a method to engineer a synthetic consortia of probiotics, namely, Escherichia coli "Nissle" and Lactobacillus reuteri, to express PYY, Ghrelin, and GLP1 - gut hormones involved in regulating appetite and insulin production. Such an undertaking involves establishing a secretion system via signal peptides and an intra- and inter- species communication mechanism via AHL-based quorum sensing. It is to be noted that such a system is designed to be versatile with a gut consortia being one of many potential uses.:::2015
