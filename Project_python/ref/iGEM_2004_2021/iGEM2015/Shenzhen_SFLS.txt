Our system is designed to release a fused protein to deliver an effector protein to the targeted cells on which a certain surface antigen is “detected” in the way of binding the specific antibody connected to the fused protein. The specific binding and the short range activating allow our system to perform a high quality of delivering as we expected. We purposed to use FRET to verify if our idea could be put into practice and believed that we will achieve impressive results. The value of our project is at the same time demonstrated in its variety. With different effector protein linked to the fused protein, it provides us with infinite choices: to relieve pain, to massacre cancerous cells, to activate downstream reactions… venturing a promising thinking in medication.:::2015
