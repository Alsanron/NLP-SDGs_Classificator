London_Biohackspace:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Community Labs:::Community Lab:::Accepted:::DIY Brew Kit - Synbio Brewery:::Our project aims to develop brewing yeast strains that produce different flavours, scents, colours, nutrients and bioluminescent proteins. Biosynthetic pathways will be developed in lab strains of S. cerevisiae however we will be exploring the use of existing brewing strains as chassis suitable for Synthetic Biology. The Synbio Breweries DIY Brew Kit aims to become an accessible kit containing a variety of engineered yeasts for use in homebrewing. The kit will allow the user to experiment with combinations of different flavours and other properties, added by the engineered yeasts, in their brewed product. The DIY Brew Kit project is a community lab project and therefore involvement in its development is open to all. Further to the inclusive and accessible nature of the projectâ€™s development, the resulting product aims to provide a hands on introduction to synthetic biology to a broader audience through the world of homebrewing.:::2015
