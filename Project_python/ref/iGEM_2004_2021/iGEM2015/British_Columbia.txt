British_Columbia:::North America:::Canada:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Pro-bee-otics: Alleviating Pesticide Impacts on Honeybee Health:::Honeybee Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is a serious problem, given the ecological and economical importance of honeybees. Experts estimate that honeybees pollinate $14 billion worth of crops per year in United States. Though the mechanisms which CCD occur are many fold and remain uncertain, neonicotinoid pesticides have been implicated. Gilliamella apicola is a bacterium that natively resides in the bee midgut. Our project aims to engineer Gilliamella to metabolize imidacloprid, a common neonicotinoid, into harmless organic compounds using three cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP6CM1vQ, CYP6G1, and HUMCYPDB1. Though 6-CNA, the breakdown product of imidacloprid, displays significantly lower toxicity, it still induces sublethal effects. As such, we have also incorporated a pre-existing 6-CNA degradation pathway from Pseudomonas putida for complete breakdown of imidacloprid. We believe honeybees that harbour this engineered bacterium in probiotic form will become less susceptible to common field doses of imidacloprid; thus, significantly reducing the risk of CCD.:::2015
