RHIT:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MitochONdriOFF: Controlling Aerobic Respiration:::The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used industrially to produce valuable products via fermentation. Many of these products are produced under anaerobic conditions, when the electron transport chain in mitochondria lacks the terminal electron acceptor and oxidative phosphorylation ceases. The goal of our project is to control aerobic respiration by manipulating the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal protein S12. This protein, which is encoded by the nuclear MRPS12 gene, is essential for the function of mitochondrial ribosomes and the synthesis of key components of the electron transport chain. We propose that the production of secondary metabolites in yeast could be optimized by purposefully regulating aerobic respiration during industrial fermentations.:::2015
