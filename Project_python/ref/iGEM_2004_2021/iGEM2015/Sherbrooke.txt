This is true for a lot of technologies and industries. However, this is not really the case for synthetic biology lab. Almost every manipulations are man-made. These manipulations are often really long, repetitive and require precision and dexterity. That would be great tasks to assign to a robot since they can easily meet all the requirements. This is exactly what Biobot project is all about: design and build a robotic platform to automate biology lab protocols. Manipulations included in the protocols and supported by our platform are pipetting, magnetisation, temperature control, turbidity measurement, and centrifuging.:::2015
