We focus on creating a signal to alert citizens and they can protect themselves from danger of these rays. All this under the approach of synthetic biology, not using plastic silicone or other contaminants. In Chile in the last 5 years there have been 20-25 cases of skin cancer per 100 inhabitants. One of the main factors is Ultraviolet (UV) radiation which causes severe cell damage when a certain amount is exceeded. Our team proposes a system that alerts the intensity of UV radiation. The project is represented by a wristband that is composed by genetically modified bacteria that detects ultraviolet light and according to intensity/danger, a coloration is generated. This will enable people to protect themselves from UV rays when its intensity is detrimental to cells.:::2015
