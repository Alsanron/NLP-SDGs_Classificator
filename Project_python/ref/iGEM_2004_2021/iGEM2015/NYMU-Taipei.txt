NYMU-Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Fight the Blight:::Phytophthora infestans is the causal agent of late blight disease of several members from the Solanaceae family. Potato, the third most important food crop in the world and a source of major agricultural income in many countries, easily falls victim to P. infestans. Yet most existing approaches are ineffective and have certain drawbacks. This year, the NYMU-Taipei iGEM team creates a systematic disease control method that can prevent, detect, and cure potato late blight. Inspired by competitive inhibition in pharmacology, we designed a ligand with higher affinity to block the entrance of P. infestans effector proteins. To detect infection in the plant, we devised a soil-based microbial fuel cell (SMFC) detecting salicylic acid emission and producing oscillating current. We also characterized a new defensin to inhibit nutrient absorption and further growth of the oomycete. Our goal is to provide an easily-practiced standard procedure for anyone involved in the production line.:::2015
