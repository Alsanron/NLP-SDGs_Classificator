ANU-Canberra:::Asia:::Australia:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A PhotoGENEic Approach to Biosynthesis:::In the International Year of Light, induction of gene expression using light offers high spatiotemporal resolution and is low cost compared to traditional chemical induction. The Australian National University iGEM team explored the principles of optogenetics, an emerging field in which gene expression can be precisely controlled by light. We developed an application for the CRY2 and CIB1 light-inducible expression system to synthesise NAD in Escherichia coli. NAD is a commercially valuable metabolite, however in large quantities NAD is toxic to E. coli. Our light-inducible expression system enables the accumulation of the NAD precursor, Î±-iminosuccinic acid in darkness. Blue-light induction of an irreversible, blue-light activated switch with a split, modular CRY2/CIB1-Cre-recombinase construct enables production of a late-stage biosynthetic enzyme, allowing the rapid production of the toxic metabolite from the accumulated precursor. We have further developed a customisable blue-light source for the activation of our construct under different light conditions.:::2015
