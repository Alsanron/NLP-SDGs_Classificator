MIT:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Population Control in Synthetic Microbial Co-cultures for Consolidated Bioprocessing:::Relative to commonly used monocultures, microbial co-cultures can better handle consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) - the conversion of substrates to products in a single reactor - by dividing the metabolic load among multiple species. However, problems regarding stability and efficiency must be overcome to implement co-cultures for CBP on an industrial scale. We aim to produce a robust co-culture by ensuring stable, efficient ratios of bacteria using synthetic intercellular communication. Our co-culture converts agricultural waste, lignocellulose, into a useful product, biodiesel. It consists of Cytophaga hutchinsonii, a cellulolytic bacterium, and Escherichia coli, which is engineered to produce biodiesel. We introduce the LuxI/LuxR/AHL quorum sensing system as the communication pathway between the bacteria. To predict bacterial interactions and design the communication network, we model the dynamics of our co-culture using whole-genome scale metabolic models with dynamic flux balance analysis. Our project makes co-cultures more viable for industrial consolidated bioprocessing.:::2015
