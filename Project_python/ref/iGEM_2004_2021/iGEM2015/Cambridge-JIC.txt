Cambridge-JIC:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Hardware:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::OpenScope - Open-source, 3D printable fluorescence microscope:::Fluorescence microscopy has revolutionised Synthetic Biology, bringing with it high costs. Cheap, adaptable, and compact; OpenScope is a novel alternative. It is a 3D-printable, low-cost digital microscope powered by Raspberry Pi© and Arduino©. The microscope supports bright-field and fluorescence modes with a resolution of four microns. OpenScope is suitable for teaching, use in developing countries and incorporation into laboratory systems. OpenScope is accompanied by a versatile, user-friendly software package. MicroMaps integrates the microscope on a remodeled, motorised translation stage. The software utilises a simple user interface similar to Google Maps©, designed by exploiting background image processing, annotation, and stitching; providing autonomous cell screening. The project was initially tested with Marchantia. Users will easily be able to create and customise programs for other organisms and screening criteria. OpenScope and MicroMaps are easily reproducible following the open source documentation.:::2015
