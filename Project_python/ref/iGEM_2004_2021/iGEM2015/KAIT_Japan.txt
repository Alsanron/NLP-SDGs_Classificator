KAIT_Japan:::Asia:::Japan:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Control protein activity by light:::Controlling protein activity by light is important for analyzing protein function and controlling synthetic biology system.However, previous methods require co factor or use toxic blue light. Fluorescent proteins such as a Green Fluorescent Protein are widely used as optical sensor. We forcused on Dronpa in them. Dronpa is a green fluorescent protein which is cloning from Echinophyllia sp.This is a photswitcable fluorescent protein, it can reversibly change On state and Off state. We used mutant of Dronpa, Dronpa145N. Dronpa 145N switches on under 400nm light and forms a tetramer, and switches off under 500nm light and forms monomer. Fuse target protein with Dronpa 145N. Dronpa 145N domain reversibly change monomer and tetramer by light, the target protein between Dronpa 145N domain can change active conformation and inactive conformation. In this way, we can control protein activity by light. This method does not require co factor and use blue toxic light.:::2015
