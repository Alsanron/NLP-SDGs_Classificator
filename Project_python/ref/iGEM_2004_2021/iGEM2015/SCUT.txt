SCUT:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Super Cadmium Ion Killer: Engineering E.coli to adsorb cadmium ion during the sewage treatment process:::Cadmium ion pollution has seriously affected people's health, agriculture and graziery from all aspects. This year our team attemps to design a novel and effective device in order to remediate global cadmium ion pollution. To solve this problem, we combine the curli nanofibers CsgA protein on the surface of E.coli with synthetic phytochelatins (ECs), which are analogs of phytochelatins (PCs). ECs are able to chelate with cadmium ion. Our engineered bacteria can also identify different concentrations of cadmium ion turning blue for low concentration and red for high concentration.:::2015
