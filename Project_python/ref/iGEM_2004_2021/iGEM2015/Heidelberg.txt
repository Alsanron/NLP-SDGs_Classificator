Heidelberg:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Catch it if you can:::Like Proteins, RNA folds into a unique, functionally relevant 3D structure â€“ as a catalytic ribozyme or an aptamer detecting and selectively binding a ligand. To obtain these functional RNAs, simple transcription of a DNA sequence is sufficient. Yet finding the few functional sequences has so far been challenging and has impeded its widespread use in synthetic biology. As a part of our project, we develop a software that drastically reduces both required resources and effort of directed evolution, as it creates aptamers for virtually any molecule through computational simulation. With the goal to provide the iGEM community with the power of RNA, we develop a toolbox consisting of easy to use standards for in vitro RNA usage, practical readouts and means for mRNA editing. To reach the end user with our work, we create straightforward tests for the detection of numerous noxious substances.:::2015
