Concordia:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Scaffococcus: Foundational advance in bacterial extracellular enzyme display:::Through the introduction of optimized genes from Clostridium thermocellum, we engineered a strain of Lactococcus lactis to express an extracellular platform, which can bind and harbor a seemingly endless variety of enzymes. By using the protein products known as cohesins and dockerins, we were able to create an organized and customizable array of enzymes on the outer surface of the cell. The cohesins are single elements orderly arranged as part of the scaffold and act as highly-specific bays for the display of the proteins of interest. The dockerins act as adaptors for the enzymes to be displayed, and allow them to anchor themselves onto the cohesin elements. For each type of cohesin element, there exists a complementary dockerin that binds specifically to it, which makes the scaffold a very powerful tool in the biotechnology landscape.:::2015
