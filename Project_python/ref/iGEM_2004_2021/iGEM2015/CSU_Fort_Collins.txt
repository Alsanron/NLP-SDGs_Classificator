CSU_Fort_Collins:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Using frying oil to produce terpenoids in an engineered strain of Escherichia coli:::Terpenoids are produced by plants in low concentrations, which can limit commercial usage. Our Escherichia coli has been genetically engineered to produce terpenoids. The strain digests spent frying oil, a carbon source with high-energy molecules that can be broken down via beta oxidation. The rate limiting step of beta-oxidation is Acyl-CoA synthetase (FadD). Increased transcription of FadD will allow our strain to better utilize frying oil waste. Terpenoid production will then be achieved via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway which is endogenous to E. coli. By increasing flux through the MEP pathway we will increase product yields. Safety considerations have been incorporated into the project through design of cellular level biocontainment. A kill switch, KillerRed, has been improved from previous years. When KillerRed protein is produced the cell turns red. Upon interaction with green light, the cell produces reactive oxygen species which damage the cell, resulting in cell death.:::2015
