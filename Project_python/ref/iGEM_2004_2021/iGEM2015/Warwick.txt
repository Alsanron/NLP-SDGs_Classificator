Warwick:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Brixells: cellular building blocks:::We aim to provide precision control over spatial arrangement of cells by designing a tool that enables drawing and building with them. Zinc finger proteins are intracellular molecules which recognise and bind unique dsDNA sequences. We have engineered these proteins to be expressed on the surface of an E. coli cell, such that dsDNA can be used as mortar to cement cells together. Producing a library of zinc finger proteins, along with their cognate dsDNA sequences, allows for combining different types of cells. We will demonstrate this principle by assembling fluorescent cells onto a 2D surface and producing microscopic images, with the ultimate goal being to build complex 3D structures comprised of different cell types. This level of control over cellular localisation could potentially revolutionise multiple fields including research into cell-cell interactions in microbial communities, multicellularity, and the construction of 3D cell structures in tissue engineering.:::2015
