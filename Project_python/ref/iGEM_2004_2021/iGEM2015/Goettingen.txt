Goettingen:::Europe:::Germany:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::FLEXOSOME - Placing Enzymes Where They Should Be!::: Many industrial and biological processes require a range of different enzymes. Our aim is to provide a powerful tool to combine these enzymatic processes. The Flexosome is a multi-enzymatic complex, which ensures higher efficiency and yield from enzymatic reactions. Our construct takes multiple dockerins from a variety of bacteria and connects exchangeable enzymes to a scaffoldin base through automatic assembly. The combination of the catalytic forces of enzymes, derived from different sources, onto one common molecular base creates a synergistic effect. This drives a cascade in which the product of one reaction acts as the substrate for the consecutive one. In the future the Flexosome could, for instance, be used to combine enzymes in washing detergents or even link enzymatic cascades for the production of biofuels. It can therefore be applied from industrial over pharmaceutical to environmental setups.:::2015
