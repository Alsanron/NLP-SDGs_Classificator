UNC-Chapel_Hill:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Construction of a Tricolor Sensing System for Glucose:::This project introduces a novel glucose sensing system in which glucose-responsive promoters drive the expression of three reporter chromoproteins. We designed four novel glucose-sensitive promoters and tested their ability to drive expression of reporter chromoproteins at various glucose concentrations. In conjunction with existing glucose sensitive promoters from the Parts Registry, we used our novel promoters to design a biological device that expresses different combinations of the three different chromoproteins in response to glucose in Escherichia coli. As such, this device can detect a larger dynamic range of concentrations of selected molecules (e.g., glucose). Our project aims to provide a cheaper alternative for diabetics than current, more expensive, glucose-monitoring systems. While driven by this initial problem, continuing work has shown that our approach may have its greatest potential as a more general molecular sensing platform, capable of being easily customized for the sensing of a broad range of relevant compounds.:::2015
