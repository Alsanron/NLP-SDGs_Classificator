Groningen:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Blue Bio Energy:::IGEM Groningen 2015 wants to harvest the energy of salt water, also known as ‘Blue Energy’. Blue energy uses ion exchange membranes to separate the sodium and chloride ions found in sea water. The currently used ion exchange membranes are expensive and their efficiency degrades over time . We aim to overcome these disadvantages by replacing those membranes with a bacterial biofilm. The biofilm completely consists of our modified Bacillus Subtilis. One of the two types of currently used ion membranes, the cation exchange membrane, only allows passage of positively charged sodium ions. A characteristics of this membrane is its negative charge. In order to generate blue bio energy, we aimed to overexpress genes whose encoding extracellular proteins provide the biofilm with an negative charge and increased rigidity. In result, our biofilm resembling the cation exchange membrane should be able to generate blue energy.:::2015
