Tokyo_Tech:::Asia:::Japan:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Prisoner’s Dilemma:::We want to replay the Prisoner’s Dilemma, a well-known game analysed in game theory, by using E. coli. This game involves dilemma between cooperation and defection. Although each prisoner knows both player's cooperation mutually benefits each other, one will always defect when the individual is pursuing his or her own benefit. We will express this dilemma by using a genetic circuit centering in quorum sensing. We will also provide various strategies and aim to determine the best strategy in this game. By combining the idea with synthetic biology, we demonstrated this game among students. We also made our own pay-off matrix. In our project we will focus on the prisoners’ emotions as well. The metaphoric usage of cherry blossoms appears in countless Haikus and Tankas, and expresses the heart of the Japanese. Therefore, we will express the prisoners’ emotions using E. coli, which will mimic the characteristics of cherry blossoms.:::2015
