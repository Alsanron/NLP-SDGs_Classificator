Nevada:::North America:::United States:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::So Happy Together: A Cooperative Relationship between Cyanobacteria and E. Coli for production of biofuels:::"Traditional methods for obtaining biofuels have relied on the fermentation of agricultural crops. The problems are reduction in land available for food production, relatively low levels of CO2 biofixation, and large biomass requirements. Our project aims to overcome these problems by utilizing E. coli for the production of biodiesel (C-12 fatty acids) and bioethanol. There have been a number of examples of biofuel production in E. coli; however 30-40% of production cost is based on media costs. Our project will surmount these high production costs by engineering the cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC6803, to secrete large quantities of glucose that will feed our biofuel-producing E .coli. Cyanobacteria and E.coli will be co-cultivated to allow the mutual transfer of carbon to produce biofuels. This project provides an efficient means for producing biofuels without a carbon source. It will also create a novel cooperative system between bacterial species that may have further industrial implications.":::2011
