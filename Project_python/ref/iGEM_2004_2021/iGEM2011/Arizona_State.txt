Arizona_State:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CRISPR Assisted Genetic Engineering:::"Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) are a genomic feature of many prokaryotic and archeal species. CRISPR functions as an adaptive immune system, targeting exogenous sequences that match spacers integrated into the genome. Our project focuses on developing a set of tools for synthetic control over the CRISPR pathway. This includes a method for creating polymers of repeat-spacer-repeat units, the development of CRISPR biobricks (CAS genes, leader sequences) for several CRISPR subtypes (E. coli, B. halodurans, and L. innocua), testing these components on plasmids containing GFP, and a software tool to collect and display CRISPR information, as well as select spacers from a particular sequence. Given the relatively recent progress in the scientific understanding of this system, we see the potential for a wide range of biotechnological applications of CRISPR in the future.":::2011
