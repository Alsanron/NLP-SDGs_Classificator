DTU-Denmark-2:::Europe:::Denmark:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Plug'n'Play with DNA: a novel assembly system:::The DTU-Denmark 2 team is designing a novel standardized assembly system, called 'Plugâ€™nâ€™Play with DNA', where any biological parts can be gathered without use of restriction enzymes and ligases. Our goal is to create a new assembly standard of biological parts in the form of pre-produced PCR-products, which can be directly mixed with a vector. This will make synthetic biology faster and assembly of an expression vector possible within a few hours. We have created a library of standardized biological parts for mammalian cells and fungi ready to plug'n'play. The simple and easy use of this new assembly system have been demonstrated by developing a reporter targeting system a mammalian cell line as well as for fungi. This novel assembly system represents an improvement of the conventional BioBrick assembly, which have its limits when creating synthetic biology with eukaryotic parts.:::2011
