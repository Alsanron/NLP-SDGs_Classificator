uOttawa:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A platform for robust quantification of transcriptional regulators and promoters and a new assembly protocol:::"Currently, there are few tools for quantitatively characterizing BioBricks in the model organism S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, current standard BioBrick assembly protocols continue to be laborious, and have the tendency to deliver inconsistent results. To address this issue, team uOttawa has engineered two strains of S. cerevisiae that allow for the rapid integration of both transcriptional regulators and their trans-regulated promoters. Transcriptional factors (TF) and promoters transformed into these strains yield fluorescently tagged TFs or fluorescently reported promoters respectively. This dual-colour system enables the quantification of the relationship between TF expression and promoter responsiveness. To expand the registry with well-characterized parts, all of these tagged transcriptional regulators and promoters will be submitted. Finally, we also describe a fast, efficient and cost-effective assembly protocol developed by our lab that was used to assemble all constructs built by our team.":::2011
