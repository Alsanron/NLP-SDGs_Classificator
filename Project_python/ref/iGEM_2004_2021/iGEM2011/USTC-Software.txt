USTC-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Lachesis:::USTC 2011 dry team as a one has worked diligently on designing and implementing a user friendly and interacting-prone software which will get nearer to biology reality and free synthetic biologist from considering unnecessary minutia as well as help both layman and expert draw deep understanding of the mechanism on how the gene circuit run. We offer a visualizing tool which give insight into the dynamics of a biology network. User dominated parameter adjustment process is also provided to assist in getting the required behavior. In order to assess the network's immunology to parameter perturbation, a PCA analysis approach is exploited to depict the structure of a 'good' behaved region.:::2011
