XMU-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::i-ccdB: Intelligent Control of Cell Density in Bacteria:::We have developed a series of devices which program a bacteria population to maintain at different cell densities. A genetic circuit has been designed and characterized to establish a bacterial 'population-control' device in E. coli based on the well-known quorum-sensing system from Vibrio fischeri, which autonomously regulates the density of an E. coli population. The cell density is influenced by the expression levels of a killer gene (ccdB) in our device. We have successfully controlled the expression levels of ccdB by site-directed mutagenesis of a luxR promoter (lux pR) and error-prone PCR of gene luxR, and we are building a database for a series of mutation sites corresponding to different cell densities and fluorescent intensities. An artificial neural network will be built to model and predict the cell density of an E. coli population. This work can serve as a foundation for future advances involving fermentation industry and information processing.:::2011
