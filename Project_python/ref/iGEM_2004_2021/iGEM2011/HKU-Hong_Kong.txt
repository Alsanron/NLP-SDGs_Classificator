HKU-Hong_Kong:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of a Novel Inducible Transcriptional Repressor mediates the formation of heterochromatin-like complex in E.coli:::"In eukaryotes, heterochromatin plays an important role in gene regulation. Here we use a synthetic biology approach to imitate heterochromatin in E.coli to achieve gene silencing. Specifically, fusion proteins comprising tetR and different parts of HNS (histone-like nucleoid structuring protein) were synthesized, they are expected to bind DNA specifically and carry out polymerization among the fusion HNS and the native HNS to create a densely packed DNA form, which may block the transcription. We produced constructs with tetO sites upstream or downstream of lac promoter and EGFP gene. Then we used standard constitutive promoters with different activity to drive our fusion proteins to find the optimum expression level. Moreover, tetR, HNS and fusion proteins were purified and gel shift assay was utilized to detect the interaction between those proteins with DNA. This study presents a novel approach to introduce a mimic heterochromatin-like structure into prokaryotes to achieve inducible gene silencing.":::2011
