METU-Ankara:::Europe:::Turkey:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MethanE.COLIc : Decreasing the Greenhouse effect and Saving the workers' life in one system:::"Firedamp explosions are frequently seen cases at all mines over the world. In Turkey, every year, around 50 miners lose their lives because of firedamp explosions. Firedamp is a flammable gas found in coal mines and it mainly contains methane. Beside its explosive property, methane is also the main contributor to global warming. However, recent mechanisms in mines release the methane that is collected into air. By offers of Synthetic biology, we aimed to design a device which will work on E.coli that provides solutions for side effects of methane. Device that we are planning to construct involves the genes of bacteria (Methylococcus capsulatus) and insect (Drosophilia melanogaster) Our compact system in E.coli is fabricated as sensation of methane, the conversion of methane to methanol and then entrapment of methanol to handle for biofuel and death of bacteria at 42 C by kill switch mechanism.":::2011
