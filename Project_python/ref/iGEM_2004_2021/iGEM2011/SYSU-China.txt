SYSU-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Nuclear-Leakage Rescuer:::"As the nuclear-leakage issue in Japan has caught world-wide attention this year, we consider that engineered E. coli nuclear cleaner will be effective to this issue. Our project consists of two parts. On one hand, the radiation-sensitive promoter PrecA and gene CheZ will build chemotaxis to Ionising radiation and lead engineered E.coli to move toward seriously affected places. On the other hand, when moved in a proper radiation level, the less radiation-sensitive promoter PrecN and gene trkD will activate a kind of ion channel which can absorb the Cs+ ions. Our nuclear cleaner will become capable in dealing with the nuclear-leakage issue. We also tried to get the idea of synthetic biology known by designing an iPhone app and a card game, carrying a survey and holding forums.":::2011
