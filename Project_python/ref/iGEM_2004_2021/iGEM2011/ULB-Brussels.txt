ULB-Brussels:::Europe:::Belgium:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Pindel: One step insertion / deletion system:::One of the most common actions of all engineers is the assembly or deletion of parts. Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of iGEM is to link biology and engineering sciences, we'd like to implement an easy way to manage those simple steps in biological systems. Unfortunately, in E. coli, it's still difficult to assemble or delete in one step, because there is a lack of genetic tools to execute homologous recombination with linear DNA. By the assembly of a unique plasmid containing different phages' genes, and the design and construction of helper plasmids, we aim to provide the iGEM community with a system that would confer to E. coli the useful properties of controlled homologous recombination. We called this plasmid for insertion and deletion of genes : Pindel.:::2011
