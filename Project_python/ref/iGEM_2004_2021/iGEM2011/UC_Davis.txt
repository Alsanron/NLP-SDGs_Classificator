UC_Davis:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Generation and Characterization of Mutant Libraries for BioBrick Circuit Synthesis:::"The Registry of Standard Biological Parts offers inducible BioBrick promoters and their corresponding repressors in a limited range of strengths and activities. To broaden the application of this key part type, we have produced and characterized libraries for the LacI, TetR repressible and lambda c1 regulated promoters, as well as the LacI, TetR and cI repressors, some of the most commonly used repressor and promoter parts. These new libraries can be used to engineer genetic circuits requiring inducible parts with varying activity levels and chemical sensitivities. To demonstrate their utility, we used our new parts to construct diverse circuits that capitalize on differences in their activity levels.":::2011
