Rutgers:::North America:::United States:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Complex Circuits in Synthetic Biology:::"The Rutgers iGEM Team designed two complex genetic circuits, Etch-a-Sketch and Full Adder, and created a software tool, MYS!S. The Etch-a-Sketch circuit enables a lawn of bacteria to be drawn on with a laser. This seemingly inconsequential task presents many engineering challenges: the bacteria need to be sensitive in order to respond to a laser pulse, yet selective to use in ambient lighting. The second circuit allows bacteria to emulate a digital full adder. The circuit makes use of individually non-functional split reporters that can reform functional reporters with the help of fused 'zipper' domains. In addition to the circuit, we have made easily fuse-able BioBricks of these domains in order to facilitate the engineering of more split proteins, which should assist in the creation of logic circuits. MYS!S aims to improve the parts registry by checking and giving directions to modify Biobricks to conform to assembly standards.":::2011
