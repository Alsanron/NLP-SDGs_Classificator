Lethbridge:::North America:::Canada:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::"Tailings pond clean up kit, a synthetic biology approach to bioremediation":::Mining extraction and refining processes produce toxic by-products that are often stored in tailings ponds. Tailings ponds are artificial reservoirs where the by-products such as toxic organic compounds, heavy metals or fine clay particles are stored until they are remediated by industrial treatment or natural degradation, which can require decades. We are developing the components necessary to create a tailings pond clean up kit for removal of harmful by-products. The first component uses the xylene degradation pathway of Pseudomonas putida optimized by the use of a protein microcompartment produced from the engineered Aquifex aeolicus protein lumazine synthase. The second component removes heavy metals by producing nanoparticles with the Magnetospirillum magneticum protein Mms6. The third component causes sedimentation of fine clay particles using natural properties of Eschericia coli and cell aggregation with Antigen 43. The final component removes the genetically modified organism's DNA by using restriction endonucleases.:::2011
