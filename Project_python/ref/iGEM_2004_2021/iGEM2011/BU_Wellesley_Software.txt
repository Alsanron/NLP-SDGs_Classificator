BU_Wellesley_Software:::North America:::United States:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::"Trumpet, Puppeteer, E-Notebook, Optimus Primer, and Gnome-Surfer: A Workflow for Collaborative Research, Design, and Assembly":::"We present tools which facilitate the research, design, and fabrication of biological constructs. Our workflow comprises Gnome Surfer for research, Trumpet and Optimus Primer for design, and Puppeteer and E-Notebook for the construction of those designs. Gnome surfer promotes collaborative research by allowing users to browse genes, Parts, and other DNA along with their associated literature on a table-top surface. Using Optimus Primer, primers can be designed for the selected Parts. Trumpet generates permutable constructs from these Parts by interleaving invertase sites among them. To assemble these permutable constructs, we present a Protocol Automation Stack comprising a high-level programming language called Puppeteer, executable on a robot. For improving manual protocol execution, we are developing an Electronic Lab Notebook that helps capture data, and schedule resources and lab activities. Our unique tools offer an end-to-end workflow that is collaborative, includes wetlab automation and organization, and provides algorithms for designing configurable constructs.":::2011
