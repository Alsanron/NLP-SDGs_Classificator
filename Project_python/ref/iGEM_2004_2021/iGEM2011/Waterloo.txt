Waterloo:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::In vivo Fusion Protein Assembly Using Self Excising Ribozyme.:::"Introns, self-excising ribozymes, can become a useful tool to create in vivo protein fusions of BioBrick parts. To make this possible, intron sequences are used to flank non-protein parts embedded in coding sequences. An intron sequence with an embedded recombination site is capable of in vivo insertion of a compatible protein fusion part. As an example, a GFP-fusion was created with an intervening lox site that is removed from the final protein using the intron to form a fully functional GFP protein. In vivo protein fusions can be applied to a larger number of modular systems to make complicated expression systems, such as synthetic antibodies or plants capable of Cry-toxin domain shuffling.":::2011
