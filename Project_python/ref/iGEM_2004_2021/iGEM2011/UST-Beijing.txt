UST-Beijing:::Asia:::China:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Gene H-transfer: bile acid receptor in E.coli & proteorhodpsin in mitochindrial inner membrane:::"In order to celebrate the power of gene H(orizontal)-transfer between pro- and eukaryotes, we constructed two fusion proteins and tested their function: (1). a synthetic bile acid receptor in E.coli using a mammalian nuclear receptor LXR. As proof-of-principle, the regulatory circuit in symbiotic bacteria could be harmoniously linked to metabolic pathway of their host. Potential application includes in situ synthesis of pharmaceuticals on-demand in the digestive tract. (2) a synthetic light-driven proton pump in human mitocondrial inner membrane using a bacterial proteorhodopsin. Preliminary testing demonstrated cellular sensitivity to light radiation. Application and utility relies on result of in-depth characterization of such system design.":::2011
