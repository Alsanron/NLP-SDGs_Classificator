Korea_U_Seoul:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synthesis of Synthetic Micro-Alkanes ('Synfuels') in Engineered Escherichia coli:::Our team concentrated on finding the solution to the world's diminishing natural oil and gas resources and greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of our project is the production of biofuels, alkanes, using bacterial cells as factories. Alkanes, so called 'Green' hydrocarbon fuels, are chemically energetically the same as petroleum-based fuels, thus no penalty for use of conventional engines is encountered from their use. For alkane biosynthesis, we designed a synthetic circuit using bacterial bioluminescence system and aldehyde decarbonylase from Vibrio harveyi and cyanobacteria, respectively. Free fatty acids in the cells firstly are reduced and converted to fatty aldehydes by LuxC, LuxD and LuxE and then fatty aldehydes finally are decarbonylated and turned into alkanes.:::2011
