UNICAMP-EMSE_Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::STRESS WARS:::"Stress and autoimmune diseases cause imbalances in immune system, observed in the biased naive T-CD4+ Lymphocytes differentiation towards T-lymphocyte-'helper'-1 in autoimmune diseases, or Th2 in stressful condition, favoring cellular or humoral adaptive responses. This can lead to bacterial evasion of host defense systems and susceptibility to some pathogens. Since nowadays we are exposed to continuously stress, perhaps we can avoid the negative effects caused by this condition. Thus, a mechanism that counteracts this imbalance is highly desirable. The ability of some bacteria to sense stress hormones such as Catecholamines will be used to produce Interleukin-12 and inducing Th1 lineage. On the other hand, the ability to sense Nitric-Oxide released in inflammatory conditions will be used to trigger Interleukin-10 production, counteracting excessive immunity. A switch control system will sustain the balance. The 'Jedi Bacteria' containing these devices would be a useful probiotic to fight against the battle imposed by stress.":::2011
