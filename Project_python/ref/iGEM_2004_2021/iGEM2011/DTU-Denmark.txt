DTU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Tuning regulation with a non-coding RNA trap:::"Small regulatory RNA is an active area of research with untapped possibilities for application in biotechnology. One such application could be the optimization and fine-tuning of synthetic biological circuits, which is currently a cumbersome process of trial and error. We have investigated a novel type of RNA regulation, where the inhibition caused by a small regulatory RNA is relieved by another RNA called trap-RNA. The system displays a large dynamic range and can uniquely target and repress any gene of interest providing unprecedented flexibility. We suspect that any level of repression is achievable by simply altering the sequences of the involved RNAs. Multiple such systems can coexist without interfering and are thus compatible with more complex designs. Furthermore the trap-RNA can be fused to any transcript in effect allowing any gene to act as an activator.":::2011
