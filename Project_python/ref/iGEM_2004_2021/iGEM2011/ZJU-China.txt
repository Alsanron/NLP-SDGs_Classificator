ZJU-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Rainbofilm:::Rainbofilm is a stratified expression system in biofilm, a self-organized module extensible for various needs. Researchers found a vertical oxygen gradient establishes in the biofilm. Such property allows us to use oxygen sensitive promoters to artificially induce differentiated functions through the spatial distribution of cells. Thus, the multi-step reaction can be processed within the different layers of the biofilm. The biofilm and its layered structure form spontaneously. Also biofilm has the natural resistance to high levels of toxin. These two properties render the Rainbofilm a convenient stable system for bio-production and bio-sensor. The system can cater to different needs simply by changing downstream genes. One possible application is ethanol production. The cellulose is degraded to monose from the bottom to the middle layer, and the ethanol is produced and secreted in the surface to minimize the toxicity to the inner cells.:::2011
