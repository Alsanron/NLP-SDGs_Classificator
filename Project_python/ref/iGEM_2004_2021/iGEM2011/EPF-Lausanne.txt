EPF-Lausanne:::Europe:::Switzerland:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Teenage Mutant Ninja TetRs: A Transcription Factor Development Pipeline:::"To create novel devices, and to fine-tune systems for a specific response to a stimulus, synthetic biology relies on a library of parts with specific functionalities and characteristics. Here, we present our efforts to expand the choice of regulatory parameters in a system by engineering TetR-based transcription factors with a large range of DNA-binding specificities and affinities. Specifically, we have generated several TetR and pTet promoter variants using site-directed mutagenesis, and characterized their respective interactions using fluorescent reporter assays and MITOMI-based microfluidic devices. In addition, we are developing a proof-of-concept high-throughput measurement system based on bacterial cell lysis to in vivo select desirable variant protein-DNA interactions . This system is based on a repression cascade, in which TetR binding to the pTet promoter element triggers cell lysis in an affinity-dependent manner, enabling us to collect the plasmids of suitable TetR variants for sequence analysis and downstream processing.":::2011
