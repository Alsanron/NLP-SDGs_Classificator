NTNU_Trondheim:::Europe:::Norway:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Fluorescent Stress Sensor:::"ppGpp (Guanosine pyrophosfate) is a global regulator of gene expression in bacteria. Production of ppGpp up-regulates central genes for starvation survival, and down-regulates genes involved in growth and proliferation, e.g. rRNA operons and the rrnB P1 promoter. ppGpp production is induced by amino acid starvation and other general stress and starvation factors, making this signal molecule suitable for monitoring stress in bacteria. The sensor consists of two parts. mCherry (a red fluorescent protein) controlled by the Lac promoter, and the Lac Inhibitor controlled by the rrnB P1 promoter. We observed a statistically significant reduction in fluorescence during growth compared to cultures with IPTG-inhibited LacI, demonstrating lacI production by rrnB P1. Results suggest that the rrnB P1 promoter produces less lacI when the cells are grown in minimal medium, possibly due to amino-acid starvation and ppGpp shutting it down. Computer modeling supports these results.":::2011
