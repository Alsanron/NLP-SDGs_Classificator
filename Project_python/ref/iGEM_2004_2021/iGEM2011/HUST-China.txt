HUST-China:::Asia:::China:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Super E.coli Architect:::"Super E.coli Architect is a design software of engineering bacteria. It offers a convenient and efficient design platform,which contributes to making simple ideas into a complete solutions. The existing synthetic biology softwares involve some specific functions such as finding genes and metabolism pathways, modeling and biobrick design.And these softwares are often oriented to scientific researchers. But we think that there is a hope in synthetic biology to turn the science of artificial biosystem into a engineering program having a standard process. Therefore, we constructed a software, Super E.coli Architect, oriented to designers more than scientists.Providing all the necessary technical support,Super E.coli Architect can release desighners from technical details,helping them work as the architects,allowing them to take more attention into constructing kinds engineering bacterias for solving practical problems.":::2011
