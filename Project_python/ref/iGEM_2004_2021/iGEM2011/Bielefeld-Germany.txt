Bielefeld-Germany:::Europe:::Germany:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Bisphenol A-Team: A Cell-free Approach for Biosensors:::The development of sensitive and selective biosensors is an important topic in synthetic biology. We want to provide nanobiotechnological building blocks as a basis for cell-free biosensors. Therefore we worked with S-layers (crystalline bacterial surface layers) which build up well-defined nanosurfaces and can be attached to the surface of beads. As an example we are developing a cell-free bisphenol A (BPA) biosensor based on a coupled enzyme reaction fused to S-layer proteins for everyday use. BPA is a supposedly harmful substance which is e.g. used in the production of polycarbonate. To detect BPA it is degraded by a fusion protein under formation of NAD+ which is detected by a NAD+-dependent enzymatic reaction with a molecular beacon.:::2011
