Minnesota:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. coli Based Biotemplating:::"The objective of our project is the construction of a light-inducible system in which E. coli is engineered to express silacatein in order to create a biotemplating system. This system has many potential uses, such as the creation of precise nano-structures or biomemetic bone. The coliroid light-inducible system was assembled by cloning a fusion protein of Cph1 and EnvZ, called Cph8, from a previous iGEM group, and isolating and cloning the two other genes (Heme Oxigenase and PcyA) required for functionality of the system and putting all the parts into a vector. Then the silicatein alpha gene isolated from Subterities domuncula was fused with E. coli outer membrane protein A (OmpA) and ice nucleation protein (INP) and inserted in the vector under control of the coliroid system.":::2011
