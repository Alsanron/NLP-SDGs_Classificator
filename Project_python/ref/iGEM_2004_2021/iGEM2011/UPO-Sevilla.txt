UPO-Sevilla:::Europe:::Spain:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::FLASHBACTER: Improving robustness in bistable systems:::The core of our project is the development of molecular systems that reproduce the behavior of an electronic flip-flop, allowing the construction of living memory devices closer to the robustness of informatics. Several iGEM teams based their work on the construction or use of biological flip-flop systems, with more problems than expected. The UPO-Sevilla team considers the design, construction and improvement of this type of systems, encompassing different regulation levels (transcription, translation, protein proteolysis and epigenetic regulation) in different model organisms, from bacteria to yeast. We leverage our informatics knowledge to improve biological systems, so we can control precisely the cellular machinery. In addition, we intend to develop a Foundational Advance for Synthetic Biology: the miniTn7 BioBrick toolkit, a transposon-based system to integrate BioBricks into microbial genomes. And a Software tool: the BioBrick Creator, to facilitate the design of BioBrick sequences and their inclusion in the Parts Registry.:::2011
