Imperial_College_London:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::When AuxIn met Root:::"In an effort to combat soil erosion, we have developed the AuxIn system. This system is comprised of three modules combined in an E. coli chassis. The first involves secretion of the plant growth factor indole 3-acetic acid (auxin). This plant hormone will promote root growth which is essential for anchoring soil. The second module rewires the chemotactic mobility of the cell by introducing a novel receptor protein which is sensitive to root exudates. The bacteria can then be naturally taken up by root cells for targeted auxin delivery. The final module uses a toxin-antitoxin system to prevent horizontal gene transfer. While the plasmid containing the AuxIn system can be maintained inside our chassis, it will induce lysis in any other bacteria. By improving root growth, the AuxIn system provides a synthetic biology approach to tackling worldwide problems such as soil erosion and desertification.":::2011
