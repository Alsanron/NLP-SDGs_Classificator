UANL_Mty-Mexico:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Simple Light Code Interpretation Enabling Circuit in Escherichia coli:::Information processing through living things remains a challenge to science. Genetic logic-gates and switches have been used to this purpose[1]. Moreover, light induction systems have been recently constructed[2]. Our project aims to enable a bacterial community, constituted by three E. coli strains, to interpret a simple light based code. Chromosome insertion of light induction's genes will be performed in order to create light responsive chassis. Furthermore, each strain will contain plasmids carrying the genetic constructions needed for the interpretation of the code, which relies on logic-gates and switches. Phage lambda's based biphasic switch[3], which theoretically allows controlling the independent expression of two different proteins through a single input, is introduced to iGEM.:::2011
