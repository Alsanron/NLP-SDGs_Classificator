Copenhagen:::Europe:::Denmark:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Expressing and standardizing cytochrome P450 in E.coli to create the oxime producing CyperMan:::"A cytochrome P450 (CYP) is an enzyme able to perfom complex hydroxylations. The regio- and stereospecfic hydroxylations performed by CYPs are often difficult to do using conventional chemical methods and it can therefore be greatly beneficial to utilize our CyperMan as a small synthetic biology factory. CYPs from the plant CYP79 family produce small molecules called oximes. Oximes are toxic to fungus, as they inhibit the ability of the mitochondrial peroxidases to breakdown potentially harmful hydrogen peroxides. The oximes are produced from a variety of amino acids. As a proof of concept we aim at generating bacteria or CyperMen able to combat fungus on their own turf. The main goal is however to standardize different plant CYP79s and deliver them as BioBricks to iGEM.":::2011
