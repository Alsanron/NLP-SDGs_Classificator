Alberta:::North America:::Canada:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genetically engineering a common fungus to produce biodiesel from cellulosic waste.:::"Converting food into biofuel is an unsustainable proposition. Our project focuses on the creation of cellulosic biodiesel using waste products. We are engineering Neurospora crassa, a highly efficient cellulose metabolizer, to produce an excess of fatty acids by both inhibiting beta oxidation and up-regulating fatty acid synthesis by the one-step replacement of the FadD gene with a thioesterase gene. We are testing the growth of Neurospora on a variety of waste substances and are developing an efficient chemical esterification method to convert the fatty acids into fatty acid methyl esters, a common biodiesel requiring no changes to current fuel delivery infrastructure. Neurospora crassa's broad substrate preferences give it unique advantages for bioproduction from cellulose. We have therefore developed an efficient and reliable system for modular bioengineering of Neurospora including a starter kit of basic reusable parts with the intent of creating a novel chassis for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.":::2011
