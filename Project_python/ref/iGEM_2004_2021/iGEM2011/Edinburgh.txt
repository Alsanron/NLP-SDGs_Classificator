Edinburgh:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Improved biorefineries using synergy: a feasibility study:::"A biorefinery is a special type of refinery in which biomass, such as plant cellulose, is converted by microorganisms into useful products. Edinburgh's 2011 iGEM project is a feasibility study into the creation of biorefineries using E. coli, the workhorse of synthetic biology; and whether biorefineries can be improved by arranging for the different enzymes involved to be in close proximity to each other, so as to create synergy between them. We investigate two methods of bringing the enzymes close together: cell surface display via Ice Nucleation Protein, and phage display via M13's major coat protein. We attempt a new DNA assembly protocol, provisionally named ""BioSandwich"". We construct computer models of synergy. Finally, we consider the broader economic and social questions surrounding the construction of a biorefinery: can it be done, and should it be done?":::2011
