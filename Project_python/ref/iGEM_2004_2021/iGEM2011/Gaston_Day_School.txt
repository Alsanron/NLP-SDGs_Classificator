Gaston_Day_School:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Red Fluorescent Nitrate Detector:::"Increasing levels of fertilizer required for mechanized farming can result in elevated nitrate levels in soil and groundwater. Due to contaminated food and water, humans are at risk for methemoglobinemia caused by enterohepatic metabolism of nitrates into ammonia. This process also oxidizes the iron in hemoglobin, rendering it unable to carry oxygen. Infants in particular are susceptible to methemoglobinemia, also known as 'blue baby syndrome', when formula is reconstituted using water contaminated with nitrates. By combining the red fluorescent protein coding region with a nitrate sensitive promoter, we are developing an inexpensive, simple, visual test for nitrate contaminated water. Use of this detector in agricultural areas could alert families to the presence of nitrates in groundwater and prevent blue baby syndrome.":::2011
