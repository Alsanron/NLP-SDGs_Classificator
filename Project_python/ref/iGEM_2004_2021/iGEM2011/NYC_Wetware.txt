NYC_Wetware:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Radiation-resistance? There's a Gene for That.:::Extremophile organisms have adapted to extreme chemical and physical environments here on Earth. Deinococcus radiodurans, also known as Conan the Bacterium, is famous for being resistant to 1000 times the amount of radiation that would be lethal to humans. By identifying genes that could be responsible for such extreme radiation resistance in D.rad as well as other organisms, we hope to enable future engineering of radiation-resistant organisms to use in toxic conditions for bioremediation here on Earth or in the high radiation background during future space travel to Mars.:::2011
