Osaka:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bio-dosimeter:::"On March 11, 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake struck off the coast of Eastern Japan and triggered a series of events that led to a nationwide nuclear crisis. The need for low-cost, portable and easy-to-use dosimeters became apparent as radiation measurements could only be conducted at sparsely-distributed installations and the values reported infrequently. We have decided to tackle the issue by building a biological dosimeter. Focus is placed on modularly transferring radiation response and DNA repair genes from the extremophilic bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans to the well-characterized, easily cultivable chassis Escherichia coli. The native DNA damage detection and repair systems of E. coli will be also modified to efficiently sense ionizing radiation through detection of the resultant DNA damage. Finally, detection will be connected to visible outputs such as color pigment production, resulting in a biological device capable of detecting ionizing radiation and alerting users to it through color change.":::2011
