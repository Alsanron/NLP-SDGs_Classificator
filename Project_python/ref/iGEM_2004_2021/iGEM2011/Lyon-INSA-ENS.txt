Cobalt is one of them, and is a major concern for these industries because of its high level of radiation. Currently, nonspecific ion exchange resins are used. Our E. coli 'Cobalt buster' strain aims at capturing cobalt specifically, even at extremely low concentrations, to increase resin lifetime and decrease the volume of nuclear waste. In a previous study, an E. coli strain has been modified by adding a transporter for cobalt and inactivating cobalt efflux pump. Then, our work focused on making this strain adherent in response to cobalt, via cobalt inducible production of curlis. These properties will enable to create an efficient biofilter, which will be easily separated from the effluent, allowing efficient and cheap bioremediation of trace cobalt in nuclear wastewater.:::2011
