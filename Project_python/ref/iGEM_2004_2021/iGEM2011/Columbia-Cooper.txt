Environmentally-Friendly Manufacture of Quantum Dots in E. coli:::"Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconducting nanoscale crystals with unique optical properties. They have many applications, including medical imaging, enhanced LEDs, solar cells, and solid state quantum computation. Our project pioneers a greener manufacturing process for QDs. We are BioBricking several metal binding peptides, expressing them in E. coli, and characterizing their ability to nucleate QDs from cadmium salts. In addition, since cadmium is dangerous to the environment, we will create QDs using less toxic metals such as zinc. We are also building a manufacturing 'tuning' device that will sense specific light wavelengths emitted by nucleated QDS and activate antibiotic resistance.":::2011
