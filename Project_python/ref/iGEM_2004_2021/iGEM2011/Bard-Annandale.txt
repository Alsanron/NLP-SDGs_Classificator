Bard-Annandale:::North America:::United States:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Zener Diode Quorum Sensing: Communication in One Direction at a Time:::"A directional quorum sensing system was made using E. coli immobilized in a microfluidic chip. One strain of E. coli carrying the LuxI and LuxAB genes was trapped in hydrogel at one end of microfluidic channel. Another strain of E. coli carrying a LuxR operon attached with a GFP reporter gene and LuxCDE gene was similarly trapped at the other end of the channel. Depending on the direction of flow, one group of E. coli will be downstream of the other and therefore capable of receiving a chemical signal. Acting as an analog of zener diode, this device is capable of controlling the direction of communication between the E. coli. The orthogonal visual responses, one fluorescent and one luminescent, should be clear indicators of which way communication took place. This device is a novel member of the growing toolkit available to perform logic operations with living systems.":::2011
