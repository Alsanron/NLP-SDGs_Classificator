British_Columbia:::North America:::Canada:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::iSynthase: Mass production of terpenes in yeast:::"In nature, terpenes are mostly synthesized and secreted by plants as a defense against pathogenic attacks by insects and fungi, such as the case of the mountain pine beetle infestation. These compounds are also utilized in pharmaceuticals, fragrances, food, and energy industries, which drives interest for high-scale production. Hence, we aim to optimize production of terpenes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast by constructing the biosynthetic pathways necessary to synthesize and retain these compounds. To simulate the system, we are also developing a model of terpene production in yeast using SimBiology Toolkit in MATLAB. In parallel, we are constructing a mathematical model to predict the dynamics of the mountain pine beetle populations in British Columbia, Canada under the influence of our synthetic yeast.":::2011
