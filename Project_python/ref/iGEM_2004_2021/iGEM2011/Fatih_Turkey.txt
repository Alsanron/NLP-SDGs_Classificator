Fatih_Turkey:::Europe:::Turkey:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Rainbow Graveyard:::"E. Coli is one of the gram-negative bacteria and most of their types are harmless. However some of E.Coli types such as enterohaemorrhagic E.Coli (EHEC) can cause serious disease. In our project we designed an innovative model to prevent gram-negative growth and infection. In our model, to prevent E.Coli growth we modified non-infectious gram-positive bacteria B.Subtilis by transforming it with a construct, which was designed to produce limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) together with a signal peptide. LALF is expected to bind and neutralize Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found in gram-negative bacteria cell wall. On the other hand, to show E.Coli growth inhibition, we prepared another construct, which carries reflectin sequence with a signal peptide sequence and transferred into E.Coli. Reflectin protein produces color by reflecting light in different wavelenghts. This ability helps us to detect whether E.Coli is dead or alive.":::2011
