USC:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bioengineering a mechanism to override plasmid-based antibiotic resistance:::"Bacteria protect their genome and remove foreign DNA through a primitive immune-like system called clustered-regularly-interspaced-short-palindromic-repeats (CRISPR). Plasmids commonly used in molecular biology are mobile genetic elements that facilitate horizontal gene transfer in the wild and enable the spreading of antibioticresistance genes between microorganisms. Plasmids contain unique DNA sequences that can be targeted by the CRISPR system. We exploited this system by engineering E.coli with an inducible mechanism of self-curing plasmid based antibiotic resistance. We synthesized a version of CRISPR encoding a spacer that matches the GFP DNA sequence. We tested the synthetic CRISPR array against E.coli harboring a tetO::GFP plasmid that confers ampicillin resistance. Activation ofCRISPER-gfp destroys the gfp-containing plasmid restoring the bacterial host's sensitivity to ampicillin. We will use the synthetic CRISPR system as a biological tool, combining it with other BioBricks for use in applications that will impact health and medicine, biotechnology, molecular biology, and genetics.":::2011
