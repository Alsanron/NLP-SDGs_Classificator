NCTU_Formosa:::Asia:::Taiwan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Pathway Commander:::"Controlling the flux through a synthetic metabolic pathway lies in selecting well-matched genetic components that when coupled, can reliably produce the desired behavior. Each generating different protein expression levels in order to test performance in reliability and consistency, but this process is both tedious and time consuming. To overcome this problem, our team provided a novel circuit design method_ Pathway Commander. We construct a single version of a synthetic metabolic pathway circuit that can use culture temperature shifts to control the expression levels of a series of metabolic proteins at the precise times. We have implemented the Pathway_Commander design in (1) Carotenoid synthesis Pathway, (2) Violacein biosynthesis pathways and (3) Butanol synthesis pathway in E. coli. This circuit design utilizes a temperature controlled system that gives precision control over metabolic protein expression which amounts to optimal synthesis that can maximize synthesis of a given compound or drug.":::2011
