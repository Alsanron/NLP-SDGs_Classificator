NYC_Software:::North America:::United States:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Deinococcus Genome Sequencing & Registry/ Biobrick Tools:::"Our goal is to sequence the genomes of several Deinococcus bacteria, construct phylogenetic trees and identify links between radiation resistant species using a combination of publicly available genome analysis tools. By sequencing the genomes of species of the radiation-resistant Deinococcus genus, we hope to identify genes that may be responsible for increased protection against superoxide radicals and ionizing radiation. We are also performing RNA-seq experiments to ascertain what genes are upregulated by radiation exposure. We also realize that there are significant gains to be made on the software side of synthetic biology, so we are working with others to code tools to integrate into the Registry and into iGEM teams' biobricking pipelines.":::2011
