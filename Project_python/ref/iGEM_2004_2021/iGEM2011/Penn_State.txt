Penn_State:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacterial Dosimeter--Detecting Levels of Harmful Radiation:::Ionizing radiation and radiation pollution is an important environmental problem that not only affects those working around radiation facilities, but those dealing with the aftermath of widespread nuclear disasters such as those at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor. Penn State's team project designed and constructed a genetic circuit introduced into E. coli bacterial cells, in order to rapidly detect and report the presence of harmful ionizing radiation. We are working to create a robust and reliable biosensor that utilizes the lambda phage lytic-lysogenic switch as the radiation sensor. When the sensor detects radiation, it triggers one of three fast acting reporters we developed based on the concept developed by Imperial College's 2010 iGEM team. Each of the reporters features a different enzyme/substrate reaction (beta-galactosodise/beta-D-galactose, beta-glucurodinase/beta-D-glucuronide or C23O/catechol). We believe that the final construct may have the potential to rival current radiation detection methods, such as digital dosimeters.:::2011
