WHU-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Colorful E.coli Weave Time and Space.:::Our project focuses on constructing colorful E.coli, which includes two parts. We plan to construct two systems consisting of several strains of E.coli: one produces different pigments due to the change of time, and the other produces different pigments with the change of position. In the first part, the strain of E.coli works as an oscillator which can yield different kinds of pigment periodically with the help of a signal transformation system. In the second part, we came up with the idea of 'colorful E.filmÂ¡'. In hope to create a colorful film, we will construct three E.coli strains which can produce and secrete three primary colors respectively in the presence of the three primary lights. Therefore, if we use a color picture as an input signal, the output will be the copy of it on the plate.:::2011
