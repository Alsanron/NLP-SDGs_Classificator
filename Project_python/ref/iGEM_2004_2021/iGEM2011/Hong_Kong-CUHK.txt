In our project, we aim to replace such analog system with a phototunable cascade, which can trigger a measurable output (e.g. gene expression) according to the wavelengths, intensities, and durations of a light source in a quantitative manner. In the long run, this system could be further modified to convert light into other types of output, such as osmolality and electric current.":::2011
