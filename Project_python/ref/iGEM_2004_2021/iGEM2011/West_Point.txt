West_Point:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Visual Detection of Cholera via Modified E. Coli:::"Cholera (Vibrio cholerae) is a bacterium that causes intestinal infections in humans. While it is rare in industrialized nations, cholera remains a major threat in developing nations; there are an estimated 3-5 million cases resulting in over 100,000 deaths annually. West Point's 2011 iGEM team is developing a simple test kit to determine the presence of cholera contamination in drinking water. Inserting a plasmid coding for Beta-Galactosidase (_-Gal) enzyme induced by an arabinose promoter (araBAD) into E. coli creates a biological specimen that will produce the _-Gal in the presence of arabinose. When the modified specimen is mixed with cholera the _-Gal is released into solution where it reacts with X-gal, also in the solution, producing a blue-violet color. If no cholera is present, the solution remains clear. Our technique should produce visible results in the order of minutes, rather than the typical day(s) it currently takes for similar techniques.":::2011
