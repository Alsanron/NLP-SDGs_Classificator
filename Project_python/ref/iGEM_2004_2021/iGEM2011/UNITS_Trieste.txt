UNITS_Trieste:::Europe:::Italy:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synbiome: a three-cell type interkingdom consortium:::The synbiome project exploits synthetic biology to obtain a synthetic stable community of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Two different bacterial strains 'A','â€˜B' and one eukaryotic cell type 'C' will be engineered to establish mutualism: 'A' produces a N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) sensed by 'B', which in turn produces a different AHL sensed by 'A'. In addition, both bacterial cells activate, through AHL, an enzyme necessary to convert cellobiose to glucose, which represents the only energy source for the whole consortium. The eukaryotic cell 'C' responds to AHL through a hybrid protein, thereby producing a secreted beta-lactamase, which allows the bacterial cells to grow in the presence of ampicillin. The creation of a consortium of inter-dependent cells from different kingdoms is expected to pave the way to multiple applications, since different cells might cooperate and, for instance, better produce complex molecules.:::2011
