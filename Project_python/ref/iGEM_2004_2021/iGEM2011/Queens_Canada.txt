Queens_Canada:::North America:::Canada:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Nemoremediation: Engineering C. Elegans into a Toolkit for Soil Bioremediation:::"Naphthalene is a pollutant produced by oil sands operations. The Queen's team has engineered the nematode worm C. elegans into a toolkit for dealing with this compound in the soil. We have produced constructs with GPCRs from M. musculus, R. norvegicus, and H. sapiens intended to enhance the worm's ability to chemotax toward naphthalene. We are working on a field bioassay based on fluorescent proteins that will indicate the presence of naphthalene in a soil sample. The goal is to have a population of green fluorescent worms chemotaxing toward and a population of red fluorescent worms chemotaxing away from the napthalene in the soil sample. Finally, we have biobricked the P. putida gene nahD, which encodes a degradative enzyme as part of a naphthalene catabolic pathway. The nahD gene encodes the enzyme 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylic acid isomerase, which catalyzes the fourth step in the catabolic pathway.":::2011
