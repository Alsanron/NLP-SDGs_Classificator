Toward a new bacterial cell-to-cell communication:::"Bacterial communication and resource sharing, hitherto thought to be mediated through the medium has been challenged by a recent paper (G.P.Dubey et al.) suggesting an extraordinary new form of communication between B.subtilis cells and even exchanges with E.coli through nanotubes. We set to provide new evidence for this cell-to-cell communication and to allow the synthetic biology community to harness its potential for amorphous computing and metabolic engineering. We developed and characterized new B.subtilis BioBricks designed to validate this finding by testing a wide range of molecules that could potentially travel through the nanotubes and be detected via signal amplification. We worked on molecules of different size and nature to best characterize the transfer. Modeling suggests that we will be able to follow the diffusion through the nanotube network by fluorescence microscopy. TuBe or not TuBe? Our ongoing experiments will shed light on this elusive question.":::2011
