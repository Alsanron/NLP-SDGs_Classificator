UEA-JIC_Norwich:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The evolution of synthetic biology; The introduction of new photosynthetic eukaryotes as model organisms.:::"There are challenges using plants in iGEM, namely growth time and the complexity with adapting synthetic biology approaches for plants. However, plants are a major focus of synthetic biology due to their potential use in an array of applications from food security to synthesis of biofuels. The short time scale of the iGEM competition has often meant that plant based projects are challenging and there have been very few in previous years. As the first iGEM team at UEA and in co-operation with the JIC, we felt that we could make a significant contribution to plant based synthetic biology. The overall aim of our project is to help develop and where possible pioneer some of the fundamental technologies and methodologies needed to make plant based synthetic biology projects possible. To achieve this we hope to adapt existing synthetic biology approaches which are successful in Escherichia coli for use in plants.":::2011
