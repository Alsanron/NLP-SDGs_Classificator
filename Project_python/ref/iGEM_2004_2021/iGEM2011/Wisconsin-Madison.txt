Wisconsin-Madison:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Optimizing biosensors through a two-phase directed evolution:::"The University of Wisconsin - Madison 2011 iGEM team sought to create fluorescent E. coli biosensors for ethanol and alkanes, two molecules with significance for sustainable fuel production. Through expression of heterologous genes, E. coli strains which appear to have a response to a specific biofuel were generated. However, these biosensors did not produce the low uninduced and high induced levels of expression desired. This situation appears to be common among biosensor-based iGEM projects. In order to improve the biofuel sensors, as well as provide a framework for other teams to do the same, a universal biosensor directed evolution construct was assembled. The device can be used to both select for high expression in the presence of an analyte, as well as select for no expression in its absence. In conjunction with mutagenesis of key genes, this device could be used to significantly improve existing and novel biosensors.":::2011
