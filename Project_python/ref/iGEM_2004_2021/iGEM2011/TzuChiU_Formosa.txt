TzuChiU_Formosa:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Photo-Paper:::"For centuries, paper-making has been a traditional but indispensable industry. Wood pulp is the major raw material for paper-making, moreover, the complicated processes toward paper-making may contribute to deforestation and environmental pollution. Gluconacetobacter hansenii is a bacterium which produces bacterial cellulose. It has an acs operon, consisting of genes that called acsAB, acsC, and acsD. Together these genes used UDP-glucose as substrate and synthesize. We aim to clone acs operon and transform it into environmental friendly and economical microbes in order to produce large amount of cellulose for paper industry. In doing so we minimized global deforestation as well as CO2 emission. We also aim to introduce acs operon into cyanobacteria which would used only light, CO2 and water to produce glucose and the acs operon to produce cellulose. With manufacturing processes, we believe this project can develop into a new, eco-friendly thus revolutionized the paper industrial.":::2011
