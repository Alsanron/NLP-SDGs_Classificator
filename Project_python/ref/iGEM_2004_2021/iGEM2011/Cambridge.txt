Cambridge:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bactiridescence:::Nature's colours don't just come from pigments, but from structure too. Cephalopods camouflage themselves using intracellular, iridescent structures made of proteins called reflectins. These are the only known proteinaceous materials that use thin film interference to generate colour. They are inspiring a new class of responsive optical materials. We hope to demonstrate the potential of reflectins as photonic materials by producing optical devices which exhibit instantaneous colour change. In addition we intend to characterise export pathways in E. coli and optimise protein production for commercial viability. We will submit constructs for the expression of reflectins in a variety of organisms. Our team is producing a report examining the impact of iGEM, focusing on innovation in the biotechnology industry. Alongside this we are contributing to Gibthon, a collection of software tools aimed at fragment library management and construct design, building on standards developed by previous Cambridge teams.:::2011
