Amsterdam:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::icE. coli: enhancing E. coli's growth rate at low temperatures by psychrophile chaperones:::Escherichia coli's optimal growth temperature is 37C. Its growth rate decreases drastically at lower temperatures and growth completely halts below 7C. The aim of our project is to increase the cold tolerance of E. coli by expressing and combining several chaperone proteins that are normally found in psychrophillic bacteria. Chaperone proteins are essential in maintaining correct protein folding following changes in temperature. Therefore, expressing these proteins will likely enable enhanced growth rates at temperatures below 37C and shift the minimal growth temperature down from 7C, possibly even allowing growth near 0C. Our project is fundamental in its nature, but any application outside the labs, from biofuel production to bio-sensors, will benefit from the ability of icE.coli to grow at low temperatures, since this will relieve the burden and costs of maintaining the temperature constant at 37C. Moreover, we envision a temperature-based selection as an alternative to antibiotics-based selection.:::2011
