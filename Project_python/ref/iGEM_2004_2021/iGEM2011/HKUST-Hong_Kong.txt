HKUST-Hong_Kong:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. trojan:::"Adding to the already massive arsenal of bacteria, highly-resistant (HR) /E. coli/ are found to be capable of supporting less-resistant (LR) individuals experiencing antibiotic stress through indole signalling - allowing LR individuals to survive in antibiotic concentrations that would otherwise be lethal. Our team has engineered disruptor /E. coli/ expressing mutated toluene-4-monooxygenase, which facilitates indole degradation. Introducing this disruptor strain into an /E. coli/ culture of HR and LR individuals is thus hypothesized to result in massive LR cell death at a lower-than-expected antibiotic concentration. If successful, indole degradation may become a possible strategy in boosting antibiotics effectiveness in medical practices against bacteria relying on similar signalling methods. We are also constructing a novel strain of /E. coli/ that utilizes an essential gene (/nadE/) for antibiotic-free transformation and plasmid maintenance. This strain can help future iGEM teams reduce their antibiotics consumption without deviating significantly from widely used transformation protocols.":::2011
