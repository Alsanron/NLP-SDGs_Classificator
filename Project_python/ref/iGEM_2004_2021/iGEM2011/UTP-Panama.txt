UTP-Panama:::Latin America:::Panama:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::THERMOGENIC RESPONSE NUTRIENT BIOSENSOR (THE RENBO):::To develop flexible and better sensors for environmental, agricultural and engineering applications are the aims of the UTP-Panama Team 'SynBio Engineering Tool kit'. In this way we work with Nitrate Biosensor (PyeaR - GFP composite) developed by Team BCCS-Bristol 2010, which expresses fluorescent signals upon nutrient detection, producing a high-resolution map of arable land. To achieve this goal we use the collateral effect of the AOX enzyme (Alternative oxidase) mainly designed to generate heat in response to a cold-shock, using the hybB promoter which increases the bacteria growth at temperatures below 20C. Finally we design a prototype device with a better cold shock promoter (CspA) developed by UNAM-CINVESTAV Team in 2010, in order to give our E. coli an 'Intelligent Coat', which means that not only survives a cold-shock but is also able to keep up with its duties, due of improving their expression mechanisms at low temperature.:::2011
