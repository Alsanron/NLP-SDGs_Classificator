Penn:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cellular phones - an optogenetic cellular signaling system:::"Paracrine cell signaling typically occurs through chemical messengers. Such signaling is limited by diffusion coefficients and unique cell properties, and cannot easily be controlled in therapeutic applications. The goal of this project was to demonstrate light-based cell signaling in mammalian cells. Using luminescent proteins and optogenetic tools, we constructed 'Sender' and 'Receiver' HEK 293T cells which send and receive blue light, respectively. The Sender Cell expresses a 480nm light emitting protein. The Receiver Cell expresses Channelrhodopsin-2, an ion channel gated by 480nm light. When the Receiver Cell is illuminated, Channelrhodopsin-2 opens, triggering a second luminescent protein via calcium influx. Since the luciferases in this system require an externally added luciferin substrate, we have also been developing Pre-coelenterazine, a genetically encoded luciferin which could allow our system to function autonomously. Our light signaling system has eventual applications in interkingdom signaling and optical controlling of synthetic networks.":::2011
