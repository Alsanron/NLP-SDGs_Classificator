Brown-Stanford:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mars BioTools: Synthetic Biology for Space Exploration:::"One of the major challenges of space exploration is the enormous cost of launching materials, limiting the size and affordability of long-term missions. Synthetic Biology can revolutionize space exploration and settlement by providing a microbial platform for catalyzing critical reactions and manufacturing essential products. Biological devices have a major advantage over classical machines: the ability to self-replicate and regenerate. Project RegoBrick uses bacteria to cement Martian and Lunar regolith simulant into a concrete-like compound. Extraterrestrial settlements will be able to use such a process to build structures using resources readily available in the environment, instead of having to transport materials from Earth. Project PowerCell develops a universal energy source from engineered cyanobacteria, which generate carbon and nitrogenous nutrients from sunlight and air and secrete them to sustain other microbes. This system will allow future settlers to transform resources on other planets into fuel, food, drugs, and other useful products.":::2011
