Peking_R:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Soft-coding of genetic program for synthetic biology:::"During genetic program tuning, mutagenesis and following screening of each mutant, which can be named as hardcoding approach, is usually the only choice, although laborious and time-consuming. But actually there can be an alternative - softcoding approach, which refers to designs that allow for the customization of performance of genetic programs via external input without having to edit the DNA sequence case by case. This year our team aims to establish a genetic fine-tuning platform based on the softcoding of genetic program in bacteria, composed of a toolbox and a methodology -- The toolbox consists of interoperable and modular ligand-responsive riboswitches/ribozymes, while the methodology is automated design of synthetic RBS with customized translation rate. When combining them together, the configuration of RBS strength in genetic program can be fast and easily determined by variable concentration of external ligand and an RBS that meets this configuration will be automatically generated.":::2011
