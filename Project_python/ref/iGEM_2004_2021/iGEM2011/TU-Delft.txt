Coli : Single Protein Attachment of Escherichia coli:::"Natural attachment of micro-organisms relies on a complex network of varying compounds known as biofilms. This complexity hinders an easy control and regulation of attachment and detachment. We will give Escherichia coli a simple, effective and controllable mechanism for biofilm formation based on the strong glue from mussel feet. E. coli, expressing the strongest-binding mussel foot protein Mfp5 on the outer cell surface, can robustly attach to a wide variety of surfaces, including glass, plastic and itself. Using highly sensitive TIRF microscopy and atomic force measurements we visualize and characterize the localization and attachment of cells. Combining these results with our mathematical models allows us to predict the attachment speed and stability as well as cell clustering and settling. The controllable, strong attachment opens up new possibilities for the use of bacterial machines in environmental applications, medicine and industry.":::2011
