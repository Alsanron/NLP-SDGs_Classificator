Sevilla:::Europe:::Spain:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Arcanum Project:::We propose a new standard in order to do synthetic biology at a higher level of abstraction, above the biobrick. Our intention is to define a universal substance (Ubbit) for communication between modules of bacteria. Each module is composed of different transformed bacterial strains that work co-ordinately so that the whole module performs a logic operation based on a binary code. Having a unique communication substance means there's no need to understand how the modules work or what's inside, the only important thing is knowing which operation it performs and the inputs and outputs it has. This would allow us to build bigger circuits with different modules that could carry out more complex operations.:::2011
