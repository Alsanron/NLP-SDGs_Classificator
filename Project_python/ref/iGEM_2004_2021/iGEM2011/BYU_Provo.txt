BYU_Provo:::North America:::United States:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. colinoscopy:::"We constructed a novel molecular AND gate in E. coli. An AND gate requires two positive inputs to generate a single output. Either positive input without the other does not generate an output. Our AND gate expresses a reporter in the presence of both ROS and high temperature. We selected an OxyR-responsive promoter (HemH) and a thermo-sensitive riboswitch (derived from Listeria) as detectors for ROS and temperature, respectively.The OxyR-responsive promoter is used to drive transcription of the Listera thermo-sensitive riboswitch coupled to a Cre/Lox system which, when activated, removes a double-terminator sequence and allows constitutive transcription of the reporter molecule. This system may be further modified and adapted to various applications, including early detection of colon cancer.":::2011
