Tsinghua-A:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ECHO: an E.Coli Homochronous Oscillator.:::"Tsinghua-A iGEMers dedicate in pursuing the goal of the construction of a biological oscillator with two Escherichia coli populations expressing gene one after another, giving red and green fluorescent light alternatively. E.coli populations communicate bi-directionally by a class of signaling molecules involves in bacteria quorum sensing, that is, N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHL), to regulate the gene expression of each other. By engineering their gene circuits, two groups (we call them CELL-A and CELL-B) will form a network, with B inducing A and A restricting B, thus cycle in a homochronous way. We have established a mechanism to change the rate of the AHL expression, allowing us to control the period and the phase of the oscillatory cycle. Moreover, a mathematical model has been made to analyze the dynamics of the system, and computer simulation software is introduced into the process.":::2011
