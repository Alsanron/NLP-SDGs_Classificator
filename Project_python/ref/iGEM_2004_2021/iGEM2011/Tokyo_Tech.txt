Tokyo_Tech:::Asia:::Japan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cool down in summer with our rock-paper-scissors game:::"In Japan, summer is terribly hot. To have more pleasant summers, we created a rock-paper-scissors game in which the winner gets a refreshing shower of rain. We make it rain by producing isoprene, which is the base for the creation of condensation nuclei that are used to make rain. As it rains and water evaporates things will cool down by giving away the heat of evaporation to water. To make it even fresher, we also created urea coolers! They are pocket size and contain E. coli-synthetized urea that has been dried. By adding water to them they will cool down as the heat of solution is used to dissolve the urea. The RPS game works based on a genetic randomizer, and we have confirmed this by creating mathematical models of it. We have also optimized the urea and isoprene production by flux analysis. Let's play rock-paper-scissors and make it rain!":::2011
