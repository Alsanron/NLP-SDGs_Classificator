Fudan-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::"E.tree, neon light and the dinner service":::What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you see this: tree, neon lights and dinner? Christmas! Well, exactly, and that is what our project all about. Part I: E.tree The 'leaves' change color according to the nutrients in the 'soil': if the soil is rich in nitrates, the 'leaves' are healthy and green; otherwise, the leaves turn yellow. Part II: neon lights Each engineered E.coli emits one color of fluorescence; after a while, the light fades and another color of light is emitted. Different combination of such E.coli could therefore achieve the effect of neon lights. Part III: dinner service The genetically modified bacteria involve a certain self-feedback system. When the 'customer' is starving, it orders dinner from the 'chef'; and the chef serves meals. While the 'customer' is full, it tells the 'chef' that no more food is wanted, so the 'chef' stops cooking.:::2011
