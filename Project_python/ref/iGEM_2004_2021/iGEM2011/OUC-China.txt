OUC-China:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Theory of Five Elements:::Our work aims to illuminate the ancient Chinese philosophical theory called 'Wu Xing', also Theory of FIVE Elements, by artificially assembling a communication system between bacteria. This theory explains the composition and phenomena of the physical universe. In the system there exists close relationships classified as mutual promoting and restraining under certain conditions, by which functions of the various systems are coordinated and homeostasis of universe maintained. In our project, five modified nutritionally deficient bacteria represent the five elements in the theory. They talk to each other emitting and receiving specific signals called AHLs. Five pairs of signal receivers and producers, like luxR and luxI, are involved in achieving the process. Moreover, one will help another producing the essential nutrition for living while limit the production of a third member. Through such mechanism, the whole group survive and live in moderate coexistence, just like the effect of the philosophical theory.:::2011
