UCL_London:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.coili - Making supercoiled pDNA technology viable:::"We are developing a toolkit for the industrial manufacturing of supercoiled plasmid DNA. This will enable a widespread adoption of pDNA-based technologies, most relevantly DNA vaccines - the future of immunization. Therefore we are a manufacturing project with a strong impact on the global health sector. Our toolkit consists of five modules tackling different bottlenecks in the manufacturing process from production to lysis and filtration as well as providing tools for monitoring and improving the overall quantity and quality of the product. Recognizing that the adoption of vaccines and other biological technologies also depends strongly on their social acceptance, we're investing heavily into public engagement for synthetic biology and are exploring the process by which new scientific disciplines arrive in the public sphere.":::2011
