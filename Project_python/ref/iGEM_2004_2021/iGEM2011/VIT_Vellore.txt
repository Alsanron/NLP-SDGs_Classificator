VIT_Vellore:::Asia:::India:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::In vivo Drug Factory:::In our project we propose a novel approach to the problem of sustained drug release, controlled using the concentrations of the target molecule and using synthetic biology. Our 'in vivo drug factory' involves using E. coli. strains which are located in the human gut to manufacture and deliver drugs in the required concentration â€“ controlled by a promoter. We have incorporated two safety features. hok/sok post-segregational killing mechanism. In case of plasmid loss during replication -minimizing the growth of unwanted bacteria 'kill-switch' â€“ using bacteriophage holins ensures that in the case of adverse reactions, the production can be shut off. We have chosen lactose intolerance for our pilot study as it is high prevalent and it involves a pre-characterized lacZ system. Our system is controlled by intestinal glucose concentration. Our system could be potentially used for treating other inborn errors of metabolism, when coupled with the appropriate promoter.:::2011
