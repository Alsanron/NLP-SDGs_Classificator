Warsaw:::Europe:::Poland:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synthetic Cloning and Expression Control:::Our goal is to set up an easy and quick protocol for cell free cloning. It skips plasmid propagation in bacteria. This speeds up the cloning procedure at least three times and allows cloning of toxic genes. We make sure that no bacteria get harmed during our project. Moreover we have measured the RBS parts with various fluorescent proteins and they are not as standard as we would like them to be. The strength of a RBS part depends on the protein used. Why? Because the beginning of the protein influences the mRNA fold. We came up with the idea of RBS parts fused with short 'protein beginnings' - expression adapters. Using genetic algorithm we designed expression adapters that would provide standardized protein expression or increase expression of your favorite protein. We are testing our design in the wet lab.:::2011
