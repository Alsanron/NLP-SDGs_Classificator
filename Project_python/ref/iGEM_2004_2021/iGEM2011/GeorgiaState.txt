GeorgiaState:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Isolation & Characterization of P. pastoris promoters in E. coli:::"Pichia pastoris is a methylotrophic yeast used as an alternative host for protein production in addition to Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. There are several reasons why P. Pastoris is an ideal host organism. Its ability to perform eukaryotic post-translational modifications, high yields of recombinant protein, and its genetic similarity to S. cerevisiae are very attractive traits (Cereghino and Cregg, 2000). The Georgia State University iGEM team has isolated three promoters from P. pastoris. These promoters have been inserted into standard biobrick vectors. The team plans to transform these parts into E. coli and characterize their productivity using fluorescence.":::2011
