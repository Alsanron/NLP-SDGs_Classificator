Baltimore:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Making Synthetic Biology More Accessible: Making Wetware and Dryware for the Synthetic Biology Lab:::The overall mission of our team is to attempt to overcome some practical barriers to entry of groups and laboratories that may not be well-funded or may not have the capital requirements to realize their synthetic biology dreams. We approach this problem from two angles- 'wet-ware' and 'dry-ware.' Our wet-ware goal this year is to provide a way for anyone to be able to make their own Taq polymerase instead of having to purchase it. Our dry-ware goal this year is to create a prototype for a PCR machine that can be assembled from an inexpensive kit.:::2011
