Northwestern:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::My NU P.A.L.:::"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen commonly found in immunocompromised patients. In addition to being the primary cause of lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients, many severe nosocomial infections can be attributed to P. aeruginosa. Currently, the standard detection method requires a potential sample to be grown overnight and then screened for the pathogen of interest. Our goal is to create a faster detection method without sacrificing reliability or experimental resolution. To realize our objective, we harnessed the native cell signaling and quorum sensing machinery of P. aeruginosa. Quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa is a complex hierarchy that governs the expression of numerous virulence genes. Quorum sensing elements from P. aeruginosa were transplanted into E. coli and used to express detectable reporters. We are thus creating a novel biosensor capable of detecting the presence of P. Aeruginosa both quickly and effectively.":::2011
