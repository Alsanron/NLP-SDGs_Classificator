Tianjin:::Asia:::China:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Expecto Patronum---Reconstruction of TOR pathway to increase the tolerance of yeast to composite inhibitors:::Although 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' marks the termination of J. K. Rowling's popular novels, we recreate a fantastic world where patronus are produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae to fight against dementors inside the cell. Ethanol fermented by yeast from lignocellulosic materials can be an environmentally friendly fuel. However, rapid and efficient fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates is limited because of inhibitors generated during pretreatment in addition to monomeric sugars. Inhibitors strongly affect the normal physiology of yeast as well as its ethanol productivity, just like the dementors taking away people's hope and happiness. Nevertheless, we reconstruct TOR protein, a central component of major signaling transduction network controlling cell growth, to increase the tolerance of yeast. A new TOR after directional mutation will play the role of patronus to defend the influence of inhibitors, keep the overall signaling networks in good order, and finally provide a prosperous world for ethanol production.:::2011
