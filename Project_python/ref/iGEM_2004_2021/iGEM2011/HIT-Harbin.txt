HIT-Harbin:::Asia:::China:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Reform of Two Strains in Yogurt:::"Since lots of people in China are lactose intolerance, they have no access to drinking milk in the past. With the development of the dairy industry in China, yogurt has become highly accepted by consumers, including those lactose intolerance people. And postacidification has always been the most vital factor which affects the shelf life and flavor of yogurt. So our team takes it as our track. Through the literature, we have discovered a gene, called lacR, which could combine with the lactose operon to inhibit the production of lactic acid in Bulgaria Lactobacillus. If lacR could be highly transcripted in Bulgaria Lactobacillus when the pH value of yogurt declines to a certain level, the acidification of yogurt would be postponed. Meanwhile, we also want to transfer part of human collagen genes to Streptococcus Thermophilus in order to enhance the nutrition of yogurt.":::2011
