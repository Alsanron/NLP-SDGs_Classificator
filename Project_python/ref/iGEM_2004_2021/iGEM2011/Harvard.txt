Harvard:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering customized zinc finger protein arrays by massively multiplexed protein design and selection:::"Gene therapy is a powerful approach for the treatment of disease; however, current therapies using viral vectors carry significant risk of tumorigenesis due to their use of non-specific gene insertion. To meet this challenge, we engineered zinc finger proteins (ZFPs), which are tailored to bind to DNA with high specificity, enabling precise genome editing. Our group has developed a foundational technology for synthesizing nearly 50,000 unique ZFPs using chip-based DNA synthesis based on bioinformatic analysis and for identifying the best binder using a novel genomically encoded 1-hybrid genetic selection scheme in a massively multiplexed fashion. Further, we employed multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for facile editing of the E. coli genome enabling rapid modification of ZFP target sites, gene knockouts and silent codon substitutions. These tools allow for low-cost creation of ZFPs targeting any endogenous human gene, which will increase the accessibility of customized genome editing for gene therapy.":::2011
