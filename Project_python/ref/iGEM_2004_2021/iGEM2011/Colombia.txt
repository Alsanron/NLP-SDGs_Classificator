Colombia:::Latin America:::Colombia:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacterial prevention of rust headaches:::"Our objective is to create a bacterial 'detect and alert' system as an aid for defending coffee plantations against fungi (rust). Our bacteria will detect chitin, an organic compound found in fungal cell walls, and alert the plant by stimulating an early hypersensitive response. Two strains of bacteria will be created: one that detects chitin using a two component system from V. fischerii and produces chitinase to attack the fungus as well as a signaling molecule to activate the second strain. This second strain will process and amplify the signal, and if it decides that there is a threat it will produce a second signal that mimics the internal alarm system of the plant to activate the hypersensitive response. The design is modular to allow other combinations of fungus-host plant systems to be created easily. We expect this biocontrol method to prove very useful for farmers and reduce fungicide use.":::2011
