Duke:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering Bacterial Genetic Toggle Switch Controllers Using Synthetic Zinc Finger Transcription Factors:::"Additions to the synthetic biologists' toolkit are expected to be interoperable and modular in order to facilitate standardization of these tools. The Genetic Toggle Switch originally presented by Collins et al (2000) was a major breakthrough in synthetic biology and utilized constitutive promoters. Here, we use Zinc Fingers as transcriptional repressors in a newly designed interfacing network, the controller, for a modified version of the original toggle switch. The controller interface is made with emphasis on interoperability and applications in mind. Specifically, we use zinc finger repressors and degradation tags to reduce cross-talk and make the network more robust. Nine ZF transcription factors are computationally characterized and submitted to the registry. The interfacing controller and toggle switch are stochastically modeled to predict gene expression levels and are subjected to experimental testing.":::2011
