Toronto:::North America:::Canada:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Magnetasense:::"Magnetotactic bacteria use the Earth's magnetic field to guide them to favourable environments. This is known as magnetotaxis, and is achieved in these bacteria by creating uniformly shaped cubo-octahedral magnetite nanoparticles. Mms6 is a critical catalytic protein which binds to magnetite in order to facilitate the formation of an uniform crystal structure. Using the Mms6 gene from Magnetospirillium Magneticum AMB-1 we intend to create a magnetite synthesis pathway in E.Coli. Finally as a proof of concept, we will also show how we can use the formation of magnetite as a novel gene expression system. We intend to achieve this through the use a ToxR - Mms6 fusion protein and the ctx promoter from Vibrio cholerae. This novel gene expression system can be used to help bridge the gap between biological and digital systems.":::2011
