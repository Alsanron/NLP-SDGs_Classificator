Dundee:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Sphereactor - a synthetic bacterial microcompartment:::Bacterial microcompartments are proteinaceous reaction chambers designed to 'cage in' metabolic pathways and increase efficiency. Potentially, these could be engineered to house any chemical reaction imaginable; to sequester toxic material; or to confer new physical properties to a host. Here, a synthetic microcompartment ('The Sphereactor') was designed and built. This was assisted by the creation of new mobile apps and web-based tools for DNA analysis. A synthetic operon was constructed, based on the pduABJKNTU genes from Salmonella, that assembled into the empty Sphereactor, which was also affinity-tagged to allow its isolation for downstream applications. A new targeting sequence comprising 20 residues of PduD was shown to target GFP into The Sphereactor. Attempts were made to pack the Sphereactor with many other proteins. Together, the Sphereactor and its new targeting sequence is a foundational advance that could influence the design of new metabolic pathways or inspire new bioremediation or biomedical projects.:::2011
