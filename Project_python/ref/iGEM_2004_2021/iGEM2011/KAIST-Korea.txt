KAIST-Korea:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. Casso: Artistic E. Coli inspired by random color generation:::E. Casso is an E. coli system engineered to perform art. The system consists of two types of genetically modified E. coli: the random signal generating E. coli ('Brush E. coli') and the color generating E. coli ('Paint E. coli'). Brush E. coli possesses genes (lasI, luxI, rhlI, and cinI) in its gDNA that produce quorum molecules. On the other hand, by modified Cre-loxP mechanism, gDNA is randomly set to secrete only one of the four types of quorum molecules. Paint E.coli possesses plasmids that express one of four colors (red, cyan, yellow, and green) by producing fluorescent proteins in response to the type of quorum it receives from Brush E.coli. As Paint E.coli expresses corresponding fluorescence in response, it also produces quorum molecule that is identical to the inducer to start propagation. Ultimately, using this system, the 'random' contribution of cells will create art on an LB plate.:::2011
