Johns_Hopkins:::North America:::United States:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::VitaYeast: addressing malnutrition with synthetic vitamin production in baker's yeast:::While hunger is a major issue in developing nations, it is often a lack of specific nutrients rather than total calories that underlies specific health issues including infant mortality, birth defects, and blindness. To ameliorate worldwide malnutrition, we engineered baker's yeast to produce vitamins A and C. 'VitaYeast' can be used to bake bread without special equipment, training, orreagents. We designed our genetic constructs using state-of-the-art optimization techniques, simulations, and data from our parts characterization experiments. In order to realize this design, we developed an extensive yeast toolkit including promoters, UTRs, and vectors. We synthesized the violacein pathway, which, combined with our vitamins and intermediate metabolites, represent a new set of yeast reporters. Finally, to assess the potential of VitaYeast to combat hunger in the real world, we have sought IRB approval to distribute an extensive survey on attitudes toward genetic engineering of food world-wide.:::2011
