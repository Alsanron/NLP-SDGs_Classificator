KAIT_Japan:::Asia:::Japan:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Colony on Colony -Colony formation like layer cake-:::We tried to overlap colony on colony. Generally, colony and colony don't overlap and approach each other, because of the cell-cell communications. Bacterias also have a system, so called quorum sensing, to control of production of signal chemicals depend on the bacteriaâ€™s density. We pay attention quorum sensing system. Bacterias produce and secret autoinducer against other bacterias by quorum sensing system, as a result of the system, bacteria senses other bacterias. Most of Gram-negative bacterias make use of autoinducer named AHL. We applied E. coli to our experiment and we use aiia which is catabolic enzyme to inhibit AHL. We tried to make a recombinant bacteria to cancelled sensing of other bacterias and expected to form the colony of bacterias on the other bacterias.:::2011
