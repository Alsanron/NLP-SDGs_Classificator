Grinnell:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Exploiting the Secretion System of Environmental Caulobacter crescentus to Deliver Biofilm-inhibiting Proteins:::"Caulobacter crescentus is a non-pathogenic aquatic bacterium that can grow to high densities in low-nutrient environments. It has a robust Type I secretion system that secretes a single protein, RsaA. This is a surface layer protein that totals 10-12 percent of all of the protein in the cell. We created a toolbox of biobrick parts that enable this system to secrete any protein of interest when fused to the C-terminal secretion signal of RsaA. Because Caulobacter is cheap and easy to grow but cannot survive in a human host, it has the potential to be an efficient chassis for enzyme-based drug delivery. As a proof-of-concept, we engineered non-biofilm forming strains of Caulobacter to secrete two enzymes, Esp and DspB, which have been shown to degrade biofilms. We tested our strains and demonstrated that our recombinant enzymes are secreted and that they do inhibit Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation.":::2011
