Our experimental design is as follows: firstly, obtain a synthetic gene of nfsI with flanking prefix and suffix of standard Biobricks, and ligate this insert to pRbcBRL, a vector with appropriate expression and selection system for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and obtain pRbcnfsI. Then, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii will be transfected with the with the designed plasmid. The transfected algae will then be grown in presence of TNT and/or TNT derivatives and the effectiveness of nitroreductase activity on biological degradation of TNT will be investigated.":::2011
