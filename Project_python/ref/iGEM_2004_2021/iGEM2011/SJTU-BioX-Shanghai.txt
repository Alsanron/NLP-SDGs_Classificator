SJTU-BioX-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Codon Switch Controlling Protein Biosynthesis:::"SJTU-BioX-Shanghai iGEM team is designing a modulating device that achieves fine tuning of target protein biosynthesis (translation). The translation of the protein can be finely turned up/down with the control of the number of rare codons and the different strength of tRNA induction. Besides, our device can be made into a real switch that can be turned on/off without background protein expression in two ways. One is to use any codon but initial codons to initiate translation, the other is to use stop codon as the controlling element. Moreover, our design would be a brand-new way to selectively express part of a gene or introduce point mutations into target residues in proteins, thus favoring the study of the important domains or residues of a target protein.":::2011
