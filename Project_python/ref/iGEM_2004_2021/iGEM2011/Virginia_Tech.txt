Virginia_Tech:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Fluorescent Protein Characterization:::"Fluorescent proteins have become ubiquitous tools for studying cellular processes. To be particularly effective for these applications, fluorescent proteins must feature fast maturation and degradation rates, and these rates must be well-characterized and documented. The 2011 VT iGEM team has worked to find and characterize fluorescent proteins and degradation tags that more quickly degrade them. Here, we present chemical and mathematical models based on two parameters, maturation and degradation rates, and in doing so, we explored difficulties in the process of characterizing parts. In conducting our experimentation, we tested fluorescent proteins with different degradation tags in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using automated fluorescent microscopy techniques, and then worked to determine a comprehensive, accurate mathematical basis for fluorescent protein characterization.":::2011
