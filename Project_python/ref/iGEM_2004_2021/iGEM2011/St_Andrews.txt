Our kill switch is designed by inserting an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene into E. coli. The AMP in question is protegrin-1, an 18 amino acid residue. Protegrin-1â€™s secondary structure is a beta -sheet conformation including a b-hairpin turn, which allows it to imbed itself into the phospholipid bilayer and disrupt bacterial cell walls by creating pores within the membrane. The antimicrobial activity of protegrin-1, including the action of pore formation, provides us with a wealth of potential applications for this kill switch, including drug delivery, conjugation both in vivo and in vitro, and its use as a basic biosafety tool.:::2011
