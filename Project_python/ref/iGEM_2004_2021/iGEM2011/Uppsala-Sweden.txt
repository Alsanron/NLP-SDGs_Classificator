Uppsala-Sweden:::Europe:::Sweden:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Expand the colidroids into colorful light sensing:::"Regulation of gene expression by light-sensing is a milestone in synthetic biology. In this project we strive to upgrade the existing coliroid system by making it triple-chromatic. Our triple-chromatic coliroid system employs sensors for red light, green light and blue light in one and same platform. These sensors are to be activated both independently and together. This functions as a triple-switch of genetic regulation. In combination of switching the individual sensors on-and-off, one can achieve higher dimensions of transcriptional control. The proof of concept is shown by coupling each type of sensor with chromoproteins, proteins that naturally show color when expressed. Instead of visualization by e.g. UV light, our colidroid system can be visualized with naked eye. Other than a bacterial piece of art, our system will be very useful in the future concerning e.g. biomaterial.":::2011
