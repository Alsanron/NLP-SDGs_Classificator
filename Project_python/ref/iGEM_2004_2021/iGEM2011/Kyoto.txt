Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Creation of carnivorous bacterium which can catch and digest bugs:::Many unique bacteria have been created in iGEM. However, they are not so 'creatures', but new tools or machines. We try to make 'new' creature, carnivorous E.coli which can prey on insects when they are hungry. In poor availability of combined nitrogen, carnivorous E.coli emit light and attract bugs by using bioluciferase, then catch and digest them by mucilage and catabolic enzymes. To create carnivorous E.coli, we set up four sub-goals: hunger, luminescence, predation and digestion. In 'hunger', We measure activity of Ïƒ54 promoter with nitrogen regulatory protein, the activator. These promoter and protein enable E.coli to responce concentration of amino acids. We also check the response of fruit fry to light emitted by bioluciferase, and weather E.coli can catch and digest bugs with mucilage and protease in the other three sub-goals.:::2011
