MIT:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Towards Tissue Self-Assembly via Juxtacrine Signaling:::"Current medical practices are only able to scratch the surface of tissue engineering or organ development. Fortunately, nature has provided us with robust, cellular systems capable of governing the autonomous formation of complex structures. To pursue control of multicellular systems, we engineered a number of ligand-receptor signaling mechanisms: the Notch-Delta juxtacrine signaling pathway and an assortment of G-Protein Coupled Receptors. Both signaling systems were modified to activate orthogonal genetic circuits, allowing for processing and integration of numerous signals. In order to facilitate and maintain pattern formation, we introduced cadherin, a natural intercellular glue. To understand and predict multicellular behavior, we developed a simulation framework based on the Synthetic Biology Open Language and CompuCell 3D modeling environment. Our models motivated several circuit designs we subsequently tested in the laboratory. Altogether, our developments establish a paradigm for manipulation of intercellular communication systems to drive self-organization of tissues.":::2011
