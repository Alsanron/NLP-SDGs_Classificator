NYMU-Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Tailoring Your Avatar:::"Optogenetics, the latest neuroscientific method, has improved specificity for stimulating certain cell types of neurons, reversible bi-directional stimulation, and elevated spatiotemporal precision. However, to achieve neuronal network stimulation, light cables are still needed, leaving long-standing annoying issues regarding immune responses unresolved. This year NYMU-Taipei iGEM team creates wireless neuro-stimulator, focusing on achieving remote neuro-stimulation to minimize the invasion and damage to the neuron. To achieve this goal, we use a species of magnetic bacteria, Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. We have chosen mms13, a transmembrane protein as our target for protein design, as it serves as a linker between reception of wireless magnetic field and optogenetic neuro-stimulation output. Regarding the neuroimmune response, we choose three genes to achieve symbiosis within glial cell: MinC, a division inhibitor, INV, a gene for invasion and LLO, a gene for facilitated escape from phagosomes. Overall, our project will make optogenetic neuro-stimulation wireless and safe.":::2011
