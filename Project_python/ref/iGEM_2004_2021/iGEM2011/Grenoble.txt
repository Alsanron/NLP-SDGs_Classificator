Grenoble:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MercuroColi: A new way to quantify heavy metals.:::Our project aims at constructing an easy to use, transportable sensor capable of quantifying the concentration of mercury, in an aqueous sample. Our system is based on a comparison between an unknown mercury concentration and a known IPTG concentration. A linear IPTG gradient is present on a test-strip containing the engineered bacteria. When the mercury solution is added, the regulatory network will switch to one of two states depending on the IPTG/mercury ratio. Bacteria become either 'sender' or 'receiver'. The bacteria sensing a predominance of mercury over IPTG, the 'senders', will release a quorum sensing molecule which is detected by the nearby 'receivers'. The reception of quorum sensing molecules will induce the expression of a red dye in the 'receivers'. In this way, a red line emerges at a position in the IPTG gradient from which the unknown mercury concentration can be deduced.:::2011
