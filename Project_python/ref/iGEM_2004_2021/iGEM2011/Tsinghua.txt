Tsinghua:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. colimousine:::We aim at constructing an E. Coli strain that can transport target protein along the concentration gradient of a cue molecule back and forth, acting as a bus in the information processing network. We first conjugated domain of outer membrane protein A (OmpA) with SH3 domain which has high affinity for proline-rich motif. These two together would function as a binding vehicle directly sensing substrate in the media. Considering efficient and specific release from strong binding, HIV-protease site was incorporated into the binding cassette. Another bacteria strain expressing the protease would wait on the finish line to cut off target protein. Besides loading and unloading, we took advantage of 'tar' and 'tar*' receptor to manipulate E. Coli chemotaxis along aspartate and PAA concentration gradients and control the direction of the movement and binding and releasing with transcription factors.:::2011
