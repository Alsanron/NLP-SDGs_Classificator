VCU:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Production of Isoprenoids in Synechococcus: A model for sustainable manufacturing:::"Cyanobacteria, such as Synechococcus elongatus, are prokaryotic photoautotrophic model organisms, which are responsible for a large proportion of global photosynthesis. Our group endeavored to develop S. elongatus as an emergent platform for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. While Synechococcus elongatus has been used in previous synthetic biology projects, our group sought not only to characterize functional promoters, but also promoters capable of tailoring expression to circadian rhythms or transcriptional factors. Concurrently, our team experimented with fluorescent proteins to find a quick-folding, robust, and transient reporter that may be used to characterize dynamic parts (such as those involved in circadian rhythms). As proof of concept, the VCU iGEM team also aspired to integrate isoprenoid pathways into Synechococcus - isoprenoids being precursors of many commercially and pharmaceutically relevant molecules. By demonstrating production of these industrially important metabolites we hope to show the practicality of utilizing cyanobacteria as a superior sustainable production platform.":::2011
