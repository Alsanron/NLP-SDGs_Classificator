METU-BIN_Ankara:::Europe:::Turkey:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::M4B: Mining for Biobricks:::"Main goal of METU-BIN 2011 project is to provide a web based tool that helps synthetic biologists at the pre-experimental step to design their genetic constructs using the biobricks according to their input and output parameters. 1- A network of all bioparts in 2011 distribution will be generated, which describes the functional relations between the subatomic bioparts. 2- A search algorithm will be developed to reveal all possible device combinations for the user defined input and output within bioparts of 2011 distribution. 3- Visualization tools will be applied for graphical representaiton of the results. 4- A web-based user interface will be provided for the developed software. The functional relations of subatomic bioparts will be examined and each combination will be registered as one incidence. The most frequently used combinations will be given a priority while providing the possible device combinations as a list which satisfies the user defined requirements.":::2011
