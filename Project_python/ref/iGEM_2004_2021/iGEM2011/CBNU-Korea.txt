However, synthesizing genome is kind of tough way. So, we decide to synthesize minimal chromosome which consists of essential genes and has normal nature of normal chromosome such as self-replication, partition and control. For this project, we employed chromosome II of v.cholerae and used some genes about replication system(rctA, rctB and origin of chromosome II) and partition system(parA, parB and several parS sites) of chromosome II. Also, we are developing our own essential gene database and genome organization design software named 'GOD' that can solve design problem until unsolved. Both are based on pattern, arrangement and direction data of genes from DEG and NCBI with statistical analyzing.":::2011
