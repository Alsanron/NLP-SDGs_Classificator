Michigan:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DNA directed cell immobilization using outer membrane protein containing zinc finger domain:::"The ability of zinc finger domains to selectively bind specific double stranded DNA sequences have largely been applied intracellularly, such as in engineered zinc finger nucleases for genomic manipulations. Proteins containing zinc finger domains can also be used extracellularly to precisely adhere objects to surfaces containing bound oligonucleotides. This project aims to utilize the specificity of zinc finger protein to direct binding of Escherichia coli to oligonucleotides bound on surfaces. The fusion protein engineered to contain a fragment of the OmpA membrane domain and a zinc finger domain allows the protein to be expressed on the outside of the cell while remaining bound to the host cell. Possible applications of this project include creating patterns with fluorescently labeled cells or studying cell-cell interactions.":::2011
