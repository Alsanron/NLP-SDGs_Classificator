Debrecen_Hungary:::Europe:::Hungary:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Oilrig or nuclear hormone receptors: How to find lipids in the environment?:::"Nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) are ligand activated transcription factors. They are able to regulate the expression of their target genes by direct DNA-binding, in a ligand-dependent manner. NHRs bear high homology to each other and are modular into distinct regions: N-terminal regulatory region, DNA-binding domain, a Hinge region, Ligand binding domain (LBD) and a C-terminal region. Some Nematode NHRs can be activated by extracted oil contamination of the soil so they can use as possible oil sensors in the future. Zinc finger motifs are the tools of NHRs to bind DNA and regulate gene expression directly. These tiny elements can be tested as direct gene regulators. Controlled gene induction can also lead to programmed cell death which is a less harmful tool in order to quit non-functionable cells.":::2011
