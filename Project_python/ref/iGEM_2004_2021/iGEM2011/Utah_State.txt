Utah_State:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CyanoBricks: Expression Testing and Bioproduct Development:::"Building upon the CyanoBrick toolkit developed by the 2010 Utah State iGEM team, our project focuses on producing valuable bioproducts using Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Our project will attempt to produce three different bioproducts: fatty alcohols, wax esters, and alkanes/alkenes. In order to optimize expression levels of various gene products, we constructed a dual luciferase expression measurement device. We used this device to provide more detailed characterization of promoters and ribosome binding sites from E. coli and Synechocystis. We also produced a variety of useful intermediate parts for the dual luciferase device, which are currently not available through the registry, allowing this measurement system to be easily adapted to new organisms and new reference standards.":::2011
