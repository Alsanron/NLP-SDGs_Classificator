Glasgow:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DISColi: Bio-photolithography in Device Engineering Using Different Wavelengths of Light:::"The DISColi project aims to design and construct a novel bio-photolithographic system for the engineering of biofilms into functional 2D and 3D structures and devices in response to different patterns and wavelengths of light. In this project we worked with light responsive promoters, a novel biofilm-forming synthetic biology chassis, E. coli Nissle 1917, and novel biobricks including several designed for biofilm dispersal and fluorescent reporters with wider utility than GFP. The main aims of our project can be separated into three light-controlled components: the designed sculpting of biofilms; 3D printing for encapsulation of cells; and the controlled modular synthesis of a variety of products. We expect this technology to have applications for material synthesis and compound manufacture in remote locations, for example outer space.":::2011
