ICT-Mumbai:::Asia:::India:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SmartSoil: Rooting for Sustainable Agriculture:::Plants secrete many chemicals in the soil around their roots. These exudates can act as molecular signals for microorganisms in the rhizosphere, which can in turn modulate gene expression. We wish to exploit this natural phenomenon to engineer microorganisms to sense and respond to plants. A synthetic symbiotic association that helps plants grow better and resist diseases will reduce dependence on artificial fertilizers and pesticides. Toward this end, we are studying changes in gene expression in the common soil bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, in response to root exudates of rice, wheat, tomato and soybean plants. As a case study, we are constructing a genetic amplifier using an exudate-inducible promoter to produce phosphatase, which will help solubilize organic phosphate present in the soil. This represents an advance toward smart soil management practices and sustainable agriculture.:::2018
