SHPH-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::A new biological method to degrade biofilm.::: Our team finds that lactic acid produced by Lactobacillus delbruckii ND02 is an acid with considerable effect of biofilm degradation. In order to support Lactobacillus delbruckii for acid secretion, lysozyme is used to hydrolyze polysaccharides in the biofilm to smaller fragments of mono and disaccharides. Sequence that codes for lysozyme is combined with sequence of Lactobacillus breris that codes for S-layer protein signal peptide, which promotes the secretion of lysozyme. The combined sequence is then transferred to the acid producing Lactobacillus delbruckii for expression.With nutrients provided by hydrolyzed polysaccharides, Lactobacillus delbruckii secretes lactic acid that further degrades the biofilm. As the pH of the system gradually decreases, the ability of Lactobacillus delbruckii adhering to biofilm increases, In addition, hydrogen peroxide is secreted for sterilization when the pH drops below 3. This produces a positive feedback loop for biofilm degradation and its effect is expected to be significant.:::2018
