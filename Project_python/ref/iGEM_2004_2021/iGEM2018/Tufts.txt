Tufts:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hypothetical System for Sensing miRNA with High Specificity and Signal Amplification:::miRNA is a small DNA regulatory molecule found in the bloodstream. More recently, its significance as a biomarker for various diseases and conditions from bone microfracture to various cancers has been discovered. These conditions are specifically correlated to certain sequences of miRNA, which is found in low concentrations (6-16CT PCR thresholds). To detect the miRNA with high specificity and amplification, our team proposed a system in which a complimentary toehold RNA would be created upstream of the RNA sequence for cas13a, a modified version of cas9 which would cut RNA randomly, triggering a fluorescent signal amplification when in the presence of RNAse detection kits.:::2018
