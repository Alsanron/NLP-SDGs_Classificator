McGill:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synnotch and Tandem ScFv in Novel System Granting Multi-Specificity to Phagocytic Immune Cells in Cancer:::The Notch family of proteins are kinetically activated cell surface receptors found in eukaryotes which can be modified to form synthetic notch (SynNotch) receptors. Our team has designed a gene construct activated by SynNotch to produce a downstream product of choice. Through the transfection of immune cells with our SynNotch system and tandem ScFV’s antibodies specific for both SynNotch and a target of interest, one can target many different cancers with the same population of transfected cells. The system provides specificity to one population of cells through use of a single tandem ScFV, and multi-specificity through the use of multiple ScFV’s. The downstream product is modular and can be switched to activate cytokine signaling, cytotoxic granule release, and other important cellular events. This system shows great promise as a flexible, cost-effective immunotherapy with the potential to treat a wide variety of cancers.:::2018
