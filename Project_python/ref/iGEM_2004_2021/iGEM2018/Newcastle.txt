Newcastle:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Alternative Roots: Engineering Microbial Communities:::The demand for food, fuel and materials is placing unprecedented pressure on agricultural production. To secure higher productivity, the sector relies upon synthetic fertilisers derived from energy intensive manufacturing methods. Here, we propose an alternative approach to support plant productivity. The Alternative Roots project investigated Pseudomonas fluorescens as a chassis organism. Development of a plant-colonising chassis provides novel mechanisms for soil microbiome manipulation without genetically modified crops. As proof of concept, we focus on improving nitrogen supply via naringenin biosynthesis - a potential chemoattractant of free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Legal and social considerations of the project drove the development of NH-1, a low-cost, small-scale and programmable hydroponic system. Tailored to overcome experimental limitations faced by many plant scientists, NH-1 provides improved reproducibility, coupled with high-throughput experimentation. This system enabled exploration of future deployment techniques within contained environments that may result in enhanced, sustainable crop productivity at a local and accessible level.:::2018
