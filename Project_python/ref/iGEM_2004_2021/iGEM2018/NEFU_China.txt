NEFU_China:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Secured Message Transmission by Yeast: A multiple-level encrypted biosystem for information storage:::In the modern world, most people recognize computers as device to store information, but deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA can do better. However, living organisms can also provide a superior camouflage for secret messages. The aim of our project is to develop a yeast-based encrypted system to transmit information between two parties. We convert messages into DNA sequences using a designated program or code book and integrate them into yeast genome. To comprehend the message, the receiver needs to successfully pass through multiple levels of encryption, including cracking a promoter lock by a specific small RNA, reuniting dispersed DNA segments separated by introns, retrieving message nucleotides by a specific primer set and decoding DNA sequence into readable sentences by a unique program. Additionally, a build-in suicide system will prevent the engineered yeast from being extensively propagated.:::2018
