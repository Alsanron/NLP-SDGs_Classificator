UC_San_Diego:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Using unsupervised machine learning and synthetic biology to implement a novel, quantitative liquid biopsy test:::In order to address key bottlenecks in liquid biopsy and noninvasive cancer detection techniques, our team focused on using epigenetic determinants for diagnostic purposes. Presented here is a novel workflow for diagnosing cancer by using promoter methylation as an indicator of interest. Key promoter regions of interest are first identified via unsupervised machine learning applied to the Cancer Genome Atlas via our in silico predictive tool. After this, our specially-designed assay can detect the presence of these hypermethylated regions of interest and provide a quantitative, fluorescent readout in order to generate clinical insight. Special advances in material science and microfluidics are then used to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of our assay. The workflow is then completed via integration into a smartphone application that provides the necessary data and helps streamline doctor-patient communication. Our proof of concept was centered around hepatocellular carcinoma.:::2018
