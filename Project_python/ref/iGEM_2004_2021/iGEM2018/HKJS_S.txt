HKJS_S:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Carbon dioxide Reduction to Methane using Modified Nitrogenase with PET decomposition as Primary Carbon Source:::Poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) is a prevalent material which can is used in various applications, while bringing adverse effects to the environment. An enzyme, PETase, can degrade the highly-crystalized PET to mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), terephthalate and Bis(2-Hydroxyethyl) terephthalate. MHET is also further decomposed by MHETase to terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol (EG). EG can be further broken down in E. coli K-12 to produce carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide, however, is a notable greenhouse gas. Using the mutagenesis of the amino acid residues of nifD in nitrogenase, the substrate binding site can be modified so that carbon dioxide can undergo the multi-electron reduction to methane. We propose an efficient carbon dioxide reduction system with the decomposition of PET as the primary carbon source. PETase, MHETase, and amino acid substituted nitrogen fixation genes in MoFe nitrogenase will be expressed in a fast-growing bacterium, E. coli.:::2018
