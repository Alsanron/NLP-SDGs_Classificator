Cadmium (Cd) is one of the more commonly found metal contaminants and due to the highly toxic nature, even minute amounts can cause loss of function of the kidney and liver and loss of bone. We developed a rapid and efficient cadmium sensing and binding system that is capable of detecting cadmium down to 10 Î¼M concentrations. When exposed to a minimum concentration of Cd, the cell expresses the green fluorescent protein (GFP). After Cd is detected, a metallothionein protein binds it and sequesters it in the periplasmic space in the E. coli cell. We will present data characterizing the performance of this system. The engineered system can be used for remediation efforts to remove Cd from the environment and process it safely.:::2018
