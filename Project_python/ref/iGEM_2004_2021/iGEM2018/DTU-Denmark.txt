DTU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hyphae Hackers: Fungal building materials for extreme environments:::Colonization of uninhabitable areas, like Mars, will require building materials to be transported to the site of deployment. Transport limitations such as space and weight make this process very expensive. Based on these challenges, we propose to make building materials from fungal mycelium to be grown on site. Therefore, our project is focused on how to optimize the material properties of the fungi through engineering of basic fungal characteristics. Our initial studies identified Aspergillus oryzae as the best candidate chassis for material properties and ease of genetic engineering. Based on this, we transformed the melA gene from Rhizobium etli into A. oryzae in an effort to improve the UV radiation tolerance by establishing melanin production. Furthermore, we have designed a final geometric structure that can withstand external conditions and reduce the amount of work needed to assemble it.:::2018
