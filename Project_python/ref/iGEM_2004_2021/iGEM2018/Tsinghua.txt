Tsinghua:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NEON Coli - Wide-dynamic-range, fine-tuned quorum sensing positive feedback circuit:::A major goal of synthetic biology is to design functional analog gene circuits that are capable of signal integration and processing. Our project presents an improved wide-dynamic-range positive feedback circuit based on bacterial quorum sensing system. Preexisting positive feedback circuits suffer from leakage problems, and to solve this we add a CRISPRi system to keep the positive feedback loop in check. This design allows us to execute fine control on signal transduction and protein expression, in our test ststem the expression of sfGFP. In order to make our project more presentable, we use this circuit to design a fluorescent bacteriograph that is able to change the picture, like a bacterial neon light. However this is not the extent of the circuit's usefulness, as it may lead to new applications in synthetic biological computations, and projects that require fine control of gene expression.:::2018
