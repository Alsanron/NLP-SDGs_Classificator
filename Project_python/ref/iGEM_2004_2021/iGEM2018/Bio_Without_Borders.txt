Bio_Without_Borders:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Community Lab:::Accepted:::Blueblood:::Horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) blood is the basis for the LAL clotting test for endotoxins in injectable formulations. Harvesting crabs for this purpose has endangered this 350 million-year-old species. The first step in the cascade that characterizes the LAL test is activation of the protease Factor C by contact with endotoxins. We have devised a replacement for the LAL test using cloned Factor C and an artificial substrate consisting of a reporter fused to cellulose binding domain with the Factor C protease site connecting them. The substrate is bound to paper by the cellulose binding domain. When exposed to Factor C mixed with the injectable liquid formulation to be tested, the presence of endotoxins will activate the protease and the substrate will be cleaved, releasing the reporter. Our aim is to develop the most cost-effective and simple device possible so that it can be used by everyone.:::2018
