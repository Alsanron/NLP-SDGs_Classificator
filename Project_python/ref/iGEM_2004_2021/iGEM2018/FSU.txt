FSU:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Audiogenetics: Activating Bacteria with Sound:::QUESTION: Can sound be used to induce gene expression in E. coli? IMPACT: It is routine to use a small molecule to induce gene expression in cells. Can sound become a routine means to induce gene expression? The Human Practices Team revealed that success in using sound to induce gene expression in cells has the potential to impact the brewing industry and molecular biology research. A potential negative impact could be the activation of pathogenic cells with sound guns. RESULTS: We characterized promoters submitted by the 2008 UC Berkeley team that potentially could be activated by sound. In parallel, we selected additional promoters that also have the potential to be induced by sound. We tested the promoters in new genetic devices to evaluate if different sound frequencies and amplitudes correlated with increased gene expression. The results of the tests are available on the wiki and will be presented.:::2018
