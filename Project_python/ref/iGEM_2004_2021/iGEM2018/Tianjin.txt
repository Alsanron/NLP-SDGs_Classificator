Tianjin:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Life Tik Tok:::Organisms are adapted to the relentless cycles of day and night thanks to circadian clocks which regulate biological activities with ~24-hour rhythms. This year, we reconstruct KaiABC clock system in the bio-rhythm expression of yeast. This will not only perfect the experimental data of the template xenotransplantation, but also provide more reliable materials in regulating and exploring the oscillation. Correlated with the yeast two-hybrid technique, reporter genes help detect the results of our construction. To work as a powerful heterologous regulator, we investigate the regulatory mechanism of the clock through the systematic alteration of chromosome topology. And a novel application we envisioned was that S. cerevisiae can produce different products alternately under the periodic regulation day and night.:::2018
