NCKU_Tainan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::One step closer towards a low carbon society:::Ever since the 90s when concern over the impact of carbon emission on our environment was first raised, global-wide efforts in reducing emission have been met with mixed results. Just 2017 alone the global emission level grew by 1.4%. This year, the 2018 iGEM NCKU Tainan team will design a device capable of piping CO2 and convert it into biomass via integrating a non-native Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle into E. coli using the RuBisCO and PRK genes from Synechococcus sp, which encode for major enzymes involved in carbon fixation. Industrial gases will enter a pipe (inlet) at the bottom of a bioreactor, flow through a ceramic nozzle and mix with E. coli-containing mixture which also consumes CO2. “Of CO2urse” is an alternative to utilize excess CO2. Our ultimate goal is to convert CO2 into useful bioproducts. It would be one step closer towards a low carbon society.:::2018
