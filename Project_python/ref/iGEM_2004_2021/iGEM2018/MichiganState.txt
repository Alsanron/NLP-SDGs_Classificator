Endophyte club:::As climate change causes more drought and increased soil salinity, plants deal with more and more osmotic stress. To deal with this stress, plants produce ethylene. In environments with high soil salinity or drought, plants produce more ethylene, decreasing growth. To block the formation of ethylene, we converted its precursor, ACC, into Î±-ketobutyrate and ammonia, using ACC deaminase and microbial endophytes inside plant roots. This produces a useful tool for people throughout the world, where famine and drought make life difficult. Such science could prove helpful for the future, as studies predict food production must double by 2050 to feed the population.:::2018
