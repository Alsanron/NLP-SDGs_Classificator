BGU_Israel:::Europe:::Israel:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::OriginALS - Prolong ALS Patients Surival:::Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that leads to a progressive muscle wasting and paralysis due to damage in motor neurons. However, no efficient treatment exists. The BGU-IGEM team aims to develop a system that will ultimately prolong survival of ALS patients by targeting microglia and reactive astrocytes, which are both non-neuronal cells that directly contribute to motor neuronal damage. Our approach is based on: (1) inhibition of toxic pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion in microglia cells and (2) on promoting intrinsic apoptotic signal in reactive astrocytes and preventing their toxic effect on motor neurons. Using modified genome editing technique, we build a system that specifically target toxic astrocytes and prevent the formation of new ones which hopefully will slow down the progression of the disease. As the reactivity of microglia and astrocytes is a common in neurodegenerative diseases, our novel approach could be expanded to other neurodegenerative diseases.:::2018
