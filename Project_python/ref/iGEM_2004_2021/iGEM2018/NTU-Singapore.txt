NTU-Singapore:::Asia:::Singapore:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ModVision - A programmable nucleic acid modification and detection toolkit based on CRISPR/Cas systems:::Recently, different CRISPR/Cas systems have been engineered to perform base editing on both DNA and RNA. However, some critical shortcomings are hampering their applications. For example, these base editors are often too large to fit into common delivery vehicles. Additionally, no approach is available to enable fast screening of specific RNA modifications. To tackle the size issue, we developed novel compact Cas9 protein scaffolds that, when fused to deaminase domains, will be both small enough to fit into delivery vehicles and only exhibit sufficient editing activity for downstream therapeutic applications. With our human practice, similar efforts were made on analogous RNA modifications using the Cas13 protein family. To tackle the second issue, we aimed to directly detect nucleotide modifications in the transcriptome using nanopore sequencing. We synthesised and sequenced unmodified and modified RNAs with the nanopore sequencer to develop different machine learning models that reliably identify positions of base modifications.:::2018
