Tec-Chihuahua:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Production of antimicrobial peptides in Escherichia coli for Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius inhibition:::American and European Foulbrood are diseases that affect bee (Apis mellifera) larvae worldwide. In the last two years, 53 countries suffered from these diseases, 6 of them are among the top 10 honey producers. The causal agents of these ailments are gram-positive bacteria: Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius respectively. Nowadays, two techniques for the treatment of Foulbrood are used: antibiotics and incineration of hives. The former promotes the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria while the latter results unprofitable for beekeepers. Therefore, we propose the production of bee antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in Escherichia coli to treat P. larvae and M. plutonius infections. Defensin 1, abaecin, defensin 2, and apidaecin are each expressed in a different BL21 (DE3) culture. PelB leader peptide and a 6X His-tag foster adequate expression and further purification. Through mathematical modeling, the diffusivity of PLGA-nanoencapsulated apidaecin is evaluated for future in vivo delivery in the bee system.:::2018
