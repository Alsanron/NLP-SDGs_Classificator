UST_Beijing:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Natural RE-lease:::Our long-term goal is to improve the health-promoting effects of ginsenosides. We believe that sterols in the ginsenosides are responsible for their main benefits. Therefore in the past projects we engineered synthetic squalene cyclase for in situ production of ginseno-sterols in human cells; and produced synthetic β-glucosidase in E.coli for removal of sugar from ginsenosides. In the current strategy, in the wake of “No release” policy of iGEM community, we are able to by-pass synthetic biology methods to achieve our goal by applying in vitro chemical reactions.:::2018
