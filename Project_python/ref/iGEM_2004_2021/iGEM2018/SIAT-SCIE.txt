SIAT-SCIE:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::COPE：CRISPR/Cas9-OMV-signal Peptide Encapsulation technique mediated targeting of oncogene in Fusobacteria Nucleatum:::Outer Membrane Vesicles(OMVs) are a ubiquitous type of vehicles that continuously bud off from gram-negative bacteria’s outer membrane, serving as a communicative tool between bacteria. As natural kins to the bacterial membrane, they can preserve the integrity and bioactivity of sensitive Cas9 proteins and single guide RNA (sg-RNA) within, when used as a delivery tool. Our project aims to construct a system that uses OMVs as vectors for transporting the Cas9 protein and sgRNA into the host cells to achieve efficient muting of the virulent gene of interest in its genome. We expressed Cas9 and sgRNA together with a signal peptide enabling them to reach the bacteria’s periplasm to be encapsulated by OMVs. We expect this technique would reveal more flexible approaches in both in vitro and in vivo genetic engineering, thus enlarging the armamentarium of Synthetic Biology.:::2018
