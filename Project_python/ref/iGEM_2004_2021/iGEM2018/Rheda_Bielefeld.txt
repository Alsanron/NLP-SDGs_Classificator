Rheda_Bielefeld:::Europe:::Germany:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Interpoll-Scanning the air for pollen:::A great percentage of Earthâ€™s population is allergic to specific substances. Approximately 20 million people living in Germany are allergic to different plants, animals and much more, but about half of them are allergic to pollen. We want to help these people suffering from an allergy to pollen by advising them which dose of medicine is necessary for every day. Although there is already useful medicine, we are convinced that we can optimize the use of such medicine and reduce the exposure to unnecessary drugs which have negative side effects like lowering the personal performance capacity, becoming tired and many others. Therefore we use a DNA-based method using pectinase and cellulase to open the pollen and isolates their DNA. This DNA will be used for a PCR with specific primers against the birch allergen "Bet". By hereby identifying pollen we aim to measure the current pollen exposure in the air.:::2018
