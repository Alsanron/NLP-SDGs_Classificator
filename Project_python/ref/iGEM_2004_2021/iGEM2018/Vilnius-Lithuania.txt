Vilnius-Lithuania:::Europe:::Lithuania:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SynDrop - Synthetic Droplets for Membrane Protein Research:::Membrane proteins (MPs) are an essential part of major cellular processes and key targets for drug development. Since distinct obstacles, including cell-toxicity and irreversible aggregation in hydrophilic environment impede MP research, we employ microfluidics and bottom-up forward engineering approach to revolutionize it. Octanol-assisted liposome assembly is implemented for synthesis of monodisperse cell-sized liposomes. We encapsulate modified MP assembly machinery alongside cell-free protein synthesis system within liposomes with excellent efficiency. This system serves as overarching framework for effective synthesis, folding, and competent insertion into the membrane of active prone-to-aggregate membrane proteins. We offer a full-synthetic microfactory that, coupled with directed evolution, solves contemporary problems in MP engineering. Additionally, synthetic liposomes enable building artificial logic gates and signaling pathways to study metabolic cascades and protein interaction completely noise-free. Utilizing liposomes as simplified synthetic models of living cells, SynDrop will facilitate scientists to step into fully controlled synthetic era of membrane protein research.:::2018
