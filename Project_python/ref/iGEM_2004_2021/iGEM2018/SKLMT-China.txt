SKLMT-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Planet protect plan:::Pseudomonas fluorescence Pf-5 is kind of biocontrol bacteria which can be used in the environmental protection. Compared with E.coli, the developed organisms, the toolkit for Pseudomonas fluorescence seems hasn’t been exploited well. This year, SKLMT-China wants to construct a library of artificial constitutive promoters as a useful tool for the model-based fine-tuning of gene expression in Pseudomonas fluorescence. The strength of different promoters will be characterized by a reporter gene, firefly luciferase. Given that P. fluorescence pf-5 has a poor ability to degrade nicotine in the natural environment, we hope to engineer this bacteria with a nicotine degradation gene cluster (about 30Kb) from P.putida S16 by red/ET recombination technology. In this way, the nicotine degradation pathway in P. fluorescence pf-5 could be improved so it can degrade nicotine more efficiently. Combined with the promoter library, pf-5’s nicotine degradation efficiency can be easily controlled.:::2018
