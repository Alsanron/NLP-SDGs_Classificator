Imperial_College:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PixCell: Electronic Control of Biological Patterning:::Engineering complex biological systems requires precise control of gene expression. Current biological control systems fail to provide the reversible and programmable spatiotemporal control of electrical systems used in industry. Electrogenetics is an emerging field of synthetic biology investigating electronic detection and control of gene expression. Presented here is the development of the first aerobic electrogenetic control system in E. coli. It functions through altering transcriptional activation of the SoxR/PsoxS redox-signalling system by controlling the oxidation of redox-mediators using an electrode. The potential of this system for precise spatial control is demonstrated using an affordable, custom electrode array to induce pattern formation in a lawn of cells. Patterning was a necessary condition for the evolution of complex multicellular life, and as such the programmable patterning demonstrated serves as an essential tool for the development of multicellular synthetic biology.:::2018
