ASTWS-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Environment-friendly Copper Ion Sense and Treatment System:::With the continuous development of industrialization, the negative environmental effects caused by heavy metal pollution are becoming more and more significant. Owing to easy migration and difficult biodegradation, it poses more challenges to the treatment of heavy metals in the environment, especially in soil and water. In this study, we developed an engineered E. coli-based system to sensitively detect the copper concentration in industrial waste using synthetic biological methods. Meanwhile, we are trying to introduce a new gene to effectively capture copper ions in environment. If successful, this constructed biosystem could not only detect copper ions, but also enrich heavy metal pollutants (copper), form copper deposits and then purify the environment, which is portable, low-cost and environment-friendly.:::2018
