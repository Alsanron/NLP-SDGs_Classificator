Hawaii:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Delivering Transgenes to Corn Centromeres:::	Nature has provided a remarkable system to insert genes into functional centromeres of grass genomes. Specifically, centromeric retrotransposons (CR) have the unique ability to insert themselves into the centromere by targeting a yet unidentified docking agent. We plan to adapt this system to insert genes of interest into centromeres. Centromeres are advantageous transgene targets because they lack recombination, allowing the stacking of multiple traits. Retrotransposons, or “jumping genes,” self-replicate and package their genome into self-assembling virus-like particles (VLPs), then reinsert (or “jump”) themselves into a new chromosomal location. To measure the stability of VLPs for packaging molecular cargo, we cloned the full-length gene encoding the CR gag protein and successfully generated VLPs in vitro. We also tested the efficiency of different gene constructs in forming VLPs in vitro. Electron microscopy can confirm VLP assembly, however, we plan to develop a convenient fluorescent assay to assess VLP assembly.:::2018
