WPI_Worcester:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ICEberg (ISPs Combatting EPSs):::Approximately 48 million people contract a foodborne illness in the United States each year. Many of these outbreaks are linked to field crops contaminated with pathogenic bacteria. Inspired by the 2018 romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak in the United States and the work of the 2015 WPI iGEM team, we investigated methods to prevent biofilms of human pathogens on crops. We analyzed the antimicrobial properties of antifreeze proteins, also called ice structuring proteins (ISPs), and curcumin, a component of turmeric. The biofilms were measured by the amount extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) they produced using crystal violet binding assays. On lettuce leaves, biofilms were quantified by their colony forming units. We also constructed a gene gun, based off the 2016 Cambridge iGEM team's design, to transform lettuce leaves to express antifreeze proteins. In the future, we envision transgenic crops that produce antimicrobial proteins to protect themselves against colonization of human pathogens.:::2018
