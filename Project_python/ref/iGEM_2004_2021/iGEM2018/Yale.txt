Yale:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering a synthetic bacterial co-culture to degrade and metabolize PET plastics:::Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a polymer used to make plastic products ranging from synthetic fibers to water bottles. Large amounts of PET end up accumulating in the environment as pollution. A bacterium named Ideonella sakaiensis was found to degrade PET by using two enzymes, PETase and MHETase, to break PET into two monomers: ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TPA). However, I. sakaiensisâ€™ inability to breakdown PET on a practical time scale undermines its usefulness in eliminating PET pollution. Our project aimed to tackle PET pollution by engineering a synthetic Escherichia coli and Aceintobacter baylyi co-culture to degrade and metabolize PET. Since both E. coli and A. baylyi are more characterized than I. sakaiensis and also capable of high-throughput mutagenesis, PET degradation and metabolism pathways in an engineered synthetic E. coli and A. baylyi co-culture potentially could be optimized to be more efficient than those natively found in I. sakaiensis.:::2018
