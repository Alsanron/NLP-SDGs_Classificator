Calgary:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Snip, Equip, Flip: Towards a Safer Gene Therapy:::The ideal medicine is not a perfect treatment - it's a cure. Gene therapy, by correcting the genetic basis of disease, may represent humanity's best chance to develop such ultimate health solutions. Despite its unbounded potential, gene therapy is constrained by safety concerns surrounding existing gene transfer technologies. Highlighting a path forward, the 2018 Calgary team has developed a targeted gene integration strategy that leverages CRISPR knock-in, FLP recombinase vector integration and beta-resolvase backbone excision. Extending the integration strategy, the team tested chromatin-modifying elements to reduce variability in therapeutic gene regulation, built a droplet microfluidic device for a scalable gene transfer system, and developed a search tool to help iGEMers find past teams' software. As an extensible platform, the strategy promises greater reproducibility for transgenic research and industrial applications. As a vision for the future, the approach represents a shift away from legacy technologies and towards a safer gene therapy.:::2018
