SCUT_ChinaB:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Plastic Killer - Engineered corynebacterium glutamicum that degrade plastics:::In recent years, the problem of plastic pollution has attracted more and more attention because of its huge amount and ubiquity. Meanwhile, traditional PET treatment methods have problems such as high cost, insufficient degradation, and secondary pollution. Therefore, we have constructed an engineering strain that can degrade PET and convert it into a carbon source. We are going to use Corynebacterium glutamicum in our project which is a food-grade microorganism that is commonly used in the industrial production of foods and amino acids. Our bacteria will firstly degrade PET to p-Phthalic acid(TPA) and Ethylene glycol(EG). Secondly, they will catalyze the TPA to protocatechuatePCA and finally to PDC, which can participate in TCA cycle to provide energy for cell growth and development. All in all, our engineered bacteria have the advantage of effectively degrading PET at a lower cost without secondary pollution.:::2018
