CU-Boulder:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Antibody Switch:::Biologic based therapies have become a promising field in cancer medicine due to their ability to harness the immune system to attack cancer cells. However, a potential side-effect of these therapies is an overactive immune system which can lead to severe reactions and possibly death. A solution to this overactive autoimmune attack would be to engineer and implement a safety switch into the system. This would allow for more aggressive monoclonal antibody therapies to be used while limiting the hazards of potential severe side-effects of current therapies.:::2018
