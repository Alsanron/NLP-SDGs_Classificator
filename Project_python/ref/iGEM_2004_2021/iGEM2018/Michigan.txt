Michigan:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CRISPR Testing Model: Competitive Binding:::The Cas9 enzyme has seen a rapid expansion of applications in the field of gene therapy. However, CRISPR’s high frequency of off site targets can lead to undesired mutations, making it imperative that accuracy and efficiency be improved to be successful. Since modifications to minimize off-site targets are under development, it is important that there is a standardized model available on which these modifications and their binding patterns can be tested and compared. We designed a testing platform for comparing engineered Cas9 variants to the natural form through direct competition. Our model relies on competition between two Cas9s from Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus as a proof of concept in an assay termed “Guardian/Assassin”. This system can be used to expedite the design process of Cas9 systems and expand the Cas9 toolbox by allowing faster identification of efficiency within IGEM and throughout the scientific community.:::2018
