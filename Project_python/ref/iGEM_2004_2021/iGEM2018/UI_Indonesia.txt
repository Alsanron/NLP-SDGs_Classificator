UI_Indonesia:::Asia:::Indonesia:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Finding Diphthy: Utilization of LuxAB-eYFP Resonance Energy Transfer System to Detect Diphtheria Toxin:::Diphtheria is an infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, marked by pseudomembrane in posterior pharynx, potentially leading to respiratory tract occlusion and death. Recently, there has been diphtheria outbreak affecting major provinces in Indonesia. We realize the urgency of fast, reliable, and cheap early detection method for diphtheria infection to overcome this issue. Therefore, we plan to combine Escherichia coli Tar chemotaxis receptor with human heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) receptor so the bacteria can detect diphtheria toxin. In addition, we will combine CheA and CheY in E. coli chemotaxis pathway with LuxAB and eYFP, respectively. When in contact, LuxAB and eYFP will create resonance energy transfer system. Without diphtheria toxin, CheA will interact with CheY and thus LuxAB-eYFP energy resonance will happen, resulting in yellow color. With toxin presence, CheA will not interact with CheY and energy resonance will not happen, resulting in blue color (i.e. LuxAB native color).:::2018
