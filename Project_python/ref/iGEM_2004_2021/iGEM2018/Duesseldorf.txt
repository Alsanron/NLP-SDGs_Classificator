Duesseldorf:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational:::Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Trinity - towards an engineered co-culture toolbox:::Co-cultures are found in all conceivable entities, such as the human gut, cheese or plants, but good tools to study those communities are currently not given. Indeed we created a modularly built toolbox using not only three different dependencies but also three different organisms: With Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Synechococcus elongatus our team engineered a system based on nutrient exchange. Here phosphate is provided through oxidation of phosphite, nitrogen source produced by melamine breakdown, whilst carbon source is provided by Synechococcus elongatus. Two additional independent approaches are designed, too. The first includes regulation via cross-feeding by amino acid auxotrophies and production: lysine by Escherichia coli and leucine by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The other utilizes regulated self-lysis via quorum sensing molecules, to control cell density by a phage lysis gene. This engineered toolbox opens a wide range of possibilities to create microbial communities for different purposes, such as synthetic probiotics.:::2018
