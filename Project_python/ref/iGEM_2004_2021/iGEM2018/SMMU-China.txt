We designed a targeting device, CaRTIN (Cardiomyocyte RyR2 Targeting Intra-Nanobody), to implement RyR2-specific inhibition of phosphorylation. Here, one of the isolated RyR2 nanobodies, AR185, inhibiting RyR2 phosphorylation in an in vitro assay was then chosen for further investigation. We investigated the potential of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-9-mediated cardiac expression of AR185 to combat post-ischemic heart failure. Adeno-associated viral gene delivery elevated AR185 protein expression in rat heart, and this administration normalized the contractile dysfunction of the failing myocardium in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, CaRTIN therapy to failing cardiomyocytes reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak, restoring the diminished intracellular Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ load and reversed the phosphorylation of RyR2. To achieve controlled intra-nanobody release, a BNP promoter based platform was also accessed. Our results established a role of CaRTIN as a promising therapeutic approach for heart failure.:::2018
