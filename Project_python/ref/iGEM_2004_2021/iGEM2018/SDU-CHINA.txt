SDU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MetaboLight: Light-controlled Redirection of Metabolic Flux:::In engineering Escherichia coli cell factories, conflicts exist between engineered and endogenous pathways for their competition for metabolite precursors. E.g., the production of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) inevitably consumes Acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle for cell growth. Given cell mass is a key factor of yield, precise switching from growth phase to production phase is significant. Previous studies utilized chemical inducers which are subject to irreversibility & toxic effects. In this project, we addressed these problems by introducing light in E. coli transcriptional control. A switch redirecting metabolic flux from growth to PHB production was built using a green light responsive CcaS/CcaR two-component system and a Type I-E CRISPR-Cas System. Upon green light illumination, the gene cluster phbCAD is transcribed to initiate PHB synthesis. A crRNA is transcribed simultaneously and binds a deactivated cas3 (mimicking dcas9) to block the expression of gltA, an essential gene in TCA cycle and cell growth.:::2018
