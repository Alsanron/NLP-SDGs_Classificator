NTHU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Open:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Equivibrium::: The Vibrio-related infection of the aquatic animal leads to inestimable financial damage for aquaculture in Taiwan. Our goal is to design a regulatory system to replace the usage of antibiotics. Our engineered E. coli will detect AHL secreted by Vibrio and will trigger E. coli a to produce a peptide which can kill Vibrio. The killing genes are regulated by the STAR system, and we would like to let the system satisfy the succession model. Moreover, to verify our experiment, we design a bioreactor which is low-cost and is a real-time O.D. measuring device. It can track two engineered germs at the same time. Last but not least, because the current Vibrio detection methods are time-consuming, we aim to create a high-specificity Vibrio detecting device which collects the water sample automatically and periodically. And it would warn fisherman timely if the concentration beyond the standard value.:::2018
