Grenoble-Alpes:::Europe:::France:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::“Phagyzer” : a fully automated detection device in the superbugs era.:::Bacteriophages are viruses that kill specifically, and with a relative efficiency, strains from a bacterial species. They are thus a viable alternative to antibiotics that our fully automated device aims to promote. Our project is designed to: identify a pathogenic bacterium; detect if this bacterium presents an antibiotic resistance marker; select the most effective phages for a therapy. As a proof of concept, we targeted Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, a bacterium causing opportunistic lung infections in immunosuppressed patient. We created DNA probes targeting a housekeeping gene and an antibiotic marker of PAO1. In parallel we automated the different processes required for detection with DNA probes: from the DNA extraction after lysis to a fluorescence measurement via a bacterial transformation. Hence, untrained healthcare professionals will eventually be able to take a sample from a patient, run it through our system, wait for a few hours and get information to decide of a therapy.:::2018
