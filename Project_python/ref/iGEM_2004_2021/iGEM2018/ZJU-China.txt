ZJU-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Detector – A Framework of Multi-enzyme Assembly:::Injuries–resulting from traffic collisions, drowning, falls or burns - and violence - from acts of war–kill more than 5 million people worldwide annually and cause harm to millions more. A waste of prehospital time led to high mortality. In response to these situations, ZJU-China developed A Detector for point-of-care testing (POCT), a manufacturing platform for other biosensors. Developers can assemble customized enzymes with Tag/Catcher labels in the expected order and immobilize them on a biocompatible matrix of curli fibers. In traumatic shock detecting, a triple-enzyme complex is constructed and performs as a logic gate to integrate two clinical parameters on molecular level. The result is exported through redox reaction on electrodes. Besides, in silicon machine learning is used to build a bridge between real clinical data and currents in our design. In brief, we propose an innovative new application by introducing A Detector, a Tag-Enzyme-Catcher assembly for fast response.:::2018
