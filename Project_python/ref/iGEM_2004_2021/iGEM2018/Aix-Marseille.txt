Aix-Marseille:::Europe:::France:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Breaking bugs:::An alternative weaponry must be found to replace the harmful and expensive traditional insecticides, that are now nearly useless against bed bugs. In fact, they developed multiple resistance mechanisms (exoskeleton thickening and enhanced metabolic pathways). The breaking bugs project aims to provide a human-friendly, and efficient solution to eliminate bed bugs. The plan is to elaborate an attractive lethal trap. We will use biosynthesized pheromones as a chemical lure to attract the bugs into the trap and infect them with Beauveria bassiana (an entomopathogenic fungus), causing a fatal epidemic. We produced several types of pheromones in E. coli and are running tests to create the optimal pheromone cocktail. We have worked on producing several enzymes and adding adjuvants to improve the killing efficiency and speed of the fungus. We had nationwide advertising of our project and obtained an indisputable validation from the public for our engagement in fighting bed bugs.:::2018
