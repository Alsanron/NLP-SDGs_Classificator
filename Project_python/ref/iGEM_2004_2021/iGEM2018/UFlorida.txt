UFlorida:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering Probiotic Escherichia Coli Nissle 1917 for Buytrate Production:::Escherichia coli 1917 is a clinically approved therapy for various forms of inflammatory bowel disease. In order to apply synthetic biology approaches to potentially augment the probiotic and therapeutic potential of this bacterial strain, we decided to introduce a heterologous butyrate producing pathway into the bacteria. We decided to delete several genome genes involved in producing metabolites that drain carbon and reducing equivalents from theoretical butyrate production in a redox - balanced manner. Then, we synthesized two gblocks in order to assemble them together to form a biobrick encoding 5 enzymes involved in butyrate production. We also tested the function of past iGEM teams that have unsuccessfully attempted to produce butyrate. Our approach to metabolic engineering of E. Coli Nissle 1917 involved both genome editing and biobrick assembly, both of which are necessary to turn this strain into a therapuetic butyrate cell factory in the gut.:::2018
