JMU_Wuerzburg:::Europe:::Germany:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Test Tonic â€“ a rapid diagnostic device for malaria:::Malaria affects 200 million people every year as reported by the WHO. This disease is caused by different Plasmodium species, leading to different types of malaria. Therefore a successful therapy for malaria requires rapid identification of the species affecting the patient. We engineered Test Tonic, a qPCR-based diagnostic device, capable for detecting Plasmodium DNA. Test Tonic can not only detect Plasmodium in general but also uses our specifically engineered and optimized primer/probe pairs for the identification of individual Plasmodium species. As a low resource alternative to qPCR we investigate Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) for our Malaria diagnosis system. Providing isothermal DNA amplification, RPA avoids the need of an expensive thermocycler. These benefits of a quick, economically priced, easy to use and portable malaria test make Test Tonic suitable for the application in traveling situations and in areas without proper infrastructure and energy supply.:::2018
