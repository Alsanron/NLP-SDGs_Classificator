BJRS_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::OxygenMAX:::Previous work have shown that the expression of bacterial Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) can help bacteria utilize oxygen more efficiently. However, the bacterial cell membrane makes eﬃcient hemoglobin-oxygen contact a challenge. Based on this, our team designed a VHb surface display system to express VHb on the outermost shell of the bacteria to raise the hemoglobin-oxygen contacting efficiency. Consequently，this could help bacteria tolerate the low oxygen environment better. We named this system OxygenMAX system. Basically, our OxygenMAX system can be applied to industrial fermentation to raise the high-cell-density growth of the engineering bacteria in bioreactors. Also, allowing for the better growth ability of the OxygenMAX system carried bacteria, our system can help avoid contamination with miscellaneous bacteria in industrial fermentation. Moreover, our OxygenMAX system can be applied to other low-oxygen engineering bacteria working condition like biosensor in intestinal tract, water or soil.:::2018
