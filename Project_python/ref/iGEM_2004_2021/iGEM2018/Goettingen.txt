Goettingen:::Europe:::Germany:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Glyphosate on my plate?! Detection and inactivation of Glyphosate using the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis:::Feeding the steadily growing world population is a major agricultural task that heavily relies on the utilization of herbicides. Glyphosate is the prominent example for a total-herbicide, as its usage rate is ever increasing since its introduction in 1974, making it the most-used herbicide in the USA today. Glyphosate has a bad reputation as it is thought to be harmful to human health. We want to improve the knowledge of the influence of glyphosate on the physiology of a model organism. For this purpose, we aim to engineer the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis for the detection and degradation of glyphosate. So far, we have isolated B. subtilis variants tolerating high amounts of glyphosate. Currently, these strains are used to develop and characterize a glyphosate detection system, which is based on fluorescently labeled bacteria. We also plan to engineer the bacteria for glyphosate inactivation using the glyphosate N-acetyl-transferase.:::2018
