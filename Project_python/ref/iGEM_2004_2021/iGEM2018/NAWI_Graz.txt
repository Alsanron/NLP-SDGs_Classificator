NAWI_Graz:::Europe:::Austria:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. coLipid - The good kind of fat!:::In the last decades, the palm oil industry increased on an extreme level and, because of great demand, it still does. The main products from the palm plant, palm oil and palm kernel oil, are not dispensable in todayÂ´s society. Because of their characteristic properties, they are widely used in food-, material-, beauty- and fuel industry. Palm kernel oil mainly consists out of saturated fatty acids, with Lauric acid (C12) as main component. This unique lipid pattern mainly differs from the palm oil itself. The aim of our project: We are working on a way to produce palm kernel oil using microorganisms, especially E.coli.The production of fatty acids and their esterification to triglycerides as energy storage is a natural process in all organisms. We make use of this natural way of synthesis by modifying the expression of fatty acids with appropriate carbohydrate chain length on a molecular level.:::2018
