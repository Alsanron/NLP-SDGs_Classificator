Makerere_University:::Africa:::Uganda:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Plastic biodegradation:::Plastics are waste products that pollutes the environment we live in more especially clogging the sewage system in urban centers and toxins from decomposed plastics are introduced into ecological systems that humans often manipulate for food. A biological approach to resolving this problem is favorable because of its practicality and efficiency. Ideonella sakaiensis is a bacteria that naturally decomposes polyethylene terephthalate, we have decided to genetically modify E. coli cells to model the plastic degradation process by adding the Lipase and Chlorogenate Esterase genes from Ideonella sakaiensis into E. coli bacterial cells.:::2018
