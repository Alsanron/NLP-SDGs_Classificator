UMaryland:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PETNET: A scalable solution for plastic bioremediation:::Explosive worldwide increase in plastic production has led to extensive pollution from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) despite ambitious recycling efforts. PETNET uses several advances to address this issue. The recently discovered PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis is attached to a cellulose binding domain to increase PET degrading potential. The degrading efficiency of this protein is amplified with the integrated hardware featuring a cellulose-lined, modular flow reactor. The enzymatic activity of PETase is accelerated when immobilized near flowing PET substrate via interaction of linked CBD with the reactorâ€™s cellulose scaffold, allowing for feasible real-time PET degradation. Quantitation of PET degradation is accomplished with an evolved protocatechuate biosensor sensitive to micromolar concentrations of PET degradation byproduct. This approach circumvents the need for expensive instrumentation for the downstream detection of PET degradation. PETNET is a comprehensive approach to PET degradation that will offer a scalable platform for society to address the overwhelming accumulation of plastic.:::2018
