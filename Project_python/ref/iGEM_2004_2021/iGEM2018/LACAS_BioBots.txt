LACAS_BioBots:::Asia:::Pakistan:::High School:::High School:::Accepted::: :::Inside the closed shell of Pinctada Fucata, a complex biomaterial nacre is produced when an irritant enters the shell. It serves as an immune response to seal of the irritant; and in the process layers of Nacre are produced, consequently forming what we commonly call a pearl. Nacre consists of two fundamental components: the organic matrix (95%), and the inorganic matrix of calcium carbonate (5%). We aim to mimic this process in the lab by using ureolytic processes to precipitate Calcium Carbonate, assisted by deposition of an organic protein layer to fulfill the composite structure of Nacre:::2018
