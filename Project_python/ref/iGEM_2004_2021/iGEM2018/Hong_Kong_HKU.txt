Hong_Kong_HKU:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::In vivo synthesis of therapeutic DNA nanostructures:::DNA nanotechnology has been evolving fast in the past few decades and has found various new applications in biomedicine. Currently, most functional DNA nanostructures are assembled in vitro, using chemically synthesized custom oligonucleotides. Our project aims to harness the synthetic ability of bacteria to accelerate the production of functional DNA nanostructures. Multiple DNA nanostructures with aptamers and strand-displacement toeholds were designed for breast cancer therapy. We characterized their actions in vitro and evaluated their therapeutic effects on human breast cancer cell line. To synthesize these DNA nanostructures, a reverse transcription system consisting of three plasmids was designed to operate inside E. coli. By demonstrating a simple and scalable biological production method of functional DNA nanostructures, we made a foundational advance in synthetic biology.:::2018
