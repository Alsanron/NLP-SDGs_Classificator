UNebraska-Lincoln:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Improving Early Detection of the Emerald Ash Borer:::The emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, is an invasive species native to Asia that first appeared in the United States in 2002. It has since spread to four Canadian provinces and thirty-five U.S. states, including Nebraska. The infestation is currently monitored with detection traps baited with the green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenol, which has been documented as an unreliable lure. The more effective bait, Phoebe oil and its most bioactive constituent 7-epi-sesquithujene, are commercially unavailable. Our team seeks to meet this challenge by building a bacterial cell factory to synthesize 7-epi-sesquithujene. We first introduced the mevalonate-dependent pathway into E. coli to enable the accumulation of the key biosynthetic precursor, farnesyl pyrophosphate. The maize terpene synthase gene tps4-B73 was then expressed in the engineered host. Accumulation of the target molecule by the constructed strain was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Future research will focus on product quantification and purification.:::2018
