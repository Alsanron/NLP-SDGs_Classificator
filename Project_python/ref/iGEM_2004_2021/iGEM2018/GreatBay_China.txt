It has a common precursor, nepetalactol, with other plant-derived compounds of great therapeutic value, such as vincristine (an anti-cancer drug). We aim to synthesize nepetalactol through the co-culture of E. coli and yeast where E. coli generates the intermediate geraniol, and yeast continue to convert geraniol to nepetalactol. Endogenous genes in yeast are deleted to reduce shunt products. Besides, we design, characterize, and use a library of transcription activator-like effectors (TALE) stabilized promoter to regulate the heterologous gene expression in E. coli. Our applied design conceives the future application of nepetalactone on stray cat control, which we consider as an opportunity for public engagement and education.:::2018
