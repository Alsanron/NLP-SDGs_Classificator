As our proposed solution, we are investigating the production of polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate (PHBV) by looking not only at using industrial co-products as substrate but also improving downstream processing. PHBV and other polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are thermoplastics that can be designed with bespoke physical properties based on their relative compositions. By introducing heterologous genes (phaCAB) from Cupriavidus necator, we engineered recombinant Escherichia coli to produce PHBV using co-products from local whisky distilleries. Furthermore, we have designed a secretion system to reduce costs associated with current extraction methods. To complement this, we are developing not only in silico metabolic models for optimized polymer synthesis but also macro-scale models to assess the environmental and economic impact of these products in their life cycles.:::2018
