Beerstoneâ€™s high insolubility results in the need for highly corrosive chemicals such as nitric and phosphoric acids, combined with intense physical scrubbing for its removal. Oxalobacter formigenes is a human gut bacterium which solely metabolizes oxalate using enzymes Formyl-Coenzyme A Transferase (FRC) and Oxalyl-Coenzyme A Decarboxylase (OXC). Oxalate is taken into the cell by an oxalate-formate antiporter (OxIT), and following its metabolism, formate is exported from the cell by OxIT. We have investigated engineering E. coli and S. cerevisiae with these genes in order to characterize their activity and feasibility for use in an industrial setting. Tests included heterologous production of FRC and OXC in E. coli to characterize their activity against calcium oxalate, and modifying S. cerevisiae to utilize calcium oxalate using OxIT, FRC and OXC during the brewing process to prevent beerstone buildup.:::2018
