Ruia-Mumbai:::Asia:::India:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Catechewing Coli: The Paan Stain Redemption:::Indiscriminate spitting of red-colored catechu (Paan-) based products is a common practice in India. Paan stains tarnish public places and historical monuments in the country. Although a considerable amount of resources are invested in cleaning these stubborn red-stains, existing methods are ineffective in removing them. Our team designed a dual-component ecologically contained system that will remove these stains more efficiently. The first module employs a four-enzyme system that breaks down the stains into non-toxic byproducts in a targeted manner. The second module interfaces with this degradation system to trigger the destruction of the systemâ€™s DNA from the environment as a safety measure after the stain-fighting enzymes have been produced. Given the enormity of this social issue, we take a holistic approach to actively engage our community and learn from industry experts, users, cleaners, and policy makers how to effectively remove existing stains as well as prevent new ones.:::2018
