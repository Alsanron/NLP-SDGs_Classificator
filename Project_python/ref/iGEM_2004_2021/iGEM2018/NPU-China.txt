NPU-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Design and Synthesis of the Minimal Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mitochondrial Genome::: Mitochondria harbor relatively independent genome, the uniqueness of which enables S.cerevisiae to be widely used in the study of mitochondrial loss and relevant diseases. The mitochondrial genome size varies prodigiously between different yeasts, positively correlated with the size of intergenic regions and introns. This year, we boldly try to design and synthesize a minimal S. cerevisiae mitochondrial genome from scratch (39k). We employed bioinformatics algorithms to analyze the function and conservation of various parts of the original mitochondrial genome, providing a criterion for determining the non-essential sequences that could be deleted. The complexity of the mitochondrial genome sequence, low GC content and the existence of local GC clusters make it difficult to synthesize the genome, which was solved by specialised separation, parameter optimization, etc. This genome will be transferred into S. cerevisiae cells that have lost mitochondria genome, verify their function, feed back the result and optimize our original design.:::2018
