USTC:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Make TW Beneficial:::In China, tobacco industry is under government's control. To prevent some people from illegally making cigarettes with TWs (tobacco wastes), especially small pieces of tobacco, TWs are all recycled to dispose. The usual way of TWâ€™s disposal is to burn, which produces pollution like CO, and nicotine in TW will spread in the air, causing huge waste. Faced with the phenomenon that nicotine in TW is difficult to use, we propose our project to make nicotine in TW beneficial by degrading nicotine to valuable chemicals. We use 3 enzymes: NicA2, PNAO, SAPD to convert nicotine to 3-succinoyl-pyridine, a valuable medicine. And then, we design a nicotine biosensor, combined with LuxR-AHL-lux pR system to activate expression of the degradation enzymes. Furthermore, to lower the harm of Secondhand Smoke, we devise our hardware using bacterial cellulose to absorb nicotine in air for recycling. We believe our project will make TW beneficial!:::2018
