Thessaloniki:::Europe:::Greece:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Galene: A genetic toolbox for controlled gene expression:::Biological systems are unpredictable, noisy and difficult to maintain stable even under standardized conditions, thus making controlled gene expression difficult. Combined with the fickleness and stochasticity associated with genetic circuitry, fluctuations in the production rate of a desired protein are inevitable. Through model-driven design, we engineer systems which guarantee constant gene expression, decoupled from gene/plasmid copy number, that can be induced to meet the desired expression level. We implement a Type I incoherent feedforward loop in E. coli cells to stabilize promoters using TAL Effectors, CRISPRi and cis-acting sRNA repressors that regulate a downstream attenuator. Furthermore, to render our system versatile, we introduce a theophylline riboswitch that allows on-the-fly control of stabilized protein production. We provide a foundational advance tool that enables fine tuning of complex metabolic pathways, functionality improvement of logic gates and suppression of fluctuations in gene expression.:::2018
