Warwick:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Safe Water:::Safe water is a global issue. Our team provides solutions to biological, organic and inorganic problems facing polluted water. Biological: The Legionella genus of Bacteria causes disease in humans. We utilise a never before seen regulation system to identify and respond to pathogenic RNA. Organic: Toxic oestrogen concentrations induce sex reversal in fish; the inability for breeding due to lack of males results in population decline. We have artificially tweaked and transferred a recently discovered enzyme pathway into E.Coli which reduces oestrogen toxicity. Inorganic: Lead contamination is responsible for serious health problems. We have designed a system through which lead can be isolated and removed via gas vesicles in Bacillus.:::2018
