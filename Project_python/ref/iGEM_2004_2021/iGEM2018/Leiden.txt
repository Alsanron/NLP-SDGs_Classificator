Leiden:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Fifty Shades of Stress: A colourful screening platform for detecting bacterial cell stress:::The number of drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria is rising at an alarming rate, while no new classes of antibiotics have been discovered in the past three decades. We tackle this twofold problem using an innovative open-source screening platform and an extensive societal outreach program aimed at spreading awareness of antimicrobial resistance. Current drug discovery efforts suffer from tunnel vision: screening is limited to lethal compounds. Our project aims to enable rapid discovery of compounds that stress bacterial cells, which can be used to establish novel synergistic combination therapies. Such combination therapies have proven to reduce resistance development in HIV and cancer treatments. In our project, we created an E. coli reporter strain that produces fluorescent proteins in response to distinct classes of cellular stress, by utilising promoters which become activated under specific stressful conditions. This specificity allows for determination of the mechanism of action and for establishment of synergistic combination therapies.:::2018
