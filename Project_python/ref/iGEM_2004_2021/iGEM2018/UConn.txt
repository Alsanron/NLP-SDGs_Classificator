UConn:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biological Alkane Synthesis through Shuttled Electron Transport:::BASSET aims to engineer E. coli to produce biofuel (short-chained alkanes) in a microbial electrosynthesis (MES) system. For this year, BASSET produces alkanes from fatty acyl-ACPs. This aim is achieved by heterologous expression of Pmt1231 (from Prochlorococcus marinus) and Acr (from Clostridium acetobutylicum), overexpression of the endogenous FadK and a mutant TesA. The engineered organism is tailored for future use in a MES. In the MES, E. coli will accept electrons from an external source (for example, off-peak excess of solar energy). This energy will power the biosynthesis pathway by producing reducing equivalents such as NADH or NADPH in the cell.:::2018
