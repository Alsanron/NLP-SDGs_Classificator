NEU_China_A:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineered bacteria alleviate the inflammatory bowel disease and prevent colorectal cancer:::Nowadays, due to the popularity of fast food and unhealthy life style, the number of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is rising in Asia. In addition, patients with IBD have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, NEU_China_A aims to design a biological system against IBD and potential CRC this year. To relieve the intestinal inflammation, we empowered our bacteria with an anti-inflammatory device, which includes a sensor to detect the inflammatory signal, a highly efficient enhancer and an effector to secrete interleukin ten (IL-10). Furthermore, we engineered our bacteria with myrosinase to turn the glucosinolates, a natural component of cruciferous vegetables, to sulphoraphane. It’s an organic molecule with well-known anti-cancer activity. Integrating cruciferous vegetable diet with synthetic biology, we envision that the engineered bacteria will greatly help us to overcome the severe situation in the IBD patient’s gut.:::2018
