KCL_UK:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Developing a novel tool to overcome antibiotic resistance by regulating gene expression in bacteria:::Antibiotic resistance is a major concern worldwide, estimated to cause 1 death every 4 minutes. Antibiotics for fatal infections such as tuberculosis and pneumonia have become less effective due to bacterial resistance to drug-based treatments. This phenomenon has led pharmaceutical companies to develop new antibiotics to try overcome this problem. However, this is costly and contributes to the emergence of multi-resistant bacterial strains. Throughout the years bacteria have developed mechanisms to resist antibiotics such as DNA mutagenesis, cell wall modification and other; most involve various bacterial proteins that have been modified or repurposed to protect bacteria. It has been shown that down-regulating these proteinsâ€™ expression helps maximise the effects of antibiotics. Therefore, our team aim to engineer a library of sRNAs, providing a platform for new tools to regulate gene expression. Our approach therefore synergises with current antibiotic treatment regimes, creating an innovative therapeutic tool.:::2018
