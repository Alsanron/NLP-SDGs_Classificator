Jilin_China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The collection of synthetic RNA-based thermosensors with different sensing temperatures::: Many strategies could be used by bacteria to coordinate temperature-dependent gene expression. A well-known class of biological temperature sensitive element is RNA-based thermosensor, which is thermoregulatory RNA sequence in the 5'-untranslated region of mRNAs. RNA thermosensors could induce equilibrium shift between closed and open conformations of the translation initiation region under temperature variation condition, and lead to mRNA degradation or ribosome accessibility, thereby controlling the efficiency of translation initiation. However, natural RNA-based thermosensors are difficult to be engineered with the narrow sensing temperature range. Therefore, this year based on free-energy method, we designed a series of synthetic RNA-based thermosensors, which can be engineered easily with broader sensing range. Then, we predicted their theoretical sensing temperature, detected the practical threshold by experimenting setting temperature gradient, and built the standard parts collection.:::2018
