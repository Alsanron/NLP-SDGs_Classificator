Lethbridge_HS:::North America:::Canada:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Cu Later: The Capture and Removal of Metal Ions from Solution Using Phage Capsid Display:::Tailings ponds enclose 176 square kilometers of oil extraction waste in Alberta. They pose a serious issue, as they contain toxic products such as heavy metals that negatively affect the environment. Due to the difficulty of its separation, the potentially useful metals present in these tailings ponds are rendered useless. However, our system of bacteria and bacteriophage demonstrates a possible solution. The target metal being copper, we will use a copper-binding protein on bacteriophage capsids to bind the copper. Then, elastin-like polymers attached between the copper binding proteins and the capsid proteins will be used for inducible precipitation, bringing the metals to the bottom of the solution and allowing them to be repurposed. Cu Later is an innovative project by turning the waste in oil sands into opportunity, in addition to cleaning up the environment.:::2018
