WLC-Milwaukee:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Ec-Sense:::Fresh water is an increasingly valuable resource in our world where the needs of a burgeoning population are complicated by rapid urbanization. Water contamination and a lack of water security affects millions of people worldwide every year, especially in at risk communities, resulting in illness and transmission of deadly parasites. Unfortunately, ensuring water safety is expensive and time consuming with few testing options available. The WLC-Milwaukee iGEM team has been continuing past work to develop a simple, accurate, and fast test kit for E. coli providing consumers the tools they need to ensure water safety. We have been working with proteins from Lambda phage known to bind the outer membrane protein, LamB, of E. coli conjugated to HRP. This protein-enzyme conjugate binds E.coli and when a colorimetric substrate is used, an easy to read visual signal indicates the presence of E. coli and fecal coliform contamination.:::2018
