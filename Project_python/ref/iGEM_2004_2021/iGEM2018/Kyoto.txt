Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Swallomyces cerevisiae ~Building a biological desalination system~::: The conformation, kinetics, and binding of macromolecules are highly sensitive to the ion environment so we must control it to succeed biological research. Thus, there is demand of ionic control tool which supports bio-sensing and bio-remediation for research usage. So we addressed to develop such a biological deionization tool. This year we focused on Na+ which is basic ion in biology, and desalination system can be realized by salvaging Na+ in solution as paste of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by applying two attributes. One is highly Na+ uptake of their plasma membrane and vacuolar by transfer of transporters. The other is surface interaction aggregation system using SdrG-FgÎ² protein connection through surface display. In addition, we calculate initial amount of our yeast to adjust to desired concentration by reconstructive membrane transport mathematical model. Furthermore, this tool can be applied to bioremediation and expanded to other ions.:::2018
