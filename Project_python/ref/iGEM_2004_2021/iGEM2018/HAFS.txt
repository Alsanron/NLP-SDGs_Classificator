HAFS:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Minicell-based oral delivery of Insulin:::Type 1 and 2 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM, T2DM) are caused by inappropriate insulin production. The former results from the lack of ÃŸ cell, while the later results from insulin resistance. In order to treat T1DM as well as severe cases of T2DM, patients should be injected with insulin analog multiple times a day. Because these analogues are readily degraded upon oral intake, the only method of injecting insulin analog is via invasive methods. We aimed to develop minicell-based insulin delivery system that can be orally administered. Minicells are achromosomal cells that do not reproduce. Overexpression of FtsZ gene in Escherichia coli induces abnormal cell division that produces minicells. Through gibson assembly, we have engineered the minicell that produce single chain insulin associated with cell penetrating peptide that facilitates cellular intake. The cells lyses in response to bile salt, which leads to targeted secretion of insulin in intestine.:::2018
