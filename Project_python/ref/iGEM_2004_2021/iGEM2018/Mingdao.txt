Mingdao:::Asia:::Taiwan:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Blood Pathogen Test for a Mosquito Bite:::Bloodborne and mosquito-borne diseases are common among humans. They are caused by pathogens in the blood such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, dengue viruses, HIV, etc. To detect these pathogens in the human bodies is difficult in areas with lacking resources such as healthcare workers and lab equipment. Whatâ€™s more, patients infected with diseases like HIV may not be willing to let others to know. Therefore, a simple and self diagnostic device would greatly appeal to them. Team Mingdao is working on engineered mosquitoes to become a biosensor and blood drawer. We successfully demonstrated the experiment in the mosquito cells with the synthetic Toll signaling through antimicrobial peptide (AMP) reporter system to response the pathogens. Finally, to make this project to be usable in real life, we designed a portable mosquito cage as the size of a matchbox for use at home even without any professional instruction.:::2018
