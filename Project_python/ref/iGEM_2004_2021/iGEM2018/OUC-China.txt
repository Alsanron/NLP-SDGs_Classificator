OUC-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::miniToe Family- A Controllable Toolkit Based on Csy4:::This year, we design a toolkit focused on post-transcriptional regulation, which is composed of a RNA endoribonuclease (Csy4) and a RNA module named miniToe. Csy4 (Csy6f), a member of CRISPR family, recognizes a specific 22nt hairpin. The RNA module was constructed by inserting the 22nt Csy4 recognition site between a RBS and cis-repressive RNA element, which can be specifically cleaved upon Csy4 expression, so the RBS is usually masked. Cleaved at the specific recognition site, it can release the masked RBS, thus endowing the programming of gene expression in the translation level with higher feasibility. We want to use one system to achieve diverse expression of target gene. So we further design four Csy4 mutants and five miniToe mutants. The whole system including five Csy4s and six miniToes is called miniToe family. By combining each Csy4 and hairpin, we can achieve different expression level of the target proteins in a polycistron.:::2018
