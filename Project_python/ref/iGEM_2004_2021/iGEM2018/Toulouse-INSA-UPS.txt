Toulouse-INSA-UPS:::Europe:::France:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cerberus : Creating Endless Possibilities with Cellulose:::Cellulose is broadly used in medicine, textile and stationery. However, functionalising cellulose could lead to exciting innovative material developments such as conductive paper or self-disinfecting bandages. Here, we designed a versatile linker protein to enable the fixation of a wide range of organic and inorganic molecules on cellulose. Since the design is based on the fusion of three fixating protein heads, we named it Cerberus, like the mythological dog. The first head is a protein domain of the type 3 Carbohydrate Binding Module family to bind cellulose. The second is a streptavidin domain, with high affinity for biotinylated compounds. The last head features an unnatural amino acid, azidophenylalanine, allowing click chemistry to form covalent bonds. Each head has been assessed and cellulose with new functions has been produced. This work combines synthetic biology, chemistry and molecular modelling and paves the way to a revolution in our use of cellulose-sourced materials.:::2018
