We are working with T.A.S.A., exporter of anchovy fish meal to detect, accumulate, and isolate mercury (Hg) from their fish meal product. Our first construct contains a Hg accumulator and Green Fluorescence protein (GFP) to detect and accumulate the Hg. The second construct, with delayed expressed of a Killer Red (KR) protein, will kill the bacteria in response to light. We aim to characterize the delayed expression of the KR protein under three different RBSs using unique constructs. The construct enabling delayed expression of the KR protein will be coupled with GFP/accumulator construct. We are building the GFP/accumulator construct using overlapping PCR. Finally, we are designing and creating a container optimizing the efficiency of detection and removal of Hg from fish meal.:::2018
