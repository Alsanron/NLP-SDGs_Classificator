UCL:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SETA - Silk Engineered Technology & Applications:::Revolutions in synthetic biology are driven by effective and universal standardisations, which the biomaterial industry has not had… yet. Inspired by the idea of engineering modularity, we investigated an innovative technology that allows for more efficient and high-throughput manufacturing of environmentally-friendly biomaterials. We devised a plug-and-play framework using intein splicing to aid in both the polymerisation and functionalisation of biomaterials with a range of applications. Due to its durability, biodegradability, and kevlar-like strength, we opted for spider silk as a model to test our proposed system. While developing our platform, we conceived a BioBrick-compatible standard with improved flexibility that enables the integration of conventional cloning methods into iGEM’s workflow. Our split-intein system provides the manufacturing industry a modular and accessible polymerisation approach that can foster the next generation of biomaterials.:::2018
