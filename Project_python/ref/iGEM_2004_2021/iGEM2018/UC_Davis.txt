UC_Davis:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cenozoic:::Our project aims to develop mammalian-based biosensors for use in the context of environmental toxicology. Specifically, out biosensors have been designed to co-opt the mammalian cellâ€™s intrinsic stress response pathways and use these to trigger the production of a fluorescent reporter. We hypothesize that a device reporting on the activation of cell stress pathways will provide more physiologically and health-relevant information about the potential toxins present in an environment than bioassays which seek to simply measure the compound presence and/or abundance. That is, our bioassay asks not whether a compound is there, but rather whether compounds exist that may pose a health hazard. Our biosensors use mammalian-derived promoters of genes known to be activated in response to stress-inducing environmental pollutants. These promoters are coupled to a reporter gene (eGFP) and used in in vitro assays to report on the presence of compounds that elicit cell stress.:::2018
