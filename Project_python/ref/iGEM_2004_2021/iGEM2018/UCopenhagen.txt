UCopenhagen:::Europe:::Denmark:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PharMARSy: A novel system combining protein production and purification - keeping astronauts on mars healthy:::Long-term space travel and colonization of Mars will require on-site production of pharmaceutical proteins to treat diseases, but current methods require expensive and bulky equipment. PharMARSy will develop a novel portable system that combines protein production and purification in a single step. To achieve this, we will hijack the bacterial type-3-secretion system (T3SS) that injects signal-tagged proteins through cell membranes. By constructing a device with two chambers separated by a membrane we direct our T3SS-bearing bacteria to inject target-proteins through the membrane and into a collection chamber. This method will separate the pure recombinant protein from the producing organism, facilitating purification. We will establish proof-of-concept using membranes in the form of liposomes, lipid-bilayers, onion cells and egg yolk. Furthermore, the two-chambered device will be 3D-printed. Our project will be developed further by integrating feedback from experts in space exploration, pharmaceuticals and bio-safety.:::2018
