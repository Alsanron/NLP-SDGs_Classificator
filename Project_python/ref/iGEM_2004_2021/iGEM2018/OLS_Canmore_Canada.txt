Looking for a solution, the OLS SynBio team discovered that the issue is not the recycling of plastic, but instead the inefficient sorting of plastics. The project uses synthetic biology to create a novel fusion protein that can specifically bio-tag polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, so it can be sorted and recycled correctly. The project involves two proteins, PET hydrolase (PETase) and a hydrophobin called BsIA, that are produced via a bacterial chassis called Bacillus subtilis. The PETase enzyme binds to PET and is fused to a red fluorescent protein called mCherry, visually indicating when the adhesion occurs. The hydrophobin is “water-fearing” and will help to bind the PETase to PET plastic. So far, transformations of Bacillus subtilis using the construct have been successful, and real-world applications of the project look promising.:::2018
