SJTU-BioX-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ECHO: E.coli for Colon Health Observation:::Colorectal cancer being a severe illness worldwide, its mortality rises along with diagnosis delay. As a result, an accurate method for early diagnosis is in desperate need. Therefore, this year our team comes up with an engineered E.coli used for early, non-invasive detection of colorectal cancer. Due to the combination with ultrasound technique, we name it, ECHO. When our device arrives at the colorectal area after capsule degradation, it stabilizes on cancerated tissue through antigen-peptide binding, meanwhile expressing gas vesicles in vivo, enabling the rapid detection and location of the cancer foci using ultrasound. Besides usage on detection, ECHO also synthesizes azurin used to eliminate cancer cells after being triggered by environmental factors in cancerated area. At last, after ultrasound detection and medicine synthesis, arabinose will be consumed to trigger self-destruction pathway. To sum up, our device introduces an applicable and innovative non-invasive technique in early diagnosis of colorectal cancer.:::2018
