TecCEM:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Novel Treatment: Tissue regeneration in burns by recombinant proteins with nanodelivering on a MiniSkin Simulator:::The percentage of the mexican population that can afford a treatment for second degree burn injuries is low since they demand a large spend when treated. Representing the third cause of infant mortality in Mexico, it stands for an urgent issue to assess. This project approaches such problematique with the design of a multi-glycopeptide scaffold and the recombinant growth factor Leptin B to induce fibroblast proliferation. Nanoencapsulation was employed to ensure proper delivery and distribution. Growth measurements were evaluated through cell image analysis and lactate dehydrogenase activity as an indirect indicator, obtained from the culture medium in the MiniSkin Simulator, which is a hardware to test molecules in a 3D culture. This system could enhance tissue regeneration, minimizing infection risks and treatment lapses for affected patients with second degree burns.:::2018
