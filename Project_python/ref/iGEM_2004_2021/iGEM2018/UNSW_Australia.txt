UNSW_Australia:::Asia:::Australia:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Covalent attachment of enzymes to a self-assembling protein scaffold for substrate channelling:::Metabolic engineering aims to produce complex high-value compounds for industry from simpler and cheaper substrates by enhancing rates of reaction. The rates of metabolic reactions can be greatly enhanced by substrate channelling, which spatially brings together the enzymes of a multi-step reaction, increasing the effective concentration of metabolic intermediates. We have designed a novel protein scaffold that specifically and covalently co-localises enzymes in a modular system. Our ‘Assemblase’ system consists of a heterohexameric complex of a highly thermostable and chemical resistant archaeal protein, prefoldin, which has been engineered to recruit enzymes using covalent protein-protein interactions. The design is being tested with a two step enzyme pathway to produce the horticultural plant hormone, indole 3-acetic acid, from tryptophan. We propose that the Assemblase system could be used for accelerating the production of pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals, bioremediation and as a foundational research tool.:::2018
