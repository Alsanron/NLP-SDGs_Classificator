Navarra_BG:::Europe:::Spain:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::BioGalaxy: a project to produce plant biofactories for an extra-terrestrial future:::In this project we propose to develop a simple and cost-effective plant-based method for production and purification of recombinant proteins. The system is based on the production of plants transiently expressing a target protein (TP) fused to granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS). Tissues of GBSS:TP expressing plants will be milled in an aqueous buffer and the starch granules will be purified from plant tissue-derived impurities through a series of simple centrifugation and wash/elution steps allowing the starch granules to precipitate in a highly purified form. The GBSS:TP will be engineered to contain a unique cleavage site recognized by a specific protease, enabling the TP to be separated from the GBSS into the aqueous buffer, while the GBSS remains embedded the starch granule. Once treated with the protease, the starch granules will be removed by centrifugation while the highly purified cleaved TP can be further purified using conventional downstream processing.:::2018
