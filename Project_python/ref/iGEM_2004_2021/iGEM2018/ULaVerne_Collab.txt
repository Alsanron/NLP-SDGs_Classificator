ULaVerne_Collab:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Bio-Solution to Plastic Pollution!:::Every year, 8 million tons of plastic enter the ocean and can devastate the oceanâ€™s ecosystem. Many of these plastics are broken down into very small pieces called microfibers which are more harmful because they can be consumed by many organisms and negatively affect their health. Although the exact path from land to ocean is still unclear, we aim to remove the plastics from the wastewater level where plastic particles are known to accumulate. To eliminate these plastic particles from wastewater, we tested modified PETase enzyme that contains a unique catalytic site. To model our system, we aim to use a zero-energy requiring RAM pump design to hold our microbes and properly circulate the plastics and degrade them so plastic-free water can be released from the treatment plants and into the environment without any harm coming to the aquatic ecosystems.:::2018
