VIT_Vellore:::Asia:::India:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Toggle pH: Engineered micro workers for ocean pH homeostasis:::Increase in industrialization has led to an overall increase in Carbon Footprint, the major component of which is Carbon Dioxide, leading to global warming. Among other ill effects of industrialization, the one that has garnered a lot of attention is what we call Ocean Acidification also known as "the other CO2 problem". Increasing acidity is directly linked to having potentially harmful consequences for marine organisms, such as depressing metabolic rates and immune responses in some organisms, and causing the worst cases of coral bleaching. In order to tackle these problems our engineered microbe jumps in. This engineered E. coli will interact with it's surrounding environment to utilize protons whose levels regulate activation of certain pH-sensitive promoters. Along with promoters, specific repressor protein-operator binding regulates gene expression so that the transporter proteins are expressed which shuffle bicarbonates, carbonates and protons in and out of cells that bring about pH homeostasis.:::2018
