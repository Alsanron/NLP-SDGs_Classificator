ECUST:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering microbial method to solve the problem of blockage corrosion caused by bacteria:::The global cost of blocking and corrosion in cooling towers is estimated to be several billion dollars each year, which mainly results from the colonization of microbes. The microbes cause the formation of corroded objections and biofilm, directly leading to severe blocking. In this year, ECUST iGEM is trying to solve the problem by synthetic biology, presenting a totally new idea. By constructing engineered Escherichia coli, we design an integrated gene circuit which assembles sensing, cleaning rust, eliminating biofilm and killing iron bacteria. The microbes in pipelines will firstly be sensed through quorum sensing, then two key substances will be secreted to clear rust and biofilm respectively. When this method achieves the certain effect, the expression of antimicrobial peptides and autolysins will be triggered to kill the bacteria without adhesion ability, basically preventing the pipelines from being blocked again.:::2018
