CCA-San_Diego:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::HORIZON: Regulated Systems for Crude Oil Degradation, Coupled with Biohydrogen Production:::Oil fuels our modern world, but unrefined oil contains carcinogenic compounds known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs and Petrogenic PAHs can inflict lasting damage to entire ecosystems. Horizon harnesses the natural ability of microorganisms to degrade PAHs to catabolize them into nontoxic substances. Horizon then reuses the catabolic end products which can be metabolized by bacteria to produce clean energy by coupling the degradation pathways with sequences that upregulate hydrogen synthesis within E.Coli. Horizon also uses synthetic pathways to metabolize long n-chained hydrocarbons to fuel such hydrogen synthesis. These engineered E.Coli systems are then implemented in a bioreactor system optimized for bioremediation and capable of modulating between conditions for degradation and synthesis. To regulate the oil degradation and hydrogen synthesis pathways inexpensively, Horizon characterizes riboswitches and novel synthetic CRISPRi operators under riboswitch regulation. Ultimately, Horizon provides a comprehensive system for oil degradation and clean energy fuel production.:::2018
