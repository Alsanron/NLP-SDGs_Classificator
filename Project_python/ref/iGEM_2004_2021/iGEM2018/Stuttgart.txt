Stuttgart:::Europe:::Germany:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Anti Germ Coating - TAGC:::To stop the spreading of germs in public places is an issue everyone can agree on its usefulness. Our team aims to produce an antimicrobial surface coating which tackles this problem. This coating, called “The Anti Germ Coating”, TAGC, consists of a chitosan matrix, coupled with rhamnolipid and nisin. All of these substances have shown antimicrobial properties in previous studies. During the iGEM competition we produced two BioBricks until this day, one for nisin-production and one for chitosan production. A third BioBrick, which should enable rhamnolipid production is currently under construction. Two approaches of coupling are used to generate our coating. The first method uses a surface-accessible tyrosine to couple a modified nisin to chitosan enzymatically. Chemical linkage of rhamnolipid is achieved by using divinyl adipate, which acts as a cross-linker. Antimicrobial properties of the coating are currently investigated. First results seem to be very promising.:::2018
