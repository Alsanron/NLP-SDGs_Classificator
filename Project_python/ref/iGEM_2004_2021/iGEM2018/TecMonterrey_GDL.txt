Although there are several therapeutic strategies available, treatments targeting the gut-brain axis are gaining importance due to the strong relationship between alterations in the microbiota, systemic inflammation, and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, we aimed to develop a novel approach for the treatment and prevention of depression and anxiety. For this, we will genetically engineer a strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus to detect increases in the levels of stress in the body. This psychobiotic, which we have termed “Lactobachill”, will secrete soluble receptors (i.e., sgp130 and a mutated variant of sgp80) that could selectively inhibit the aberrant trans-signaling pathway of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. We will also characterize the efficiency of secretion of these receptors, which will be coupled to bacterial signal peptides from Sec-dependent pathways. We envision that Lactobachill could be used as an adjunct to current treatments against anxiety and depression.:::2018
