Nottingham:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Clostridium dTox:::Clostridium difficile infections are the primary cause of healthcare associated diarrhea, with hypervirulent outbreaks becoming increasingly common across the globe. It is predicted that $6.3 billion is spent annually on treating C. difficile in the U.S alone. Patients who have undergone treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics are at a high risk of being infected by this opportunistic pathogen, because their native gut flora is more likely to exist in a dysbiotic state. Our project aims to engineer a lysogenic bacteriophage with genetic constructs that will suppress the toxin production in C. difficile. We will use two different strategies to achieve this: an antisense RNA system capable of inhibiting translation of toxin transcripts, and a dead Cas9 mechanism to impede transcription of the toxin genes. Ultimately, we intend to produce a novel phage therapy capable of reducing toxigenicity of resident C. difficile without affecting native gastrointestinal microbiota.:::2018
