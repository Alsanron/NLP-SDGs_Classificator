Edinburgh_UG:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Maxed OOT:::Release of the living prokaryotic chassis used in synthetic biology outside of laboratory conditions can cause unforeseeable damage to the environment and the ecosystems present there. However, the inability to release synthetic biology inhibits its usefulness, and limits its potential in solving global and localised problems. At team Maxed OOT we believe we have the solution… Maxicells! Maxicells are achromosomal E. coli cells that cannot replicate. Maxicells remain metabolically active following the loss of their chromosome and express genes given to them on an ‘instructor plasmid’. In our project we analyse the most efficient methods for maxicell production, quantify their active metabolic timeframe, and characterise them as a biosensor. Additionally, we present our triple lock system for preventing horizontal gene transfer. The resulting novel chassis could re-contextualise many previous Synthetic Biology projects and open doors for the field as a whole.:::2018
