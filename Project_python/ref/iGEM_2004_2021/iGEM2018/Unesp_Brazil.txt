Unesp_Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hope: a framework to engineer living therapeutics:::Treatment of metabolic disorders often relies on pills and uncomfortable injections. Genetically engineered probiotics have the power to revolutionize drug delivery in a non-invasive way, by acting as living therapeutics in the human gut. To take this novel approach to its fullest potential, we designed a robust framework to engineer living therapeutics. Our framework provides an interchangeable and adaptable system to secrete and deliver a therapeutic polypeptide in response to an environmental signal, and a light-responsive biocontainment module based on the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery. Moreover, we designed and constructed a low-cost bioreactor system to simulate the human gut microbiome and validate our engineered probiotic. As proof of concept, we engineered a probiotic to treat type 1 diabetes that secretes insulin in response to glucose. Our framework aims to offer an easy, modular, robust and open-source solution to engineer and validate designer probiotics, bringing new hope to patients suffering from metabolic disorders.:::2018
