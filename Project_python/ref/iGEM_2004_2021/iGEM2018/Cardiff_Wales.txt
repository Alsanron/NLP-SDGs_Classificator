Cardiff_Wales:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RNAphid - an effective RNAi pesticide against Myzus persciae, expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana:::Aphids are crop pests globally. They feed on a massive diversity of crops and can cause tremendous economic loss for farmers by reducing crop yields and grain sizes. They damage crops directly by feeding on plant vasculature, draining essential compounds, or indirectly, as hosts of a variety of plant viruses. Current agricultural practice is to use chemical pesticides, which are unfavourable due to off-target effects, harmfulness to humans, and developing resistance of aphids. Consequently, our team has attempted to produce an effective RNAi pesticide against Myzus persicae, the most economically detrimental aphid pest worldwide. In the vasculature of Nicotiana benthamiana, we express siRNAs that affect aphid bacteriocytes, cells that enable the survival of their essential symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola. We target genes BCR3 and SP3 to do this. Finally, we expand the limited PhytoBrick registry, with several plant promoters and reporter genes.:::2018
