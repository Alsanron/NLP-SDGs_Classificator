Bulgaria:::Europe:::Bulgaria:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The 65 CRISPRoses Story:::We aim to create a CRISPR-based DNA diagnostics system that could be used for the detection of the most frequent mutations leading to cystic fibrosis. This genetic condition is considered to be the most common rare disease in Bulgaria. In most cases, the patient is initially misdiagnosed when sweat chloride level is used as an indicator. Our system relies on CRISPRâ€™s ability to recognize specific sequences. We plan on using different read-outs, our first idea being site-specific DNA cleavage if a cystic fibrosis associated mutation is present. Another approach would be a pair of dCas9 proteins, linked to split halves of a reporter molecule that restores its activity if the target sequence is identified. Not only could our system be applied in big healthcare facilities, but also in many small town hospitals, since it does not require expensive and sophisticated equipment, for instance DNA sequencing devices.:::2018
