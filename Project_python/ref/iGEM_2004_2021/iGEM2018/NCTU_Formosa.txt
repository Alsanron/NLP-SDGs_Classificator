NCTU_Formosa:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Plan(t) B:::Soil bacteria distribution is skewed by chemical fertilizers. These elements temporarily increase nutrients; however, they promote excessive growth of certain bacteria, such as phosphate solubilizing bacteria, damaging soil integrity. We developed a regulation system to manipulate soil microbiota, using bacteriocins as bio-stimulants to maintain nutrient levels while balancing bacterial ratios. First, we determine ideal levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium for plant growth. After determining a volume of fertilizer, we use a nutrient-to-microbiota model that relates element levels to bacteria amounts to determine the distribution of bacteria after fertilization. We use our bacteriocin-effect-model to predict an ideal bacteriocin volume. A correlation model relates inhibition to changes in bacterial ratios. This system predicts the bacteriocin volume needed to prevent bacteria that thrive off chemical fertilizers from becoming too dominant. Our innovative system of regulating microbiotas using bio-stimulants is a long-term solution, balancing high productivity with environmental sustainability.:::2018
