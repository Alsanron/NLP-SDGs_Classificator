NUS_Singapore-Sci:::Asia:::Singapore:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RESCUE - RNA Editing System for C-to-U Editing:::Since the discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9, researchers now have a tool for precise gene targeting in any living organism. However, there remain concerns about whether such DNA editing methods are ethical, specific and safe, especially if editing is carried out in somatic cells. Recent work has shown that another Cas family protein, Cas13, can target and degrade specific RNA transcripts, thus effectively silencing target gene expression. The targeting of RNA strands has many advantages over DNA, as any changes are not permanent and its effect is transient. Our project aims to extend the application of CRISPR-Cas13 guided RNA targeting system for editing specific RNA bases on RNA strand (RESCUE system). Cas13 is linked to the catalytic domain of APOBEC1, an enzyme that can carry out RNA base modification. Our RESCUE system can diversify the current repertoire of RNA editing methods available.:::2018
