IISER-Mohali:::Asia:::India:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::FearOmone: Cat pheromone based Bio-synthetic deterrent to minimize post harvest losses caused by rat manifestation.:::FearOmone seeks to exploit the innate fear of murines for the cats. Our challenge is to create genetically engineered yeast producing cat pheromone-based biosynthetic deterrent and prepare a device capable of diffusing this cat pheromone to areas surrounding grain storage facilities, thereby keeping murines away. Our first aim is to transform our host system, S. cerevisiae, with necessary synthetic gene circuits which will result in a recombineered yeast that mimics the cat nephron pathway for producing felinine. Next, we will conduct controlled experiments in the form of murine behavior assays to test the effectiveness of our synthetically derived felinine as a rat/mouse deterrent. Finally, we intend to design user-friendly and field-effective hardware to integrate with our yeast cells and run simulations on field data to understand murine behavior in realistic conditions and over a reasonable time-frame, with the intention of designing software for optimal dispersal of our FerOmone.:::2018
