Utilizing CRISPR for purposes other than gene editing has allowed us to create a novel, field-ready, diagnostic technique for carriers of recessive traits. Cas12a proteins are DNA targeting enzymes that recognize DNA based on a guide RNA sequence designed to match a target. The binding initiates non-specific single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity in Cas12a sufficient to degrade linear and circular ssDNA within minutes. Through this, ssDNA attached to fluorescent dye and quencher, serving as reporters, will undergo degradation. Upon cleavage, the quencher is released and fluorescence is emitted. We designed, built and programmed a hand-held device that can detect the fluorescence with high sensitivity. Simply, DNA obtained from cheek swabs, inserted into the device, diagnoses carriers of Sickle Cell Anemia.:::2018
