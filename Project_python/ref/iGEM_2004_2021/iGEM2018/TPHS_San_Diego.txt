TPHS_San_Diego:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Chitinolytic Activity of Serratia Marcescens Chitinase in Response to Various Species of Pathological Fungi:::Fungi producing harmful mycotoxins flourish on various crops. Such fungal infections significantly reduce sustainability and food production in developing countries, where mycotoxin exposure from lack of advanced food storage are responsible for severe economic losses and 40% of diseases. Our team developed a modified enzyme chitinase capable of breaking down chitin cell walls. Specifically, Serratia Marcescens Chitinase works against multiple families of fungi. By GSTChiA Chitinase genes with a signal sequence from araC, we successfully generated an Escherichia coli line that secretes chitinase against Rhizoctoniasolani Solani, Alternaria raphani, and many other pathogenic fungi. Expression of GSTChiA was further quantified through analysis of chitin compounds. This project will provide an easily accessible method capable of combating major pathogens, saving crop yield and revenue.:::2018
