Harvard:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Degratin: a story of keratin degradation:::Keratosis pilaris and Seborrheic keratosis are characterized by a buildup of keratin which are accompanied by redness and rashes. In severe cases, these skin conditions may be precancerous. Keratin is difficult to degrade due to the nature of its protein structures. However, complete degradation can be induced by the synergistic capacity of endo-acting, exo-acting, and oligopeptide-acting keratinases. We have engineered strains of E.coli to produce these keratinases and secrete them through the curli secretion pathway. We then encapsulated these modified bacteria in a hydrogel only permeable to the enzymes and essential nutrients for growth. Thus, weâ€™ve created a prototype for a keratin-degrading patch to place on the afflicted area to mitigate the lesion, eliminating the need for conventional invasive treatments. The development of easily produced keratinases lends to future uses, such as management of agricultural waste and facilitated research in precancerous growths linked to excess of keratin.:::2018
