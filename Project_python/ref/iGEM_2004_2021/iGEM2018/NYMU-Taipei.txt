NYMU-Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hair to Stay â€“ a Drug Screening System for Androgenetic Alopecia (AGA)::: Hair is one of the first noticeable aspects of our beauty and it reflects our identity. This year, the NYMU iGEM team aims to introduce a quick and convenient drug-screening platform to determine the effectiveness of hair loss product without animal or human testing. The cause of AGA is believed to be highly related to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a derivative of testosterone that can possibly trigger the production of DKK-1 protein. DKK-1 protein can possibly inhibit the growth of root sheath cells in hair follicles and eventually lead to hair loss. The system that our team designed demonstrates a convenient platform to measure the amount of secreted DKK-1 protein, which provides a novel method for the screening of AGA drugs.:::2018
