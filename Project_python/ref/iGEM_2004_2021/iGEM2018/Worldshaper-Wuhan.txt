Worldshaper-Wuhan:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Long noncoding RNA IL7-AS promotes cell migration in renal cell carcinoma:::Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. Patients with RCC typically respond poorly to conventional treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying RCC progression, including metastasis, is required to improve RCC treatment. LncRNAs have been shown to have crucial roles in carcinogenesis and metastasis. LncRNA IL7-AS is a newly discovered lncRNA, which has been suggested to be associated with innate immunity. We first examined the expression pattern of IL7-AS in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues via mining various available public data sets, which has suggested IL7-AS may play an important role in carcinomas, especially in renal cell carcinoma. Our project will clone the different splices of IL7-AS and investigate the role of IL7-AS in renal cell carcinoma. Our studies may reveal that IL7-AS is a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for renal cell carcinoma.:::2018
