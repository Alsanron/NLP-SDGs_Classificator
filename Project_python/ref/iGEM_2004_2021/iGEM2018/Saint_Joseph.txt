Saint_Joseph:::Europe:::Turkey:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::RAFI - Revolutionary Approach To Fish Infections:::For years, fish industry has been one of the most important economic resources. However , humans were not the only ones consuming this resource; some aquatic bacteria such as Vibrio anguillarum and many other bacteria species have evolved to prey on fish. This has caused huge economic losses in various countries’ fish industries. Humans responded to this problem by applying antibiotics, to which bacteria easily developed resistance. Another solution applied was vaccinations but they were ineffective for fish larvae .That’s why we need to find an effective solution that can adapt to its ever changing environment. For this we aim to use bacteriophages as a specialized lytic agent to eliminate fish pathogen. Due to resistant nature of bacteria we will support our bacteriophages with an antimicrobial peptide in a recombinant therapy where we will observe any potential synergy against Vibrio anguillarum“. We will execute our experiments in in-vitro environments.:::2018
