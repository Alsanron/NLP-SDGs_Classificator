With the use of DH5ɑ Escherichia coli as the chassis, a plasmid was introduced containing a pLac promoter, and EstA gene. The EstA gene that is found in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was inserted in the plasmid with the intention of breaking apart ester bonds which connect the glycerol backbone to the fatty acid. To test the enzyme’s effectiveness, 4-nitrophenol joined to a short chain fatty acid by an ester bond was introduced to the bacteria sample. Once this ester bond is severed, the 4-nitrophenol compound turns green. Preliminary results have shown that the bacteria expressing EstA is capable of breaking the ester bonds within 4-nitrophenol constructs. In the future, our team hopes to achieve the same result with triglycerides.:::2018
