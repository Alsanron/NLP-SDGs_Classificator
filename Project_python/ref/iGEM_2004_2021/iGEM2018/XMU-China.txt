XMU-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cell-free Systems for Disease Detection and Treatment:::This year team XMU-China developed cell-free systems to detect and treat diseases. Protein detection is unique and significant in biology fields, especially for the detection of protein biomarkers which produced by diseased cells. In order to overcome the deficiencies of traditional detection methods, we have developed an Aptamer Based Cell-free Detection system (ABCD system) of protein. The core of the ABCD system is the specific binding of the aptamer and its target protein. After protein detection, we use outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) to treat the diseased cells. We designed a system that has realized the efficient, customizable production of OMVs, which serves to encapsulate specific siRNA for disease treatment. To guarantee the practicability detection and treatment system, we also improved KaiABC system and TDPs system to regulate the expression rate of OMVs and store fragile chemicals or biological materials.:::2018
