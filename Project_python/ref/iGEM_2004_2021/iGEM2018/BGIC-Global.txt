BGIC-Global:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Formaldehunter:::In large cities of China, the population growth is accelerating. As a result, an increasing number of buildings are constructed and renovated, and problems of indoor air quality in newly decorated houses become more and more serious. Formaldehyde existing in paint and furniture may cause asthma, or even potentially leukemia. It is commonly acknowledged that formaldehyde volatile is very hard to control as it has long volatilization period. Unfortunately, current methods to remove formaldehyde are mostly either inefficient or expensive. Therefore, our project aims to develop an engineered E.coli to detect and eliminate the indoor formaldehyde safely and efficiently, when the concentration of which exceeds the legal limitation. By emitting florescence, the E.coli indicates the presence of formaldehyde and its effectiveness. Besides, the design of replaceable freeze-dried E.coli ensures the durability of the product. In this way, we would like to provide people with a real “formaldehunter”.:::2018
