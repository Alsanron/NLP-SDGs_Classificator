ColumbiaNYC:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Self-Contained Detection of Pathogenic Bacteria Using E. coli Based TX-TL Cell-Free Expression System:::Improved characterization of the cas13a protein provides the opportunity to build a cheap, rapid non-technical diagnostic tool that has point-of-care applications in resource-poor settings through the use of an Escherichia coli ­based transcription-translation (TX-TL) cell-free expression system. This self-contained platform encodes all components for diagnosis from detection to a readout in a cell-free solution. By combining the collateral cleavage of CRISPR-cas13a and small molecule sensing via metal sensitive operons, this system becomes modular, allowing for multiple diagnostic targets. To demonstrate, gene fragments of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were detected through the creation of specific targeting guide RNAs. CRISPR-cas13a’s collateral cleavage and its preferential cleaving towards certain motifs allowed for the development of a ratiometric read-out due to the preferential degradation of chromoprotein expressing mRNA. The diagnostic system provides a simple in vitro platform that can be used for the versatile detection of pathogenic bacteria in clinical or field settings.:::2018
