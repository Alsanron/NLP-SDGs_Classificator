SUIS_Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Better Together: Engineering Bacteria for Symbiotic Relationships with Micro Algae.:::Although numerous strains of microalgae have already been identified as being useful for biotechnology purposes, to make commercial up-scaling of algal production cost effective, research into novel approaches to enhance microalgae growth, and their products is needed. Microalgae and bacteria have existed together from the early days of evolution. This co-evolution provides an interesting avenue for industrial biotechnology exploration. Synthetic biology presents us with an opportunity to rationally design and construct microbial communities with well-defined objectives. The co-cultivation of engineered bacteria and micro-algae provides the possibility for enhancing associations between these populations. We aim to engineer a strain of E.coli which will help increase the biomass of microalgae through nutrient-exchange-based mutualism. Our engineered bacterium was designed to express the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of Vibrioferrin, a type of siderophore. Our construct will allow for the increased bioavailability of iron for many species of microalgae once co-cultured.:::2018
