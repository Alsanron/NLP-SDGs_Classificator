Cornell:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Oscillate:::As the field of synthetic biology grows, it becomes increasingly necessary to have a reliable cell signaling platform that is more resilient to noise than traditional promoter-controlled systems. This year, we developed a robust new paradigm for cellular signaling based on frequency, rather than amplitude-based signals. Our system is analogous to a band-pass filter in electronics; the bacteria respond only to signals of an intermediate frequency, but not those of low or high frequency. By adding tunable degradation tags to proteins in the system, it is possible to frequency at which the reporter was expressed. Versatile deterministic and stochastic models were developed by our team and used to simulate and predict properties of the system. Creating a more robust paradigm for cellular signaling has several implications for the future of synthetic biology, including advancements in biological data storage and computing, chemical production, and biosensing.:::2018
