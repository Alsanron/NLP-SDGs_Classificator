Hamburg:::Europe:::Germany:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Reagents of S.H.I.E.L.D.:::Malaria is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Extraordinary efforts are made to reduce malaria infections with limited success. All currently available applications, which look to prevent transmission by mosquitoes, are limited by the vast infrastructural differences in affected regions. With the Sustainable Human-Imitating Elimination and Lure Device (S.H.I.E.L.D.) we developed a mosquito trap tailored especially to the requirements of infrastructurally and economically disadvantaged regions. S.H.I.E.L.D. employs a self-sustaining co-culture of cyanobacteria and engineered E. coli which produce a complex mosquito attractant mixture as well as a targeted bioinsecticide. Careful implementation of novel regulatory circuits limiting cell growth, responding to nutrient availability, and monitoring metabolic load allows sustained in-trap production of attractants and insecticide over extended periods of time. The durable trap case with nano filter, co-culture separation and hydrogel reservoir ensures biosafety and brings together our no-maintenance sustainable solution to one of worldâ€™s biggest problems.:::2018
