Exeter:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Project Perchlorate: Turning a problem on Earth into a solution on Mars:::Mars is a location of scientific interest and the next step in space exploration. NASA’s 2008 Phoenix Rover found that Martian regolith contained up to 1% perchlorate salts, which would leach into crops grown in Martian soil and cause health issues like hypothyroidism. Additionally, transporting the necessary oxygen to a Martian base would be expensive and inefficient. Oxygen production would ideally take place in situ. Our project aims to utilise a GM bacterium that bioremediates perchlorate, reducing it to oxygen. Naturally occurring perchlorate reducing bacteria utilise two enzyme complexes; PcrABCD for perchlorate reductase and Cld for chlorite dismutase. We will insert these genes on two plasmids into E. coli. We’ve worked with stakeholders to design a perchlorate reducing bioreactor that could be integrated into existing life support systems, providing breathable oxygen. Existing methods of perchlorate disposal are explosive, something especially dangerous in space, making this a uniquely synbio project.:::2018
