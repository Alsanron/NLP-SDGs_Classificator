ULaval:::North America:::Canada:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Adrenayeast: Eco-Innovative Biosynthesis of Adrenaline in Saccharomyces cerevisiae:::Adrenaline is an essential medication used to treat several conditions, including life-threatening anaphylactic reactions. However, the current chemical manufacturing processes struggle to keep up with the demand for adrenaline, often leading to shortages of potentially life-saving medicine. Our project aims to increase the moleculeâ€™s availability by providing an eco-innovative alternative with milder operational conditions. We designed a two-plasmid system which harbors synthetic human cDNAs encoding the adrenaline enzymatic pathway. We explored how the insertion of this plasmid system into a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain engineered to overproduce L-tyrosine can be used for the biosynthesis of adrenaline. As the enzymatic pathway also produces metabolic intermediates of biomedical interest, we intend to create three strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae producing dopamine, noradrenaline or adrenaline, based on plasmid combination. Along with an optimized protocol to harvest purified products, we present our exploration of the social and ethical impacts of using this process to mass-produce adrenaline.:::2018
