TJU_China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Booming CRISPRers:::This year, the CRISPR-Cas family is the protagonist in our story series. The old member, dCas9, is the enhancer for the heavy-metal detection based on E. coli, while the newbie, Cas12a, is a worker for the high-throughput cancer-related SNP detection chip. We have also built a "highway" for tracking and delivering the Cas9/sgRNA complex in mammalian cells, and we try to apply it to manipulate the mitochondrial genome.:::2018
