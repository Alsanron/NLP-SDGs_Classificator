RMHS_Maryland:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Conversensations: Developing a Two-Way Quorum-Sensing Feedback Loop and Characterizing Dose-Dependent Sensitivity to Realistic Autoinducer Concentrations:::Quorum sensing, a form of bacterial cell-to-cell communication reflecting cell population fluctuations, can be adapted to facilitate multi-population collaboration. Our project combines two different QS systems to create a novel feedback loop in an E.coli co-culture, where each population synthesizes a different fluorescent protein in response to the other populationâ€™s autoinducer production. Population A is a LuxS knockout that produces AI-1 and RFP in response to AI-2, while Population B secretes a constant level of AI-2 and expresses GFP in response to AI-1. In co-culture, each population induced fluorescence in the other, indicating a successful two-way quorum sensing system. In the process, we also generated novel characterization data for two Biobricks, demonstrating for the first time that BBa_K575024 exhibits minimal leaky expression and is dose-dependent over a range of realistic AI-1 concentrations (5-1000 nM). We also provide the first evidence that BBa_K575026 is induced by AI-1.:::2018
