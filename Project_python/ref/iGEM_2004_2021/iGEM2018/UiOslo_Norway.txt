UiOslo_Norway:::Europe:::Norway:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Canditect – Fast detection of vulvovaginal Candida albicans using CRISPR/dCas9:::During their lifetime 75% of women will experience a Candida albicans infection, one of the most common vulvovaginal yeast infections. Currently there are no fast methods to detect whether an infection is caused by C. albicans. As a result, women purchase over-the-counter antimycotics without knowing the cause of their infection. This contributes to the rise of antimycotic resistance, making treatment of future infections more difficult. Based on previous projects, UiOslo_Norway aims to develop a fast detection kit for C. albicans infections, using CRISPR/dCas9. Upon a suspected infection, a vaginal sample will be treated with glucanase to selectively lyse yeast cells walls, exposing the fungal DNA. Afterwards, modified dCas9 enzymes fused with split β-lactamase are added. Using specifically designed guideRNAs, the dCas9 complexes bind adjacently on C. albicans specific DNA sequences. This activates the β-lactamase to cleave its substrate nitrocefin, producing a colored product indicating the presence of C. albicans DNA.:::2018
