Worldshaper-XSHS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Microbial Sensor for Nicotine Capture:::Tobacco consumption is one of the leading preventable causes of death and disease in the world. Nicotine, a major toxic component of tobacco, can cross biological membranes and the blood-brain barrier easily. During cigarette manufacturing, large quantities of tobacco waste with high concentrations of nicotine are produced, and the disposal of these wastes is a serious ecological problem. Microbial organisms play important roles in the tobacco manufacturing process by altering the content of nicotine. Some strains of Pseudomonas exhibits high nicotine-degrading activity, which has a gene cluster encoded enzymes involved in the catabolism of nicotine. In this project, we are aiming to explore a better way to nicotine detection and degradation. The Escherichia coli strains was constructed to easily detect the concentration of nicotine using synthetic biological methods. Meanwhile, over-expressing the key enzyme genes for nicotine bioremediation is also in progress.:::2018
