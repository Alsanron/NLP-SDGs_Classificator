Tsinghua-A:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Allergy test master: the histamine receptor based whole - yeast sensor:::Histamine increases significantly in blood when allergy happens. So, we engineered the pheromone pathway in yeast to test histamine release in blood sample under one specific allergen per time. The pheromone receptor ste2 in original pathway is replaced by human Histamine receptor H3 or H4. In order to reinforce the coupling between H3/H4 and yeast G-protein, C-terminal of Î± subunit of G-protein is modified by replacing several amino acids from the homologous protein in human. EGFP is set behind promoter Fus1 as the reporter gene. Many previous works support our modifications. Then the models of histamine and EGFP intensity relationship and the diagnosis credence can help to give the final result. Our special-designed integrated box can finish the blood collection, reaction and data sending process. Then the result will be calculated by our server and sent back to the smart phone. Thus, our project is available in families.:::2018
