Minnesota:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Self-Sustaining Engineered Bacteria for Mercury Bioremediation with Auxotrophic Based Biocontainment System:::We have engineered mercury(II) ion auxotrophy, which is sensitive to the mercury(II) ion concentration. Cell proliferation will remain normal with the presence of mercury(II) and the auxotrophic attribute by mercury(II) concentration, at which become nonviable. This is achieved by inserting an plasmid vector into an existing auxotroph E. coli (strain JW3841-1), which has its GlnA gene (Glutamine synthetase) knocked out, leads to its inability to synthesize glutamine and constrains the E. coli's proliferation. MerR is a mercury(II)-dependent transcriptional repressor-activator based on mercury(II) concentration. When mercury(II) is present, it activates the transcription of the mercury resistance protein complex and represses when absent. GlnA, MerR and MerA gene will be implanted into strain JW3841-1. MerR is activated by environmental mercury(II), glutamine synthetase will be produced for cell utilization. When the environmental mercury(II) is fully converted into mercury(0) by MerA (Reductase), the translation of glutamine synthetase will stop, which lead to bacterial death.:::2018
