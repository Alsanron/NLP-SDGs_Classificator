SDSZ_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Advanced enzymolysis technique for chitosan production:::Chitin is a kind of natural macromolecular substance that can be found abundant in the exoskeleton of arthropods. It could be converted to chitosan, -1, 4- polymer of 2-glucosamine, through deacetylation. Chitosan is significantly soluble and bioactive, widely used in medicine, food industry, and water treatment. However, the current technology that treats chitin with concentrated alkali has led to deficient, unstable chitosan production, and pollution. After learning that Chitin Deacetylase (CDA) could hydrolyze the acetamino group on chitin, we aimed to find out a crystal- chitin-active-enzymes due to the only industrial-available source of chitin. In our research, we chose several CDA and chitinase sequences, synthesized and complemented them with respective domains, and cultivated them in plasmid pET-28a. After inserting plasmids into competent cells and searching for optimal induction condition for expression, we would finally find out maximum viability and model the research for factory production.:::2018
