NTHU_Formosa:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioWatcher_Autonomous cell reporter system for non-invasive real-time blood diagnosis:::Countless biomarkers exist in our blood flow, which could be applied to diagnose health condition or even potential diseases. Ensuring the accuracy, common ways for soluble biomarkers detection are mostly invasive and not real-time. Hence, we proposed Biowatcher, engineered reporter cells that enable detection and autonomous report of soluble biomarkers in the bloodstream. The sensing parts of the reporter cells are powered by nanobodies, the single-domain antibody that can be engineered to detect different biomarkers. Binding of biomarkers on nanobodies triggers cleavages and releases of transcriptional activators. Activating the expression of lux gene, in turn, induces bioluminescent emission as a readout for devices to detect. This kind of autonomous reporting system can have great varieties of applications by installation on wearable devices, watch for example. With the required software, the wearable devices could noninvasively track the level of biomarkers for real-time diagnosis.:::2018
