UIUC_Illinois:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Symbiosis of Lactococcus lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae:::We are exploring symbiotic co-culture of Lactococcus lactis, a lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, brewerâ€™s yeast, as a means to naturally produce lactic acid. This precursor is valuable for the synthesis of poly-lactic acid, a widely used biodegradable plastic. In many food and beverage industries, LAB is a common contaminant of yeast. This suggests that yeast and LAB form a complex microbiome where both species act in symbiosis. Studying the symbiotic relationship between yeast and LAB could increase carbon flux to the production of lactic acid. Co-culture dynamics have not been thoroughly studied, as a result, we obtained bacterial and yeast fluorescence reporter strains and performed a systematic analysis of co-culture dynamics, including optimization of media characteristics and ratios of initial cell numbers. We concluded the ideal co-culture media is a mixture of 1X YPD and 1X M17 media supplemented with 2% glucose.:::2018
