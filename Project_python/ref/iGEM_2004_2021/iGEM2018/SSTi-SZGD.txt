However, there is no report that tissue cells or microorganisms can directly produce low molecular weight HA . In order to prepare low molecular weight HA , physical and chemical methods are needed. However, there are many drawbacks in physical and chemical methods, such as poor product stability, low efficiency, complex reaction conditions and possible environmental pollution. This year our project constructed a recombinant strain Bacillus subtilis 168E which could directly produce different molecular weight HA products by regulating the activities of LHAase. The HasA gene and identified precursor genes was transferred into Bacillus subtilis. Since HA of high molecular weight was produced at this time, we transferred the LHAase gene into Bacillus subtilis 168 which is from leech resources coding hyaluronidase. Therefore the HA could be enzymatic hydrolyzed to different molecular weight.:::2018
