The spread of ARGs has become a global challenge. Eliminating ARGs of microbes (e.g. from fermentation industry or laboratories) can reduce the amount of ARGs in the environment. To this end, we developed a light-controlled genetic engineering machine for degrading ARGs, which is comprised of the following modules: 1) To cleave an ARG, Cas9 was expressed under the control of arabinose promoter and guided by the sgRNA which targets at the ARG. 2) To control the expression of Cas9 through light, the efficiency of the light-controlled part was measured with eGFP as reporter. 3) To reduce leaky transcription of sgRNA, the arabinose-controlled repressor LacI was constructed and evaluated with eGFP. 4) A module for cell lysis was constructed to disrupt cells after eliminating the ARG. Together, we provided a novel strategy for controlling ARGs.:::2018
