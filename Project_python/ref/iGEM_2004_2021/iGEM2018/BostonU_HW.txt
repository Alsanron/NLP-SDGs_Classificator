BostonU_HW:::North America:::United States:::Open:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::TERRA: An application agnostic device that selectively dispenses the outputs of microfluidic chips:::While microfluidics is not new to synthetic biology, they're not widely used by or accessible to many biologists. The current “lab on a chip” microfluidic chips are highly specialized to each experiment and expensive to manufacture. In order to analyze the results of the experiments on microfluidic chips, many designs incorporate embedded sensors directly on chip. However, labs already have dedicated equipment to analyze experiments, such as plate readers and flow cytometers. Traditional analytical equipment could be used to analyze the outputs of microfluidic chips if the outputs were dispensed selectively into standard vessels, such as a 96-well plate. This would increase the design space for microfluidic experiments, enabling biologists to incorporate microfluidic chips into their workflows without having to fabricate highly specialized chips. To accomplish this we have created TERRA, an application-agnostic system that selectively dispenses the outputs from a microfluidic chip into standard vessels for downstream analysis.:::2018
