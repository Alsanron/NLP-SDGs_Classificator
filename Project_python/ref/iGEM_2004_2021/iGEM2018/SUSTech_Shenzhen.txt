SUSTech_Shenzhen:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A "Time-saving Machine" for Genetic Screening in Two-Cell System:::With rapid development of Molecular and Cellular Biology, we know more about what's in a cell but still know little about how cells interact among populations. Cell-Cell Interactions form a complicated signaling network which is far beyond our imagination. SUSTech 2018 Team developed a "time-saving machine" to study cell signaling networks based on genetically engineered Two-Cell system, a Secreting and Responding cell. Wnt signaling pathway was our proof-of-principle. Secreting cells secret Wnt signal and were modified by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout system for genetic screening on Wnt secretion. Responding cells were constructed by inserting a strong TCF promoter with GFP fluorescence for visualization of Wnt signal level. Two types of cells were then encapsulated by our microfluidic system producing thousands of Two-Cell droplets at a time. Unlike traditional coculture method, this is time-saving. In future, our systems may have wider applications in synthetic biology, drug screening and immunological recognitions.:::2018
