WHU-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Noah’s Ark I—Polyphosphate planet:::This year we aim to establish a brand new system of environmental remediation and maintenance in water. Owing to leakage or improper discharge, there are high levels of many chemicals in the water body causing water pollution like eutrophication. To deal with this, we established a set of pathways, used the symbiotic system of algae and our engineered bacteria and finally built an device as platform that can carry them—The Noah’s Ark. The Ark can make use of solar energy and continuously collect specific element or chemical agents from water to achieve the water restoration, as well as reusing the purified chemicals as resources！As an experiment, we used the Ark to recover phosphorus this year. Thus, the first product of a whole series was launched：Noah’s Ark I—Polyphosphate planet.:::2018
