Northwestern:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MetaSense: A heavy metal biosensor optimized for cell-free expression:::Water pollution has become a rising problem in Lake Michigan as more contaminants are accidentally or illegally dumped. However, very little is being done to raise citizen awareness or to combat the negative effects on the ecosystem. Thus, the goal of this project is to create a paper-based cell-free assay that detects whether chromium or lead is present in a given water supply. Cell free systems are ideal for heavy metal detection because they are field-deplorable, eliminate issues of biocontamination, and facilitate increased reaction control via the open reaction environment. For each metal, there are two plasmids; one that produces a repressor protein while the other constitutively produces GFP. With this combination, the repressor interferes with the production of GFP until the specified heavy metal is present, resulting in a fluorescent output. The benefit of creating an easy-to-use sensor is that it empowers everyday citizens to test their water quality.:::2018
