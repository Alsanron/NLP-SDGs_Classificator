Jiangnan:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SuperVIP-Suspended universal plasma-enabled rapid vaccine production:::Vaccine is one of the most cost-effective public heath solution, with cell-based approach being a promising production strategy. We are devoted to establish a cell line with self-owned intellectual property and feasible for rapid production of a broad spectrum of viruses, with the aim of reducing the cost of cell based virus production in the heath care sector. By constructing two biobricks and enabling three features to our chassis cells, we considerably reduced virus production cost by increasing virus titer per cell and virus-producing cells per fermentor, and broadening cellsâ€™ virus sensitivity spectrum. We used computational modeling to explore genes for biobrick construction and cold atmospheric plasma ejecting device to further increase virus titer. We proved the significance of our project through systematically examining the needs of vaccine production companies including our close collaborator DaBeiNong, and disseminated knowledge related to vaccine and synthetic biology to the public.:::2018
