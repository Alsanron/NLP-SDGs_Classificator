IIT_Kanpur:::Asia:::India:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SWASH: Hacking E.Coli to clean the cleansing agent:::There are about 2 billion people worldwide who donâ€™t even have access to clean drinking water. This has resulted in a growing need for solutions to tackle the problem of water pollution. One of the major chemical wastes discharged in sewage and as industrial effluents are detergents. This year we plan to provide a reliable and robust solution to this problem by focusing on sodium dodecyl sulfate(SDS) which is an anionic biodegradable surfactant and is the major component of detergents used around the world. Our project is concerned with developing a synthetic pathway in E.coli for extracellular expression of enzyme alkyl-sulfatase originally found in bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa to degrade SDS into commercially viable 1-dodecanol. As part of our project, we will also develop a bio-sensor to precisely quantify and characterize the by-products obtained as a result of SDS degradation.:::2018
