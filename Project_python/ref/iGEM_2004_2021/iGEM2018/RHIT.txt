RHIT:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PEBBLE - Modifying Escherichia coli to Degrade and Metabolize Polyethylene Terephthalate Plastic into Usable Products:::A recently discovered bacteria, Ideonella sakaiensis, degrades polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic into ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid using the enzymes PETase and MHETase. As genetic engineering methods have not been well-developed for this organism, we are engineering this pathway into Escherichia coli, a model organism. Other researchers have mutated PETaseâ€™s active site to increase its substrate turnover. We are cloning the DNA sequences of these mutated enzymes into an E. coli plasmid and developing a second plasmid to overexpress the native E.coli enzymes for ethylene glycol metabolism. With both plasmids, the transformed bacteria should be able to survive solely off the PET carbon. The only byproduct would be terephthalic acid, a precipitate which can be recycled into new plastic. Computer simulations of the pathway gave us predictive degradation rates at optimum conditions. Implementation of these bacteria in the future could address the concern of plastic build-up in our world.:::2018
