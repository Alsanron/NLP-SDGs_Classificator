Tongji_China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Ocandy:::Neoantigens, which are the abnormal proteins produced by mutations in cancer cells that activate the immune system have already become the hotspots of concern to researchers. Neoantigen is Individualized and is a promising concept to be used in cancer treatment. Type III secretion system (T3SS) acts as a promising tool for protein delivery directly into the target cells. We establish a method which can deliver neoantigens into immune system using the Type III secretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We select the colorectal cancer as our target and use the bioinformatic method to filter our item antigens. Then we use the T3SS to deliver the item antigens into immune system through orally intake of engineered attenuated bacteria. Since for the T3SS, there are almost no restrictions on the delivery of short peptide antigens, this method has the flexibility to be adapted to, if there are effective neoantigens, any specific cancer patient.:::2018
