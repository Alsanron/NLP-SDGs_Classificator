UGA:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of Gal4/UAS Reporter Systems for use in Plants:::The development of inducible expression systems in plants is imperative to the field of synthetic biology. The University of Georgia’s 2018 iGEM team is expanding the iGEM registry’s profile of plant promoters and reporters. Here we report a modified Gal4/UAS system. The Gal4/UAS system is an inducible promoter system native to yeast that utilizes the Gal4 transcription factor to activate genes downstream of a minimal promoter enhanced by an upstream activator sequence (UAS). We have created a 6X UAS repeat combined with a minimal 35S promoter to provide enhanced expression of reporter genes such as GFP, AmilC, and the apoptotic initiator from bell peppers, BS3, in the model organism, Nicotiana Benthamiana. The introduction of these expression systems to the iGEM registry will enable future iGEM teams to produce targeted expression in plants with ease using a binary vector system.:::2018
