William_and_Mary:::North America:::United States:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Construction of a decoding circuit to process dynamic frequency-encoded information:::One of the most ubiquitous forms of information processing in cellular systems is one in which information is encoded in the time-domain dynamics of signals. Although there exist synthetic circuits capable of encoding information in the time-domain of gene expression, the field lacks circuits that can decode time-domain information. As a result, synthetic circuits are incapable of processing time-domain information, rendering them unable to interface effectively with dynamically encoded cellular signals. To address this problem we created a decoder circuit that uses an incoherent feed-forward loop to convert frequency-encoded information into amplitude-encoded information. Through modeling and experimentation we demonstrate that our IFFL decoder allows synthetic circuits to more accurately process information encoded in the frequency of an oscillatory signal. Our decoder therefore provides a means for teams to design and build synthetic circuits that can better interface with endogenous signaling pathways to access the broad possibilities of time-domain information processing.:::2018
