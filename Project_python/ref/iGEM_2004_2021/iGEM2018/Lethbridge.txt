Lethbridge:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::VINCEnT: A modular Viral-Inspired Novel Cargo Encapsulation Toolkit for targeted delivery of molecules to cells:::The 2018 Lethbridge iGEM team is developing a Viral-Inspired Novel Cargo Encapsulation Toolkit (“VINCEnT”) for simple design and assembly of protein nanocompartments (PNCs). This standardized toolkit can be used to produce custom PNCs for targeted delivery of various cargos including nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules to desired cell types. PNC design will be facilitated by our software platform, enabling informed selection of cell-targeting surface modifications, encapsulation proteins, and cargo-loading approaches tailored to the intended application. PNCs have wide-ranging utility from targeted drug delivery and gene therapy to materials synthesis and distribution of biological control agents. With the simplified design, standardized protocols, and modular components, less experienced users will be able to design and produce PNCs in a basic laboratory environment. We have also critically examined the “dual-use” implications of making custom PNC production more accessible and have developed a risk assessment rubric for VINCEnT to help mitigate potential threats.:::2018
