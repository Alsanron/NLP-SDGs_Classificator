SZU-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cockroach terminator:::This year we designed a fungal cockroach terminator system based on Metarhizium anisopliae. It can infect cockroaches in a very high efficiency and eventually lead to death. Our system consists of three parts. First, we use a hydrophobic protein called HsbA. It can help our fungus attach better to the cockroaches. Second, we transferred Bbchit which encodes the chitinase that can penetrate the surface of the cockroaches. After our transgenic Metarhizium anisopliae enter the hemolymph of cockroach. The third gene we transferred called MCL1 will combine with the specific antigen on the surface of Metarhizium anisopliae , which makes our system 'invisible' and can avoid the detection of the immune system. This allows our transgenic Metarhizium anisopliae to reproduce themselves greatly and eventually lead to cockroachâ€™s death. For better application we designed a device to contain our emulsifiable powder which we will definitely show you in giant jamboree.:::2018
