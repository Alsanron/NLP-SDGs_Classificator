UCAS-China:::Asia:::China:::Open:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Rose Forest:::A hundred years ago, a nightingale built a red rose for true love out of music by moonlight. Today, our E. coli uses light and music to create a colorful and fragrant rose forest for scientists and artists. Using three sensors to sense light of different wavelengths and intensity, and a RNAP system as resource allocator, our E. coli produces different proportions of three-primary colors responding to light and music, realizing the painting of full-color roses. By changing the output into scent genes, our roses can even emit various sorts of pleasant odors. Besidesï¼Œwe plan to make a collection kit to collect important genes related to light control and the color output of E. coli, which will be more convenient for future researchers. Integrating idealistic human feelings with logical genetic circuits, we aim to bring forth a new perception of combining art and science.:::2018
