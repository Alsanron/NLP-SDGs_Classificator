SYSU-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CO-RAD：Collaborative optimization platform with recommendation，analysis and design:::Designing genetic circuits and protocols by teamwork is pervasive for synthetic biologists, but it's still hard to cooperate with partners using traditional collaborative software for the complexity and hierarchy in synbio design. Here, we develop an open-access software CO-RAD to facilitate the collaboration, recommendation and analysis for the synthetic biologists. CO-RAD allows users to edit circuits and protocols online while collaborating with other users in real-time. For assisting users in optimizing their circuits, we strengthen CO-RAD's ability of recommendation and analysis. After designing circuits in embedded design platform easily, users will get similar circuits from our interactive database by collaborative filtering algorithm. Users can also acquire various projects information efficiently through our search engine. Based on directed evolution algorithm, our software can simulate performance of circuits and provide suggestion of optimization. Moreover, some deep level information of circuit sequence can be showed in our software concisely.:::2018
