Lund:::Europe:::Sweden:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Using synthetic biology to increase recombinant protein yield via co-expression of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin:::The use of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) to increase recombinant protein yield via co-expression has been proven successful in various applications. However, recent studies have indicated that the success is largely dependent on the choice of associated expression system. While there are many ways of regulating VHb levels, there is to this end no simple nor standardized way of tuning the expression levels for a certain application. We present a set of inserts containing VHb expressed at various levels, created by utilizing the library of constitutive Anderson promoters. The effect on the cell growth was investigated by optical density measurements. The increase in recombinant protein yield was determined by co-expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and measuring fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry. Preliminary data suggest a positive correlation between VHb expression level and GFP fluorescence intensity. Further studies include expression under varying oxygen availability and expression of other target proteins.:::2018
