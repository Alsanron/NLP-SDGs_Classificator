JNFLS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::HCV, Aparecium!:::We aim to develop a biosensor for detecting HCV by the nucleic acid aptamer, and the specific detection of trace HCV could be realized by rolling circle amplification, which has great significance to shorten the window period of HCV in clinic transfusion. HCV C gene was expressed, and collected secreted HCV C protein was used to bind specifically with the nucleic acid aptamer. Using the competing reaction of the target antigen, a highly sensitive fluorescent aptamer sensor was developed based on the rolling circle replication. When there is no target antigen, the aptamer complementary sequence binds with aptamer instead of the padlock probe; whereas when the aptamer probe binds with the target antigen, the complementary sequence hybridizes with padlock probe, which triggers rolling circle amplification reaction. Under the action of DNA ligase, the padlock probe is further cyclized and a rolling circle amplification occurs under the action of DNA polymerase.:::2018
