BCU:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Nicotine Degradation:::Nicotine, a major alkaloid in tobacco plants, is a significant factor of evaluation for tobacco and cigarettes. Nicotine plays a critical role in smoking addiction and is well known to be harmful to human beings, because it easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and biological membranes. Meanwhile, with large quantities of tobacco products being produced and consumed, tobacco waste is entering the environment. So we want to find a key nicotine-degrading gene to degrade nicotine effectively in E.coli by synthetic biology. Nicotine oxidoreductase (nicA) from Pseudomonas putida S16 has been obtained by our team and a new expression vector has been constructed with promoter(J23119), ribosome binding site(RBS B0034), nicA ,terminator(B0015) in psb1c3. NICA expressed by E.coli top10 could catalyse and degrade Nicotine effectively from 35-50â„ƒ and pH5 to pH8.:::2018
