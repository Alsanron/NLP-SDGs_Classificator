Gifu:::Asia:::Japan:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MPPP (Mass-production of protein in PURE system):::In vivo circular RNA expression can be a cutting edge method to perform mass-production of protein. During the translation of coding information of DNA into amino acids, function of ribosomes is naturally influential. The translation is initiated by binding ribosomes to mRNA and termination of translation is induced by a stop codon. When a start codon is recognized by ribosomes, the protein producing organelles release the protein. To produce large amount of protein and long-chain protein we can utilize circular RNA without the stop codon. iGEM Gifu 2015 performed the method of the Permuted Intron-Exon Method (PIE method). Currently 2.5% of transcribed RNA can be formed as circular RNA. With PIE method, mass-production of protein was confirmed in E.coli, however the protein had no function because of aggregation. This year our team will try to produce functional protein from the circular RNA in PURE system, a kind of cell-free system.:::2018
