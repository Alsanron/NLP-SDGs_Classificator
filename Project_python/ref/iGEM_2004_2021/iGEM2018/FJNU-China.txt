FJNU-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::2-PLEAsant:::According to statistics, the microbes we touched each day are about 3 times more than the human cells. The infection with some specific microbes can cause infectious diseases and give unpleasant smell. Bacteria can infect any area of the body and cause different diseases: pneumonia, meningitis, food poisoning, etc. Our project focuses on inhibition of the infectious microbes in a more efficient, environmentally friendly way. Based on the principles of metabolic engineering, we engineered an E.coli strain producing phenyllaclic acid that has broad-spectrum antibacterial effects, and the rose-like aroma compound 2-phenylethanol. We incorporated the common components of temperature and salt control in the synthesis system, which applied phenyllaclic acid and 2-phenylethanol to the natural environments. In addition, we designed the toxic protein mazF as a suicide switch to ensure biosafety. In the future research, we plan to promote the system into various types of fields and solve more environmental problems.:::2018
