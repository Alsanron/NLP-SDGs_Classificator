NTNU_Trondheim:::Europe:::Norway:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Quorum Sensing as a target mechanism for reducing biofilm formation:::Bacterial biofilm formation is a profound challenge in treating wounds, inserting prostheses in patients or on equipment in different production industries. Communication between bacteria and coordination of biofilm formation is mediated by the quorum sensing mechanism. Here we utilize a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system to inhibit Escherichia coli’s quorum sensing mechanism by knocking down the luxS gene. The luxS gene encodes the synthase “S-ribosylhomocysteine lysae”, which is responsible for synthesis of the Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) quorum sensing molecule. We implemented the CRISPRi system in E. coli DH5α and TG1 and measured the biofilm production by Crystal Violet assays. We were able to significantly reduce TG1’s biofilm formation, while DH5α showed results with high variability. Experimental approaches for reducing biofilm formation have the potential to illuminate unknown underlying processes in biofilm formation and possibly reveal treatments for the challenges that biofilms account for.:::2018
