DNHS_SanDiego:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Survival and Quorum Sensing Activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Under Influence of QS Inhibitors vs Antibiotics:::Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial species, often infects major burns and cystic fibrosis. Historically, antibiotics can treat these infections; however, P. aeruginosa quickly grow resistance, increasing colonization in human flora and decreasing treatment efficiency. Alternatively to antibiotics, inhibition of quorum sensing (QS), chemical communication among bacterial colonies, is under speculation. This experiment compares the effects of common antibiotics (gentamicin and tobramycin) to QS inhibitors (salicylic acid and zeaxanthin) on Pseudomonas survival and QS activity. Bacteria transformed with a plasmid that detected LasR, a P. aeruginosa QS indicator, levels and correspondingly produced green fluorescence protein (GFP) would be transformed to P. aeruginosa and grown in the presence of each antibiotic and QS inhibitor over 3 days. Absorbance and fluorescence would then be measured through serial dilution. This experiment explores a promising possibility for the future of antibacterial care efficiency and success in saving the lives of cystic fibrosis and burn patients.:::2018
