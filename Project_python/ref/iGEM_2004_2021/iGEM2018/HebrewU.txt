HebrewU:::Asia:::Israel:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Catalysis of Dioxin Degradation:::Dioxins, a family of chemical compounds, pose a serious threat to humans, animals, and the environment. Classified as persistent environmental pollutants, these compounds move up the food chain via bioaccumulation; consequently, they are found in very harmful concentrations by the time the reach humans. Our team has set out to engineer a metabolic pathway for the complete degradation of dioxins, and detoxification of chlorinated compounds. The pathway would involve the uptake of these pollutants and their subsequent breakdown into molecules that would enter organismsâ€™ native metabolism. We are testing the pathway in S. cerevisiae, and have prepared expression vectors and means to engineer a multitude of plants. By deploying such pathways directly into endemic plants, our solution can be tailored to specific regions. Furthermore, because we can efficiently control plant reproduction, we can responsibly implement synthetic biology to solve this issue in a non-invasive and ecological manner.:::2018
