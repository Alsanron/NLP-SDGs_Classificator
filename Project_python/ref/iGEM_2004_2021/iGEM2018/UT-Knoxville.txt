UT-Knoxville:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering E. coli for Dichloroacetate and Dichloromethane Degradation:::Chemical pollution resulting from large-scale industrial practices can result in volatile organic compound (VOC) accumulation in water supplies. One VOC of interest, dichloroacetate (DCA), is a chlorinated carcinogenic contaminant at clinically high levels. Similarly, dichloromethane (DCM), is used for various industrial applications but its accumulation in water systems poses a threat to aquatic organisms and is considered a carcinogenic to humans. The goal of the UT Knoxville iGEM Team is to design biological systems in E. coli capable of degrading DCA and DCM in order to remove them from the water supply and metabolize them within the cell. Through the addition of Haloacid Dehalogenase (HADase) genes capable of breaking down DCA as well as the development of a DCM biosensor, we are generating biological organisms in order to facilitate our access to clean drinking.:::2018
