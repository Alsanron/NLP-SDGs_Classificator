Macquarie_Australia:::Asia:::Australia:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Chlorophyll-induced Vesicles (ChiVes) for metabolic engineering and protein purification:::Recombinant proteins have diverse and important therapeutic and industrial utility, at present their purification is costly, time and labour intensive. Our research simplifies this purification process by sequestering desired proteins into synthetic vesicles, allowing for bulk purification via an operationally simple centrifugation step. These synthetic vesicles have been engineered into the expression host E.Coli. As previously shown in plants and algae, vesicle formation occurs spontaneously in the presence of chlorophyll and the enzymes needed for its biosynthesis. Cells grown in the dark recruit phospholipids to form crystalline aggregates known as prolamellar bodies. Subsequent exposure of the cells to light results in the conversion of these aggregates to vesicles. By mimicking this natural process, our cells can be selectively induced to capture valuable recombinant products in easily isolable vesicles. Additionally, through computational modelling and our human practices ‘customer discovery’ toolkit, we have validated the viability and potential impact of this research.:::2018
