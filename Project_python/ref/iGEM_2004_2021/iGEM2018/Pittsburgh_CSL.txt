Pittsburgh_CSL:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Energy on Demand from Symbiotic Microbial Fuel Cells:::The burning of fossil fuels generates greenhouse gases that damage the atmosphere and impacts the global environment. Energy from sustainable sources such as wind and solar is difficult to store for times when no wind is blowing or no sun is shining. The purpose of this project is to show a possible symbiotic relationship between Shewanella oneidensis and E.coli to generate energy. This allows the use of energy in a eco friendly way. In order to build a sustainable energy source for energy on demand we created a system using living organisms. E.coli was engineered to synthesize lactate which will then be used to feed a Shewanella biofilm. Shewanella oneidensis is a bacterium notable for its ability to reduce metal ions, live in environments with or without oxygen and when incorporated into a microbial fuel cell produced voltage. Results of co-culture experiments to test the symbiotic relationship will be presented.:::2018
