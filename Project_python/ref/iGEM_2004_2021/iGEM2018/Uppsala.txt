Uppsala:::Europe:::Sweden:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Worm Busters - Fighting the hidden resistance:::This year iGEM Uppsala has applied modern methods in novel ways to solve problems in a field largely untouched by synthetic biology. The purpose of the project is to use applied diagnostics to prevent overutilization of anthelmintics in horses by engineering a ‘smart’ bacterium. These bacteria would be able to report the presence of specific nematode parasites in a quantitative manner, allowing deworming treatments to be individualized for each horse depending on the level of infection. This would minimize the risk of future anthelmintic resistance, helping to stem the impending problem. Using synthetic biology to solve problems in veterinary diagnostics has presented many unique challenges to our team. These challenges have been overcome by development of new applications of existing techniques such as phage display, transcriptome sequencing using nanopore technology, and chromoprotein expression.:::2018
