Westminster_UK:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Facilitating styrene biodegradation through modification of the tod operon:::While waste plastics are a major environmental concern, polystyrene is one of the least recycled and is amongst the most polluting plastics. We investigated the impact of polystyrene and evaluated chemical methods of reducing its expanded volume using citrus waste chemicals followed by thermal depolymerisation. Methylbenzene (toluene) is metabolised in Pseudomonas putida F1 through the Tod operon, a class of genes which facilitate the transport and metabolism of toluene. Our goal is to use the tod operon to facilitate the biodegradation of styrene monomers. One critical enzyme, the 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (todE) was reported to encounter inactivation by 3-vinylcatechol intermediate of styrene biodegradation thus, our aim is to up-regulate todE in our composite biobricks while computationally modelling it. If successful, these genetic modifications could be applied back to P. putida F1 for more efficient growth on waste styrene on an industrial scale, with the possibility of useful intermediate collection.:::2018
