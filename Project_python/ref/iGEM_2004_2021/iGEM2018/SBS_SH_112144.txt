SBS_SH_112144:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::The lysis of Cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystem using Cyanophage lysozyme and its commercial implications:::The rampant growth of cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystem has become more than an environmental issue. Their incredible ability to multiply and voracious consumption of oxygen often make them a disturbing factor to natural systems. Although effective ways to gather and salvage cyanobacteria have been developed, there are barely any success in decomposing these bacteria. Through background research, our team identified a cyanophage lysozyme, cp-OS lysozyme 1. Alone with other chemicals such as BugBuster, this lysozyme in small reaction systems could lyse the cyanobacteria effectively. Through molecular cloning, protein expression, and the subsequent purification, we were able to acquire the recombinant protein from E. coli cells, and we evaluated its enzymatic activity under different pH and temperatures. We also designed a prototype device in which immobilized lysozyme can be used to lyse cyanobacteria repeatedly. Our research lays foundation for the utilization of cyanobacteria components in agricultural, bioenergetic, and even medical fields.:::2018
