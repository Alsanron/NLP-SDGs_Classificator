IIT-Madras:::Asia:::India:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ADaPtat1on : Expanding Toolkit for Acinetobacter baylyi:::Acinetobacter baylyi is a gram-negative, soil-dwelling, non-pathogenic, naturally competent and nutritionally versatile organism especially known for its ability to degrade aromatic compounds. However, only a few tools are available for its gene manipulation. This year, we plan to expand the toolkit for A. baylyi ADP1 by making a synthetic promoter library along with codon optimized fluorescent reporter proteins to achieve better control over its expression rates. The codon table is not available for this organism. So we obtained sequence data of well-characterised proteins of this organism by filtering manually putative and hypothetical sequences and used this data to generate the codon table using CUTE - a tool of ChassiDex. The codon optimisation is done manually by replacing the less frequent codons with high-frequency codons based on the generated table. This can potentially open up various new exciting synthetic biology opportunities with this unexplored organism.:::2018
