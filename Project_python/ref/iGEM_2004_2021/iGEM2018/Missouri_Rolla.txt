Missouri_Rolla:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BTree:::Since the year 2002, North American ash trees have been infected with and killed by an invasive beetle species known as Emerald Ash Borers (EAB). Current methods for prevention and treatment of EAB’s are too expensive and time consuming for large scale eradication. Our proposed long term solution is to develop Ash trees that are genetically resistant to EAB’s. From a known Bacillus thuringiensis Cry8Da protein, we hope to induce mutations in the protein’s receptor binding regions to create a Bt toxin specific for EAB’s. After screening modified proteins, we will utilize leaf-specific expression of the Cry Toxin in Arabidopsis thaliana as our model system for Ash trees. This method will target EAB’s as they feed on ash leaves during adulthood. We hope to present this system for future development as a safe and effective alternative to current treatment methods used in affected areas.:::2018
