Chalmers-Gothenburg:::Europe:::Sweden:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DiYEASTive: Probiotic yeast for diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer:::Our project uses Synthetic Biology to treat colorectal cancer. Our envisioned product is a pill containing genetically engineered probiotic yeast. The pill is ingested by the patient and passes through the digestive tract. If the ingested yeast cells encounter cancer cells in the colon, they will selectively attach to them. As more yeast cells accumulate, the secretion of anti-cancer molecules will be triggered. The yeast cells continuously produce gas vesicles which will refract ultrasound waves. This allows detection and monitoring using simple ultrasound imaging technology in an otherwise invisible and inaccessible part of the body. Meanwhile, the anti-cancer molecules specifically target and kill the cancerous cells, treating the patient with highly limited collateral damage.:::2018
