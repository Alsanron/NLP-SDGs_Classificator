BIT-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Who can get an A?:::Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered as the main reason of human aging through damaging DNA, attacking membrane and inducing apoptosis. Now many antioxidants adding in food, cosmetic and some medical production claim they can clear oxidative damages. Although many methods of measuring antioxidants capability are precise in vitro, there is no standard method for living cell. Therefore our project is to construct a system which can determine the activity of antioxidants in vivo. We chose Saccharomyces. cerevisiae as host and accumulated ROS by overexpressing genes. After reacting with antioxidants, the remaining ROS could reflect the antioxidant activity which could be detected by a redox sensor, roGFP2-Orp1. Additionally, a feedback gene circuit was set to avoid the overproduction of ROS which injured our yeast. Compared with the traditional methods, our system requires a milder environment, damage-free and with higher biologically relevant which make our system more reliable.:::2018
