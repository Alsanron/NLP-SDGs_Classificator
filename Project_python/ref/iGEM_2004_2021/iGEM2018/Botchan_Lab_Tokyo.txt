However, it is difficult for people in poor areas to continuously obtain protein rich foods. Therefore, in addition to these ingredients, we propose ‘Bacterial Supplement’ anyone can easily take it into the body. We got this idea from Papuans living in Papua New Guinea. Despite their low-protein diets, they have muscular bodies. It is thought that nitrogen fixing bacteria in their intestines are influencing on protein nutrition. We thought to construct a pathway to synthesize amino acids from nitrogen in E. coli, introducing it in the future. To synthesize amino acids, we first express nitrogenase to convert nitrogen to ammonia. We then express amino acid dehydrogenase to synthesize glutamate and phenylalanine from accumulated ammonia. We hope that our project will contribute to the solution of protein-energy malnutrition by fixing this E. coli in our intestinal flora.:::2018
