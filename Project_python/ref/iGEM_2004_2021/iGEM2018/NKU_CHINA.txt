NKU_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Population Quality Control system: a circuit for yield enhancement based on non-genetic variations:::Biosynthesis enables renewable and environment-friendly production of various compounds. However, present biosynthetic performances still await improvements to be cost competitive with petroleum-based chemical synthesis and suitable for large-scale industrial production. In order to achieve this goal, many approaches have been created, among which the Population Quality Control ( PopQC ) system is proved efficient. In our project, a PopQC system was developed as a plasmid based gene circuit in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 to continuously select high-performing cells in order to improve the yield of target metabolite, glutamate. In the presence of our PopQC system, high-producers stayed alive while low-producers were unable to survive. Consequently, the average intracellular concentration as well as the yield of glutamate among the population was enhanced, which finally led to the yield enhancement of poly-Î³-glutamate, a high-value-added secondary metabolite.:::2018
