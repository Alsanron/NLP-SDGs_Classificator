Virginia:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Quorus: Engineering a Microbial Symphony:::Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism where bacteria detect the presence of nearby cells and coordinate their behavior among the population. Utilizing the QS genes of the Lsr operon and T7 RNA Polymerase, we are developing a biologically orthogonal quorum response sensitive to the universal autoinducer AI-2. This system introduces an alternative method of gene induction and biomanufacturing to iGEM, re-engineering microbial coordination of population phenotypes. Further, we have designed a synthetic feedback loop in tandem with the Lsr operon to increase the mean and homogeneity of quorum activation in a colony to levels comparable to industrial inducers like IPTG. This provides a system of self-regulating induction that can produce target proteins cheaper and more efficiently than current industrial methods. The resulting engineered microbe has increased biofilm production compared to the wild type, which has applications such as microbial cellulose biomanufacturing and hyper-virulent control organisms for testing certain microbial antibiotics.:::2018
