IIT_Delhi:::Asia:::India:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Back & Forth with Recombinases:::With the growth of synthetic biology, there has been an increase in the development of digital synthetic circuits, which requires biological logic gates that can accept a binary input and generate a suitable binary output. Often biological systems are unable to provide sharp and accurate input to output response due to reasons like noise, growth factors etc. Hence there exists a need of robust and reliable modules that can transform the analog and stochastic behaviour of biology into a digital response. We aim to develop recombinase based elementary constructs that would allow development of complex circuits with specialized functions with greater ease. Recombinases are enzymes that trigger site-specific recombination to perform excision/incision or inversion of genetic circuits, to produce the desired gene expression. Our project involves use of serine based recombinases to develop a novel recombinase based toolkit of elementary circuits such as feedforward loop, feedback loop etc.:::2018
