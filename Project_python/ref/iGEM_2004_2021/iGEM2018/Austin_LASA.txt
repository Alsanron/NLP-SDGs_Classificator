Austin_LASA:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Infection Detection: HIV1 Detection in Infants:::HIV diagnosis of infants in the developing world continues to pose many problems as current diagnostic methods are inaccurate in infants and difficult to administer in the field. Recent research demonstrates CRISPR-associated enzyme Cas12a’s ability to indiscriminately cleave ssDNA following recognition and cleavage of a dsDNA target strand, lending itself to nucleotide detection assays. Due to their high stability in cells, Cas enzymes such as Cas12a are prime candidates for lyophilized bacterial reagents (“cellular reagents”) that can be stored at room temperature until resuspended for later use in the field. Our project aims to design an innovative HIV1 diagnostic system for infants that combines cellular reagents with a Cas12a assay. For the purposes of iGEM and biosafety, our team focused on demonstrating the following with purified enzymes and cellular reagents: isothermal amplification of viral DNA and detection of viral DNA by a Cas12a assay.:::2018
