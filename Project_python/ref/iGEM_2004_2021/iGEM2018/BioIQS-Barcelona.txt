BioIQS-Barcelona:::Europe:::Spain:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::IN SITU PERSONALIZED DIAGNOSIS KIT FOR CELIAC DISEASE:::In our iGEM Project we will design a personalized gluten sensor through a synthetic biology approach. To do so, we will build a model based on the HLA expression of the patient which will be coupled to a sensor, allowing the detection of reactive epitopes. Our sensor: a) Will be built according to the patient HLA, allowing the detection of specific reactive epitopes independently of the food source. b) Will be able to detect reactive epitopes even in fermented foods. c) The methodology implemented in our sensor could be used for the identification of new reactive epitopes and unknown allelic variants. d) Requires only a DNA sample of the patient. Therefore, the methodology and application of our sensor could be extended for the detection of other HLA related disorders as well as the generation of new research lines for the diagnosis, detection and basic knowledge of these type of disorders.:::2018
