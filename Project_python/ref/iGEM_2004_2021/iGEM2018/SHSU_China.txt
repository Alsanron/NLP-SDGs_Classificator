SHSU_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::ExoBlood:::We will engineer human cell line to produce exosomes that work as cellular hemoglobin based oxygen carriers. They can be used in blood transfusion and stroke treatment. We will first try to secrete human hemoglobin subunits and other required proteins for oxygen transport. Then we will focus on loading the protein cargo into the exosome, which we have chosen for the reason of immune-compatibility and easy production. The exosomes will be loaded endogenously with hemoglobin using membrane anchored proteins (CD63) or using exosome-forming pathways inside the cell (WW tag and Ndfip1). By doing this, we will produce an efficient method for future iGEM teams to create protein-loaded exosomes that can be used in therapeutics and develop a potential blood replacement.:::2018
