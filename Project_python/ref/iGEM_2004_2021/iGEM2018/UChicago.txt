UChicago:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::An iGEM-Optimized CEN Plasmid for E. coli and Pichia pastoris:::Komatgella pastoris, otherwise known as Pichia pastoris, serves as an important industrial chasis organism for its ease of cultivation while also making post transcriptional modifications to eukaryotic proteins. Expensive and complex techniques, such as in vivo recombination, however remain a major bottleneck to developing transgenic P. pastoris lines. Centromeric plasmids developed for Saccharomyces cerevisiae overcome this bottleneck by providing the flexibility of plasmids with the stability of endogenous chromosomes. Here, we adapt the pSB1C3 iGEM backbone with a P. pastoris selection marker and various portions of the P. pastoris centromeric sequences to develop centromeric plasmids. We demonstrate by sectoring assay that these plasmids provide chromosome-like stability while maintaining the ease of use of an iGEM plasmid. This plasmid has major implications in the manufacturing of biologics.:::2018
