CUNY_Kingsborough:::North America:::United States:::Open:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Low Cost Quantification of DNA Using ImageJ™ and Application:::Quantification of nucleic acids is essential for ligation reactions and other reactions that require nucleic acids. Without accurate quantification of nucleic acids, it is difficult to complete a molecular biology experiment. Spectrophotometers are commonly used but are not accessible to all lab groups, making experiments prohibitively difficult for some. The Ethidium Bromide Spot Test protocol is a quick and dirty approach that relies on visualizing dye-DNA complex fluorescence under UV light. However, its reliability is questionable because the protocol is not well characterized. This year, the CUNY Kingsborough iGEM team hopes to better characterize this protocol and standardize the fluorescent measurements using ImageJ™. Ideally, our characterization will allow future iGEM teams to reduce lab costs but still produce trustworthy results. As proof of application, we will use the Ethidium Bromide Spot Test to construct and characterize quorum sensing BioBricks. Additional modelling will be performed to tune the BioBricks’ pattern-forming behaviour.:::2018
