iTesla-SoundBio:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Factor C The Difference: A Synthetic Biology Alternative to the LAL Endotoxin Detection Assay:::Many gram-negative bacteria naturally create compounds called endotoxins, which induce pathological symptoms including septic shock in humans. Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) testing, the gold-standard endotoxin detection test, is used in virtually every area of biomedical product development. The test is derived from horseshoe crab blood, including coagulation Factor C, the primary effector protein. Many horseshoe crabs die each year due to the bleeding process, straining populations and ecosystems along the US Atlantic Coast and in Asia, where it is less sustainable. Moreover, LAL testing is expensive, creating a barrier to biomedical innovation in low-resource settings. For these reasons, our team sought to synthesize a codon-optimized sequence of Factor C and integrate it into Bacillus subtilis (a gram-positive bacterium) using a pAX01 backbone with a xylose inducible promoter. In the future, we hope to design a detection mechanism to signal for the cleavage of Factor C and the presence of endotoxin.:::2018
