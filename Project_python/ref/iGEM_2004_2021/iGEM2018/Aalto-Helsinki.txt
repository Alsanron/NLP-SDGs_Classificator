Aalto-Helsinki:::Europe:::Finland:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Silkolor - A sustainable approach to dyeing industry using fusion proteins:::Textile dyeing is one of the biggest polluters of natural waters. Many of the synthetic dyes used are non-biodegradable, toxic and large amounts of them end up in waters during the dyeing process. Natural dyes, although less toxic than synthetic ones, require mordants in order to bind to the fabric. Mordants often contain aluminum or other metals, which are harmful to the environment. We are addressing the problem by using two types of colorful fusion proteins. Chromoproteins are fused with binding domains to create colorful proteins which can bind cellulose or keratin based materials, such as cotton or wool, respectively. Spider silk is added to some of the proteins in order to make colored silk proteins that can be made into fibers, which would erase the need for the dyeing step from the textile value chain completely. Our experiments were focused on binding tests and silk fiber production.:::2018
