The morphology of pyroptosis is characterized by cell swelling which causes the release of cytoplasmic contents. Recent studies have demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of GasderminD protein accounts for pyroptosis of the host cell, which may be exploited for tumor suppression. In our project, we redesign Salmonella to act as a delivery vehicle that can target tumor cells and replicate in their cytoplasm. By inducing the bacterial expression of the N-terminal domain of GasderminD, bacteria are led to lysis and release this protein into the cytoplasm of tumor cell and then induce pyroptosis to the tumor cell by making membrane pores. The lysate of cell rupture during pyroptosis destroys the tumor microenvironment and attracts immune cells into tumor bed to kill tumor cells. Our project which aims to induce pyroptosis to tumor cells provides a new approach for cancer therapy.:::2018
