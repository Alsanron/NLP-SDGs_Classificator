Tec-Monterrey:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.Coding:::CRISPR-Cas technology has the capability of storing information. This year, iGEM team Tec-Monterrey aims to use the CRISPR-Cas system to store specific DNA sequences in the genome of E. coli in order to save information about the environment surrounding the bacteria. To make this possible, Cas1-Cas2 proteins, which create the protospacer acquisition in the CRISPR system, are used to insert a synthetic DNA sequence in the CRISPR array within the genome of the bacteria. This synthetic sequence is produced by a second system, called SCRIBE. The final step of our project is reading out the inserted DNA sequence. Using specific primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are used to amplify a section of the CRISPR array where the sequence is inserted. Taking together both systems, our project intends to act as a biological tape recorder capable of sensing external stimuli in the environment and storing their presence in the genome.:::2018
