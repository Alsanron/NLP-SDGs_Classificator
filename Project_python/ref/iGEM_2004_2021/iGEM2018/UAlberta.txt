UAlberta:::North America:::Canada:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Developing an Antifungal Porphyrin-based Intervention System (APIS) to treat Nosema infections in honey bees:::Nosema ceranae is a microsporidian parasite which infects the European honey bee, Apis mellifera. Nosema infections cause energetic stress in bees and decreases their immune response. The detrimental effects of Nosema can lead to lower hive productivity, and ultimately colony failure. To counteract this infection, Team UAlberta designed an Antifungal Porphyrin-based Intervention System (APIS) to treat Nosema infections in honey bees. APIS uses a modified heme biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), the eighth intermediate in the pathway. When ingested, PPIX-like molecules have been shown to decrease N. ceranae spore load in infected bees. Re-introducing the heme pathway in E. coli controlled by an inducible promoter overproduces PPIX using existing cell machinery. APIS allows bypassing of mechanisms regulating the endogenous pathway. Our system allows for directly introducing the bacteria into bees, as well as the mass production of PPIX in bioreactors.:::2018
