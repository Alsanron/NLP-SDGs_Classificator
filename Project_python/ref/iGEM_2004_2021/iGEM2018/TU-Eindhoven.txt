TU-Eindhoven:::Europe:::Netherlands:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::GelCatraz: Where E. Coli goes to stay! A Novel platform for Living Materials.:::Living biomaterials are expected to revolutionize the field of medicine. This new class of devices, which incorporates biomaterials and harnesses the synthetic powers of living cells, would enable numerous applications ranging from replacement organs to personalized point-of-care medicine production. A major obstacle for the use of Living Biomaterials outside the lab is bacterial leakage, presenting both a technical issue and a safety risk. Our project aims to address this issue. We have engineered a strain of E. Coli to anchor itself into a novel dextran hydrogel by expressing an adhesive protein derived from arctic ice-binding bacteria. This platform would enable innumerable applications. As a proof of concept, we have designed a patch for chronic wounds in which anchored E. coli would secrete antimicrobial peptides to fight infections and reduce the need for systemic antibiotics and daily change of wound dressing â€“ a painful procedure for many patients.:::2018
