SCUT-ChinaA:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Enhancing limonene biosynthesis by a high efficiency enzyme self-assembly system:::Terpenoid flavor and fragrance compounds (TFFCs) show extensive application in nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and food industries that have rapid grow market demands. The use of GRAS microorganisms to convert natural raw materials into aroma compounds can be described as natural products, which have been considered as one of the most promising strategies. However, fermentive TFFCs produced by engineered microbes mostly only obtain intermediates or low yields of end-product currently. This study proposes a non-conditional yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as a chassis for TFFCs production, in which limonene was chose as target product. By employing synthetic biology technology including gibson assembly, CRISPR/Cas9 and protein scaffold, we develop a high-performance enzyme self-assembling system (HESS) to rewiring the pathway into limonene accumulation. Furthermore, the MVA pathway will be enhanced by overexpression of two rate-limiting enzymes (HMG1 and ERG12) for increasing the production. This project will provide an alternative metabolic engineering strategy for biosynthesis of TFFCs.:::2018
