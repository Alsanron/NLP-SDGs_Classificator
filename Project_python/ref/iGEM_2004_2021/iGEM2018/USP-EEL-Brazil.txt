These compounds, also known as estrogens, are highly toxic to fish and may cause long-term harmful effects in humans and other animals.The lack of effective treatment of effluents to remove these micro pollutants has led to the contamination of water reservoirs and pollution of the environment. Our team's proposal was the development of a method for the removal of these estrogens from water. To achieve this goal, we cloned and expressed genetically engineered laccases from filamentous fungi in E. coli strains. Laccases are copper-containing enzymes that act in the oxidation of a various range of phenolic substrates, including EDCs. We plan to explore laccases as model environmental friendly biocatalyzers applied in the biodegradation of estrogenic compounds in water and effluent treatment stations, which can greatly improve water quality.:::2018
