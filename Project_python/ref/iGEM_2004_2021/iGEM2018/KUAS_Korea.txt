KUAS_Korea:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: Bacterial Evolutionary Game Simulation (BEGS) for Snowdrift, Harmony, Stag Hunt and Prisoner's Dilemma Games:::How does microbial community perpetuate or perish? Like human society, in nature, microorganisms not only compete but also cooperate with each other for a successful establishment of a microbial community. The major goal of our project is to construct an accessible evolutionary game model using a synthetic microbial population controlled by genetic circuits. Here, we use E. coli to form a microbial population composed of the "cooperator" and the "cheater". "Cooperator" which displays β-glucosidase on the cell surface breaks down cellobiose into glucose. This enzymatic activity allows both "cooperator" and "cheater" to share glucose as an energy source (public goods). "Cheater" which expresses GFP is now able to proliferate within microbe population by glucose from cooperator. Based on the combination of mathematical modeling and experiments, we are going to find critical parameters for evolutionary games such as harmony, snow-drift and prisoner’s dilemma for controlling population dynamics of the microbial community.:::2018
