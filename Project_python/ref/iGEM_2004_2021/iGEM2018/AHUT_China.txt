AHUT_China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Carbon dioxide purifier:::With greenhouse effect becoming a widespread concern in recent years, how to effectively capture CO2 has become a worldwide problem. At present, CO2 capture mostly includes absorption, adsorption and membrane methods, etc., which have problems with high cost, high energy consumption for regeneration and secondary pollution. CO2 capture using carbonic anhydrase has attracted extensive attention due to its high catalytic efficiency and environmentally friendly properties. First, our project successfully expressed wide type carbonic anhydrase in E. coli, however, its industrial application was limited due to poor stability and easy inactivation. Therefore, based on this, molecular simulation technology was used to investigate effect of amino acid residues mutation on the conformation and activity of enzyme, and the mutant carbonic anhydrase with higher thermal stability was obtained. The experimental results showed that the purified mutant carbonic anhydrase exhibited higher stability and activity than wild type carbonic anhydrase, achieving efficient capture of CO2.:::2018
