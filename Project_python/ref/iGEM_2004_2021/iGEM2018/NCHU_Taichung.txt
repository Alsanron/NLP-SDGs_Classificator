NCHU_Taichung:::Asia:::Taiwan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineered Endophyte-Assisted Phytoremediation:::Endophyte can live inside the plants and work together with them without causing harm to the host plant. With the large and deep root system of plants, the endophyte can have further impact in soil. A serious case of soil contamination is dioxin pollution after the Vietnam War. Dioxin is a group of toxic compounds that accumulate in the environment and are difficult to break down naturally. Tackle with large area soil dioxin contamination is hard, since the most efficient way to clean up is burning, which is eco-unfriendly and costly. Our project combines phytoremediation and engineered endophyte to clean dioxin-contaminated soil. We engineered an endophyte with membrane transporter, dehalogenase and laccase to intake and break down dioxin, and created biobricks compatible shuttle vector that can express in a well-researched endophyte, Burkholderia phytofirmans. This platform can potentially apply to projects that related to or benefit from plant-microbe interaction.:::2018
