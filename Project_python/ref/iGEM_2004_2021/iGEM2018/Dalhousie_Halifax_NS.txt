Dalhousie_Halifax_NS:::North America:::Canada:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Microbial Approach to Detecting Toxic Aluminum:::As a result of acid rain, levels of toxic aluminum are rising in Nova Scotia rivers. These aluminum levels correlate with dramatic declines in Atlantic Salmon populations. Measuring aluminum levels is expensive, making it difficult for community groups that protect rivers in Nova Scotia to track aluminum levels. To decrease this cost, we designed a sensitive and inexpensive biosensor to detect levels of toxic aluminum. Our team is making use of the natural product pyoverdine, a fluorescent compound that certain pseudomonads produce to scavenge iron. While the enzymes responsible for pyoverdine synthesis are known, it is not known what steps in the pyoverdine synthesis pathway may be rate-limiting. We are overexpressing pyoverdine enzymes to determine the rate-limiting step. We are developing a fluorescent aluminum biosensor, which could be used as a “point-of-care” diagnostic for at-risk rivers. This will enable targeting of mitigation strategies and better profiling of aluminum levels.:::2018
