Stanford-Brown-RISD:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Functionalizing mycotecture:::A turtle carries its own habitat. While it is reliable, it costs energy. NASA makes the same trade-off when it transports habitats and other structures needed to lunar and planetary surfaces increasing upmass, and affecting other mission goals. But what if it didnâ€™t have to be transported from earth? What if it could be grown on planet? The Stanford-Brown-RISD iGEM team proposes to explore the use of fungal mycelium, the vegetative structure of fungi, as a light-weight, durable material that could be grown on planet using spores to create habitats and other necessary items. The team will focus on developing a design for a habitat from mycelium as a proof of concept, and using synthetic biology to enhance the filtration and adhesion capabilities of the mycelium. The team will further explore the implications and uses of these biodegradable, self-growing structures made of fungi on Earth.:::2018
