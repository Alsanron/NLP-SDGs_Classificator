In previous iGEM projects related to formaldehyde, several problems still need to improved, such as 1) the present sensing threshold of formaldehyde concentration (~ 10 ppm) is far upper beyond the environment-protecting standard (~ 0.1 ppm); 2) the degrading system seems to work unstably, although some survival or duration after formaldehyde addition was observed. Our project is aiming to construct a more sensitive and effective E. coli-based system for detecting and further degrading formaldehyde in environments, basing on current systems (already registered as BioBrick parts).:::2018
