UESTC-China:::Asia:::China:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Straw-Degrading Energy E.coli:::With the development of agriculture, the yield of straw is huge, and it grows rapidly around the world every year. However, due to the complex structure of straw, current physical and chemical methods not only consume a lot of energy, but also create potential air pollution problems, while existing biological methods still require pretreatment by chemicals. Therefore, how to use straw effectively has become a problem we need to consider. Fortunately, we have found a bifunctional enzyme, xyn10D-fae1A from a paper, which directly decomposes straw and converts it into useful chemical raw materials â€“ cellulose, lignin, ferulic acid and xylose. In addition, considering the energy shortage, we also convert cellulose to butanol and hydrogen to make more efficient use of cellulose.:::2018
