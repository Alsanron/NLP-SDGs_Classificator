UIOWA:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Investigating biosensors for the industrial production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid::: Many industrial manufacturing processes revolve around the molecule 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP). This organic molecule can be used in a variety of industrial products, from biofuels to bioplastic production. While much research is focusing on maximizing the production of this important molecule, our team belongs to a smaller subset focused on finding ways to sense and measure its production. In a recent study, genes from the bacteria Pseudomonas putida were incorporated into Escherichia coli and demonstrated that re-purposed regulatory proteins from P. putida could be used as a biosensor for 3HP (Hanko et al. 2017). A separate study identified similar 3HP responsive genes in Pseudomonas denitrificans (Zhou et al. 2015). Our research team has transformed a promoter-regulator system that recognizes 3HP into Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis is a hardy bacterium that has great potential as a 3HP producer for industrial processes and metabolic engineering experiments.:::2018
