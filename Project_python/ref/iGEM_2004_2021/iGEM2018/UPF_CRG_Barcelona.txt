UPF_CRG_Barcelona:::Europe:::Spain:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Probiotics to fight metastasis: Engineering E. coli to regulate fatty acid metabolism:::Prevention of metastasis remains a challenge for modern medicine. Recent experimental evidences indicate that metastasis development correlates directly on dietary long chain fatty acids (LCFA) intake, such as palmitic acid (PA). Hence, targeting fatty acid availability in the intestine could prevent cancer cells from spreading. Here a safe, effective and affordable solution is proposed by the design of a probiotic with increased LCFA uptake, GARGANTUA. We approached this by modulating the beta-oxidation family genes in E. coli. Moreover, we developed the first LCFA intracellular biosensor that does not interfere with its metabolism. This will provide a tool able to characterize LCFA uptake. We also developed a framework for the genomic integration of the uptake machinery, as a way to increase safety and robustness of our device. GARGANTUA provides a proof of concept for an alternative approach for metastasis prevention with potential applications in metabolic disease treatment.:::2018
