BostonU:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Characterizing Inducible Tools for Dynamic Control of Transcription in Budding Yeast:::BostonU is characterizing and optimizing two light-inducible promoters, LOV2 and PhiReX, in S. cerevisiae to improve eukaryotic transcriptional control with applications in industrial fermentation. Light-inducible promoters lend greater spatiotemporal control over transcription than small molecule-inducible promoters. Further, LOV2 is activated by blue light and PhiReX by red light, allowing for multiplexed control. We characterize these systems using the eVOLVER, a novel automated cell culturing platform developed by Brandon Wong at Boston University’s Khalil Lab. The eVOLVER’s specificity and high throughput allows for unprecedented characterization across light pulse programs, temperature, and OD thresholds. We then apply LOV2 and PhiReX to the violacein pathway, demonstrating the induction of four distinctly-colored phenotypes in a single strain, providing a proof-of-concept for the multiplexed control and finely-tuned expression of genes required for effective control of metabolic flux via transcriptional regulation.:::2018
