DLUT_China_B:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Homehold portable urine analyzer for early diagnosis and monitoring of chronic kidney diseases:::In order to provide regular screening and early prevention for potential patient populations, it provides home portable visual detection. This project is aimed at chronic kidney disease caused by hypertensive and diabetes.In the early stages of the diseaseï¼Œit can provides medical advice by testing the content of early indicator beta2 microglobulin in the urine. We can get the concentration of the beta2 microglobulin by color change of the liquid crystal film which substance is the orientation change of the liquid crystal molecules caused by the antigen-antibody reaction on the liquid crystal substrate.The aldehyde group at the carbon terminal of the nano-antibody is modified by a screening and co-expression system, and then C18 is attached to enhance its ability to induce liquid crystal molecules, so that the nano-antibody fully satisfies the needs of liquid crystal detection.This project provides prophylactic measures for patients, early recognition and timely treatment.:::2018
