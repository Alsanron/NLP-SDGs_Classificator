BNDS_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::A. hydrophila Killer:::Aeromonas hydrophila is an ubiquitous gram-negative opportunistic pathogen in aquaculture. Every year, it causes a variety of diseases in fish. The symptoms include ulcers, fin rot, and hemorrhagic septicaemia. When A. hydrophila enters fish body, it often colonise in the gastrointestinal tract first. The pathogen's virulence factors secretion systems are controlled by N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)-dependent quorum-sensing system based on the ahyRI locus. Since the pathogen has developed resistance to most common antibiotics, our project targets to develop an A. hydrophila killer by engineering the fish probiotics, Escherichia coli MG1655. The killer expresses lactonase to degrade quorum sensing signals from the pathogen in aim of reducing the production of virulence factors. Also, it expresses antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to inhibit the growth of A. hydrophila directly. We plan to regulate lactonase and AMPs expression by using Prhl promoter, which is induced by the pathogenâ€™s dominant quorum sensing molecule, C4-HSL.:::2018
