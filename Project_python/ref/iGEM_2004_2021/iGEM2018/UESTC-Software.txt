UESTC-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioMaster: An integrated bio-brick database::: BioMaster is an integrated bio-brick database with the function of promoter prediction. We improved and standardized the information of bio-bricks in iGEM Registry by integrating information in databases like Uniprot, Epd, GO, etc. So BioMaster provides more comprehensive information about bio-bricks, including their functions, sites, interactions and references. With these, bio-bricks could be used and designed in a more reasonable way. Meanwhile, BioMaster offers more user-friendly searching methods. In addition, we provided a promoter prediction tool based on machine learning, in which promoter sequences can be found in unlabeled gene sequences. Via this tool, a promoter database predicted from E. coli genome was constructed, it contains a quantity of promoter sequences and information about the gene to which the sequences belong. We believe that this brand-new bio-brick database, BioMaster, can provide more conveniences for synthetic biologists.:::2018
