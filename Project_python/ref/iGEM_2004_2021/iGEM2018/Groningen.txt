Groningen:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::StyGreen: Bioplastic from cellulosic waste through consolidated bioprocessing:::Current production of styrene, an important plastic monomer, is oil based. As an alternative to oil based styrene we aim to produce styrene from a presently underused wastestream: cellulosic waste. Our system consists of both breaking down cellulose to glucose and subsequent styrene production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. First the cellulose is degraded by an established cellulosome complex containing different cellulases and a cellulose binding domain. By complexing the cellulases and anchoring the complex to the cell wall the efficiency of the cellulosome is enhanced synergistically. The freed glucose is taken up and used for growth and production of phenylalanine. Conversion of phenylalanine to styrene occurs in two steps, first the phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme (PAL2) is introduced, which enables the yeast to convert phenylalanine into trans-cinnamate. The final step of our cascade is catalyzed by a native enzyme, producing styrene from trans-cinnamate.:::2018
