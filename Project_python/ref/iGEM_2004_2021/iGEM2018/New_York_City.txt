New_York_City:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Testing the efficacy of mRNA displacement technique in huntingtin cell lines to treat Huntingtonâ€™s Disease:::Huntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder that leads to the progressive degeneration of neurons in the brain, which currently has no cure. HD is typically adult-onset and is characterized by a variety of symptoms including memory loss, involuntary movements, poor coordination, and impaired decision-making. Mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene causes HD, specifically a trinucleotide repeat of CAG that is abnormally repeated over 40 times. The goal of our project was to test the effectiveness of the plasmid that we generated last year, which targets and blocks endogenous faulty mRNA and releases a corrected RNA strand for proper protein synthesis of the HTT gene. The efficacy of this plasmid was tested on huntingtin cell lines, specifically the HeLa/polyQ-mCFP cell line. The effectiveness of this treatment was tested by evaluating whether the quantity of mutated HTT protein decreases after transfecting cells with the engineered plasmid.:::2018
