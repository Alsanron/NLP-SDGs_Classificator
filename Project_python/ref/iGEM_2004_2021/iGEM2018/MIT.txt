MIT:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Porting the ComCDE System of Streptococcus mutans into HEK Cells as a Potential Caries Treatment:::Cariogenesis is facilitated by the growth of dense, adherent biofilm on the surface of teeth. This process is largely initiated by Streptococcus mutans through quorum sensing, a process by which S. mutans release Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP) to activate a two-component signaling system (ComCDE) in neighboring cells, leading to critical bacterial mass formation on the tooth surface. Here, we engineer mammalian cells to sense CSP and biofilm formation by incorporating the ComCDE system into Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells. In turn, our engineered HEK cells process the signal and actuate a response by secretion of kappa casein, a protein with known anti-biofilm activity. We envision these cells being administered through either an oral device worn overnight or as a cell therapy injected into patientsâ€™ gums by dental professionals. Ultimately, our system will allow cells in the oral cavity to automatically detect and combat cariogenesis, preventing the onset of dental caries.:::2018
