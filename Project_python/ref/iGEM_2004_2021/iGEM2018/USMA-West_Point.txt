USMA-West_Point:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Developing bacterial mammalian olfactory system-based chemical biosensors:::Artificial bio-sensors based on the mammalian olfactory system are potentially powerful chemical analytical systems for many industrial, medical and security applications. The ability to express mammalian proteins make bacteria a potentially powerful platform for developing artificial chemical biosensors. Bacteria, however, lack several of the intracellular signaling proteins required to alter cell membrane field potential changes in response to odorant binding. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a plasmid containing a synthetic bacterial operon that enables the expression of multiple genes under the control of the upstream regulatory promoter for the AraC gene. In this proof-of-principle system, synthetic operon will be expressed in E.coli with a separate plasmid that co-expresses a human odorant receptor protein. These studies will provide the foundation for future work to develop synthetic operons can be used to heterologously express the multiple proteins required to develop bacterial chemical biosensors based on the mammalian olfactory system.:::2018
