UCSC:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Portable Progesterone Production in Yeast (PoPPY):::Women around the world lack adequate access to safe and affordable methods of contraception. The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) iGEM team will create a safe, sustainable, and cheap progesterone-based contraceptive for all women, regardless of location or status. We will engineer the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica (Yali) to synthesize progesterone. Yali naturally produces a progesterone precursor, ergosterol. We will add five genes to the yeast genome to induce steroid hormone production by completing the progesterone biosynthesis pathway. We will insert these genes into Yali via three parallel experiments: Gibson cloning followed by homologous recombination, yeast-mediated cloning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae followed by Cre-lox recombination into Yali, and yeast-mediated cloning followed by Cre-lox into Yali. Following these experiments, we will monitor progesterone production to determine a safe, effective contraceptive dosage. On proper growth media, our self-replicating yeast biofactory will produce progesterone and provide a sustainable source of contraception.:::2018
