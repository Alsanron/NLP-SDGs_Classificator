BOKU-Vienna:::Europe:::Austria:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ROBOCROP â€“Turning Genes ON and OFF, in Yeast and Arabidopsis through a dCas9 Toggle Switch:::Our goal, communication with eukaryotes, is achieved through the heart piece of our model, the dCas9 Toggle Switch. This will allow switching between two stable states of gene expression. It consists of 2 gene classes which we simply call the ON and OFF genes. One gene in each class, which is considered the primary gene, codes for a gRNA which represses the antagonistic set of genes by binding to dCas9 and further blocking transcription though CRISPR Interference. The switch can be activated either by signal molecules binding to a receptor or directly by liposome bound gRNA that is taken up by the cell. As a proof of concept, the ON gene contains a GFP coding sequence as a reporter gene. Our design is very universal and has many possible applications in the lab and in agriculture, such as controlling flowering time of plants to protect them from late frost.:::2018
