Lubbock_TTU:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Expanding the Synthetic Biology Toolkit for Polyamine Production:::	The metabolic engineering of E. coli has significant potential to provide an accessible cellular factory for the in vivo production of essential chemicals during space exploration. Recognizing the versatility of using E. coli for bio-manufacturing during space travel, we investigate applications in polyamine production. In particular, a diamine known as putrescine with medicinal and materials applications. To expand on earlier improvements of the product yield for putrescine in E. coli, we explore modifying the W3110 strain of K-12 E. coli. Additionally, we explore the use of TX-TL cell-free synthetic biology to design transcription factor-based biosensors for the detection of improved putrescine yield and to monitor other small molecules of interest. With these strategies we hope to improve the yield of putrescine in E. coli and to expand the synthetic biology toolkit for metabolic engineering.:::2018
