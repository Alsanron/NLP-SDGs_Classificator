See with HCG!:::Detection is essential in providing an illustration of the chemical world around us. Currently, fluorescent protein are used as reporters but they require additional analysis with expensive and immobile equipment. We propose to create an alternative detection system kit using recombinant Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) as a reporter. The goal of our project is to create an easy, cost-effective, and sensitive detection device for use in synthetic biology, it can even be used by other iGEM teams to get an all-or-nothing response indicating the presence of targeted protein using pregnancy test strips. We plan to create a pGEX plasmid containing recombinant HCG preceded by new restriction sites which is where the promoter is inserted, only to be activated in the presence of the protein in question. Then when a pregnancy test strip is inserted in the sample, it will trigger the response based on the activation of the introduced promoter.:::2018
