NWU-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Salt eater:::The lopsided ratio of ions(too much Na+ and less K+) of saline soil could affect the growing of the crop[1] such as wheat and rice. The high concentration of Na+ in sea water limits our range of drinking water. To solve those problems ,we need to distinguish the potassium ions and the sodium ions.But because of the similarity between K+ and Na+ (radius of ion and chemical charaters), it is very difficult to distinguish them in solution. And alternatively we need to exclude or absorb sodium ions in an efficient way.We decided to use ion channel to meet both requirements simultaneously.:::2018
