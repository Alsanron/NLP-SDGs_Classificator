SCAU-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Desertification combating strategy: bacterial cellulose biosynthesis in desert surviving cyanobacteria:::Desertification is becoming a serious global problem. Great efforts have been put into the desertification control by introducing various methods. Here, we take advantage of using genetic engineering and synthetic biology as powerful tools to propose a new strategy for the densification control. We use Acetobacter xylinus which is a model bacterium for producing cellulose. Its cellulose can be used for water conserving both soil and moisture. On the other hand, Microcolus vaginatus is a dry land living cyanobacteria which is an ideal bioreactor for producing bacterial cellulose. We cloned seven key genes that are critically required for bacterial cellulose synthesis from Acetobacter xylinus and expressed them in cyanobacteria. Additionally, we employed computer modeling and prediction to optimized the production of cellulose. Finally, we successfully achieved the cellulose production from the transgenic cyanobacteria and its cultivation on sands. Together, we have developed a new and low-cost method for desertification control.:::2018
