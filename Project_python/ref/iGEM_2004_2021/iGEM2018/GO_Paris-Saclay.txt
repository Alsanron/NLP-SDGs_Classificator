GO_Paris-Saclay:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MethotrExit: a HeteroGenious Cleaning Factory:::Cytotoxic anticancer drugs are among the harmful chemicals found in hospital wastewater at high concentrations. Degradation through physical and chemical methods exist but are often inefficient, unsustainable or expensive. We propose MethotrExit, a bioreactor-based approach to tackle this problem. We focused on the biotransformation of methotrexate (MTX), a widely used anticancer drug. We designed synthetic cassettes encoding a new biotransformation pathway using a heterologous carboxypeptidase in Escherichia coli. In only five hours, MethotrExit drastically removes MTX from the media. However, anticancer drug degradation products and/or the biotransformation pathway itself might be toxic for E. coli. To overcome this issue, biobricks generating heterogeneity in enzyme expression were built to ensure survival of a subpopulation. Modeling of this system highlights the interest of a division of labor between “cleaning” and “stem” bacterial cells.:::2018
