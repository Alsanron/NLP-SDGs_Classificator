In aquaponics, accumulation of copper ions is toxic to organisms. In sight of this, we aimed to create a cost-effective device for metal ions removal from water. In this project, metallothioneins, a type of protein capable of binding metal ions, was expressed in E. coli. Copper absorption capacity of the transformed bacteria is tested. From our results, E. coli can absorb copper ions at 10 mg/L and 2 mg/L. The is no significance difference between untransformed and transformed bacteria at 10 mg/L. At 2 mg/L, the transformed bacteria expressing Elsholtzia haichowensis Metallothionein 1 (EhMT1) slightly enhances the copper absorption ability. At last, we tried circulating E. coli inside dialysis tubings, receiving positive results, it is confirmed the idea using bacteria to remove copper ions in water is feasible.:::2018
