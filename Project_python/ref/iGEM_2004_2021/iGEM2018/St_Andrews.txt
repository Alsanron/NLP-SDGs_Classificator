St_Andrews:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A system for detection of bacterial cell lysis and the presence of biofilms:::A split mNeongreen fluorophore system was employed such that one half of the protein was retained within a certain population of Escherichia coli, while a different population exported the other component. Upon lysis of the former group, the two protein domains associated to form the complete molecule, which fluoresced detectably. Regarding the detection of biofilms, several methods were tested. An mCherry fluorophore was fused to binding proteins for each of the following components of biofilms: the polysaccharides alginate and Psl (major components of the biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa), cellulose, and double stranded RNA. Studies were carried out to determine which of these most accurately predicted the presence or absence of biofilms as compared with the results of traditional detection methods.:::2018
