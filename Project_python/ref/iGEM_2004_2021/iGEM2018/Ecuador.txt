Bacterial cellulose is used as a bandage matrix. The fusion proteins have the following parts: CBD, ELP and BMP2. CBDs function is to bind to cellulose, the ELP protein gives greater flexibility to the bandage, while the BMP2 protein, an inducer of cell differentiation in osteoblasts, is responsible for reducing the recovery time of the bones. To achieve the objective, the expression of the cellulose and the fusion proteins is carried out separately. For bacterial cellulose, is used an Escherichia coli expression system, in two plasmids: psb1C3 responsible for cellulose synthesis and psb1A3 responsible for the synthesis of the export system and overproduction. For the fusion protein, is used plasmid psb1C3, which contain the genes for the proteins CBD, ELP and BMP2.:::2018
