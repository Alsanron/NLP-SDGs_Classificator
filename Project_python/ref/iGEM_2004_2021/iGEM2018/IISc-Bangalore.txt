IISc-Bangalore:::Asia:::India:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PhageShift: Improving treatment of bacterial infections through novel modifications to conventional phage therapeutics:::Bacteriophages have long been proclaimed as the answer to antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. However, simultaneous resistance to phages and antibiotics is a concerning possibility. Anticipating this problem, we have developed an in-silico protein modification algorithm that hard-codes mutual exclusion of antibiotic and phage resistance. An engineered phage with high affinity for phosphoethanolamine, the molecule that confers colistin resistance, has been developed as a proof-of-concept. This system has potential applications in drug delivery, ligand extraction and study of bacterial membrane proteins. We are also building a phage mediated immune recruitment system that ensures removal of the pathogen without significant toxin release - a fatal condition in immuno-compromised individuals. This is accomplished by a monocyte chemokine encoded into a lysis deficient phage genome that recruits phagocytic immune cells to the site of infection. PhageShift thus takes a leap forward in addressing potential problems with phage therapeutics before they arise.:::2018
