Tartu_TUIT:::Europe:::Estonia:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Eco-friendly sunscreen: MAAs+yeast extract:::Nowadays a great number of commercially produced sunscreens contain chemical compounds with a broad-spectrum ultraviolet coverage, such as oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are extremely toxic to the environment. Every year around 14,000 tons of sunscreen is washed into the oceans and seas, resulting in a dramatic increase of the toxicity level, causing a variety of pathologies to corals. Tatru_TUIT iGEM team will engineer S. cerevisiae to produce yeast extract enriched with biological sunscreen compounds Shinorine and Porphyra-334, both of which belong to Mycosporine-like Amino Acids (MAA). In order to produce MAAs, we will introduce 4 genes from cyanobacteria Nostoc commune KU002 (MysA, MysB, MysC, MysD) or Actinosynnema mirum DSM 43827(amir_4259, amir_4258, amir_4257, amir_4256) into yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our final product, which combines positive properties of both biological sunscreen compounds and yeast extract, could be further used in cosmetic products like creams, lotions, etc.:::2018
