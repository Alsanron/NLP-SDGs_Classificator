Duke:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Optimized Taxol Biosynthesis in E. Coli:::Taxol is a natural molecule found in the bark of the Pacific Yew tree that has been used to treat a variety of cancers. Current manufacturing methods are unable to achieve high yields; the aim of our project is to greatly improve manufacturing outputs and reduce costs through biosynthesis of taxol from an intermediate in the synthesis pathway in E. coli. We used a modular approach to link the five necessary genes together before recombineering the construct into the E. coli genome; our design thus can be easily adapted to produce next generation taxanes. Five T7 bacteriophage promoters of varying strengths were selected from a promoter library and fitted in random combinations to the pathway genes. The resulting variants were screened to determine which combination of promoters maximized taxol synthesis. Finally, we analyzed the activity of produced taxol and evaluated this biosynthesis designâ€™s feasibility in industrially relevant conditions.:::2018
