BUCT-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Research and Construction of Fatty Acids and Glyoxylic Acid Operons:::The regulation of expression in the process of life is the essence of life. The construction of gene expression regulation network has become the key to explain the mystery of life. However, due to its complexity and diversity, it is necessary to study its subunit Â¬-operator first. . In this experiment, experiments were carried out by experimental ideas such as controlled experiments and deductive methods. Through the design process, operon prediction, operon verification, quantitative analysis, model establishment and other experimental processes, the research and construction of multi-class fatty acids and glyoxylate operons were carried out. Through many experiments, this experiment successfully constructed fatty acid, glyoxylate operon, and found a suitable substrate for fatty acid operons: hydroxy fatty acids. At the same time, quantitative experiments have also made some progress. Based on the qualitative and quantitative experiments, we also established the mode.:::2018
