XJTU-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DEcose: A Biosensor-based Directed Evolution Method in Promoting D-psicose Productivity:::D-psicose, the C-3 epimer of fructose, is a natural rare sugar that is low in energy, which exerts several potential health benefits, including preventing diabetes development. Bioproduction of D-psicose shows promise but suffers severely from low enzyme activity. Directed evolution (DE) is an effective strategy for optimizing various enzymes. However, high throughput is never achieved when screening manually or using conventional methods such as HPLC to monitor metabolite concentration. To overcome such difficulties, we have constructed the Sensing, Coupling, Selecting and Iterating framework of DE with quantitative regulatory mechanisms underlying each step. D-psicose productivity is first converted into mRNA expression level, then couples with genes conveying survival advantages by tunable hairpin cassette. The procedure iterates itself in evolving more effective enzymes. This framework for DE could hopefully be applied to improve the functionality of other biomolecules, as long as a suitable biosensor for the final product exists.:::2018
