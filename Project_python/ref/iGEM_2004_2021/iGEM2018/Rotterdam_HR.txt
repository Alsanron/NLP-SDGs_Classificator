Rotterdam_HR:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Open:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Selective carbon monoxide detection using the CO binding receptor protein CooA in E. coli.:::Modified bacteria that are present in our product contain the CooA receptor gene which codes for the synthesis of a receptor protein named CooA. This CooA receptor can bind with the carbon monoxide derived from the polluted environment. The binding of the CooA receptor with carbon monoxide results in a change of the protein structure. Due to the changed structure, the CooA protein will be able to bind to a CooA sensitive promoter on the bacterial DNA. The binding of the CooA receptor with the promoter enables the synthesis of the enzyme urease. Accordingly, the formed urease converts the urea which is present in the medium into CO2. The released CO2 gas in the medium will be collected. When a certain threshold is reached in the amount of produced gas an increase in the resistance between two electrodes will occur. Finally, the detected change in resistance will activate the alarm.:::2018
