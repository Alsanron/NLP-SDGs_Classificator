Pittsburgh:::North America:::United States:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Chronological Event Recording of Stimuli using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Base Editing:::The ability to measure and record molecular signals in a cell is critical. Current systems are limited in that they can only take a “snapshot” of the environment, preventing scientists from understanding event order. Previously systems have utilized a CRISPR/Cas9 base editor complex (BE), which can record information in DNA by producing permanent single nucleotide changes; however, recording capability was limited to logging an average concentration of stimuli over a period of time. Our system builds upon these foundations by designing a method of true chronological event recording. By introducing recording plasmids with repeating units of DNA and multiple gRNA to direct our base editor construct, we can achieve true temporal resolution of stimuli. Furthermore, we simplified the readout, so inexpensive laboratory equipment can be used. This technique will provide an understanding of the order in which molecules and proteins appear in systems, illuminating the hidden, casual relationships.:::2018
