Utrecht:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DeTaXion: a synthetic biology-based biosensor to detect environmental pollutants:::Water is one of our most precious resources. Unfortunately, increased use of chemicals such as pharmaceuticals threatens this ecosystem. These contaminants are often difficult to detect. We therefore developed Detaxion, a biosensor to rapidly identify chemical contaminants in water. Detaxion is based on the E. coli chemotaxis system. We engineered the CheY and CheZ chemotaxis proteins to form a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) pair. Upon binding of chemicals to the TAR chemotaxis receptor, BRET fluorescence emission changes in a quantifiable manner. We additionally used receptor ligand binding domain swapping to expand the range of detectable chemicals. Finally, we modified receptor methylation sites to extend the detection range. Our results thus far show successful fluorescence energy transfer. Moreover, we used a capillary-based assay to confirm BRET measurements. Taken together, Detaxion constitutes a synthetic biology-based approach to detect chemical waste in water, to safeguard this vital resource.:::2018
