IISER-Kolkata:::Asia:::India:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BACMAN:::Arsenic contamination of ground water is a serious issue in West Bengal (India). Each year a large population falls victim to severe Arsenic poisoning due to ingestion of heavy doses of Arsenic through water and food over years. Small amounts of water can be purified before drinking using several available techniques such as chemical filtration kits etc. but no decontamination techniques exist to remove Arsenic uptaken by food crops (rice) or fishes through polluted water used to raise them in paddies or ponds. We, Team IISER-Kolkata plan to design a probiotic bacteria that can efficiently intake and sequester Arsenic at the physico-chemical conditions existing in the human gut. We aim to design an affordable and effective pill to administer the probiotic microbes into the gut. The microbes will then colonize in the gut and outcompete GI epithelia at Arsenic abosorption thus shielding humans from accumulating the ingested heavy-metal.:::2018
