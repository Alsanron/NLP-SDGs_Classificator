Toronto:::North America:::Canada:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Exploring biomass flotation as a viable separation technique for application in bioremediation processes:::Our project focuses on demonstrating flotation of Escherichia coli using gas vesicle proteins (GvPs) as a novel cellular separation technique for bioremediation processes. Previous iGEM teams have demonstrated gas vesicle production and flotation in mammalian and yeast cells using GvPs from various bacterial species. Shapiro et al., (2018) engineered a GvP-producing plasmid using arg1 from Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Bacillus megaterium to synthesize these echogenic structures and observed that high expression enabled E. coli to float. Our goal is to replicate and improve their flotation results by modifying arg1 to achieve consistent flotation using a specific induction protocol. We propose that using this technique may be a cost-effective separation technique for various bioremediation processes. Upon sorption or uptake of pollutants or valuable materials, this technique could allow for simpler extraction of pollutant-harboring or heavy metal-bound bacteria. We have developed a bioreactor model to investigate this claim.:::2018
