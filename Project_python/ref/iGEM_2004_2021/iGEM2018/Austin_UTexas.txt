Austin_UTexas:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Broad Host Range Plasmid Kit for Engineering Non-Model Bacteria:::Synthetic biologists often reach for a handful of well characterized organisms when designing experiments due to their ability to be reliably engineered with standard protocols. However, there are many non-model organisms that perform useful functions, survive extreme environments, or are optimized to produce certain materials which are largely ignored because the methods of engineering them are not well established. The broad host range kit aims to use genetic parts that function in a wide range of bacteria to make this process more efficient. The kit contains a combination of plasmid parts and assembled plasmids with origins of replication known to function in diverse bacteria. Each origin is linked to a fluorescent protein or chromoprotein so successful transformations can be easily identified when plated. Additionally, origins are associated with a specific barcode that can be sequenced to confirm the assembly. Several assemblies containing broad host range origins have been constructed.:::2018
