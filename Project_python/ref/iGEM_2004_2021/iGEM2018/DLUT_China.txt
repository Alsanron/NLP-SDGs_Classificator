DLUT_China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A mirobial agent for treating hyperuricemia:::Hyperuricemia refers to the symptom that the level of uric acid is unusually high in ,blood. It commonly affects joints and leads to the gouty arthritis which are shown as joint deformity. At present, the drugs for treatment of hyperuricemia show a strong side effect. Urate oxidase is an enzyme in organism that catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid in purine metabolism. It oxidizes uric acid to allantoin. Allantoin can be easily metabolized by the kidneys. To solve the above problems, introduced the gene encoding humanized urate oxidase into E. coli Nissle. After the patient consumes these bacteria, the recombinant strain will remain in the patient's intestine. When the uric acid concentration reaches the threshold, the strain can secrete urate oxidase which can reach the blood of the patient. In addition, we have set up a microbial population control and in vitro lethal system to make our strains safer.:::2018
