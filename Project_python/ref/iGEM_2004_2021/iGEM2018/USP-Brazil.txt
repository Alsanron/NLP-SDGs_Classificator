USP-Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::QS-Comms:::Quorum sensing is a mechanism for communication within and between bacterial populations, and it presents interesting possibilities for biotechnology in controlling populational behavior, ranging from task division in bioprocesses to biofilm disruption in infections. However, to generate complex patterns in a predictable manner, orthogonality between different quorum sensing pathways is essential, so the toolkit of quorum sensing parts needs to be thoroughly characterized, expanded and optimized so that this technology may see its full potential. Thus, our project aims to characterize activity and quantify the genetic crosstalk between a variety of quorum sensing systems that showed promising activity in prior works, while also using this information to predict, model and ultimately aid possible design applications and solutions for microbial communication. This way we will build on a growing bank of data of quorum sensing parts that will help future projects work with this technology.:::2018
