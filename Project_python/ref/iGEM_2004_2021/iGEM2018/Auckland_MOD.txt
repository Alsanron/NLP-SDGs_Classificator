Auckland_MOD:::Asia:::New Zealand:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Improving the Farmer, Environment and Nitrogen Use Efficiency:::Environmental pollution is a pressed global issue, even in clean, green New Zealand. Maintaining clean waterways is our responsibility as kaitiaki of the land (guardians in Te Reo Māori), but agricultural practices such as excess fertiliser application and cow effluent are flooding our New Zealand soils and waterways with urea. Taking a fluxomics approach in Arabidopsis thaliana, we are overexpressing a high-affinity urea transporter (DUR3) to upregulate the uptake of urea, and glutamine synthetase (GS1) to convert the toxic metabolite ammonia into glutamine. As a result, urea is removed more readily from the soil before it’s subject to groundwater leaching or surface run-off. We predict the increase in amino acid production will enhance plant growth. Applying our model to other plants like ryegrasses will allow farmers to grow pasture or forage crops that utilize urea on the paddock more efficiently, requiring less financial investment into urea fertilisers.:::2018
