LZU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::New therapy for gastric cancer based on TIL cells-exosomes mechanism::: Gastric cancer is one of the most popular digestive malignant carcinomas in the world. Exosomes are cell-derived nanovesicles and act as vesicles for delivering micromolecular like miRNA. Here, we turn HEK 293 T cells and MGC803 cells into a manufacturing factory, massively producing exosomes with our target miRNA in it,whose function is related to reduce the viability of tumor cells.The three miRNA is obtained by bioinformation analysis.To be continued, considering the heterogeneity of tumor cells, we use inducible promoter to active three miRNAs separately. By changing the inducers' concentration, we want to grope optimum functional concentration range of miRNAs. Finally, we hope that this system can be used in tumor infiltrating T cells. TIL is an inactive T lymphocyte in tumor tissue whose function is inhibited because of tumor microenvironment. If the TIL were armed with our controllable miRNAs, a new therapy for gastric cancer treatment would appeared.:::2018
