ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL:::Asia:::Turkey:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::LTNF 2.0: Circularized Venom Neutralizing Factor:::The Opossum (Didelphimorphia) is an animal with a very unique characteristic; it displays an outstanding resistance to toxins, snake venoms in particular. This anti-venom ability is gained through a single protein; the Lethal Toxin Neutralizing Factor (LTNF). We are attempting to produce an improved version of this anti-venom, LTNF 2.0 if you will, as a synthetic anti-venom for human use. LTNF 2.0 incorporates the post-translational modification process known as circularization, a process that comprises of adding cysteine amino acids to both ends of a polypeptide chain; triggering the formation of a disulphide bridge, ultimately leading to a circular structure, hence the name circularization. Circularized proteins are known for not only greater stability but also greater efficacy of the protein, thereby improving its shelf life and lowering the required dosage for treatment, ultimately providing a more efficient bioproduct.:::2018
