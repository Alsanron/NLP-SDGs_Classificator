XJTLU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::EXOport: A CNS-targeting mRNA-packaging exosome device:::In recent decades, scientists have advanced various drug delivery modalities to overcome the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which excludes most neurotherapeutics from entering the central nervous system (CNS), in order to treat CNS disorders. The emerging brain virotherapy using AAV vectors was reported to be immunogenic and costly in manufacturing. In addition, it is rather perilous that therapeutic viruses have to be administered into cerebrospinal fluid. Hence, this year, our team aims to engineer HEK293T cells to produce engineered exosomes, which are extracellular vesicles naturally capable of traversing BBB, hereby providing a low-risk platform for CNS mRNA therapy . The engineering includes: 1. boosting the production of exosomes; 2. facilitating therapeutic RNA to be packaged into exosomes; 3. increasing targeting specificity to neurons with low leakage during the transport of RNA cargo 4. prolonging the expression of therapeutic RNAs in the neurons:::2018
