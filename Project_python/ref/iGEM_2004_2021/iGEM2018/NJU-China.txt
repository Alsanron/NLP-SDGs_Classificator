NJU-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Surf in the neuron: A new strategy to target the dendrites:::With cell-type specific targeting exosomes expressing a special peptide on the exosomal membrane, we could deliver biological molecules to the neuronal cells. By this method, the localization of molecular cargos in the recipient cells is random and even. However, some molecules are localized at sub-cellular compartment naturally, like in neurons, several mRNAs are transported to the dendrites or axons. How to specifically deliver an exogenous mRNA to the neurites remains to be solved. We tested two cis-acting RNA elements (the 5’-UTRs of Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and the 3’-UTR of mouse β-Actin gene) to guide the mRNA. It turns out the shorter one, 5’-UTR of TBEV works better, and the 5’-UTR could be successfully applied to the AAV vector, carrying the mRNA into the neurites. Through our element, we could improve the targeting method to the sub-cellular level and provide new insights into future treatment of certain neuronal diseases.:::2018
