Tongji-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Alpha Ant::: Advancements in metabolic engineering have enabled us to engineer enzymes and construct novel pathways for various applications including drug discovery and value-added biochemical production. However, it is hard to design and construct pathways with high efficiency and fidelity while balancing the metabolic burden of the microorganism.Thus,our project is to develop powerful and convenient web tool for synthetic biologists to design proper metabolic pathways while taking into account several criteria such as thermodynamic feasibility, material competition of heterologous reactions, atom conservation, toxicity of intermediates.We obtain data from several databases, including KEGG,BRENDA,MetaCyc and equilibrator.The core algorithm we use is depth-first search. Other than that, we have some additional functions for users, including organism recommandation and FBA. Alpha Ant means its capacity to find the most efficient metabolic pathway is just like the ant colonyâ€™s intelligence of finding the most efficient path to a food source once it has been discovered by scouts.:::2018
