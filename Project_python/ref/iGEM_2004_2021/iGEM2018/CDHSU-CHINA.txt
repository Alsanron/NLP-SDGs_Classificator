CDHSU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Use genetically modified lactic acid bacteria to compound miraculin:::Nowadays, it is nearly impossible for the patients with diabetes mellitus to enjoy the sweat foods, and our project is designed to solve that problem. So far, there is one thing that could help us reach our purpose-- Synsepalum dulcificum. The key is that the Miraculin in the Synsepalum dulcificum Could turn the taste of sour foods to sweat briefly, allowing patients with diabetes mellitus to enjoy the sweat taste. However, the current technology couldnâ€™t make the collection of Miraculin from the Synsepalum dulcificum easy and efficiently. Our goal is to compound the Synsepalum dulcificum protein by using genetically modified technology, and we believe that the new compound method could increase the quantity of the Miraculin and decrease the cost of production, with the intention to help diabetes mellitus patients.:::2018
