BIT:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::JACOB 2.0:Reborn for Optimization:::Last year, our JACOB 1.0 used the competitive reaction between target protein and aptamer-complementary chain complexes to achieve signal conversion for sample markers' early detection. This year, we adopted the idea of JACOB, detect CKMB protein to monitor myocardial infarction. Then, in order to adapt to different needs of detection. We designed two sets of independent fluorescent expression systems that each has advantages. One is to modify the molecule SAM on the complementary chain, and to control engineering bacteria to produce GFP by using SAM-riboswitch. Another method is to combine the Spinach Probe with the complementary strand to form a stem loop structure to capture the Fluorescein (DFHBI) then produce fluorescence. We designed microfluidic chip that can carry the whole biological reaction process. We integrated the peristaltic pump on it also, so the chip and detection equipment are completely separated, which greatly reducing the volume of the overall instrument.:::2018
