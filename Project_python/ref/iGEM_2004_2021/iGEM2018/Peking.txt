Peking:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synthetic organelle: A phase-separation-based multifunctional toolbox:::Membrane-less organelles are involved in many essential biological processes. In order to orchestrate various cellular regulation using a single platform and to make the response dynamics more flexible, we put forward the idea to construct a ‘synthetic membrane-less organelle’ as a multifunctional toolbox in yeast. In this case, certain components are self-organized to form liquid droplets through phase separation, which require multivalence and interaction as prerequisites. Based on this principle, we fused interactional modules into homo-oligometric tags (HOTags) to form droplets in the yeast. Various interactional modules provide diverse control methods while different promoters alter the features and kinetics of our systems. Beyond quantitative analysis of the foundational system, we verified the feasibility of several potential functions theoretically and experimentally, including reaction crucible, sequestration, organization hub, sensor, etc. In the future, by replacing functional modules with other parts, this system would conduct functions not included in the current project.:::2018
