NYU_Abu_Dhabi:::Asia:::United Arab Emirates:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Pathogene: A portable, low-cost, microfluidic lab-on-a-chip based device for rapid detection of multiple foodborne pathogens:::Despite regulations in place to ensure the distribution of safe food, foodborne diseases (FBDs) remain a global concern. To address the worldwide challenge of FBDs, we have devised a customizable device for the simultaneous detection of multiple food-borne pathogens (FBPs). The device detects specific DNA sequences associated with four FBPs: Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and Vibrio cholerae using the isothermal amplification techniques: recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The use of isothermal techniques allows the device to be more portable and cost-effective compared to conventional PCR systems, while the use of microfluidics allows for multiplexing and rapid high-throughput screening. The parameters of the device such as the number of pathogens, and amplification and detection methods can be customized as required. This novel lab-on-a-chip based device is rapid, portable, affordable, sensitive, specific, and customizable, making it ideal for resource-limited settings and point-of-care testing.:::2018
