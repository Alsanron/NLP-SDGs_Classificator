NUDT_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PR PREDATOR-An improved protein degradation method based on ectopic expression of TRIM21 and recombinant antibody:::TRIM-AWAY, through introducing antibody and Trim21 protein into cells by microinjection or electroporation, represents a novel strategy which could rapidly remove unmodified native proteins in diverse cell types. However, the high complexity and low efficiency limited its application. Through combining TRIM-AWAY and ectopic expression of recombinant antibodies, we developed PR PREDATOR, a robust tool for degrading endogenous proteins in mammalian cells. Basically, parts for expression of Trim21 and recombinant antibodies were constructed and inserted in one single vector to realize the P2A-mediated bicistronic expression. GFP and ErbB-3, a member of the receptor tyrosine-protein kinases highly involved in the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells, were chosen as targets of PR PREDATOR for the proof of concept and further demonstration of our design respectively. Our PR PREDATOR method shall provide not only novel tools for protein function study but also brand-new options for treating disease caused by aberrant protein aggregations.:::2018
