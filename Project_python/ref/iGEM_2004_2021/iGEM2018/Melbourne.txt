Melbourne:::Asia:::Australia:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Glutamate Biosensor:::Our proposed project is to create a glutamate biosensor. The proposed biosensor can be used to detect and give a fluorescent readout on the glutamate concentration level. The biosensor will be a circuit in Escherichia coli where fluorescent readout, via FRET, will correlate with the glutamate concentration. The signal will be detected using a calcium based fluorescent system. Our system uses a calcium channel that has a glutamate binding site which opens upon binding in our bacteria. Once the channel opens, the influx of calcium and the binding of calcium to our calmodulin-based fluorescent sensor. The calmodulin undergoes a conformational change into its active form, and will form a protein-protein interaction with M13 peptide, the calmodulin-binding domain of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase. On the ends of both protein will have an EGFP protein that will be in vicinity of each other to give a FRET signal.:::2018
