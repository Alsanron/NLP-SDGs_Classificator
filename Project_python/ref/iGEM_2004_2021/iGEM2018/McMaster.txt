McMaster:::North America:::Canada:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Investigating Mechanisms of Amyloid-beta Aggregation in Alzheimer’s Disease:::Our proposed project seeks to investigate amyloid-beta aggregopathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) through an E.coli model system. We will generate a mutant library of the Amyloid Beta 1-42 (Aβ1-42) gene, to be recombinantly expressed in E.coli as part of a drop-out screen. Given that Aβ1-42 spontaneously aggregates into toxic plaques, we expect the dropout cultures to become enriched over time for Aβ1-42 gene variants correlated with a reduced capacity for aggregation. We will use next generation sequencing data from our initial and resulting mutant sequences to develop a model to identify key regions of the Aβ1-42 sequence crucial to plaque formation. This can contribute to future research by revealing plaque-forming Aβ mutations.:::2018
