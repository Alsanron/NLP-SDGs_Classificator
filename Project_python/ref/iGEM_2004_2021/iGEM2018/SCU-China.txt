SCU-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CRISProgrammer:::Inspired by the modularization, call-and-return and do-not-reinvent-the-wheel philosophy in computer programming, we came up with the idea of using the dCas9 to manipulate the expression of proteins and to implement complex logic in E. coli. Ideally, we would like to generate a versatile “Library strain” containing the CDS of commonly used proteins. Individuals would simply transform a much smaller “Minimid” which contains specific sgRNAs targeting the sequence of desired proteins into the Library strain, then the dCas9-sgRNA complex can control the expression. To show the practicality of the design, we tested the system in E. coli by using a series of simple logic circuits based on dCas9-sgRNA complex, with fluorescent proteins as reporters. We also thought about the further application of our design in the synthesis of indigo and try to modularize two enzymes that participated. This project will contribute to the construction of engineered bacteria and green manufacturing.:::2018
