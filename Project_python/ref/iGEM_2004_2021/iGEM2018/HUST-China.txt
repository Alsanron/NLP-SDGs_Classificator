HUST-China:::Asia:::China:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Optopia:::To convert optical energy into electric energy in a clean and sustainable way, Optopia is designed as a photovoltaic system consisting of photosynthetic microorganism (Rhodopseudomonas palustris) and electrogenic microorganism (Shewanella oneidensis). Synthetic biology strategies are applied to the system to trigger production and export of lactate in Rhodopseudomonas palustris, as well as to improve efficiency of lactate utilization and extracellular electron generation in Shewanella oneidensis. Compared to Cyanobacteria, also a kind of photosynthetic microorganism but generating oxygen in photosynthesis, Rhodopseudomonas palustris serves as a better carbon resource provider for Shewanella oneidensis, not only because of its anaerobic photosynthesis maintaining an anaerobic environment required for extracellular electron generation in Shewanella oneidensis, but also due to its capacity of reusing the waste from Shewanella oneidensis. Hence, functioning as a compatible and mutually beneficial optical MFC (Microbial Fuel Cell), Optopia creates a novel and optimized approach to utilize clean resources through optical-electric conversion.:::2018
