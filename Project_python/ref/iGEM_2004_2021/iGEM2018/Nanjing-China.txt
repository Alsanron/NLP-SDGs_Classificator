Nanjing-China:::Asia:::China:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Light-Driven Biohybrid Nitrogen Fixation Approach in E. coli Cells:::Our team, Nanjing-China 2018, intends to establish a sound and ideal whole-cell photocatalytic nitrogen fixation system. We use the engineered E. coli cells to express nitrogenase and in-situ synthesize of CdS semiconductors in the biohybrid system. Instead of ATP-hydrolysis, such system is able to photocatalytic N2(nitrogen) to NH3(ammonia). The biohybrid system based on engineered E. coli cells with biosynthesis inorganic materials will likely become an alternative approach for the convenient utilization of solar energy.:::2018
