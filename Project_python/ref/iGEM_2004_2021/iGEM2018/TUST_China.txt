TUST_China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Tetracycline Detecting and Degradation ("T D&D")::: Tetracycline is a kind of antibiotic substance separated from the culture solution of Streptomyces aureofa-ciens, which belong to the common broad-spectrum antibiotic and have a great effect on many types of microorganism, this family including chlotetracycline„ÄÅoxytetracycline and tetracycline.Last century, tetracycline is widely used in animal husbandry and aquaculture because of its competitive prices between with other antibiotics. As a result of this phenomenon,the pollution of tetracycline in water and soil is increasingly serious. This year, we want to construct a tetracycline detecting and degradation devices,"T D&D"system, to achieve our anticipation that sensitive detection and rapid degradation in the special devices through our constructive chasis. In our project, we would find a better ratio between detecting device and degradation device to the optimal result.:::2018
