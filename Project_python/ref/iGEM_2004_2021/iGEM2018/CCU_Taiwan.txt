CCU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Liggreen:::With the policy of restriction on plastic usage in Taiwan,we aim to produce a lignin-like polymer which can be applied as a lining for paper cups in place of plastic. We were inspired by the water resistant nature of lignin, but natural lignin has many weaknesses. By taking advantage of an oxidizing enzyme produced by engineered Pichia pastoris, we can bind monolignols together into a simpler polymer. This polymer, which we named Liggreen, is water resistant like plastic but decomposable and also heat resistant. Liggreen in paper cups is just one of many applications, so the future of Liggreen is prosperous.:::2018
