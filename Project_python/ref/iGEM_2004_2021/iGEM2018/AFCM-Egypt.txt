AFCM-Egypt:::Africa:::Egypt:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Microbiota: Opening Doors to New Horizons in Colorectal Cancer Therapy:::Colorectal cancer (CRC) is considered one of the most common cancers and accounts for almost half a million deaths annually worldwide. Tremendous progress has been made in understanding the role of the immune system in driving the development of cancers, including CRC. As sensors of cell death and tissue remodeling, Toll like receptors(TLRs) may have a universal role in cancer. There are different TLRs that respond to a variety of Pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide . The evidence of existence of relevance between bacterial microbiota and carcinogenesis is increasing. itâ€™s suggested that microRNAs act as ligands of TLRs playing a role in epigenetic immune modulation. In this study, We will assess the therapeutic efficacy of microbiome based approach as novel therapeutic strategy in restoring normal Toll lie receptor signaling in CRC cell line.:::2018
