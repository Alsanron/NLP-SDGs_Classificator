ShanghaiTech:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Fast & Fidelity - a circuit system achieving high input-output concurrence:::Input, controller, and output have been the standard procedure of engineered regulatory biocircuit. However, the precise input-to-output control may fail at times mainly due to (i) delayed responses from input signals to output signals, and (ii) unexpected interactions between the host and exogenous circuits. For example, previous iGEM projects primarily focused on the single time response of systems, which underestimated the fact that continuously changing inputs may cause the disorder of output signals. Therefore, a system needs to be constructed for rapidly responding to the changing input signals and eliminating the superposition between outputs from different input signals. In this context, we design a high-fidelity control system with a feedback loop and orthogonal ribosome, which allows the outputs to respond precisely to the changing input signals. We envision that our control system will offer the synthetic biology community a novel solution to manipulate uncertain input.:::2018
