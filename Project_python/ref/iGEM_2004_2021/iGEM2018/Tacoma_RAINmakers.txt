Tacoma_RAINmakers:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Ticket or Quit It: Protecting Families from Arsenic Contamination:::In Tacoma, Washington, arsenic pollution from the ASARCO copper smelter continues to devastate the surrounding communities’ soil and water. Even small amounts of arsenic pose a threat to long-term community health, including cancer and developmental issues in children. The city and state have spent more than $62,000,000 over 18 years testing around 450 yards in the region, with efforts still underway. Our iGEM team seeks to change that paradigm by engineering an affordable and easy-to-use biosensor that utilizes chromoproteins made in the presence of bioavailable arsenic. Our biosensor is user-friendly by design and will not require hazardous chemical reagents. The Tacoma RAINMakers’ goal is to improve community understanding of this local environmental issue and provide a low-cost tool that can be used by the citizens of Tacoma and communities worldwide to detect heavy metals.:::2018
