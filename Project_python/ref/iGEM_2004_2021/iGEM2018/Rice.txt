Rice:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PORTAL: A Portable Transcription-Translation System to Improve Cross-Species Genetic Circuit Reliability:::The unique properties of non-model bacteria can expand the applications of synthetic biology. However, currently there are few reliable tools for engineering non-model bacteria. A central obstacle to the development of such tools is the dependence of circuit expression on host machinery. To address this problem, we developed PORTAL, a system which uses T7 transcription and orthogonal ribosomes to insulate the circuit from host processes. We characterized PORTAL in four E. coli strains, Shewanella oneidensis, and Pseudomonas putida, comparing PORTAL-driven and host-driven expression of a reporter. To design orthogonal ribosomes, we created software that analyzes binding energies of 16S rRNA and determines the optimal orthogonality-promoting anti-Shine-Dalgarno mutations. We created a model that simulates the performance of PORTAL and shows that the system is minimally sensitive to metabolic differences. PORTAL presents a tunable “virtual machine” to facilitate insulated synthetic gene circuit expression in non-model bacteria.:::2018
