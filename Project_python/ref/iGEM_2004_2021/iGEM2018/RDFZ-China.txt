RDFZ-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Xscape:::Biosafety has always been a major challenge. Leakage of recombinant DNA to the environment may cause undesirable environmental consequences. Aiming to solve this urgent issue, we constructed three devices: two for industrial fermentors, and one for drug delivery bacteria. The first device for use in fermentors utilized thermal-sensitive and quorum system sensors, PhlF and sRNA as logic gate components, and DNase as actuator, forming a NOR gate; the second used a cold-regulated device and a LuxR-repressed promoter as sensors, forming an AND gate. Both devices will self-induce DNA degradation if recombinant bacteria are accidentally leaked into environment. Moreover, with multiple thermal-sensitive devices and gas vesicles, we could perform noninvasive monitoring of the bacteria, drug release by heating tissue at the nidus, and initiation of DNA degradation by applying a higher temperature.  For human practice, we mainly focused on current biosafety issues, including biohackers, sales of hazardous materials and local laws.:::2018
