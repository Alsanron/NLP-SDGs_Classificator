MSP-Maastricht:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::METHAGONE - Harnessing the Powers of Seaweed to Reduce Methane Emissions in Cows:::Over the last 100 years, the human population has exploded and so has the demand for food sources such as meat. To keep up with this demand, the number of cows has also skyrocketed. Cows have multiple stomachs, one of them being the rumen. Within it, there exists a microcosm of microorganisms of which the archaea, specifically the suborder, Methanobrevibacter, creates methane (CH4) by using the fermentation byproducts H2 and CO2. Methane, a greenhouse gas, has a global warming potential that is 28 times stronger per unit mass relative to CO2. To tackle this issue our team is producing a microbial feed additive for cows which will express a set of proteins, derived from different species of red seaweed, to inhibit the metabolic pathway of CH4 production by producing a compound called bromoform.:::2021
