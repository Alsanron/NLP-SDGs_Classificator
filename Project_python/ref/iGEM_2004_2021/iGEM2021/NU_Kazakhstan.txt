NU_Kazakhstan:::Asia:::Kazakhstan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Remi, du et!:::Increasing demand for oil & gas production in modern days pushes for higher production and distribution rates. The occurrence of oil spills in such processes is not unusual and the vast majority are left unaccounted for. Existing treatment methods are only efficient for localized spills shortly after the accident, while in the long-term they are less cost-effective and hazardous to Kazakhstani endemic flora & fauna. We propose a solution to this problem by developing a novel agent for crude oil bioremediation - “Remi, du et!”. Specifically, we modify nonvirulent Pseudomonas putida using a dual-inducible system for overexpression of genes nadE and rhlA/B, coding for NAD synthetase and rhamnolipids, respectively. The metabolically-engineered bacteria demonstrate a high yield of rhamnolipids when grown as biofilms under electrofermentative conditions. Since produced rhamnolipids are biosurfactants that emulsify crude oil, the resulting product can be used directly for the treatment of oil spills in ecologically-sensitive areas.:::2021
