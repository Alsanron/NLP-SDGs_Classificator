Pittsburgh:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Colon Detective: Tumor Diagnostics centered on Fimbrial Anchorage and Oxidative Stress Activation:::Contributing factors to high mortality rates of Colorectal Cancers (CRC) in the United States are associated with the cost and inefficiencies with colonoscopies as the initial detection method. Here we propose the development of a detection system utilizing engineered E.coli cells to produce a color change in the presence of CRC tumors and adenocarcinomas. To colonize colorectal cells, we have proposed engineering E. coli cells with chimeric fimbrial cap protein that can be anchored to surfaces. Anchoring occurs via interaction with customized antigens using a SNAP tag. We then sense a hypoxic environment in cancer cells through the oxidative stress response transcription factor OxyR. To achieve this goal, we designed and built plasmids in which OxyR promoters regulate the transcription of the B-galactosidase lac-alpha fragment. Finally, the lac-alpha released forms a complex with lac-omega resulting in functional B-galactosidase that can be used in colorimetric assays reporting OxyR mediated transcription.:::2021
