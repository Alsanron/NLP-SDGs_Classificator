This has greatly worsened the phenomenon of coral bleaching, and will further lead to the collapse of marine ecosystem, as coral reefs are home to 25% marine species. To alleviate the current situation, we are developing an eco-friendly bio-sunscreen that is harmless to coral reefs and the marine ecosystem. Inspired by how marine species in nature protect themselves from UV rays, we have decided to produce gadusol, a natural UV filter originated from zebrafish, as the main component of our bio-sunscreen product. We first introduced the synthetic pathway of gadusol into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Then, the utilization pathway of xylose was also introduced to engineer it into a high-yield cell factory. By doing this, we hope to balance the use of sunscreen and the protection of coral reefs.:::2021
