GA_State_SW_Jiaotong:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Heterogeneous Expression of Recombinant Gas6 and EGF Proteins for Curing Alopecia:::In research published in the past year, two critical proteins, Gas6 and EGF, have shown promise for treating stress-related and androgenetic alopecia. Plasmids were constructed for transformation into Pichia pastoris, E.coli, and Bacillus subtilis respectively. Gas6 proteins will be purified from Pichia pastoris and EGF proteins will be expressed in E.coli using a T7 promoter to produce a cell-free protein treatment for hair loss. As a possible alternative, two plasmids with the coding sequence for each protein and a suicide switch (to prevent unwanted growth of the bacteria after treatment) were designed to create a living-cell protein expression system in B.subtilis which could be applied to the microbiome of the scalp.:::2021
