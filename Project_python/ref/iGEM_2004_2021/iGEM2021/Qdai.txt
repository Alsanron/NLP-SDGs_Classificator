Qdai:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Alternative to Canary:::Using genetic recombination technology, we will create E. coli bacteria that can detect toxic gases. The E. coli will be used in an environment where human life is at risk, and the luminescence of the E. coli will alert the user in advance of danger. In addition, we plan to make the E. coli die by itself after reacting for a while, assuming that the person handling the E. coli runs away at once in a dangerous situation. This is to prevent the worst-case scenario of accidentally releasing the synthetic organism into the environment. By using synthetic biology, we hope to create a multifunctional E. coli bacterium that can protect the safety of people in dangerous situations.:::2021
