Istanbul_United:::Europe:::Turkey:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Ecolgae (E.coli & Algae):::The issue of heavy metal pollution in aquatic systems is a very serious problem for both our future and present. This problem manifests itself in different ways all over the world. Although it affects the food chain and the life cycle negatively; the studies carried out until today, including methods where external intervention is mandatory, could only provide a temporary solution to the problem. We aim to reduce the percentage of heavy metals in water by using gene transfer methods and gene cloning, without disturbing the natural balance. This is possible by a system that will be added to the natural habitat. In this project, we studied how to use the bioremediator properties of algae without causing eutrophication. Based on this idea, we obtained transgenic E.coli which contains the heavy metal removal genes of algae. With our study, we as Istanbul United, can reduce heavy metal pollution permanently.:::2021
