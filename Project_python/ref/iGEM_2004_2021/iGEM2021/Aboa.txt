Aboa:::Europe:::Finland:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Lac Case - Utilization of laccases for pharmaceutical waste detoxification:::Pharmaceutical waste is one of the most deleterious pollutants in the Baltic Sea. Especially the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac is causing severe harm to this delicate ecosystem. The current removal efficiency of diclofenac is only 27% at our local wastewater treatment plant. The project objective was to contribute to the development of a microbial wastewater treatment system for the detoxification of this compound. The approach was to overexpress and extract three heterologous laccases, specific enzymes which are capable of catalyzing the conversion of diclofenac into less harmful derivatives, in engineered E. coli. We were able to successfully produce and purify CotA (from B. subtilis) and CueO (from E. coli), of which CotA was shown to have catalytic activity in vitro. Implementation of this work would include the expression of this laccase in photosynthetic cyanobacteria in a closed bioreactor system, integrated as a part of the wastewater purification process.:::2021
