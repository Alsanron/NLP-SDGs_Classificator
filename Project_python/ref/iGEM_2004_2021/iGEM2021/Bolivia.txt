Bolivia:::Latin America:::Bolivia:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ARSEMAPHORE:::Reliable access to potable water is a major problem in Bolivia and other nations. Scarcity of this essential resource drives populations to seek drinking water from rivers, lakes, and wells. However, these sources can be dangerous if they are contaminated by heavy metals. Preliminary studies show that drinking water in Bolivian cities often contains highly hazardous levels of arsenic. In response, we designed and constructed a bacterial biosensor to rapidly quantify water sample arsenic content. The biosensor design strategy is called traffic light; it employs 4 genetic constructs to quantify defined ppb ranges of arsenic content in water. Light color responses indicate lower metal concentrations while increasingly dark color responses correspond to increased arsenic content. We created a portable device that houses the biosensor and allows one to quantify water samples anywhere. Our goal is to make the biosensor available to users in Bolivia and eventually around the world.:::2021
