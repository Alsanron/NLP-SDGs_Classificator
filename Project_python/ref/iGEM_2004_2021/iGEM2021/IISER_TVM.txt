IISER_TVM:::Asia:::India:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering Chimeric Chitinase with Enhanced Antifungal Activity:::Opportunistic fungal infections like mucormycosis, aspergillosis, and candidiasis have ravaged immunocompromised patients battling multiple comorbidities. Tackling these infections has been difficult due to a limited repertoire of expensive antifungal drugs and their side effects. Moreover, the rampant use of these limited numbers of drugs raises the alarming possibility of developing drug-resistant fungal strains. Chitinases are potent natural biocontrol agents against fungi. We aim to engineer chimeric chitinases with a specific combination of different chitin-binding and catalytic domains from wild-type chitinases that will have increased anti-fungal activity. The antifungal enzymes thus synthesized could be developed into effective therapeutic agents against invasive fungal infections.:::2021
