ASTWS-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Enhanced “Plastic Eating” Biofilm System:::The synthetic plastic waste accumulated in modern society has formed a large-scale garbage belt in water bodies, which has polluted the global ecosystem and caused serious harm to the health and survival safety of human beings, animals, and plants. Last year, ASTWS2020 successfully developed the "biofilm system that can enrich and degrade plastic pollutants in water". Based on this, this year, we aim to explore the further optimization and upgrading of this plastic pollutant treatment system by means of genetic engineering. The main optimization schemes include: 1) using a dual enzyme (PETase and MHETase) system to achieve more safe and efficient degradation of micro-plastics. 2) Objective to optimize the expression system of enhanced biofilm compound double enzyme and realize the optimal expression scheme of enhanced biofilm, PETase, and MHETase.:::2021
