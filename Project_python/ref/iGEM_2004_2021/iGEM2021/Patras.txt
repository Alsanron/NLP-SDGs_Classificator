Patras:::Europe:::Greece:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PGasus: A comprehensive workflow for the identification & functional characterization of PGx variants:::iGEM Patras 2021 goal is to characterize the impact of genomic variants, derived from targeted panel-based resequencing using a portable next-generation sequencer, on the enzymatic activity of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzymes, responsible for the metabolism of clinically used drugs, using in vitro assays. These variants will be engineered into gene constructs, via site-directed mutagenesis in eukaryotic 293FT cells, encoding these enzymes and will be subsequently characterized as deleterious or benign, and compared against in silico prediction scores. Furthermore, to validate the mechanisms underlying the molecular interaction between the mutated CYP isoforms and the chemical substrates, we used molecular simulation methods like docking, to confirm the potential deleterious effect of the identified PGx variants.:::2021
