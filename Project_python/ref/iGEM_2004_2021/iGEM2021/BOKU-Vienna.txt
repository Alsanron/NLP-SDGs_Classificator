BOKU-Vienna:::Europe:::Austria:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Friendzyme - a novel therapeutic platform in case of Irritable Bowel syndrome, and related disorders:::About 15% of the worlds population suffer from bowel disorders like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and related disorders. These are triggered by so-called FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols), which are non-digestible food components that lead to bloating, abdominal pain and other symptoms. So far the only therapy is a highly restrictive diet. We want to change that by addressing neglected gastrointestinal diseases and tackling one of the most common FODMAPs: Fructans, a fructose polymer. Our goal is to develop a novel therapeutic platform by the use of lactobacilli that secrete fructan-degrading enzymes. We encapsulate them in a biocompatible scaffold that keeps them safely inside while allowing the release of the produced enzymes. The surface of the scaffold is designed to have muco-adhesive properties which enable site-targeted enzyme delivery over a prolonged timespan. With this concept we want to take oral enzyme therapy to the next level.:::2021
