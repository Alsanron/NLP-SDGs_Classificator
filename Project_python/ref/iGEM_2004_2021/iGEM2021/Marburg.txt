Marburg:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::OpenPlast - Establishing cell-free systems from chloroplasts as rapid prototyping platforms for plant SynBio:::Climate change is threatening many of the crops we rely on. To ensure stable food supply, engineered crops will play a major role in our future agriculture, but crop development currently takes about a decade. In our project OpenPlast, we develop cell free systems (CFS) from chloroplasts of different plants, including various crops. Showing that they can be employed as prototyping platforms to characterize genetic constructs, these systems drastically reduce testing times. We use a machine learning guided approach to optimize reaction mixture composition and create a collection of GoldenGate based chloroplast parts to be characterized in our CFS. This toolbox includes regulatory elements for chloroplasts of plants so far heavily underrepresented in the registry. After successful chloroplast transformation, we want to show that data generated in our systems is comparable to in vivo data, proving that our systems can efficiently be used as prototyping platforms for plant SynBio.:::2021
