UFlorida:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mitigating Antibiotic Resistance Through Alternative Selectable Markers and a Conjugative CRISPR Delivery System:::Antibiotic resistance is emerging as the center of a healthcare crisis worldwide. In order to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria, team UFlorida seeks to utilize metabolic enzymes in place of traditional antibiotic resistance markers when testing for transformants in the lab to further contribute to the ever growing synthetic biology library for better genetic engineering tools. UFlorida is also developing a two plasmid conjugation/CRISPR system that will deliver and induce the endonuclease activity of Cas9 protein to an antibiotic resistance gene in a bacteria. This will generate genome instability in our target host through a triad of double stranded DNA breaks, thereby killing the bacteria. We plan to utilize this system to target pathogenic, antibiotic resistant bacteria, and test our system with our novel selectable markers.:::2021
