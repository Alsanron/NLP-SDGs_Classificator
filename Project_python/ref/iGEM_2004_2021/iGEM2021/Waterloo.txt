Waterloo:::North America:::Canada:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NeuroDetech:::Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattentiveness, an inability to focus, and restlessness. Current ADHD diagnosis procedures require a series of psychological assessments that are qualitative in nature and subject to potential clinician bias. Waterloo iGEM’s 2021 project, NeuroDetech, is a quantitative tool that aids in the diagnosis of ADHD and reduces the margin of bias. NeuroDetech consists of a series of microfluidic capillary flow assay lab chips designed using process engineering methods. Each lab chip contains a binding molecule that detects an ADHD-associated biomarker or gene marker in urine. Through protein engineering and computational protein redesign methods, the binding molecule can be adapted for the sensitive detection of a variety of ADHD-associated markers. Each lab chip and optical detector emits a signal over time that is visualized on a software app, providing healthcare professionals with insight into an individual’s risk for ADHD.:::2021
