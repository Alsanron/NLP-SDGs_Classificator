Chalmers-Gothenburg:::Europe:::Sweden:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A tunable yeast cell factory for micro-scale production of fatty acid-derivates:::Fatty acid-based compounds act as important building blocks in many industrial processes. Currently, many of these compounds are obtained through costly and energy inefficient chemical synthesis using base oils. Vegetable oils are promising alternatives, but many of these are drivers of deforestation and biodiversity loss. Finding alternative ways to produce the building blocks that make up the products we use every single day, is a key step in the development of a bio-based economy. We propose that Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be engineered for the production of high-value fatty acid-based compounds in a tunable fashion. We aim to fine-tune reaction pathways in vivo that can be difficult to carry out using conventional chemical synthesis. By downregulating the native fatty acid synthesis and introducing a bacterial system, we can regulate the production profiles using three types of thioesterases linked to different induction systems.:::2021
