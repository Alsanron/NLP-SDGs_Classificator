Stuttgart:::Europe:::Germany:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::TardiSun - Innovative UV Protection:::Our project TardiSun-innovative UV-Power takes advantage of the DSUP protein, which can be found in tardigrades and protects the DNA from UV-radiation. The aim of the project is to improve the life cell imaging method by using the protein within HeLa-cells. Furthermore, we like to express and isolate the protein in Escherichia coli to dissolve the protein into a liquid. In this context we want to find out if the absorbance properties are independent of the DNA protection function. The developed liquid could be used to protect other surfaces.:::2021
