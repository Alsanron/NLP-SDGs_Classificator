It is urgent to establish an effective and rapid drug screening model for AD. This project is going to establish AD models using transgenic fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) carrying the UAS-APP transgene, which will express human APP protein in the fly nervous system by crossing to appl-Gal4 driver flies. These APP-expressing flies will produce AD-like symptoms, including Amyloid deposits, neuronal loss, axon degeneration, locomotor defect, and cognitive deficits, etc. Furthermore, some potential drugs will be selected to assess this fly AD model. We hope that one day Alzheimer's disease can be controlled and cured, and we are also working hard for this.:::2021
