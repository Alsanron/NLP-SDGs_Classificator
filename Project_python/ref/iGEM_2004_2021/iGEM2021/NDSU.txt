NDSU:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Anti-fungal recombinant DNA in Escherichia coli for the inhibition of Rhizoctonia solani growth.:::Crop fungal disease is a global issue that costs billions of dollars in lost crops every year. Crops can be especially susceptible to fungus that infect the root system, like Rhizoctonia solani. Although R. solani threatens many major crops, there are no direct treatments against the pathogen, only management strategies. This project aims to genetically engineer Escherichia coli to produce antifungal compounds which alone, or together in synergy, are effective in inhibiting the growth of R. solani. To accomplish this goal, golden gate cloning was utilized to create several E. coli strains with different antifungal genes. These modified strains were then placed in an antifungal assay with R. solani to establish inhibitory and co-inhibitory effects. Future research would explore inserting these genes in bacteria that have symbiotic relationships with crops to protect against R. solani.:::2021
