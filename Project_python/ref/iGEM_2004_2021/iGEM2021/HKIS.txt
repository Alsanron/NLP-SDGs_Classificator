HKIS:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Vib-Check:::Vib-Check is a two-part detection and purification system for Vibrio bacterium in Oysters. Vibrio, being the leading cause of seafood-related deaths around the world, is a hazard that has yet to be tackled effectively. Vib-Check aims to provide a method for affordable and effective detection of Vibrio pathogens in oyster batches that the average fisher can use, something no product is currently capable of. In the event of a positive result, aquaculturists can use our specially designed peptides expressed by transgenic microalgae for the effective and convenient purification of pathogens in oysters.:::2021
