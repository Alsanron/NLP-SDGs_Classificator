NYCU-Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Natto It Out:::A fatal cardiovascular disease, Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a rising major health problem due to the potentially lethal complications such as pulmonary embolism. Since an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, our project “Natto It Out” aims to prevent DVT progression at its earliest onset via a fibrinolytic protease—Nattokinase. In this project, we engineered an E. coli, which is designed to be able to release the NK in the intestine, by inserting the Nattokinase DNA sequence from B. subtilis into pET21a plasmids. In addition, we integrated the BphP1-QPAS1 optogenetic system to manipulate Nattokinase production remotely, along with a detector that could instantly calculate the risks of DVT. To overcome biosafety concerns, we adapted the mazEF toxin-antitoxin system into our kill switch design to mediate cell death once they have been released into the environment.:::2021
