HUST-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mr.Tony:::An increasing number of people prefer perming or dyeing to add to their glamor and vigour, and existing hairdressing market scale in China alone is over 20 billion yuan, and that of overall beauty salon industry scale amounts to 380 billion yuan, according to a recent estimation. However, undesired health consequences brought by harmful chemicals used in perming and dyeing process are undisputable. Therefore, an optimized humanistic device for perming and dyeing based on engineered yeast producing natural pigments and short peptides was designed by HUST-China to tackle with this problem, which can produce enzyme to catalyze natural pigment precursors into natural pigments and express short peptides with abundant sulfhydryl. A xylose responding system was also created to fade the pigments ,straighten the curled hair, and resume the hair to its original state. Corresponding devices such as original fermenter were also designed to put engineered yeast in real life scenarios.:::2021
