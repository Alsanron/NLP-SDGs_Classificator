In order to solve the problems, we try to develop an efficient method to converge gutter oil into high value-added polyunsaturated fatty acids like linolenic acid. In this work, Yarrowia lipolytica has been selected as the model host to produce polyunsaturated fatty acids (linolenic acid) by using the waste oil in the kitchen waste as substrates. For this, we firstly enhance the ability of Y. lipolytica to utilize the waste oil by optimizing the fatty acid degradation pathway. Furthermore, the synthetic pathway of linolenic acid will be introduced into Y. lipolytica. The goal of this project is to make full use of the waste oil in the kitchen waste after simple treatment, so as to realize "turning waste into treasure".:::2021
