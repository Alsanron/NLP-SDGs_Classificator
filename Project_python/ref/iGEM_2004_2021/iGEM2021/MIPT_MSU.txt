MIPT_MSU:::Europe:::Russian Federation:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Final destination for cancer: using viral sorting and targeting mechanisms for RNA molecules delivery:::Our team propose a new method of targeted RNA delivery to tumour cells using membrane-derived extracellular vesicles with fusion proteins. The endogenous retroviral gene syncytin-1 was selected as a fusion protein to enhance fusional properties with the target cells. Its receptors (ASCT2) are found on some tumors cells, for example, colorectal adenocarcinoma. Using fusion protein, vesicles overcome the potential membrane barrier. In our iGEM project, we were focused on the sorting and targeted delivery of mRNA (GFP and b-galoxidase, reporter genes) to tumour cells. For mRNA sorting we used RNA-binding domain (N domain of gag protein), which can recognize the psi-packaging signal of the HIV1. The mRNA will be associated with the psi-signal, and RNA-construction (target mRNA+psi-signal) will be recognized by the gag protein. Currently, there are no analogs of such systems in the world, so our technology might become a breakthrough in the field of targeted drug delivery techniques.:::2021
