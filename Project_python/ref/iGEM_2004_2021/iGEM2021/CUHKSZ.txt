CUHKSZ:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::EthaNO:::Alcoholic beverages usually play an important role in our social life. Some spirits, like Chinese Maotai, may also contain some ingredients beneficial to human health. However, the high concentration of ethanol in those spirits can also take a serious toll on human health. Our project EthaNO is a tiny device that can decompose ethanol in alcoholic beverages. We aim to figure out the oxidation mechanism of bi-functional alcohol/ aldehyde dehydrogenase (AdhE) through computational biology E.coli bacteria are transformed with modified gene and will generate enzymes to degrade ethanol. To make it user-friendly, PVA-SA granules are applied to store the bacteria in the device. We will optimize the immobilization method to maximize degradation efficiency. With EthaNO, people can enjoy alcoholic beverages like Maotai without worrying about ethanol.:::2021
