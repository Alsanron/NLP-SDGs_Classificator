SZ_SHD:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Alpha Gel:::Our goal is to be able to produce a product that can safely degrade the keratin in hair while easily removing body hair, hence solving the problem of keratin waste disposal. We have found keratinases that can decompose the Î±-keratin in human hair. By incorporating it into a bio-gel, we can produce a product the market has never seen before. We hope that our products can help everyone, and we hope that in the future, everyone can choose our products freely. Of course, we accept all kinds of beauty, hairless or not. As long as we like it, we should advocate social acceptance and respect the aesthetics of all people. In the future, we hope that this technology can be further applied in medical and industrial fields, such as treatment of skin keratinization diseases, treatment of poultry feathers in farms, leather pretreatment, hair treatment of household sewage pipes, etc.:::2021
