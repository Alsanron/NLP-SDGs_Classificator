LINKS_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::NeoLeathic Age â€” Revolutionary Leather Substitute from Kombucha, Spider-silk, and Natural Dyes:::The booming of the fashion industry has led to rising demand for leather. However, current industrial leather production causes environmental and ethical problems such as water pollution and animal cruelty. LINKS_China 2021 aims to create a sustainable and humane leather substitute using bacterial cellulose (BC) produced by co-culturing Komagataeibacter with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By engineering S. cerevisiae, we induced transgenic expression of artificial spider-silk proteins fused with cellulose-binding matrixes, which increases the tensile strength and flexibility of BC membrane upon binding. Additionally, we enabled our engineered S. cerevisiae to synthesize ethyl acetate, giving our membrane a fruity fragrance. To endow our leather with more fashionable features, we used engineered Escherichia coli to synthesize different di-halogenated indigoid dyes for coloration. We expect our novel leather to be a transformative product that will continue the prosperity of fashion industry through a more humane and environmentally friendly technology.:::2021
