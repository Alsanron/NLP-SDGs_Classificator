When the temperatures drop below zero, ice crystals form and destroy sensitive plant tissues. This problem is exacerbated by Pseudomonas syringae syringae, a common pathogen of apricot trees producing an ice-nucleation protein that promotes ice crystal formation. Our project aims to find biological treatments to protect apricot trees from frost damage. We pursue three different combinable approaches. Firstly, we engineer Escherichia coli to overproduce antifreeze proteins, which we purify and spray onto the plants, so that they bind to ice crystals and inhibit their growth. Secondly, we also produce tailocins, bactericidal protein complexes, to specifically kill P. syringae. Lastly, we want to use a phage that delivers CRISPR/Cas9 and a guide RNA into P. syringae on the plants to delete the gene coding for the ice nucleating protein.:::2021
