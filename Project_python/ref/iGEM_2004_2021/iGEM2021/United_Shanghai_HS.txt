United_Shanghai_HS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::PET Gig Eater:::Plastic waste pollution has seriously threatened the environment and creatures. Here, we designed a burying yard with concentrated PET plastics, using the modified Bacillus subtilis carried by earthworms to initially degrade PET ,accelerating the degradation of PET plastics in it. At the same time, the activities of earthworms are used to improve the distribution of engineering bacteria and enzymes,solving the difficulty of frequent mixing in the dump site. The modified engineering bacteria release PETase and MHETase to hydrolyze PET into ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid,finally metabolizing it into carbon dioxide and water. Whatâ€™s more ,we also inserted GFP gene into the plasmid to further track the distribution of engineering bacteria in the soil. And by detecting the fluorescence in the body or feces of the earthworms, we can know  whether the engineered bacteria have been swallowed by the earthworms. The expected result is that the engineered bacteria can be carried elsewhere through the activities of earthworms, which will promote the distribution of engineered bacteria in the soil.:::2021
