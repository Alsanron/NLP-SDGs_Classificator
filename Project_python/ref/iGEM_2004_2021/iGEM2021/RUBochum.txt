RUBochum:::Europe:::Germany:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Project Platylicious:::Livestock farming, especially dairy and meat production, contributes to a large extent to CO2 emissions and thus to climate change. More and more people are questioning their diet in order to find new ways of contributing to the protection of the climate. Our goal is to use the DNA of cows and the platypus to produce milk proteins with Pichia pastoris that do not differ in their molecular structure from those of these animals. This would offer an equivalent substitute for those people who do not necessarily want to switch to plant-based milk, but do not want to contribute and enforce global warming and animal exploitation. By producing platypus-yoghurt we try to do our part while simultaneously raising awareness for the platypus, a species threatened by dairy farming.:::2021
