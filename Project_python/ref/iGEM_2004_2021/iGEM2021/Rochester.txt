Rochester:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bio-Spire: A novel diagnostic device for the continuous monitoring of biomarkers in sweat:::The 2021 University of Rochester Team Bio-Spire is manufacturing a wearable biosensor to diagnose sepsis using biomarkers found in sweat. Sepsis is a condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to infection. In the USA alone, at least 1.7 million adults develop sepsis yearly and nearly 270,000 die. We are storing DNA-encoding aptamers for sepsis-related biomarkers in Escherichia coli, synthesizing them in vitro, and developing a sleeve-like biosensor that incorporates these aptamers, graphene, electrodes, and microfluidics to monitor the changing levels of relevant biomarkers in patients. Mathematical modeling is used to predict the concentrations of these biomarkers in blood based on the sweat samples, and a corresponding software tool will display warnings of the patientâ€™s elevated sepsis risk. Our team is centering topics of safety, inclusivity, and ethics in our project, and we are doing outreach activities with a variety of local organizations to demonstrate basic scientific principles to children.:::2021
