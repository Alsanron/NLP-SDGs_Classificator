Vilnius-Lithuania:::Europe:::Lithuania:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AmeBye: prevention and detection tools for eradication of infectious disease amebiasis:::Every year about 50 million people develop a symptomatic form of infectious disease amebiasis, and 100 000 die. Although the infection is most common in developing countries, it is relevant to the whole world as travelers and immigrants disseminate the infection. The annual rates, lack of publicly available diagnostic tests, inexistent prevention tools, and deadly consequences of pathogenesis progression have inspired us to create effective prevention and sensitive diagnostic tools to improve the control of this infection. The first solution - probiotic bacteria that synthesize naringenin - a compound that negatively affects the viability of E. histolytica. This would prevent the spread of amebiasis by asymptomatic people and the development of the infection to an invasive form. The second - a rapid diagnostic test, which is based on aptamers and is specific to ameba secreted proteins. This test would enable accurate and specific detection of the invasive E. histolytica infection.:::2021
