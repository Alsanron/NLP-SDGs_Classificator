NCTU_Formosa:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Denteeth - A New Type of Dental Bone:::Periodontal disease is an infection of the tissues that hold your teeth in place. Severe periodontal disease was proved to be related to many chronic and cardiovascular diseases. With almost 10% of the global population affected with periodontal disease, the problem of oral disease has been one of the top problems that pose a threat to human beings and even dogs. As many experimenting thoughts are first conducted on dogs, we think it's expedient to focus on dogs' oral health first before applying to human beings. We ameliorate and create a new type of dental bone, DenTeeth.In DenTeeth, antimicrobial peptides are used to sterilize. And we also found several proteins which can repair damaged gingiva and tooth tissue. By optimizing our design through this procedure, we can adjust our project to the optimal place.:::2021
