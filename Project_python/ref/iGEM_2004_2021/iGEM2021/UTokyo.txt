UTokyo:::Asia:::Japan:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::YEAST-AID:::Incoming aging society asks us: "How can we extend the healthy life expectancy?". There are many obstacles to answering the question, one of which is bedsore. A bedsore is a severe wound that often occurs in people who spend a long time in bed. It requires continuous care by medical professionals and keeps patients away from home even after recovering from the initial symptoms. Our team suggests a solid solution to this problem by creating YEAST-AID for bedsore. This project aimed to help everyone takes care of bedsore correctly and efficiently, discharging millions of people from extended hospitalization. Our solution, YEAST-AID is a multifunctional wound dressing using synthetic yeast. The yeast has three functions supporting wound care: wound monitoring by oxygen concentration, infection prevention by antimicrobial peptides, and detection of P. aeruginosa infection. Furthermore, the yeast is appropriately integrated into the fiber-like hardware to function safely on the wound.:::2021
