Stanford:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mitigation of Grapefruit-Drug Interaction through Engineered Gut-Colonizing Yeast:::The grapefruit-drug interaction refers to unpredictable adverse effects that occur when certain drugs are taken concurrently with grapefruit products. Grapefruits contain a family of compounds called furanocoumarins, which are known to repress CYP3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of a large percentage of drugs prescribed today. This interaction causes increased bioavailability of some drugs and can result in unintentional drug overdose. Given the prevalence and popularity of grapefruit products and the number of affected drugs, our project is designed to provide passive negation of the grapefruit-drug interaction. Our plan is to put the gene for CYP6B1, an enzyme from the black swallowtail butterfly that breaks down furanocoumarins, into brewer’s yeast and colonize the human gut microbiome with our modified microbe to provide continuous mitigation and resilience to the drug interaction through the gene’s expression.:::2021
