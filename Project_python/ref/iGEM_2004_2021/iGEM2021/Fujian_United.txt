Fujian_United:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Alpha Luco - Development of a new S. cerevisiae to self-secrete glucoamylase:::In the fermentation method widely applied in ethanol production, glucoamylase is an essential raw material, which accounted for a lot of costs. Our project aimed to develop the Saccharomyces cerevisiae in order to self-secrete glucoamylase, thus, reducing the cost also improving the fermentation efficiency. In the lab, we started off by constructing 4 plasmids, pYES2-ctl, pYES2-TGC, pYES2-HGC, and pYES2-IGC, with different promoters, respectively by Golden Gate Cloning and then transformed them into the yeast. After selection by several enzyme activity tests and fermentation performance tests, we finally obtained the expected engineered yeast and hope our work will contribute the alcohol manufacturing in the future.:::2021
