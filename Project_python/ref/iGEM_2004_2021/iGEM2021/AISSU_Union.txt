AISSU_Union:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Memory bread：Constructing Catechin Production Pathway in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae:::Increasing ageing of population has become a global issue, and the cognitive ability of those seniors, an important measurement of this group’s healthy level. Researches have proven that flavonoids could be potential in improving the seniors’ cognitive ability. We selected nine different genes from plants to build up two plasmids and used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the chassis for expression. The first plasmid uses L-Tyrosine to produce naringenin, a central molecule in the production of flavonoids. The second plasmid converts naringenin into the final product -- catechin. As a crucial member of flavonoids, catechins plays a significant role in improving cognition and cardiovascular health. We hope that catechins could be used as food additive in elders’ daily diet, and therefore improve their memory. And we believe that it has the potential to become a new solution towards seniors’ health in the future.:::2021
