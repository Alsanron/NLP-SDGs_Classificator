Jilin_China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mosquiet: A Environment Friendly And Quieter Biological Mosquitoes Trapping System:::Currently, more and more people suffer from mosquitoes and mosquito-borne disease. Although variety of methods have been developed to protect people from mosquitoes by using chemicals, they all have some defects such as slight toxicity, limited scope of action and so on. To solve this problem through biological method, a type of E.coli has been engineered to effectively attract mosquitoes in our project by releasing the three-gases-mixture ,including L-lactic acid, acetic acid and ammonia. Besides, the CRISPRi/dCas9 technique has been applied to regulate the use of carbon to increase the production of gas. Meanwhile, an acid-responsive dynamic control system and a quorum-sensing system has been added to ensure the normal growth of E. coli in a weakly acidic environment. In addition, sucrose-related suiciding system and carbon source utilization system have been introduced into the bacterium to ensure biosafety and meet the demand of household device.:::2021
