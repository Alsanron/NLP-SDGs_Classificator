UChicago:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::LaccXa:::Pharmaceutical pollution is a major problem that threatens the integrity of Lake Michigan, the largest freshwater lake in the world. One such pollutant is triclosan, a commonly found antifungal and antibacterial agent. While current wastewater treatment plants are able to separate this molecule from water, it is often incorporated in sludge and used as compost where it can find its way back into our waterways. That’s why UChicago’s iGem project hopes to create an optimized enzyme called LACCXA that can chemically degrade triclosan, thus completely eliminating this pollutant rather than physically moving it to another location. Using the laccase from the fungus Trametes versicolor as a template, we employed molecular dynamics simulations from GROMACS to analyze active site binding activity at wastewater treatment plan conditions to inform potential mutations that optimize laccase functionality.:::2021
