ECUST_China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Magic Blue:::Phycocyanin is a kind of rare natural blue pigment and has a broad development and application prospect. It has great value in food, medicine, reagent,cosmetics and other fields. But phycocyanin is limited by it’s high cost and instability. In order to improve the stability and cut down the cost of production of phycocyanin so that it can obtained more widely used. We--ECUST_China invented‘magic blue'. Using dual-plasmid-system to rebuild the metabolic pathway of producing phycocyanin in the host of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In brief, our experiment includes three parts: Firstly, the construction of the expression pathway of phycocyanin. Secondary, the regulator part of the expression vector. Thirdly, improvement of the thermal stability using site-directed mutagenesis. Through our project, we can make the phycocyanin get easy access to our daily life and benefit us.:::2021
