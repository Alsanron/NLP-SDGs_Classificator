TecCEM:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Disrupting Disruptors:::We designed a biosensor for the detection of Endocrine Disruptive Compounds (EDCs) in samples of bottled water. This biosensor works through the immobilization of protein receptor hER alpha on a piezoelectric sensor. The protein captures these chemicals, while the piezoelectric sensor senses the change of mass through a change of the natural resonance of the quartz. This signal is recieved and interpreted by a circuit of our own design and will give us information about the concentration of EDCs on the sample of water. We focused on the enzymatic degradation of these compounds as well, through the expression of a Laccase. We plan on introducing this step as part of the purification process of fresh water, guaranteeing EDC-free water to our community and reducing the risk of developing any serious illness.:::2021
