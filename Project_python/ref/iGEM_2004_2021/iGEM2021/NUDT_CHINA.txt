NUDT_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Light-mediated control of cell cycle in mammalian cells:::Optogenetic tools provide essential approaches to control designer cell function. Our project intends to optimize Predator Pro, a modularized protein degradation system weâ€™ve been working on in the past few years, to achieve light-mediated degradation of endogenous cyclin protein, the key regulator protein family in cell cycle, thereby manipulating cell cycle in mammalian cells. Integrating with a raspberry pie-based blue light illumination device, our system may provide novel tools for cell cycle synchronization and spatiotemporal control of cell division. Our work may provide novel tools for synthetic biology community and researchers in other fields, it will also provide new hints for treating diseases caused by cell abnormal division.:::2021
