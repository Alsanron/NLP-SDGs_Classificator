Northern_BC:::North America:::Canada:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::D-tector: an inexpensive, rapid vitamin D biosensor for northern communities:::The synthesis of vitamin D primarily occurs in the skin upon exposure to UV light. In northern climates with fluctuating sunlight levels, vitamin D insufficiency (< 50 nmol/L) is common. In Canada, 33% of the population experiences insufficiency. Current testing methods in northern British Columbia, Canada, are expensive, time-consuming, and inaccessible. A benchtop vitamin D biosensor that can be implemented in local healthcare facilities would address this problem. Our biosensor will detect vitamin D (25(OH)D) in a blood serum sample. The biosensor is contained in E. coli, and consists of two components: (i) 1-alpha-hydroxylase, and (ii) a chimeric protein consisting of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of vitamin D receptor and a FRET system (VDR-FRET). The 1-alpha-hydroxylase activates 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, which has high affinity for the VDR-LBD. Binding of 1,25(OH)2D to the VDR-FRET protein results in an altered fluorescent signal.:::2021
