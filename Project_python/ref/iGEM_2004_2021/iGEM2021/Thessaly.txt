Thessaly:::Europe:::Greece:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Amalthea: a complete prevention toolkit to gut dysbiosis:::Diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are one of the greatest pandemics of the 21st century. Most of them are reflected on the metabolic capacity of the gut microbiome, thus making it an attractive target for further research and interventions. The impairments on the microbiomeâ€™s metabolic profile, called gut dysbiosis, is characterized by altered concentrations of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs). Thus, we are developing a bioelectronic capsule that utilizes a biosensor which correlates the amount of gut SCFAs with gut microbiome functional capacity, also supported by a kinetics-oriented in silico analysis. The data is digitized and transmitted to a mobile application, where a multidisciplinary team of health experts evaluate the data received. If dysbiosis is detected, we alleviate it by the usage of a living biotherapeutic, synbiotic nutritional supplement in a personalized manner.:::2021
