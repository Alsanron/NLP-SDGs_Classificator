Nanjing_NFLS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Antibiotics Killer:::Residual tetracyclic antibiotics in the environment is a real problem of ecological and human health relevance that has emerged in recent years, and there is an urgent need to develop efficient and convenient technologies for the efficient degradation of tetracyclic antibiotics (aureomycin). We found that microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can degrade aureomycin by Fenton reaction through modification of the cathode. At the same time, to improve the degradation rate, we aim to localize a biofilm to the cell anode as biofilm activity is closely related to the efficiency of microbial fuel cells. By overexpressing the quorum sensing system in the electricity-producing bacteria, we greatly improved the efficiency of the fuel cell and thus the degradation efficiency of aureomycin.:::2021
