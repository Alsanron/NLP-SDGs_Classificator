LMSU:::Europe:::Russian Federation:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ASCEND:::The question of food supply for the long-distance flights remains still unsolved. Moreover, onboard food production must meet restricted requirements due to the curtailed resources on the spacecraft. Ð¡yanobacteria Arthrospira platens is a perfect candidate in this case. However, it is tasteless. A long-term ASCEND project is aimed to introduce Arthrospira platensis engineered to produce any genes of interest, and flavours in particular, as a new chassis for the synthetic biology community. We have designed and tested a special optogenetic system, which will facilitate switching between different products and help optimize growth and production conditions. Blue light induces anchoring of BcLOV4 protein in the plasma membrane and maintains culture growth, whereas far-red light induces the production of genes of interests by activating the BphP1 light-sensitive protein and forcing it to inactivate QPAS1-Gal4 repressor. This year genetic constructions were trialed in E.coli with YFP as a test gene.:::2021
