It can enter the child's body in the form of oral liquid, capsule, drink, etc. The oral form can facilitate rotavirus patients' treatment and prevent children from developing resistance. In this project, the construction and characterization of the plasmids for oral rotavirus vaccine production were completed in order to prepare the target vaccine. Genes for the Î² subunit of the heat-labile enterotoxin (LTB) from E. coli and the immunodominant outer core protein VP7 were cloned and expressed as a fusion protein. After being introduced into Bacillus subtilis, the plasmid could recognize rotavirus and express antigens LTB-VP7 successfully. This work here set the stage for the future development of the oral rotavirus vaccine:::2021
