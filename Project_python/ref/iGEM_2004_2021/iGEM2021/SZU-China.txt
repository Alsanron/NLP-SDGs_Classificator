SZU-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Gutail Floractory - A customized platform for IBD cocktail adjuvants based on intestinal engineered bacteria:::IBD, as a chronic intestinal inflammatory reaction, recurs frequently and is a potential cancer risk. The disease is currently incurable and exerts many different stresses on patients. This year, we aim to develop a 'cocktail' of customized, genetically engineered intestinal probiotics as an adjuvant to alleviate the recurrence of IBD and improve patient's quality of life. Based on E. coli Nissle 1917 and L. lactis, we express four related substances to target IBD: butyric acid, which can consolidate the intestinal barrier and inhibit inflammatory pathways; human antimicrobial peptide LL37 for LPS resistance; SOD to reverse peroxide stress state; and BSH to reverse abnormal bile acid metabolism and reduce inflammation. To successfully implement our project in the context of potential patient needs, we write a business plan and design a series of hardware devices. We believe our project will be practical and can offer far-reaching benefits to many future patients.:::2021
