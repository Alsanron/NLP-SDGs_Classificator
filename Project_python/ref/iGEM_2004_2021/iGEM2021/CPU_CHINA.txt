CPU_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Construction of MnP-AAO-HFB1 composite system based on CRISPR/dCas9 programmable assembly technology for polyethylene plastic oxidation.:::Examplified by polyethylene, undegradable plastics have a degradation period of hundreds of years under natural conditions, causing severe environmental crisis worldwide. Manganese peroxidase (MnP) uses hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce high-redox-potential Mn3+, possessing a PE-degrading potential. Our project takes MnP as our key PE-degrading enzyme, employs aryl alcohol oxidase (AAO) to provide H2O2 for MnP, and utilizes hydrophobin-1 (HFB1) to increase substrate accessibility, as well as combines SpyCatcher-SpyTag system with CRISPR/dCas9 system to anchor MnP, AAO and HFB1 onto one double-stranded DNA scaffold according to certain spatial order, distance and proportion. The final complex works as a molecular machine that can adhere and degrade PE in a green and swift way:::2021
