Concordia-Montreal:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Astroyeast Microfarm: Space-adapted nutrient and flavour factory:::The AstroYeast Microfarm project comprises two major parts. These include AstroYeast, which is a strain of microgravity tolerant S. cerevisiae and a bioreactor that mitigates the effect of microgravity on liquid cultures. The overall goal of this project is to provide a platform for bioproduction using baker’s yeast that can be used on long space missions. To develop the yeast, a fluorescent reporter whose expression mimics microgravity induced stress responses, and will be used as a marker for tracking evolution progress. The promoters selected are based on results from the AstroBio database, our team’s project from last year. Microgravity stress was induced using microgravity simulators in the form of a high aspect rotating vessel and a 3D clinostat designed and built by our team and collaborators. The bioreactor will be designed to be automated, sustainable, and accessible to the operator in order to satisfy our objective.:::2021
