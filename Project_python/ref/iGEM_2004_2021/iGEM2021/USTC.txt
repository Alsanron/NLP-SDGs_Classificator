USTC:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Tau-captamer the early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease:::It's reported that Tau protein level in serum may indicate AD progress. Thus, we devised a new-concept in vitro Tau detection method for early AD diagnosis, depending on the specific binding between aptamers and Tau proteins. First, a molecular switch transfers the aptamer-protein binding signal to a downstream signal pathway. Second, the downstream signal pathway amplifies the signal exponentially to a detectable level. Our method has more convenience, lower cost and higher specificity and sensitivity.:::2021
