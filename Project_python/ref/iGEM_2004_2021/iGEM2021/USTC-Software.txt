USTC-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CAT : Convenient and Accurate Tool:::Nowadays, machine learning has been devoted to various areas, and has made some magnificent contribution in Synthetic biology, for example, Alphafold2 by Google, which can accurately predict the 3D structure by protein sequence, and some other models predicting the properties of protein sequence. But recently there is still lack of tools that is user-friendly and can integrate existing model and software. Thus, CAT, Convenient Accurate Tool, is designed and is based on the purpose of offering an highly-efficient software to our user. We‘ve collected some important properties of protein sequence. Moreover, we combine CAT with education and build up an education version in order to briefly introduce the models and the achievement that machine learning has done in synthetic biology. By the education version, we hope that CAT can motivate students’ interest and make further contribution in the area of synthetic biology and machine learning.:::2021
