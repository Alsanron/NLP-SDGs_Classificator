Hong_Kong_JSS:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::AflaCut: A Innovative Apporach to Tackle Aflatoxin Contamination in Food:::Aflatoxins are carcinogens produced by Aspergillus sp. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most common and toxic member among all. According to WHO, ~25% of foods crops are contaminated by AFB annually. Meanwhile, ~5 billion people are at risk of AFB exposure and 80% of them develop AFB-related cancer. The Consumer Council of Hong Kong in 2020 shows that 24% of popular dried spices in HK contain AFB. Meanwhile, the humid weather in HK favors the growth of the fungi, so AFB contamination of improperly stored food is a common problem. Our project aims to synthesize a probiotic E. coli that secretes high activity AFB-degrading enzymes. The applications include: 1. Applying to the surface of crops. While the enzymes detoxify the AFB, E. coli reduces the fungal growth by competition. 2. Purified enzymes will be used as detoxifying spray. This project is in the Phase I stage.:::2021
