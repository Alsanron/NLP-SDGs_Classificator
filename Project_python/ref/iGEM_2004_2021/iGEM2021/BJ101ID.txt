BJ101ID:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Enhancing Recycled Paper:::Ever since the industrial revolution, mass manufacturing of products through assembly lines and technologies emerged. Paper, being a commonly used household and working item, had production boost from 20th century. Meanwhile, people realized how their actions damaged environment, which pushed the development of Recycled Paper. Up to now, recycled paper process is still not "environmentally-friendly" and the quality is not as good as first-hand one. BJ101ID are dedicated to solving this problem using synthetic-biology. We explored the possible effects of additives sericin and chitosan on recycled paperâ€™s strength and elasticity and proved the improvement in lab. Through E.coli, we were able to produce these two substances by genetic modification. Further experiment and modeling formulated a preeminent result with high quality and spotless paper. At the same time, we developed partnerships and collaboration with other iGEM teams and educated the new generation with what we know through seminars and online conferences.:::2021
