AFCM-Egypt:::Africa:::Egypt:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Deep Learning-Assisted Immunotherapy Platform for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC):::Immunotherapy provides new therapeutic opportunities for various cancers and infectious diseases. Herein, triple-negative breast cancer immunotherapy is achieved via circuits developed to operate logical decisions upon recognizing intracellular targets. Using DNA launching of replicons as a potent delivery system, the platform regulates the expression of the subgenomic immunotherapeutic message based on sensing intracellular mRNAs or proteins via novel protein fusion constructs. This regulation depends on a set of riboswitches to control downstream expression. To provide a safety switch for clinical applications, the system can be stopped through a small molecule inhibition. This design is also environment-responsive, as it depends on a set of toehold-like switches to sense cell-specific set of RNAs leading to feedback regulation of the delivered cargo. The platform was adapted to deliver intratumoral oncolytic and immunotherapeutic signals. It is aided by a set of deep learning models and a computational directed evolution algorithm for developing functional proteins.:::2021
