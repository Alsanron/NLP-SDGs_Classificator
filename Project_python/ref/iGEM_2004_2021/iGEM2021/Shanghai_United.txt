Shanghai_United:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::ASeeker: Arsenic Biosenser:::As a non-metallic element, arsenic has a very important use in industry. But equally, its harm to the human body is also very huge, even causing cancers. So what we need to do is find a more efficient way to detect the presence and the amount of arsenic around us. In this case, we design to combine the arsA, arsD, and arsR genes to make up the ARS operon pattern which could respond to the presence of arsenic. Afterward, we use green fluorescent proteins to ’ring’ the alarm by glowing. We hope our project could promote the public awareness of arsenic threat and provide a better solution to detect arsenic.:::2021
