Stony_Brook:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MlrA Expression in E. coli to Break Down Microcystin from Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms:::Microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a toxin produced by cyanobacterial algal blooms, contaminates lakes and causes severe illness and death in humans and wildlife. Removing MC-LR with conventional techniques is costly and produces toxic byproducts. Therefore, we plan to use MlrA, an enzyme native to Sphingomonas spp., which linearizes the ring structure of MC-LR and reduces its toxicity. While previous works have expressed this enzyme in E. coli, we hope to achieve higher yields through two novel methods. The first anchors MlrA on the outer membrane of E. coli via a fusion protein with poly-Î³-glutamate. The second secretes MlrA into the periplasm using TatExpress, a super-secreting strain, to increase the expression of transport membrane proteins. This project also proposes a microcystin detection method using a two-hybrid bacterial assay. Overall, employing these modified bacteria into a biofilter and detection system is a potential method for reducing microcystin toxicity in a safe, cost-effective way.:::2021
