UMaryland:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PhosphoREUSE:::Our neighboring Chesapeake Bay is frequently subjected to harmful algal blooms caused in part by excess phosphorus pollution. This type of pollution threatens aquatic habitats, biodiversity, and even the livelihoods of humans. However, current phosphorus remediation techniques do not prioritize reclamation and reuse of phosphorus, a nonrenewable resource. By genetically engineering E. coli to contain key phosphorus metabolic genes from the phosphorus-accumulating organism, Microlunatus phosphovorus, UMaryland iGEM set out to develop PhosphoREUSE, a phosphorus recycling system that can uptake, store, and release phosphorus. To facilitate easy use of our sequestration units, our genetic constructs are housed in a bioreactor system that is user-friendly and affordable. In order to ensure the efficacy of our design and its usefulness to our community, our team engaged with experts in the area and stakeholders who may want to utilize our system to detect and decrease unhealthy levels of polyphosphates in bodies of water.:::2021
