Open_Science_Global:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Community Lab:::Accepted:::Frugal Biofoundries for Distributed Enzyme Manufacturing:::Biotechnology can help avert human civilization's looming mass extinction caused by fossil energy. However, intellectual property, skills, and high costs of hardware and wetware create massive barriers. These barriers were profoundly felt throughout the pandemic as sparse access to bio-manufacturing infrastructure severely limited medical relief, testing, and vaccination. With an internationally distributed team of 10 nationalities and 4 laboratories, we aim to break these barriers by frugally producing and purifying thermostable enzymes essential for synthetic biology solutions. We have established a pipeline for enzyme production in frugal bio-foundries thatâ€™s based on open-sourced software, hardware, material transfer agreement, and wetware constructs of B. subtilis for reducing protein extraction costs. Our genetic constructs will be freely distributed by FreeGenes. To gauge the global needs of implementing a frugal bio-foundry in different parts of the world, we set up a hackathon in partnership with JOGL. Our project contributes towards democratizing biotechnology.:::2021
