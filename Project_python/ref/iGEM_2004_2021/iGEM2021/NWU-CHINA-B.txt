NWU-CHINA-B:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The transformation journey of ginsenosides:::Ginseng is the main source of ginsenosides, but unfortunately, its growth cycle is very slow and it is susceptible to seasonal climate and other factors, its yield is limited.In order to overcome this problem, the SS-bgly gene derived from Sulfolobus solfataricus was highly expressed in pichia coli system after codon optimization, and the enzymatic reaction conditions of conversion of ginsenoside substrate Rb1 to CK from SS-bgly were explored.Under optimized enzymatic reaction conditions, the recombinant SS-bgly can transform ginsenoside Rb1 with higher substrate concentration into CK, which is conducive to the large-scale production of ginsenoside CK.:::2021
