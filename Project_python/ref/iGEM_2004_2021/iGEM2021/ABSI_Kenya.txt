ABSI_Kenya:::Africa:::Kenya:::Environment:::Community Lab:::Accepted:::Development of a Portable Biosensor for Detection of Selected Contaminants in Drinking Water:::Access to safe drinking water is essential for humans. However, drinking water quality is a major source of human infections in low and middle-income countries. Conventional methods for detecting contaminants in drinking water is time-consuming, labour-intensive and expensive. This study aims to overcome this challenge by constructing and validating a cheap, easy to use portable device for the detection of selected contaminants in drinking water. The “Build, Test, Design” cycle will be employed. Appropriate parts will be identified for the selected contaminants and obtained from the iGEM repository. Modelling and simulation will be done to select the best combination. Next, the designed model will be tested for the detection of specific contaminants. Findings from this study will demonstrate the importance of synthetic biology in solving human problems by providing a user-friendly, inexpensive, home-deployable biosensor.:::2021
