Tec-Monterrey:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Diagnosgene:::Agave is a crucial part of Mexicoâ€™s culture, ethnicity, and economy. In our country, nearly 558 municipalities are dedicated to its production, and its use for the manufacture of tequila generates a net income of more than 1 billion USD every year, but its production faces an obstacle: the wilting of agave, which is caused by a diversity of fungi and leads to the eventual death of the plant. Current detection systems are either visual or laboratory examinations, but the process can take up to three weeks, and by that time the infection can be spread through the whole land. Our proposal, Diagnosgene, consists of a rapid, easy-to-use, early detection system which can be implemented on the field. The detection which occurs within a cell-free system, is accomplished by the usage of toehold switches, which are RNA tools that get specifically attached to a given complementary sequence.:::2021
