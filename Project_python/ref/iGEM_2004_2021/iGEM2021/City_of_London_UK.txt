City_of_London_UK:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Project Ribotox:::Pre-eclampsia is a condition that causes high blood pressure during and after pregnancy. Currently, It is detected after symptoms have arisen by old, antiquated methods that often result in misdiagnosis, ultimately leading to preventable complications in pregnancy such as foetal growth restriction, low birth weight and life-threatening seizures and blood clots. Project Ribotox aims to spread awareness about preeclampsia and to develop a screening tool using microRNA biomarkers twice as early into pregnancy as current methods allow, by detecting two upregulated miRNAs in the serum of patients with the condition with toehold switches, and a novel method of isothermal amplification. This test will be able to take place in a single tube at a single temperature, increasing the accessibility of RNA tests worldwide.:::2021
