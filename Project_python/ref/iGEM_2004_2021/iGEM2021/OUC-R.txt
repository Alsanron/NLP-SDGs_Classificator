OUC-R:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RegulatorZ：A gene expression regulator achieved by conformation changes of Z-DNA:::Based on the study of our team PI, We designed a DNA double-loop structure with hairpin, APP sequence, promoter sequence and ribozyme gene. By adding inducer, the conformation of DNA changed and ribozyme gene expressed normally. We plan to use this switch to simulate the effects of special structures such as left spiral DNA and cross structure on gene expression in organisms, and it can be applied to detect whether cobalt ions, nickel ions and ZBP1 protein are contained in the environment. In further studies we also focus on diseases caused by DNA conformational changes, like Alzheimer’s Disease and Breast Cancer, seeking a way of detection of these diseases and an easy and quick method to show the diagnosing results.:::2021
