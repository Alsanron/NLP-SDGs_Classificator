NEU_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Environmental multivirus detection based on PmrCAB and LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing system.:::In this study, we developed an environmental multivirus detection device based on engineered E. coli to capture coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, to spark fluorescence reporter gene. The PmrCAB system derived from Salmonella was recombined onto the surface of E. coli, and the Fe(III) recognition site of PmrB was replaced with the receptor of targeted coronavirus. Therefore, the bacteria can capture coronavirus via binding to their receptors and transport signaling to the downstream components. LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing system from E. coli and Hrp amplifier from Pseudomonas syringae were used to enhance the sensitivity and output signal. In addition, we also develop an improved air sampler to enrich nanoparticle in air onto engineered E. coli. The implementation of the environmental multivirus detection would be helpful for establish a preventive system in public place, such as hospital and super market.:::2021
