ECNUAS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Silent Spring: Cell-free Atrazine Biosensor:::Atrazine is commonly used as a herbicide for production and distribution but harm to human body. Our team is working on the development of a portable, efficient and inexpensive cell-free biosensor that can detect the Atrazine derivatives through fluorescent color. To achieve our final goal, we firstly constructed a Recombinant E. coli in order to veryfy our design and we would further explore the cell-free experiments to improve the applicability and functionality of our biosensor.:::2021
