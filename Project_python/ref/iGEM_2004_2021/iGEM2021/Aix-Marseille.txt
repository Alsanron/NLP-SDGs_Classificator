Aix-Marseille:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ARBO-BLOCK : To a novel eco-friendly way to prevent mosquito-transmitted viral diseases spread:::Arboviral diseases, such as Zika, Dengue and Chikungunia are a serious threat to human health as no vaccines against them exist. Furthermore, global warming is causing the spread of the mosquito vectors of these diseases, including to the South of France. However, mosquitos are an important element of biodiversity in the environment and part of ecosystem food chains. We have designed and engineered ARBO-BLOCK, an innovative, and eco-friendly solution to prevent arboviral diseases spread. Using a modified bacterium from the mosquito microbiota to specifically detect and kill only dangerous virus-infected mosquitoes, while preserving uninfected mosquitoes. ARBO-BLOCK is designed around a timed lysis device, that results in bacterial lysis and release of large amounts of arthropod lethal toxins accumulated following the detection of viruses in the mosquito gut.:::2021
