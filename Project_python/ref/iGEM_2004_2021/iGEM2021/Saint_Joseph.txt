Saint_Joseph:::Europe:::Turkey:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Cellulophile:::Water pollution caused by paper waste is a huge ecological problem. Cellulose, a polysaccharide, is the main compound of paper products and can be degraded by cellulases; primarily performing hydrolysis of the 1,4-beta-D-glycosidic linkages to produce monosaccharides, smaller polysaccharides and oligosaccharides (2,3). In this project, we aimed to find a biological solution to water pollution caused by paper contaminants. For this purpose, we used endoglucanase II enzyme from Trichoderma reesei and removed the linker region, CBM domain and the signal peptide from the gene (BBa_K3941001). Additionally, for the purpose of increase enzyme activity, we designed 2 mutant forms of this enzyme and conducted experiments (BBa_K3941003 and BBa_K3941002). For the same purpose, we also worked on the catalytic region of CelAB cellulase (BBa_K3941000) which produced from Teredinibacter turnerae. The results of this project promise that paper contaminated waters can be cleaned much more effectively and eco-friendly by using cellulases.:::2021
