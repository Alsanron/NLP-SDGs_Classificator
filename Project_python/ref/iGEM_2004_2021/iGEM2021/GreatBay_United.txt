GreatBay_United:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Artificial Limulus Amebocyte Lysate:::Bacterial endotoxin testing is indispensable for disease diagnosis and the launch of new drugs, demand is increasing year by year. The limulus blood reagent taken from the blood of horseshoe crab is currently recognised as the most reliable detection method, but 600,000 horseshoe crabs are dedicated to this every year. This project draws inspiration from bacterial endotoxin detection and horseshoe crab protection, and plans to develop a new, efficient and accurate method to meet the market needs of endotoxin detection. Based on the principle of the limulus hemagglutination reaction, three systems are designed to simulate the limulus reagent reaction. It is hoped that while filling the technological gap, members from GreatBay_United can saves the future of an endangered species.:::2021
