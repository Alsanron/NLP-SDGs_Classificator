IISER_Berhampur:::Asia:::India:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CODE-M : Cas Optimised DEvice for MDR-TB detection:::In our project, we aim to make a rapid molecular diagnostic kit for early detection of TB and MDR-TB. Our diagnostic kit will first detect the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sample via LAMP colorimetric assay. Along with detecting the presence of TB, it will also provide DNA fragments for mutation analysis for MDR-TB detection. Studies have shown the formidable ability of Cas14 to detect SNPs. We intend to use this property to detect the key MDR-TB mutations through specially designed guide RNA. The gRNA will act against the selected genes and analyze the results by detecting the fluorescence triggered by Cas14 complex. We propose to use an integrated hardware device for detecting the fluorescence emission which will also give the final diagnostic report. Our ultimate goal is to reduce the cost of diagnosis and provide a point-of-care system and make our kit accessible to most of the patients.:::2021
