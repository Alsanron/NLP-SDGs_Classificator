ICJFLS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Disposable and Biodegradable Straw Made from Amylose Produced by E.coli:::In January 2021, the Chinese government started to enforce the ban on the use of disposable plastic straws in the food industry as they cause great harm to the environment. At present, paper straws are the most popular alternative to plastic straws. However, paper straws have many defects including bad taste, easy to crack and short lifetime. Amylose is a polysaccharide chain linked by a-(1,4) glycosidic bond with D-glucose. It has poor water solubility, anti-swelling and fat insolubility, which can be used in the production of food packaging materials. In our project, we introduced two enzymes involved in amylose synthesis into E. coli: ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase containing 2 subunits ADG1 and APL1, and granule-bound starch synthase 1 (GBSS1). Once our project is completed, amylose will be synthesized and used for the production of biodegradable straw. It will replace the plastic and paper straws with a broad prospect.:::2021
