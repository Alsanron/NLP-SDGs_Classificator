Cornell:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering Prokaryotic Collagen-Based Scaffolds to Guide Cell Growth in Damaged Joint Tissues:::Numerous cell types must grow in specific patterns to form functional knee and elbow joints, and injury healing in these areas is difficult as these cells must all regenerate in very exact locations. This project aims to improve tissue healing by developing a prokaryotic collagen-based scaffold; this acts as a pre-programmed framework that precisely directs the growth arrangements of mouse myoblasts and fibroblasts. Strains of Escherichia coli were engineered to produce Scl2 proteins with binding motifs for integrin and fibronectin; these customizable protein products were incorporated into a hydrogel, providing a physical structure to which the mouse cells attach. The hydrogels feature optimal spatial distributions of binding motifs tailored to each cell line, causing them to grow in desired patterns due to the differences in their respective ECM affinities for integrin and fibronectin binding sites. The effectiveness of these hydrogels was characterized through cell cultures and microscopic imaging.:::2021
