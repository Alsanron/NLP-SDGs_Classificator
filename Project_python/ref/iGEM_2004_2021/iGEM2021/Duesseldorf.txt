Duesseldorf:::Europe:::Germany:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of an in-field quick test for the differentiation of plant pathogens:::This year, iGEM Düsseldorf sets the focus on pathogen detection and differentiation. The aim is to design an adaptable quick-test with three potential applications. Firstly, to detect common plant diseases on young plants, secondly, to detect pathogens in-field before signs of infection are even visible, with the help of multispectral imaging cameras that identify plants with reduced photosynthetic activity. Thirdly, to be able to differentiate between known diseases that are hard to identify with the naked eye. The plants can be tested with our lateral flow assay consisting of two aptamers that have been carefully selected through the SELEX process. These aptamers bind specifically to either a protein expressed during the plant’s stress response or the pathogenic cell itself, precisely detecting the cause of stress. To visualize general plant stresses immediately, a reporter plant was designed, whose colour changes depending on the kind of stress it’s exposed to.:::2021
