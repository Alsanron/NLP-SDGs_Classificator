Leiden:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DOPL LOCK - unlock the potential of GMOs:::A major challenge in synthetic biology is the containment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) outside of the laboratory. This includes restraining the physical spread of the organism and transfer of synthetic genes, via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This challenge remains as regulatory bodies require sound evidence on the safety of GMOs which is difficult due to the lack of knowledge upon release. Additionally, the absence of risks is not necessarily a definitive proof of safety. Therefore, industry is unwilling to invest and scientists only rarely get permission to gather large-scale data. Here, DOPL LOCK can make the difference: we propose a mutually dependent double plasmid lock which will minimize HGT and the spread of GMOs. Our goal is to provide an open-source, standardised, modular and widely applicable Safe-by-Design biocontainment system of GMOs in non-contained applications. With DOPL LOCK, we aim to drive bio-safety innovations, accelerating the field of synthetic biology.:::2021
