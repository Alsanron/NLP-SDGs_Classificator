Hong_Kong_HKU:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Co-culturing PET-degrading and sucrose-dependent E. coli with sucrose-secreting S. elongatus:::HKU iGEM team is developing a self-sustaining and solar-driven bioreactor that digests PET by utilising the symbiotic relationship between the bacteria Escherichia coli and the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus. In the co-culture, E. coli (Strain BL21-DE3) is engineered to express PETase and MHETase enzymes, as well as absorb sucrose secreted by S. elongatus as its energy source. The enzymes facilitate the degradation of PET into its monomers - terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol, which can then be repurposed in the creation of new bioplastics to maintain a circular and greener supply chain.:::2021
