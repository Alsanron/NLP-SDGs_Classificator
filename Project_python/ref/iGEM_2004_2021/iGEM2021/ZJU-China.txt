ZJU-China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Liver Guard: Precise therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma based on engineered oncolytic adenovirus:::Oncolytic virus (OV) is a promising method to treat hepatocellular carcinoma, yet it has not been widely used clinically due to low infection efficiency, insufficient specificity, compromised intertumoral transmission and etc. Our project designed a genetically modified adenovirus using synthetic biology approach to overcome current problems with oncolytic virus. We also enables engineered adenovirus to escape from immunity trap with immunocamouflage, which increases the titre of viral infection. We hoped that our project can give a new insight into precise oncolytic treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.:::2021
