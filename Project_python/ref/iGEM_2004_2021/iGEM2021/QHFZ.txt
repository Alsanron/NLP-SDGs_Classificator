QHFZ:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Tyrian Purple Producer:::Tyrian purple, mainly composed of 6,6'-dibromoindigo (6BrIG), is an ancient dye extracted from sea snails and was recently demonstrated as a biocompatible semiconductor material. However, its synthesis remains limited due to uncharacterized biosynthetic pathways and the difficulty of regiospecific bromination. Here, we introduce an effective 6BrIG production strategy in Escherichia coli using tryptophan 6-halogenase SttH, tryptophanase TnaA and flavin-containing monooxygenase MaFMO. After our transformation, E. coli will become a producer of tyrian purple, and it has been proved to be used as a biological dye.:::2021
