OhioState:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Lipid-A Phighter - an engineered phage therapy to combat sepsis:::Sepsis is caused by the overreaction of the immune system to an infection. This overreaction can starve organs of oxygen leading to tissue death, organ failure, and even death. Approximately 1 in 5 deaths worldwide are sepsis-related. When sepsis is caused by a bacterial infection, the immune system reacts to an endotoxin, lipid-A. Our solution was a phage that can kill bacteria and release molecules that competitively inhibit or modify lipid A such that the immune response is reduced. We designed recombinant plasmids with multiple promoters and different anti-lipid A genes to be inserted into the phage genome. Beyond the lab, we created a predictive model for baseline gene expression to compare promoter strengths. Additionally, we worked to propose legislation promoting phage therapy and spread awareness about sepsis by creating a childrenâ€™s book.:::2021
