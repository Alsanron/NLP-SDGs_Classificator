UPF_Barcelona:::Europe:::Spain:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ARIA: A democratizing AI-Synbio system to fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria:::Drug-resistant bacteria cause 700,000 deaths per year, which could rise to 10 million by 2050. When standard treatments are not effective, saving lives implies rapidly profiling the pathogen's resistance, but traditional methods can delay this process from hours to days. The Antibiotic Resistance Inference Array (ARIA) aims to become a proof-of-concept for an innovative system that tackles this problem. First, we combine advanced algorithms to analyze large amounts of microbe genomic and functional data and define lists of resistance-related markers. Then, we create a library of self-growable biosensors that detect these markers, and we deploy them on a paper-based array: by adding a pathogenic sample to the array, a fluorescence pattern emerges. Finally, a cross-platform computer vision application automatically extracts from this pattern the set of markers found and sends it to an artificial intelligence module, which integrates it with patient-specific information to infer the most suitable countermeasure available.:::2021
