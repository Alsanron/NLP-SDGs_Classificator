SHSID:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Dual biosynthesis of putrescine through the yeast by reconstructing the plasmids:::Tropane alkaloid-derived medicines are under supply shortage, but growing demand. The extraction of putrescine from plants was time-consuming and low yields, which is seen as a vital limiting factor of tropane alkaloids production. Our project aims at genetically modifying yeast to efficiently produce putrescine in large quantities. On one hand, we designed to introduce the spe1gene to over-express the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction producing putrescine from ornithine. On the other hand, we also introduced two other genes, AsADC derived from oats and speB derived from E. coli which could produce enzymes catalyzing the reaction producing putrescine from arginine. All above will make the yeast a factory to continuously biosynthetic putrescine to support tropane alkaloids production.:::2021
