A tumour starts developing asymptomatically, becoming less responsive to therapy by the time of diagnosis. We can detect cancer sooner by screening bodily fluids, such as blood or urea, for presence of tumour-associated biomarkers. These biomarkers include proteins, nucleic acids, and circulating tumour cells. However, a large-scale screening initiative requires a test for a dynamic marker that appears early during the disease and is shared by multiple tumours, such as microRNA (miRNA). Our prototype microfluidic chip, ExoSwitch, makes nucleic acid detection acessible and simple. By utilizing de novo designed RNA machines termed toehold switches, it allows rapid detection of multiple cancer-linked miRNAs. The “lab-on-chip” technology offers parallel testing for multiple targets and requires minimal equipment to perform the assay. Combining low cost and easy distribution, ExoSwitch can bring accessible tumour screening to patients worldwide.:::2021
