NEFU_China:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::G-quadruplex-directed colorimetric virus detection system:::The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) severely struck the whole world. Rapid and convenient detection of pathogenic viruses can facilitate early detections and prevent large outbreaks of viral epidemics, including COVID-19. Here, we developed a G-quadruplex-based, highly specific, expedite and economic RNA virus detection system using SARS-CoV-2 as an example. The procedure includes recombinase-polymerase-mediated viral sequence amplification, nCas9-Phi29-mediated DNA nicking and displacement, rolling cycle amplification of G-quadruplex, and color development. All reactions can be carried out at ambient temperatures with limited requirement of instrument, which allows the method to be used under all circumstances.:::2021
