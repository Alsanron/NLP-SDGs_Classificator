They are pharmacodynamic compounds and have been widely used in the treatment of cancer and various diseases. Unfortunately, for some people, itâ€™s hard for them to digest certain kinds of flavones, which is detrimental to their health. In this project, we put FLR gene into E. coli to produce a strain secreting FLR enzyme. The strain degrades flavonoids to produce DAT and stimulate the immune system to achieve the purposes of anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and anti-cancer. Through this project, we hope to help those people assimilate certain flavones and improve their physical state.:::2021
