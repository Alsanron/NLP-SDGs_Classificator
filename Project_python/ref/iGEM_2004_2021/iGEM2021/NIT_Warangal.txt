Despite its nutritious and functional food qualities, the consumption of cotton seeds is severely hampered by the presence of a toxic terpenoid known as gossypol. The enzymatic method has proved to be effective for detoxifying gossypol as it is substrate-specific. To date, the degossypolyzation of CSM by enzymatic techniques remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we have computationally screened for enzymes displaying affinity towards gossypol. The top screened enzymes were cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris and further provided with crude glycerol as a carbon source for cost-effectiveness. Subsequently, the expressed enzymes were verified for their in vitro degossypolyzation ability against CSM. Moreover, the process parameters of enzymatic degradation will be statistically optimized for the maximal reduction in gossypol content of CSM.:::2021
