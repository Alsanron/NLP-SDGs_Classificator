KU_Leuven:::Europe:::Belgium:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of a continuous directed evolution platform for in vitro-cultured plant cells:::Targeted continuous evolution, using a platform based on CRSIPR-Cas-based nickase and error-prone DNA polymerase (a.k.a. EvolvR), is a powerful approach to rapidly evolve specific phenotypes with minimal user intervention. By establishing this method in planta, we seek to accelerate the evolution of needed plant phenotypes such as (a)biotic stress tolerance. EvolvR, targeted to a gene of interest by a specific guide RNA, continuously diversify the underlying DNA, with cells constantly under selection for improved variants. We have confirmed the efficiency of the approach in E. coli, validated it in a plant-based cell-free system and confirmed its functionality in Tobacco BY-2 cell culture. We have also established mathematical approaches to model and optimize the selection regimens to maximize the efficiency of the pipeline. Our in silico, in vitro and in vivo results further demonstrate the potential of EvolvR to plant biotechnology improving crops and developing new plant-based applications.:::2021
