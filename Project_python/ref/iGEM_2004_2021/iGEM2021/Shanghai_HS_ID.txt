Shanghai_HS_ID:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Applications of CRISPR-Cas 9: Increasing the Expression Efficiency of Foreign DNA in Lactobacillus casei:::Lactobacillus casei was found to have the potential to cure and prevent common health issues like high cholesterol, hypertension, and gastrointestinal diseases. Recent studies show that L. casei's capabilities in medicine and food are highly restricted by their low transformation efficiency of foreign DNA, due to its restriction-modification system. Our purpose is to improve the transformation efficiency of foreign DNA in L. casei to maximize their benefits. In the laboratory, we constructed a plasmid containing CRISPR-Cas9 in E.coli, then transformed the plasmid into L.casei so that the target gene LSEI-2094 can be removed and the restriction-modification system can be silenced. Lastly, we confirmed the results through both sequencing and controlled experiments to verify the efficiency before and after the modification. Results show that the transformation efficiency has significantly increased post-modification, it is hopeful that this modified L. casei could be applicable in pharmaceutical and food.:::2021
