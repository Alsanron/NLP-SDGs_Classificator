Bulgaria:::Europe:::Bulgaria:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::2021 A Resistance Odyssey:::Our team focused on the application of protocols, combining identification of already known and discovery of new genetic determinants, for antibiotic resistance in waste waters. In Phase 1, we gathered information for known antibiotic resistance genes by running full metagenomic sequencing, as well as through selective amplification and sequencing of integrons. This allowed early detection of antibiotic resistance factors relevant to clinically significant antibiotics. Then we singled out genes related to antibiotic resistance, which havenâ€™t been found in the territory of Bulgaria yet. Upon the discovery of new determinants, our project entered Phase 2, in which the determinants were generated using synthesis and gene cloning. The successful completion of our project would lead to the development of streamlined protocols for the examination of the cumulative resistome. This allows for an adequate estimation of antibiotic resistance and provide us with information for future emergence and treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.:::2021
