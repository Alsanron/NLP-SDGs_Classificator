Lambert_GA:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::AgroSENSE:::Hydroponics is a compact modular form of agriculture that addresses food insecurity by producing nutrient-dense, high-yield crops. However, maintaining small-scale systems introduces nutrient fluctuations thus declining plant health, impeding the implementation of hydroponics in urban communities. To combat these barriers and increase the frequency of hydroponics use, AgroSENSE provides an accurate and efficient method of nutrient monitoring and pathogen detection, while simultaneously addressing United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We utilize our phosphate and nitrate biosensors and Fusarium and Phytophthora toehold switches in conjunction with our frugal plate reader for fluorescence quantification. To safely distribute our biosensors, we developed a frugal lyophilizer to freeze-dry cell-free lysates and bacterial samples. We collaborated with the Georgia Department of Agriculture on a regulatory proposal for agricultural biosensors to address biosecurity gaps and led community-centered synthetic biology educational outreach programs. AgroSENSE allows hydroponics users to proactively adjust system maintenance, ultimately increasing harvest yields and sustainability.:::2021
