SCUT-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Nootka-Boom!:::In the humid south, mosquito repellent has been the concern of Guangzhou people. Mosquitoes are not only annoying but also spread various diseases. Therefore, in tropical and subtropical areas, mosquito repellant products are in great demand. Nootkatone is a new mosquito repellent ingredient reported by EPA with more safety and higher stability, but excessively high cost has caused manufacturing limitations. SCUT-China aims at turning S. cerevisiae into a cell factory for Nootkatone production and improving efficiency by promoter engineering modification. Based on the fermentation characteristics of S. cerevisiae, we combined the upstream regulatory elements of different promoters according to the carbon source response mechanism of promoters, and obtained hybrid-promoter supporting high expression in both early and late fermentation. Further, we increased the transcriptional strength of hybrid-promoters by nucleosome affinity model. It is hoped that this project could help achieve higher market shares of Nootkatone and benefit more people.:::2021
