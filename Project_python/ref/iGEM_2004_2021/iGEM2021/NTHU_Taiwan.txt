NTHU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Compine: A Novel Way to Solve Pine Wilt Disease:::Pine wilt disease is caused by specific nematodesâ€”Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. Our goal is to generate a kind of pine tree that can synthesize siRNA that encodes important gene information to B.xylophilus, such as targeting genes related to reproduction and pathogenicity. As soon as the nematodes uptake plant cells, siRNA generate by pine trees will knock down genes that significantly influent the survival of nematodes. We build a model to simulate how the diffusion of siRNA in B.xylophilus. And the birth and dead model we build is to simulate the activity of nematodes on plant callus. We have published an article on PanSci and meet related environmental groups. Our podcast program has launched on several platforms and we designed a board game--Adaptor, introducing this environmental issue and synthetic biology to the public. We hope to generate an efficient method to solve PWD comparing to traditional methods.:::2021
