HZAU-China:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::P.E.T: Pets' Enteric Test:::Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), whose victim almost covers all mammalian species, is an immune-mediated disease at the intersection of complex interactions among genetics, environment and gut microbiota. Compared with human-beings, pets are not able to voice their current health conditions directly; thus, delayed diagnosis becomes a common phenomenon. Taking the most common pets- dogs as objects, HZAU-China aims to develop a method based on synthetic biology to detect IBD at an early stage. The modified Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 can sense the concentration change of biomarkers. If pets suffer from IBD, the bacteria will amplify the unperceivable pathological change by producing substance with special smell and release therapeutic protein. Whatever pets' health conditions are, the modified bacteria will release health-care unit, exerting profound positive effects on pets' health. In the future, our project will be further ameliorated so as to apply this detective method to a wider range of mammals.:::2021
