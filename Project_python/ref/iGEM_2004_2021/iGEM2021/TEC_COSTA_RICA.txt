TEC_COSTA_RICA:::Latin America:::Costa Rica:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Chronobacter:::Inspired by the endless possibilities synthetic biology entails, we decided to approach its real life limitations as inspiration for our project and identified a problem: developing genetic circuits are biased to their core by combinatorial logic which limits functionality, circuit architecture and possible applications. Our objective is to pursue an incipient focus on genetic circuit development based on sequential logic, enabling new functions and expanding the possible applications for engineered organisms. We first developed a novel genetic counter system from which we constructed and modeled a genetic circuit, whose modularity enables it to behave as a toolbox with applications in all areas. To validate our approach we developed a framework and software which allow the construction of an extensive library of genetic circuits. This library can in turn be explored by several filters, designed to convey expression profiles, processes and functional applications of interest as defined by experts.:::2021
