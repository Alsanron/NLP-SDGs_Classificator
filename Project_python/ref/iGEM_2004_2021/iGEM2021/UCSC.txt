UCSC:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Progenie: A prokaryotic sequence-specific gene elimination system:::Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) outbreaks are one of the leading causes of food recalls in the United States; infections can cause diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and even kidney failure and death. We developed a programmable in-situ gene-elimination system, Progenie, to selectively knock-out the Shiga-toxin producing gene stx2 from an environmental microbial communityâ€”reducing STEC outbreaks without harming commensal bacteria. Progenie consists of an initial phage delivery of a conjugatable plasmid encoding an RNA-guided transposon system that self-integrates into a targeted locus and spreads to neighboring microbes. Using E. coli with chromosomally-integrated mcherry as a model for stx2, we measure mCherry fluorescence to quantify the effectiveness and extent of our gene knockout system. Progenie can not only reduce STEC-related food recalls, illness, and waste, but can generalize to disable virulence factors or antibiotic resistance in a host of other microbes.:::2021
