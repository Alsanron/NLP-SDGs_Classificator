WHU-China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Acneraser:::Acne, a common skin disease generally related to pores being blocked by sebum and Propionibacterium acnes proliferating in such an anaerobic environment, almost bothers everyone but has no particularly effective treatment. To address this long-standing challenge, our project aims to develop a novel acne therapy. We engineered a safe, nutritionally deficient Escherichia coli strain, which could decompose fatty acids in high efficiency and secrete strain-specific bacteriocin, for ameliorating sebum blocking and inhibiting P.acnes growth, respectively. In addition, a fatty acids-sensing system was constructed to enable precise therapeutics actuation only in appropriate conditions, minimizing the side effects of gene leakage expression. Furthermore, a high-throughput microfluidic chip was manufactured for accelerating the experimental cycle of directed evolution to optimize the fatty acids-sensing system. It is anticipated that the Acneraser will build new bridges between acne research and synthetic biology, letting this promising and exciting scientific field enhance everyone's life.:::2021
