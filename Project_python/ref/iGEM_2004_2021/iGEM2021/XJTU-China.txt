XJTU-China:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Tryptophan iDream:::In our project, in order to release the pain of people suffering from mental health problems like depression,anxiety and insomnia, we apply the methods of synthetic biology on the functional change of Escherichia coli. According to our ideas, a gene circuit based on Toogle-Switch is designed to reach the goal of switching between two statuses: tryptophan-producing and proliferating, by reacting to signals of IPTG and temperature. On top of that, considering the situation of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we give our project further application by constructing a hardware to help people release their pain in their home by drinking a cup of milk with additional tryptophan in it. We believe this design will actually aid people in dealing with their mental health problems, especially during the pandemic, in a much safer and user-friendly way.:::2021
