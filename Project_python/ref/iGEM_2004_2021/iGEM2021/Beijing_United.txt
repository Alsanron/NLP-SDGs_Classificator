Beijing_United:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Construction of the engineered S. cerevisiae that Breaks Down Wheat Starch-B for Alcohol Production:::Due to COVID-19, the demand for alcohol products has increased a lot, mostly for medical use, and this lead to the increase of the market price of the medical alcohol, as a result, some people not able to afford medical alcohol. One way we thought could solve this problem is to use the gene-editing method to edit the yeast when fermenting wheat starch, that way it can accelerate the efficiency of the process when producing alcohol. We edit the genes of xylanase, β-xylosidase, and acetyl-xylan esterase into the yeast, therefore the gene edited yeast can process these three enzymes by themself. Each kind of enzyme’s role is to break down the polymer of carbohydrate chain in the starch, so the yeast can use the monosaccharides to produce alcohol. Overall, The gene-edited yeast could reduce the cost of alcohol production and take advantage of wheat B starch.:::2021
