Most applications are related to neurochemistry and range from the treatment of neuromuscular disorders, including Parkinsonâ€™s disease, to the use as stimulants. There is increasing need for large-scale, climate-independent, and local production of tropane alkaloids as precursors for medicinal drugs. Our goal is to remedy the impact of world crises on the cultivation and exportation of these drugs. To this avail, we aim to develop a biosynthetic route for a tropane alkaloid intermediate, tropine, in Escherichia coli and the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. To the best of our knowledge this would be the first production of tropine in a prokaryotic organism and could provide an effective and cheap alternative to current tropine production methods.:::2021
