TUDelft:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AptaVita: A novel and modular aptamer-based rapid diagnostic test for vitamin deficiencies:::Hidden hunger, synonymous with micronutrient deficiencies, is estimated to impact the health and life-quality of one in three people, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Current monitoring policies are insufficient, as more data on hidden hunger is required to implement solutions effectively. However, existing detection techniques remain inaccessible for most people. Here, we present AptaVita: a modular, quantitative, and accessible paper-based rapid diagnostic test for vitamin deficiencies available at the point-of-care. Aptazymes (ligand-regulated self-cleaving ribozymes) engineered through in vitro evolution for binding the vitamins of interest are fused with the lacZ reporter gene. Vitamin-responsive translation activation is enabled in the PURE cell-free expression system on paper support. The colorimetric output is quantified by a portable, 3D-printed, dedicated hardware, allowing us to assess the level of targeted vitamins. We envision AptaVita making hidden hunger visible and addressable, thereby contributing to monitoring and tackling vitamin deficiencies together with those involved.:::2021
