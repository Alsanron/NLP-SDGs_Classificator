Shanghai_HS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::The Inhibitory of COVID-19 Antibody Against the Mutant B.1.1.7:::COVID-19 is the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 using the S protein on the surface to combine with the ACE2 receptor. There are now more than 1.7 hundred million cases around the globe with approximately 388 million deaths. SARS-CoV-2 is RNA virus with high glycosylation of its S protein in which the mutation of S1 proteinand the RBD can arouse the infectivity of the virus to alter and even lead to immunologic escape. Known that the receptor ACE2 is highly conservative, the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody targeting ACE2 had already been proved the ability to restrict its replication inside or outside human body without affecting the activity of ACE2. Given above, our research on testing whether this antibody can effectively inhibit the outbreak of mutant strain B.1.1.7 is significant.:::2021
