Humboldt_Berlin:::Europe:::Germany:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Target Taxi â€“ Salmonella minicells as drug delivery system:::Cancer is a global threat to humankind being the cause of million deaths per year. Chemotherapy often remains the last resort, with the major drawback of being non-specific. To overcome this limitation we aim to design genetically modified minicells derived from non-pathogenic Salmonella Typhimurium. We plan to equip our chassis to specifically target cancer tissue and inject on site a cell growth-inhibiting peptide into malignant cells. In a first approach, we validate the chassis-cell interaction by modifying the minicells with lectins that specifically adhere to a targeted cell line. Subsequently, via the type-III secretion system of Salmonella, the anti-cancer peptide Pep8 will be translocated into the cancer cell, and inhibit further uncontrolled cell growth. We believe our approach will provide insights to crucial aspects of cancer research such as therapy-specificity and limitation of side effects.:::2021
