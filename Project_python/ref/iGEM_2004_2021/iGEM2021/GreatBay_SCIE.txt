However, its solution remains flawed in many ways, for example, antibody-drug conjugates often cause great side effects; pathway inhibitor drugs rely on specific pathways which sometimes can be bypassed by tumor cells. To tackle these issues, we developed a new drug delivery system consisting of aptamers, nanoparticle, and a model drugâ€”similar to that of ADC, but applying aptamers rather than an antibody. Moreover, we make modifications throughout the system to further improve the drug's specificity and stability: our aptamers are pH-sensitive, only binding to cancer cells in an acidic tumor environment together with the nanoparticles. We have communicated with experts and modified our project design based on their advice. In addition, we produced card games and documentaries and delivered lectures to increase our project's publicity and promote the significance of synthetic biology in the real world.:::2021
