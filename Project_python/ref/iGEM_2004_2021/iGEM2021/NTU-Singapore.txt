NTU-Singapore:::Asia:::Singapore:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Rapid Detection of Single Nucleotide Mutations in COVID-19 and Cancer:::As we have learnt from interviews, assays that can detect mutations accurately are valuable in the diagnosis of fast evolving infectious diseases and cancer. Furthermore, in pandemics such as COVID-19, rapid point-of-care detection is essential to isolate patients as fast as possible and minimize spreading of the disease. Hence, we have developed a sensitive and easy-to-use diagnostic kit that can accommodate direct patient samples without RNA extraction and deliver results in under 40 minutes. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was utilised to amplify the target genes. After amplification, a novel CRISPR-Cas12a Lb-RVRR enzyme was employed to identify different mutations based on the fluorescence intensity. Alternatively, we developed a probe that was sensitive to point mutations, allowing us to distinguish between different genetic variants in COVID-19 and cancer. Thus, our project has provided with better methods to diagnose such diseases for a better future.:::2021
