AHUT_China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Breast cancer-targeting bacterial microrobots:::Breast cancer has overtaken lung cancer as the most frequently diagnosed cancer according to Cancer Statistics 2020. Expression of HER2 leads to poor prognosis in 30% of breast cancer. Though there are effective approaches for targeting HER2 such as trastuzumab for breast cancer patients, it is often associated with toxicity and resistance. New treatment strategies are, therefore, urgently needed. In this project, we decided to modify the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 to induce the expression of the HER2 artificial antibody and sTRAIL fusion protein in hypoxia, which can kill cancer cells. We demonstrated that sTRAIL fusion protein with trimerization structure could induce apoptosis in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. The modified strain with hypoxia-inducible promoter could express the fusion protein in low oxygen environment and induce apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Our result suggests that the probiotic we designed and engineered would be a potential novel treatment for breast cancer.:::2021
