The current method for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer remains as a big limitation. Previous reporters identified syndecan-2 (SDC2) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2) were aberrantly methylated in Colorectal Cancer. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) for detecting methylated SDC2 and TFPI2 has been reported as an effective early screening method for colorectal cancer. Toehold switches are a class of RNAs with a hairpin loop that can be unfolded upon binding a trigger RNA for translation initiation of the reporter protein, which plays an important role in clinical diagnoses. In this study, we constructed a toehold plasmid and incubated it in the cell free protein expression system with methylated TFPI2 with a trigger sequence, which offers a non-invasive and visible approach for early detection of colorectal cancer in the future.:::2021
