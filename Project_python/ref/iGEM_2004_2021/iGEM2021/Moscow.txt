Moscow:::Europe:::Russian Federation:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::miPression - the diagnostic test system for depression detection based on CRISPR/Cas.:::We are the Moscow team, and the main goal of our project - miPression - is to design a test system that can detect depression and distinguish it from other psychiatric diseases. Our diagnostic test will use miRNAs circulating in blood as biomarkers. We are going to measure it by two-step technology: first, rolling cycle amplification (RCA); second, the connection of two d–°as9, which are linked with the half of GFP, to the product of the RCA. The concentration of our target miRNA will be defined based on the brightness of fluorescence. As a result, our project will help to solve the problem of misdiagnosed and undiagnosed cases of depression. In the long term, our development may help to reduce public stigmatization and break down false stereotypes about mental disorders.:::2021
