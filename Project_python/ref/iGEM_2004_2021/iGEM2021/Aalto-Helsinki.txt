Aalto-Helsinki:::Europe:::Finland:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::GutLux: shedding light on your gut:::Certain associations have been established that link several metabolites associated with the gut microbiota to mental disorders, amongst other illnesses. However, reliable measurements of these compounds are a major drawback for a better understanding of the connection between the gut microbiota and the brain. GutLux, our ingestible biosensor, tackles this by measuring the concentration of the metabolites in vivo, inside the gut. GutLux is comprised of two parts. The biological component responds to the concentration of metabolite by producing a light signal that can be measured quantitatively. The electronic component measures this signal and converts it to readable, wirelessly transmittable data. Our design focuses on compounds associated with mental health, but its use could be extended to other gut metabolites by adapting the biological component. In addition, we have devoted ourselves to create awareness of the importance of the gut microbiota in our wellbeing and its impact on mental health.:::2021
