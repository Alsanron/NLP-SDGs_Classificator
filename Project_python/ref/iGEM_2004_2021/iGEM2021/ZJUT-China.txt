ZJUT-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CRISPR/Cas9-based Cell-Free Biosensors for RNA Biomarkers:::According to literature, various RNA molecules in urine or blood have proven to serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases. Herein, we are developing a cell-free RNA biosensor which comprises a cell-free system, engineered DNA transcription templates and RNA-responsive CRISPR/Cas9 System. Once the sensor is exposed to specific RNA, the visible outputs from deGFP can be visualized by naked eyes.We hope our project will provide patients with a simple, safe, low-cost diagnostic method.:::2021
