Ulink-SIP:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Efficiently Producing 2′-Fucosyllactose In Escherichia coli:::2′ -fucosyllactose (2′ -FL), one of the simplest but most abundant oligosaccharides in human milk, has many benefits for the healthy development of newborns. However, the high-cost production and limited availability restrict its widespread use in infant nutrition and further research on its potential functions. This year, Ulink-SIP aims at producing 2’-FL by engineered Escherichia coli. First, we co-expressed the genes for GDP-L-fucose biosynthesis and heterologous α-1,2-fucosyltransferase in E.coli. Then, we deletion genes (wcaJ, nudD, and nudK) involved in the degradation of the precursors GDP-L-fucose and GDP-mannose to further boost the carbon flux from GDP-L-fucose toward 2′-FL synthesis. Finally, preliminary optimization of fermentation conditions was used to achieve a high yield. As a proof of concept, our preliminary 2’-FL production demonstrated a superior production performance.:::2021
