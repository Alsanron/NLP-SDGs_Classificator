Edinburgh:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The SuperGrinder: value from waste:::We aim to revolutionise the extraction of valuable materials from the most common recalcitrant waste polymers, including cellulose, keratin, chitin and PET. These are all resistant to natural biodegradation but hold great potential for integration to the circular economy. Current treatments are often unsustainable, requiring harmful chemicals, high energy and resulting in downcycling of materials to lower value products. Our team seeks to combine physical and enzymatic treatment of these polymers by constructing a ‘Super Grinder’, featuring enzymes immobilised on silica beads using silica-binding tags. These enzyme-laden silica beads both contribute to the physical grinding mechanism and theoretically ensure that enzymes will have greater access to the substrate surface. Immobilisation may have the added benefits of improving enzyme stability and recyclability, and our design operates at ambient temperatures, decreasing its carbon footprint and cost. We also aim to improve enzyme efficiency using directed evolution techniques.:::2021
