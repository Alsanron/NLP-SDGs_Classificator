Current treatment methods of depression are either ineffective or have side effects on patients’ physiological functioning. Through bioengineering, our team presents a novel method to reduce the severity of depression and, as our name indicates, brings light to patients’ dark world. We inserted efeB, a gene that can reduce oxidative stress, into a constructed plasmid and placed the gene into bacteria for more effective treatment purposes. Tests show that bacteria with constructed plasmid can suppress the level of MDA under 20 mmol/mg and can survive better than the bacteria without this plasmid under high hydrogen peroxide condition. Our team believes that our product can bring effectual treatment to depression.:::2021
