SJTang:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Eco.H: Sustainable Energy via Photosynthetic Fermentation:::Compared with traditional means, biohydrogen production is cost-effective and owns unique environmental advantages. Herein, SJTang modified E. coli and R. palustris, a purple non-sulfur bacterium notable for its hydrogen production ability. In both strains, photosynthetic biohybrid systems are introduced by interfacing iodine-doped hydrothermally carbonized carbon on the cell surface, facilitating photoelectron transduction. Moreover, oxygen-tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenase is expressed heterologously to enhance versatility and efficiency. Genes encoding for biofilm and uptake hydrogenase in R. palustris were knocked out to maximize yield. Upon modification, the co-culture of E. coli and R. palustris demonstrated a mutualistic relationship in hydrogen production by exchanging essential carbon and nitrogen sources. A low-cost bioreactor capable of fermentation, gas collection, and quantitative component analysis is developed and packed into an integrated open-source solution. Through metabolic modification and hardware innovation, SJTang hopes further to improve hydrogen production efficiency and lower unit costs.:::2021
