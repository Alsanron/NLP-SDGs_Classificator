Warwick:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A fast detection method for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) using CRISPR riboswitches:::Enterobacteriaceae are a highly widespread family of bacteria, some of which are pathogenic. They are traditionally treated with antibiotics, but the antibiotic resistance crisis threatens to remove this option. Some Enterobacteriaceae have developed resistance to carbapenems, a "last-resort" antibiotic for multi-drug resistant bacteria. Hence, containment is one of the most effective countermeasures against infections with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). However, current methods of testing for CPE are slow and can take up to 4 days for a negative result. Hospitals appear to be a reservoir for CPE â€“ particularly drains, sinks and faucets. To aid in containing the spread of CPE, we propose a novel detection method using a gRNA modified into a riboswitch, sensitive to the presence of a carbapenemase mRNA, coupled with a CRISPR activation system to produce a fluorescent green RNA aptamer. The resulting fluorescence can be viewed under UV light, making carbapenem resistant bacteria easy to identify.:::2021
