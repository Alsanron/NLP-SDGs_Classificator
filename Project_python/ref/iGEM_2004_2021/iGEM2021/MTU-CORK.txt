MTU-CORK:::Europe:::Ireland:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bioremediation of MARS using engineered bacteria in a novel housing system, the Biofrag 2.0:::Mars holds great interest to humanity and commercial applications alike due to its suitability for potential habitation. One issue withstanding are the components of the planets soil that contains toxic levels of sodium perchlorate making growth of food impossible. Our team has devised a solution by engineering E.coli with genomic islands from A. suilum which breakdown the sodium perchlorate in the soil through the enzymes Perchlorate reductase and Chlorite dismutase. The bacteria is housed within a 3D printed, novel, spherical design allowing biofilm formation, bacterial proliferation, enzyme distribution and addition of a seed for bioremediating and cultivating the Martian soil. This design has been titled the Biofrag 2.0. The Biofrag can be used within specially contained Biofrag Isolation Units which allow for contained remediation of soil whilst preventing widespread contamination. Each box also allows for optimal conditions for growth of both flora and microbiome within the Biofrag.:::2021
