Yonsei_Korea:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Detection of rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae using Cu2+ dependent DNAzymes and gold nanoparticles:::Rice blast, a fungal disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is increasingly affecting rice plants leading to approximately 30% of rice production losses globally (Nailey 2016) and 15-60% annual incidents in Korea. The current treatment and diagnostic methods, however, are not environmentally friendly or are not easy to use for farmers. Therefore, we propose a DNAzyme based detection system to specifically detect the mif23 gene of M. oryzae. By Cu2+ catalyzation, our DNAzyme cleaves at the ends of the CTGC site of the target gene. We used PAGE and denaturing PAGE to validate the specific cleavage activity. We also confirmed that Cu2+ is significant in catalyzation, and that it is an efficient system in detecting the target gene. Lastly, gold nanoparticles functionalized with the complementary target DNA sequences to the cleaved DNA products were employed as a colorimetric approach to visualize the DNAzyme catalyzed cleavage reaction.:::2021
