BIT:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Early screening of colorectal cancer(CRC) based on CRISPR/Cas12-coupled SlipChip for detection of miRNA:::Early screening and treatment of colorectal cancer(CRC) has been proved to be conducive to reducing the mortality rate of CRC. Currently, most diagnostic methods do not meet the requirements of rapid, sensitive and specific screening of CRC. Based on the selection of miRNA as our biomarker for its high sensitivity and specificity，we developed an ultrasensitive approach for miRNA detection based on a combination of Loop-mediated isothermal amplification(LAMP), CRISPR-Cas12a trans-cleavage and SlipChip. We also designed temperature-control and fluorescence detection modules to erect an interactive IVD system for POCT detection. Our system has been tested to be simple to operate, for completing the process within 1h，and its sensitivity reaches to fM level. Furthermore, our system has the capacity to detect different miRNAs, giving the potential to build standardized cancer detection platforms.:::2021
