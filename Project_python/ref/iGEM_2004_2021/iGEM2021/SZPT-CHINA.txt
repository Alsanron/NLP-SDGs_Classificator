SZPT-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Kissed by Light:::Infection remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in burn patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is among the leading causes of nosocomial infection primarily because it is intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics and antimicrobials. This year our team is working on P.aeruginosa infection and wound repair in burn treatment. Using principles of synthetic biology, we genetically modified Gluconacetobacter hansenii ATCC 53582 to kill P. aeruginosa specifically through the production and release of chimeric bacteriocin SE protein and the immunity protein. Moreover, the production of cellulose in the engineered Gluconacetobacter hansenii ATCC 53582 was regulated by light, which can further prevent infection of other bacteria and promote wound repair.:::2021
