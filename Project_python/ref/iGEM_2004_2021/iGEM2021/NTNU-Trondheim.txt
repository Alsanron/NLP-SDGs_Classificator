NTNU-Trondheim:::Europe:::Norway:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SulFind: A biosensor for sensitive hydrogen sulfide measurements in recirculating aquaculture systems:::With SulFind, we are addressing acute fish death caused by hydrogen sulfide (H2S) poisoning in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Our goal is to design a biosensor that would satisfy industry standards as present technologies for H2S detection are often insufficiently sensitive for toxic H2S levels. Two biosensor systems were attempted, a whole-cell system and a system based on heme proteins. Our heme-based sensor exploits the protein's sulfide-binding capabilities. We use fluorescence intensity to evaluate the conformational change in fluorophore-tagged myoglobin protein bound to H2S. The sensing device will be embedded in a microfluidic chip, which will be compatible with existing methods for monitoring water quality in RAS facilities. As a result, our study seeks to reduce acute fish mortality in RAS facilities, making RAS more sustainable and economical.:::2021
