NMU_China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Toggle Macrophages:::Elimination of the SARS-COV-2 and balance the immune response are both important for late-stage COVID-19, however, no ideal therapeutics can achieve the two goals for our knowledge. To address this, we have 1) designed synthetic antiviral macrophages with immune-regulatory capacity and 2) demonstrated its feasibility through both in vitro experiments and mathematical modeling. The designed synthetic antiviral macrophages, termed "Toggle Macrophages", have the phagocytic capacity specific for SARS-COV-2 and showed pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory phenotypic transformation according to the level of local IL-6 concentration. Therefore, as "smart" therapeutics, Toggle Macrophages can both reduce the viral load through phagocytosis and balance the immune system via phenotypic transformation. We further mathematically modeled and analyzed the feasibility of the practical application of Toggle Macrophages in humans. This work supports the use of Toggle Macrophages as a novel Genetically Engineered Cellular Platform that may be useful in future therapeutic approaches against severe COVID-19.:::2021
