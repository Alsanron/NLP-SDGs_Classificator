Paris_Bettencourt:::Europe:::France:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mini.ink: think big, go with minicells:::Biosafety is central when manipulating GMOs. We aim to participate in increasing biosafety by using minicells, nanosized and chromosome-free bacterial cells formed by abnormal division of rod-shaped bacteria. We observed their behaviour and hypothesized their use as chassis for local production of desired proteins, without purification expenses. This project is centered around the production of compounds through minicells of E.coli MG1655 containing a plasmid of interest. Minicells are produced using two approaches: overexpression of the FtsZ ring and deletion of the min operon. In parallel, a bioreactor for cultivation and isolation of minicells from parental cells was designed to guarantee a final genomic DNA-free sample. Filtration and introduction of an infection-defective lambda phage into the genome of parental cells was implemented to achieve higher separation yield. We focused the project on production of indigo pigment and found a method to safely dye textile without purification or addition of chemicals.:::2021
