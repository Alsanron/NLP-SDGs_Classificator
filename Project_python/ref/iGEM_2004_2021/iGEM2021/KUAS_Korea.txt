KUAS_Korea:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Probiotic Therapeutics to Rescue Frogs from the Deadly Chytrid Fungus:::Amphibians are facing an uncertain future. A third of global amphibian species have become endangered due to habitat loss, climate change, and the lethal chytrid fungus. The invasive chytrid fungus has been prevalent in many parts of the globe but a reliable solution is not available yet. This year, our focus is on the biological control of the chytrid fungus by engineering skin symbiotic bacteria. We designed a genetic AND-gate that produces the antifungal agents (e.g. violacein) only working under sunlight warming frogs and the detection of chytrid. To avoid environmental risks, we also designed a quorum sensing kill switch based on the MazEF toxin-antitoxin module. We surveyed the skin microbiome of frogs for a potential chassis of our design. Our therapeutic approach will contribute to protecting susceptible amphibian species from the invasive chytrid disease.:::2021
