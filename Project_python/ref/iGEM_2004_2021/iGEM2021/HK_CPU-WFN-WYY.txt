HK_CPU-WFN-WYY:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Project SSS:::Inspired by Fast Fashion, which is a threat to the environment at disposal, we came up with the idea of utilizing biodegradable ‘silk’. In this project, E. coli BL21 is aimed to be engineered to produce a protein named spidroin, which is the basic unit of spider silk. Masp1 and Masp2 from dragline, flagelliform silk protein from capture spiral silk and pyriform silk protein (PiSp) from piriform silk are planned to be manufactured. In the future, the mechanical properties of silk products, like strength, will be adjusted by controlling the proportion of spidroin with different toughness and elasticity. Thus, we hope to obtain spidroin with different properties to cater for different needs, like making clothes or fishing line, hence bringing an environmentally friendly solution to Fast Fashion disposal.:::2021
