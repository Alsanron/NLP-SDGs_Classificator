SDU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PsiloAid:::We want to contribute to the utilization of psilocybinâ€™s absolute potential by reducing the costs of acquiring the substance for research projects. Psilocybin is currently undergoing clinical trials, to explore its potential as a treatment method for depression. However, it has shown itself to be a very difficult and expensive process to chemically synthesize psilocybin or purify it from the mushrooms. Despite recent improvements in heterologous production of psilocybin using either bacteria or yeast, current methods persist to be tedious and costly with a reduced yield. That is why we aim to construct an enhanced biosynthesis of psilocybin from tryptophan, by introducing all four different enzymes from the Funghi in Escherichia coli. After successfully producing psilocybin in E. coli, we hope to transfer this system to our ideal, non-pathogenic host organism, Rhodovulum sulfidophilum that only needs sunlight and seawater to grow, thereby making a sustainable and safe cell factory.:::2021
