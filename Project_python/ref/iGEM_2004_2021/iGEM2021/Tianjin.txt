Tianjin:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CREATE：a yeast without chromosomes:::As the carrier of genetic information, chromosomes are vital to cells and even life. Most of the time, we cannot imagine what would happen to a cell without chromosomes. However, like Monkey King's curse in Journey to the West, chromosomes sometimes can be a burden to the cells. In our project, we have gotten out of the rut to create the CREATE（Chromosome Released Eukaryote which is Active, Transitory and Environment-friendly）, a yeast without chromosomes. Such cells have no chromosomes and cannot proliferate, but endogenous enzymes still remain active for a certain period of time. Taking advantage of these characteristics, CREATE might be a much safer bio-reactor used in drug delivery and gene therapy. Obviously, the applications of CREATE will never be limited to any certain field. We believe that CREATE has great potential to be applied in more fields deeply and widely.:::2021
