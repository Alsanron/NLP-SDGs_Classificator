Hence, there is an unmet clinical need for new and effective drugs. However, a long-existing problem in drug discovery is the cost-effectiveness issue in finding effective drugs for clinical use. To address this, our team aims to develop a simple and cost-effective fungal synthetic biology platform to produce various derivatives of variecolin, a fungal natural product that shows potent therapeutic and antimicrobial properties. The platform consists of the genetically modified Aspergillus oryzae host with (1) a “terpene synthase” biobrick for the backbone synthesis and (2) a series of different “cytochrome P450 monooxygenase” biobricks to derivatize the variecolin scaffold. We have successfully obtained three novel variecolin analogues as confirmed by LC-MS and NMR analyses, and experiments are currently underway to characterize their biological activities.:::2021
