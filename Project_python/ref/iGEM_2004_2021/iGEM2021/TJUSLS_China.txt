Enzymatic recycling of PET has been extensively investigated in the past 20 years. PETase is a novel PET-degrading enzyme with the ability to degrade the highly crystallized PET. However, the heat-labile property seriously hinders its industrial applications. To over this limitation, we firstly rationally designed several PETase mutants through our combine bioinformatics strategies. Then we cloned and expressed these mutant genes by using the E. coli system. We next purified all the expressed PETase mutants and tested their thermostability at several conditions. We found 7 of PETase mutants with increasing thermostability. Excitingly, the enzyme activity of one mutant was 163 times that of the wild-type PETase at 60°C that was 20°C higher than the optimum temperature of the wild-type PETase. Our project sheds light on the industrial application of PETase.:::2021
