HUST2-China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NANO-AI-Cleaner:::As the eighth epidemic, acne plagues billions of people and is becoming one of the most common skin diseases. Abnormal proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes and corresponding immune responses are the main factors causing acne. To target both factors, we engineered probiotic E.coli Nissle 1917 to produce BLP-7 with elastin like peptide(ELP) and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) antagonist with ELP under infrared induction, followed by in-situ assembly of sphere-like nanostructure NANO-AI-Cleaner through ELP-mediated hydrophobic interaction. ELP showed Intelligent temperature-controlled ability and significant skin-repairing effect while BLP-7 kills P. acnes by punching holes on the membrane surface and TLR2 antagonist blocks NF-kB pathway by competing for binding to acylated lipoproteins on the surface of P. acnes. In this way, our multi-functional nanostructure achieves antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and skin-repairing effects at the same time. We have successfully constructed NANO-AI-Cleaner, providing a convincing and promising treatment strategy for acne.:::2021
