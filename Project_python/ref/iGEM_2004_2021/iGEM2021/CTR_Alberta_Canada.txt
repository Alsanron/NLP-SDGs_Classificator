Oxybenzone contributes to coral bleaching by accumulating in coral tissues and reducing sunlight availability for photosynthetic organisms due to its UV-absorbing properties. Through the genetic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, oxybenzone concentration levels in water bodies can be detected. The estrogenic properties of oxybenzone allow it to bind to a synthetic fusion protein containing a human estrogen receptor which will result in the expression of the LacZ gene. This causes the enzyme beta-galactosidase to be produced and breakdown its substrate. This produces an electrochemical signal which can be measured using the Field-Ready Electrochemical Detector (FRED) and analyzed to determine oxybenzone concentration. This will allow for greater understanding of the issue of coral bleaching, and provide a tool to assess the impact of further steps being taken to protect these aquatic ecosystems.:::2021
