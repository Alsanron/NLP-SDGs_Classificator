Thessaloniki:::Europe:::Greece:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::METIS: A toehold-based diagnostic tool for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma:::Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common type of pancreatic cancer and it is characterized by its devastating outcome, with only a 10% 5-year survival rate. As in other cancer types, it is considered that the earlier diagnosis could contribute to a more efficient treatment. However, the currently available diagnostic methods are unable to detect the tumor at an early stage. Thus, we are designing a toehold-based system to detect specific molecules, called miRNAs, that play an important role in the regulation of gene expression and cell cycle and are upregulated in the urine of patients in the first two stages of PDAC. We hope that this tool can be used by local diagnostic centers to provide a cost-effective, non-invasive and easily accessible diagnostic method. To further improve the impact of our method, we are, also, designing a device where the necessary reactions will take place.:::2021
