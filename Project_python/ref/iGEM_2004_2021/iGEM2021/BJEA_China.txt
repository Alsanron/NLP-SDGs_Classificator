BJEA_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Beneco:::Plastics are widely used in the world because of its durability. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most commonly used plastics. Generally, there are 3 methods for PET recycling including physical, chemical, and biological recycling. However, physical and chemical recycling both have limitations,such as the inability to achieve closed-loop recycling and cause secondary pollution. Therefore, biological recycling seems to be a sustainable development approach. Research published on Nature found a mutant LCC (mLCC) which is the most efficient enzyme that can degrade PET. Base on the facts, our group decides to enhance the activity of mLCC by proceeding two approaches, The first is constructing a fusion protein of mLCC and hydrophobins to enhance PET adsorption. The second is using the technique of Bacillus subtilis cell surface display to construct a whole-cell biocatalyst which can improve the stability of enzymes and reduce costs.:::2021
