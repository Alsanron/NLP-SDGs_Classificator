This innovation in the food industry aims to solve some of the worldâ€™s most pressing global crises such as mass animal slaughter, climate change, deforestation and emerging pandemics. Among all the essentials needed for the growth media, FGF2 or bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor, is one of the most expensive. This is due to its unstable and short-acting characteristics but most importantly, its production cost. We aimed to improve a number of FGF2 properties that include binding affinity to its receptor, thermal stability and solubility. We designed three such mutants of wild-type FGF2, with each variant being successfully expressed and purified. Some of them were scaled up further. Our long-term goal is to be able to offer an improved growth factor to industry.:::2021
