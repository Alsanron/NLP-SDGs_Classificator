William_and_Mary:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Orthogonality:::Orthogonality, defined as the lack of unwanted interactions among parts of a circuit or between a circuit and host physiology, is a fundamental tenet of synthetic biology. While methodology for identifying undesirable interactions among circuit parts themselves is well studied, assessment of orthogonality between the circuit and the host physiology that goes beyond metabolic burden has received surprisingly little attention, with the few existing methods both costly and technically challenging. To address this universal need, W&M iGEM is developing an accessible toolkit for circuit-host orthogonality assessment in E. coli. This toolkit employs circuits that provide measurements not only of classic burden, but also more encompassing orthogonality markers identified by extensive analysis of RNA-Seq data. These measurements serve as inputs for our integrative, comprehensive mathematical model that provides the end user with overall orthogonality metrics, with the goal of enhancing the efficiency, functionality, and safety of all synthetic biology circuits.:::2021
