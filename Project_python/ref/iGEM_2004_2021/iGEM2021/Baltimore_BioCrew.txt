Baltimore_BioCrew:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Joy-Biotic: Challenging Mental Illness & Its Stigma One Flavored Drop at a Time:::The COVID-19 Pandemic has brought an increase in mental illness rates. The group most critically affected by this increase is high school students, the peer group of The Baltimore BioCrew. To challenge the stigma and the increasing rates of mental illness, the BioCrew has created Joy-Biotic, a flavored water probiotic that will increase serotonin production by producing 5-HTP, GABA, and acetylcholine in Lactobacillus and E. coli Nissle. These molecules increase neurotransmitters in the brain. To prevent serotonin syndrome, we engineered a negative feedback loop that would regulate the levels of serotonin. To raise awareness about mental health stigma, we have created a podcast interviewing mental health professionals, a social media campaign, an educational comic, and a course teaching high school students about the relationship between the gut biome and mental health. Through oral ingestion of Joy-Biotic, the BioCrew plans to fight mental illness one flavored drop at a time:::2021
