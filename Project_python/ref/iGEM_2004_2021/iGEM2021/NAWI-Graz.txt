NAWI-Graz:::Europe:::Austria:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Phos4us: A novel biosensor system for quorum sensing mediated phosphorus solubilisation:::Phosphorus is an essential element for all living beings. It provides life not only for humans but is substantial for the growth of all plants on the planet. About 80% of the finite phosphate-containing rocks mined, is used in crop fertilizers and with the current rate of consumption the phosphorus sources might be depleted in less than a century. Our aim was to design a mediator organism that effectively regulates processes involved in phosphate solubilization and therefore increases the phosphate uptake efficiency of plants. We created the “Phos4us” system, which makes use of an already existent phosphate regulation pathway in Escherichia coli to react to high inorganic phosphate levels in the soil and produces the quorum sensing molecule 3OC6HSL. This signal allows the cell to actively communicate with neighboring microorganisms, which in return respond with growth and solubilization of the abundant phosphate.:::2021
