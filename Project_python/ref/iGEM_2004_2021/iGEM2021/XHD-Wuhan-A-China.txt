XHD-Wuhan-A-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Nitrate Decomposer: decrease nitrate in soil with rhizobium:::Soil compaction is a concrete manifestation of soil degradation. Acidification and salinization caused by excessive use of chemical fertilizer will damage soil structure and lead to soil hardening and compaction. Rhizobia is a type of bacteria widely found in roots soil. In our project, we aim to solve the soil salinization and acidification problem by using the denitrification effect of rhizobia to reduce the adverse consequences of soil hardening. Many rhizobia have the ability of denitrification by decomposing nitrates. We enhanced the denitrification ability of rhizobia by introducing plasmids containing nirK or napA genes, which code for key enzymes in denitrification. This new strain of rhizobium can not only fix nitrogen but also break it down to release the fixed nitrogen from the soil. Furthermore, we also studied the promoter that can sense nitrate concentration, which laid a foundation for the self-initiated denitrification of rhizobia under high nitrate concentration environment.:::2021
