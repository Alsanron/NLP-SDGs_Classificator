Nanjing-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Polyp Neo:::IBD（inflammatory bowel disease） are two serious, chronic digestive diseases that affect five million people worldwide. By means of Synthetic Biology, we hope to biosynthesize long-chain polyphosphate, which is biocompatible and promising to cure IBD. The aim of our project is to develop a new application of long-chain polyphosphate, including not only biosynthesizing it with high yield and under the concept of sustainable development, but also exploring its potential to be developed as a new IBD therapy.:::2021
