KCIS_NewTaipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::D-licious: Engineering Butyrate-producing Bacteria to Combat Vitamin D Deficiency:::From regulating calcium homeostasis, strengthening the immune system, and even preventing COVID-19 infection, vitamin D serves a crucial role in the maintenance of human health. Vitamin D deficiency, a global pandemic caused largely by the lack of sunlight exposure, has only exacerbated during COVID-19 lockdown. However, all current solutions to vitamin D deficiency present limitations in efficiency or accessibility. Our project presents a new method for vitamin D activation. By manipulating the acetyl-CoA butyrate producing pathway, we can increase the butyrate-producing ability of probiotics. The increased production of butyrate would upregulate Vitamin D receptor expression by increasing the activity of the TGFÎ² pathway, which would ultimately result in a more efficient activation of vitamin D. By introducing our engineered probiotics into fermented food starters, we believe the project could be implemented in daily diets, opening up opportunities for a more efficient way of vitamin D intake in the future.:::2021
