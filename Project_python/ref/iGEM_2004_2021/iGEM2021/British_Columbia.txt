British_Columbia:::North America:::Canada:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DetecTME: Untangling the immuno-modulated tumour microenvironment using a tumour-colonizing bacterial vector and reporter system:::Immunotherapies are cancer treatments which activate the immune system against the tumour. While very effective in some patients, many do not respond to immunotherapy. To personalize treatment, tissue biopsies are used to profile tumour immune activity and inform likelihood of immunotherapy response but are invasive and prone to sampling bias. Salmonella bacteria naturally colonize tumours, and have been proven safe as a therapeutic in clinical trials. Our project creates an in vivo Salmonella-based biosensor for minimally invasive diagnosis and real-time monitoring of tumour immune activity. We construct a functional screening system to discover promoters regulated by tumour immune markers across the Salmonella genome, and implement an AND-gate with a split-operon technique to detect multiple biomarkers. The biosensor will be adaptable to detect other clinically relevant biomarkers, and to deliver therapeutics. This project is a gateway to a multifunctional platform to support the growth of immunotherapy and personalized medicine:::2021
