Recent studies in rodents, correlated curli biofilms in the gut, and plaque buildup in the brain. To prevent neurodegenerative diseases, we aimed to express potential curli inhibitors via a probiotic chassi, Limosilactobacillus reuteri, and investigate the impact of the inhibitors in the presence of curli-producing bacteria. We applied gibson assembly and restriction enzyme cloning to attempt to insert our inhibitor genes into an L. reuteri expression vector. However, most likely due to our chosen selection marker, transformations were unsuccessful. During the last weeks, we successfully inserted one construct into pET11a, yet with an inconclusive expression assay. Our conclusion is that further studies of curli inhibition is required, preferably choosing a more suitable vector and chassi for expression. The connection between curli formation in the gut and amyloids in the brain also requires further investigation.:::2021
