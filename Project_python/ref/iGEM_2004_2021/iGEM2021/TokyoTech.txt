TokyoTech:::Asia:::Japan:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Lacteeth:::There are billions of people who have dental caries around the world. Dental caries are related not only to quality of life but also to health expectancy. The more aging society grows, the more dental health problems become important. Our project aims to develop new probiotics that continuously prevent dental caries with engineered Lactococcus lactis. We designed Lactococcus lactis which is able to bind specifically to biofilm and diffuse growth inhibitors against bacteria causing dental caries. We also considered the practical use of recombinant probiotics in the real world and suggest how we can use engineered bacteria safely outside of the laboratory. We hope that our project contributes to the world without dental caries.:::2021
