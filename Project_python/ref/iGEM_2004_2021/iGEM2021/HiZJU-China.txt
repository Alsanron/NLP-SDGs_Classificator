HiZJU-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::EE2limination——Elimination of EE2:::The synthetic estrogen 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) is a micropollutant with strong endocrine disrupting effects. Due to the large-scale use of estrogen in contraceptives and feed as well as the shortage of effective degradation method, EE2 is accumulating in water environment and will induce serious diseases. Our project aims to solve the EE2 pollution problem. We designed genetically modified bacteria to degrade EE2 via cometabolism in waste water. In order to detect EE2 concentration accurately and quickly, we developed a synthetic biological cascade amplification reaction based on yeast two-hybrid technique, which can easily co-relate the content of EE2 with portable readout, such as cell growth and fluorescence intensity.:::2021
