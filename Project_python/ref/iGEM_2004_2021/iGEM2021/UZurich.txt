UZurich:::Europe:::Switzerland:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BOOM-V: engineered bacteria-originated (outer) membrane vesicles as a novel plant protection strategy:::Crop loss caused by phytopathogens is a severe threat to world food security. However, the extensive use of synthetic pesticides has led to toxicity and resistance emergence. Here, we propose an alternative solution to combat pathogens, by using bacterial membrane vesicles to boost plant immunity. We first screened for strains producing large amounts of highly immunogenic outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). By displaying immune elicitors on the surface of OMVs, the protective immune response can be further enhanced. Meanwhile, we also designed bacteria to function in situ, which can sense pathogens and automatically generate OMVs to prime plants. In addition to OMVs, bacterial cytoplasmic membrane vesicles (CMVs) are engineered to deliver cargoes (e.g., DNA) into plant cells. Our results show that engineered bacterial membrane vesicles can improve disease resistance, as well as other agronomic traits of plants, which might open the door for a new era of biopesticides and biostimulants.:::2021
