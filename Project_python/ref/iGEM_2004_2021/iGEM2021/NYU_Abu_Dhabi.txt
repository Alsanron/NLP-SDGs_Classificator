Caused by the infection of the fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) or Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), chytridiomycosis causes rapid decline and extinction of amphibian populations. Both species are responsible for fatal disease; however, Bd infects frogs and toads, while Bsal generally affects salamanders. Amphibians rarely display visible symptoms, limiting diagnosis of chytridiomycosis to post-mortem examination, which highlights the need for diagnostic devices. Current methods for identification of the pathogen are laboratory equipment-dependent, time-consuming, and expensive which contributes to the spread of infection. Thus, our team is developing a diagnostic device that allows for rapid detection of the two disease-causing fungi in a field setting. To bypass the time consuming DNA amplification step, we use electrokinetic concentration of the extracted DNA, followed by a CRISPR-Cas 12a complex binding to the Bd or Bsal target DNA for detection.:::2021
