BUCT-China:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Future Food ——Cultured Meat:::Mankind has never stopped exploring the universe. With the development of science and technology, space migration is no longer a dream. Among the many problems of space migration, our team has great interest in space food. We tried to provide feasible solutions based on synthetic biology and tissue engineering technology. In our design, firstly, an engineered E. coli was employed and started with glucose as raw material to synthesize a bio-compatible polymer, which would work as scaffold for muscle cell growth. Afterwards, collagen was produced by another engineered E. coli and doped with scaffold materials. Then the scaffold was prepared by biological 3D printing technology. Finally, the extracted muscle stem cells were inoculated on the scaffold for culture, differentiation, and proliferation to form the final cultured meat. Besides, a mathematical model is established to simulate the growth of artificial meat, which would provide foundation and guidance for the future research.:::2021
