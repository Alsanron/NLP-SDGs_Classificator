LZU-HS-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::NANO'S Eagerness(Nano-Se):::Selenium is an essential element of human body. It plays a role to maintain body health, boost immunity, resist cancer, poisoning heavy metal and oxidation. However, Se is in deficiency in large areas, which has caused health problems among more than 1.1 billion people. The lack and the excess of this element both cause health problems. The existing preparation methods of Se are unstable and not safe enough. Thus, micro-biosynthesis of SeNPs, which is easy to absorb, is a way to use this mineral efficiently and safely. In our study, the new found selenite reductive SerV01 expressed in Staphylococcus aureus LZ-01 can convert Se (IV) to SeNPs, which has the potential to be used as a booster for the production of selenium supplements.:::2021
