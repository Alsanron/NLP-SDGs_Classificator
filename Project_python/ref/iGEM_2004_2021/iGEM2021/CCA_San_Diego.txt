CCA_San_Diego:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Collagene:::Collagen has countless applications, from cosmetics to supplements to prosthetics, and is useful especially in regenerative medicine as a biomaterial, constituting skin meshes, bone grafts, and artificial organs. While most commercial collagen come from bovine sources, the derivation process is both unethical and poses significant health concerns such as arsenic poisoning and zoonotic diseases. To combat these environmental and ethical concerns, as well as extend research into recombinant collagen technology, Collagene was developed, making functional triple-helical collagen for regenerative medicine. A bacterial collagen called Scl2 was expressed in yeast and E. coli via gap repair cloning in order to create a blank template of collagen that is highly adaptable to various research uses. In addition, we tested a wide variety of biomedical gels and threads that could be used during surgery or woven to replace blood vessels, developing our own wet-spinner for Collagene threads.:::2021
