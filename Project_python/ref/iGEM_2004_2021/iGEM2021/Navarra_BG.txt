Navarra_BG:::Europe:::Spain:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::A project to provide UV protection for plants on Mars:::A major factor limiting the expansion of human space exploration is the enormous logistical costs of launching and resupplying resources from Earth. Plants could play a critical role in providing food and precursors for manufacturing medicines and materials in long-duration missions to Mars. The absence of a significant ozone layer and low atmospheric pressure on Mars results in a higher surface flux of UV radiation. UV is potentially damaging to DNA, RNA, proteins, and generates oxidative stress. Therefore, it will be essential to engineering improved photoprotection mechanisms that enhance the performance of the light-harvesting machinery and UV-protection. This project aims to design strategies that endow plants with sunscreens that protect them from harmful UV effects in harsh planetary environments. The proposed solution is to construct a series of Biobricks with UVR8 and PAP1 Arabidopsis genes that allow GoldenBraid assembly of different transcriptional units to produce UV-resistant plants.:::2021
