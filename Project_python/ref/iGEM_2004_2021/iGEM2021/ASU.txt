ASU:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genetically engineering the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to sequester arsenic from contaminated groundwater:::Arsenic contamination in groundwater is a serious problem both in local Arizonan communities and abroad: prolonged exposure to arsenic contamination can cause cancer, vascular damage, and liver failure. This project aims to engineer the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to sequester arsenic out of water. Metallothionein, arsenate reductase, and ferritin were integrated into the microalgae via the pASapI plasmid in varying permutations. The plasmid rescues function of the photosystem II gene, leveraging the ability to photosynthesize as a selective trait. Metallothionein and ferritin bind the two most common forms of arsenic: arsenite and arsenate, respectively. Arsenate reductase catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite, allowing for the ultimate sequestration of the toxic metal to occur in the chloroplast. Transformed algae were incubated with multiple concentrations of arsenic-contaminated media and the final concentration of arsenic after 2-3 days of exposure was measured using ICP-MS to quantify uptake efficacy.:::2021
