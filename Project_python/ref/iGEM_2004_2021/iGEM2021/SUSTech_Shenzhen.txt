SUSTech_Shenzhen:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of gut microbes to prevent diarrhea-related dehydration:::Diarrhea is a major problem in third-world countries due to poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. Diarrhea in children (>5 years) accounts for approximately 11% of infection-related death. To address this problem, our objective is to develop engineered microbes that regulate water retention through colanic acid biosynthesis, triggered by dehydration cues including intestinal chloride concentration and pathogenic bacterium quorum sensing molecules (QSM). Pathogenic microbes release QSMs during severe dehydration, resulting in protective biofilm formation. We further include the triggered release of broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides to displace the diarrhea-causing pathogens. As a case study, we selected Vibrio cholera as it is one of the major global causes of diarrhea. Due to the genetic circuit modularity, we can readily modify the quorum sensing module to target other pathogenic bacteria. The aim is to create broad-spectrum, cost-effective, readily accessible and convenient methods of diarrhea management.:::2021
