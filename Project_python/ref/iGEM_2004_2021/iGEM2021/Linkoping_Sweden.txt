Linkoping_Sweden:::Europe:::Sweden:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CyaSalt - A novel synthetic biology solution to the global freshwater crisis:::The world population is consistently growing and integrated agriculture is expanding consequently. As a result, the global need for freshwater is greater than ever and it continues to increase. Accordingly, the world is facing a freshwater crisis that is vastly affecting the agricultural industry in all parts of the world. CyaSalt is an innovative approach to solve this crisis. The aim of the project is to desalinate seawater in an environmentally friendly way using modified phototrophic organisms. These organisms will utilize sunlight to activate the inward-directed chloride pump, Halorhodopsin, that imports chloride ions. Sodium ions will enter via the ion channel MscL. Thereafter, the modified organisms are separated from the desalinated water by a cellulose filter. The organisms bind to the filter via a carbohydrate-binding domain on their surfaces, resulting in desalinated water free from modified bacteria. Hence, CyaSalt provides a sustainable and economically accessible freshwater source for agricultural use.:::2021
