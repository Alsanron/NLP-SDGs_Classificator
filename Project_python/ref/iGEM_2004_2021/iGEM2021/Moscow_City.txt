Moscow_City:::Europe:::Russian Federation:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A rapid test system of Equine herpesvirus detection based on CRISPR/dСas13:::Equine herpesvirus outbreaks lead to mass deaths and quarantines. Disease symptoms can be easily confused with other diseases. Current diagnosis methods - PCR-tests - are time-consuming. Therefore, we decided to create a test system based on CRISPR-Cas. It detects herpesvirus by its RNA. We use deadCas13 protein, connected by a linker with two halves of reporter protein - beta-lactamase. Two deadCas13 proteins are directed by gRNA to the RNA of the virus. When the distance between two Cas-proteins is correctly selected, two beta-lactamase proteins can fuse into a functional protein that destroys nitrocefin — the solution's color changes from yellow to red. To avoid false-positive results, we use two guide RNAs. With one guide, RNA reporter protein will not become functional. We are willing to create a system that will not require any special skills to use it. Horse owners will be able to detect herpesvirus using only saliva.:::2021
