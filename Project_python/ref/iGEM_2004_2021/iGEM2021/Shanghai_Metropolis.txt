Shanghai_Metropolis:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::EV71 oral vaccine against HFMD:::Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a contagious viral infection, mostly occurring in children under the age of five. The condition is caused by a series of enteroviruses, including EV71, and VP1 is one of its pathogenic subunits. Since many of the infected children may be afraid of traditional injection-based vaccines, we are trying to develop an EV71 oral vaccine that will gain higher compliance among infant patients. Using E. coli and L. casei as the expressive system, we express the plasmids we constructed, pGEX-6P-1-VP1 and pGEX-6P-1-VP1-LTB. We hope that our project will shed light on the possibility and practicability of the EV71 subunit oral vaccine and pave the way for a much safer, more convenient, and efficient oral vaccine for children to defend against HFMD.:::2021
