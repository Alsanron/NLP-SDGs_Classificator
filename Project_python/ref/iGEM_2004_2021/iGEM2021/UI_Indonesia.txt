UI_Indonesia:::Asia:::Indonesia:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Helicostrike:::Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram negative spiral shaped microaerophilic bacteria that resides in the stomachs of almost half the world population. Its pathogenic effect due to numerous virulence factors lead to various gastric pathologies including peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. Although it has been established since 1982, we are facing some treatment challenges especially regarding the biofilm formation and its role in antibiotic resistance. So, we engineer an E. coli, specifically E. coli Nissle 1917, a probiotic strain to be able to chase the H. pylori, disperse its biofilm using a protease: Proteinase-K, and kill the H. pylori using a antimicrobial peptide, PGLa-AM1.:::2021
