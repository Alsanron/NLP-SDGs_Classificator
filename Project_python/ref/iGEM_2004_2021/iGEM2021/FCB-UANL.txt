FCB-UANL:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synbiofoam: a synthetic alternative to fluorosurfactants:::The incidence and intensity of forest and urban fires have increased throughout the last decades; to combat them, firefighting foams containing fluorosurfactants (a group of extremely pollutant chemicals) have been used for years without acknowledging their impact. These have contaminated ecosystems, harming both wildlife and human populations. Thus, we propose the creation of an environmentally friendly firefighting foam that will be produced using synthetic biology techniques. To achieve this, we have continued our work on Synbiofoam, a firefighting foam composed of foaming and stabilizing agents like Ranaspumins (a series of proteins from a native frog) and surfactin and biofilm, both naturally produced by B. subtilis, and whose production will be regulated through a circuit intended to control the bacterium’s own regulatory network. As we continue to validate and modify our project based on our stakeholders’ responses, we believe that our project will positively impact our society and environment.:::2021
