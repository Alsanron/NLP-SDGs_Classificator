SCAU-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MESEG:::Heavy metal pollution is very serious in water. Our team came up with the idea of a "cruisable molecular magnet". "Molecular magnet" means it can capture heavy metal ions and store them in vacuoles. This can be achieved by expressing heavy metal binding proteins and autophagy-associated proteins in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. And "cruisable" means it can swim back and forth in sewage by our hardware device. This new device have an acrylic frame and cruise system, supplemented by sodium alginate embedding method and semipermeable membrane. On the one hand, it can cruise in the water by Beidou navigation satellite system (BDS) or remote control to capture heavy metal ions at different positions and facilitate recovery at the same time. On the other hand, it can prevent the leakage of genetically modified Chlamydomonas and provide a relatively stable and safe environment for Chlamydomonas.:::2021
