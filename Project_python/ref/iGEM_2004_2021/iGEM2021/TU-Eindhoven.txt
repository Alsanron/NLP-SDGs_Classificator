TU-Eindhoven:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Non-Invasive Monitoring of IBD using Genetically Engineered Bacteria as Living Sensors:::Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the intestine. Globally over 6 million people suffer from IBD, and this number keeps rising. The current monitoring procedure for this disease lacks specificity, resulting in unnecessary follow-up examinations that are invasive, expensive, and time-consuming, which calls for an alternative procedure. Our solution, IBDetection, consists of a pill that can be ingested orally by the patient and delivers live, safe, genetically engineered Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) to the intestine. These bacteria include a biorthogonal sensing cascade to detect tetrathionate—an inflammation biomarker—with high specificity, and in turn activates translation of acoustic reporter genes, resulting in the formation of gas vesicles in the bacteria. These gas vesicles can then be measured outside of the body using conventional ultrasound equipment. This method provides a cost-effective, easy-to-use solution to rule out unnecessary follow-up examinations in a specific and non-invasive manner using fast imaging methods.:::2021
