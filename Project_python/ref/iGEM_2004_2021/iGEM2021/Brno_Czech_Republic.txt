Brno_Czech_Republic:::Europe:::Czech Republic:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Phoscage:::Our team created a system for phosphate removal from water. The system is based on modified Bacillus subtilis. This bacterium is designed to be able to measure the amount of phosphate in water. If the phosphate exceeds a certain threshold concentration, the bacterium will start to form a system to pick it up. This consists of an enzyme that will bind the phosphate into long chains (polyphosphate kinase) and protein vesicles (bacterial microcompartments, BMCs) that will enclose the phosphate chains. According to the design, these modified bacteria will be placed in water in a system that prevents their escape into the environment. After a period of time, the bacteria with the accumulated phosphates will be removed from the water, inactivated, and can be further utilized. We envision their use either as fertilizer or as a source of phoshporus for the chemical industry.:::2021
