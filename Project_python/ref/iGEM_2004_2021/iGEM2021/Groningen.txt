One of the main culprits for this so-called nitrogen crisis is animal agriculture, a vital income source for the Dutch economy. Our project targets ammonia emissions contributing to the crisis and aims to convert them into a beneficial feed additive. Thus, we have engineered Saccharomyces spp. to synthesize alpha-amylase, an enzyme that optimizes cattlesâ€™ digestion. This way, their milk production and growth will be enhanced while ammonia emissions will be reduced simultaneously. Residual ammonia will be captured by a state-of-the-art filter device, a Metal-Organic Framework (MOF), and fed back to our GMO. Furthermore, insights from artificial intelligence will be employed to optimize the engineering process. Overall, we have designed a closed sustainable circle in which waste - excess ammonia, is converted into worth - a feed additive for cattle.:::2021
