ASIJ_Tokyo:::Asia:::Japan:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::ABrCaDaBra:::With 2.3 million women diagnosed and 685,000 deaths in 2020, breast cancer has become a major problem in the global community. However, early detection can help increase the survival of patients. Current detection methods include mammograms and MRIs, which can be uncomfortable and expensive, raising the need for a better alternative. For our two-year project, we plan on creating a convenient breast cancer testing kit that would be similar in design to a pregnancy test through the detection of biomarkers found in sweat and tears. This year, we focused on verifying the interaction between aptamers and biomarkers using ELISA before developing a colorimetric aptamer-based detection assay with gold nanoparticles, which we hope will translate into our testing kit next year. Through our detection kit, we hope to raise early screening rates, allowing women to go through a pain-free and simple process that is reliable and accurate to detect breast cancer.:::2021
