BNUZ-China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.Coli Keen Doctor:::Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major chronic disease with high incidence, poor prognosis and complicated complications, which has become a major public health problem endangering global public health. Indoxyl sulfate is the key urotoxin that promotes the progression of chronic kidney disease, and its precursor, Indole, is formed by tryptophan metabolized by the E.coil, then is metabolized by hepatocytes and eventually produce it. This year, we are committed to using engineered bacteria for special therapy in the following three ways: Firstly, we prevent our chassis metabolism from producing indole and enhance the competitive advantage of the chassis; Secondly, we use engineered bacteria to convert tryptophan into indole propionic acid, a substance conducive to enhancing intestinal mucosal barrier. In addition, we use engineered bacteria to promote the growth of other probiotics and improve the ecology of intestinal flora. Through the above ways, we believe that CKD will be well treated.:::2021
