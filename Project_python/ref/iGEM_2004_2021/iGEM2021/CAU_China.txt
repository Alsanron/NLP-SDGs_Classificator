CAU_China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SSR: Saline-alkaline Soil Restorer:::Saline-alkaline soil, containing heavy soluble salt and alkali, can endanger the environmental safety and agricultural production, and thus is a global concern. γ-PGA, a polymer formed by glutamic acid, is an emerging solution for this problem because it can prevent soil moisture from evaporating, help to build ideal soil structure, absorb the exchangeable sodium ion and act as buffer in soil pH changes. Aimed to restore saline-alkaline soil, above all, we engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum to make it produce γ-PGA based on genes from Bacillus subtilis. Secondly, to harvest γ-PGA as much as possible, we modified genes in oxaloacetic acid node and α-ketoglutarate node to yield more glutamic acid, the raw material for γ-PGA. Finally, in view of biosafety, we designed a kill switch that can only be turned on when both the ionic strength and pH of the soil decrease to an expected level.:::2021
