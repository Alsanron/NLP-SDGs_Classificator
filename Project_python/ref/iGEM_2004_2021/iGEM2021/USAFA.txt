USAFA:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DeFluorine Machine: Biodegradation of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) utilizing Delftia acidovorans Enzymes:::Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) persist in the environment and are associated with liver and kidney disease, altered immune function, lower birth weight, and cancer. More than 4,000 PFAS chemicals have been manufactured for industrial use. PFAS discharge seeps into ground water and bioaccumulates, resulting in unsafe human exposure. Responding to this urgent need, the US Air Force Academy iGEM team identified the aerobic bacterial species Delftia acidovorans from PFAS-contaminated soil with the potential ability to breakdown PFAS. Genetic sequencing of D. acidovorans revealed coding for 5 dehalogenase enzymes (DeHa 1-5). The dehalogenases genes were cloned individually into E. coli expression vectors. Assays of these purified enzymes revealed monodefluorination activity for DeHa 2 and 4. DeHa 1 and DeHa 5 show promising preliminary data and may prove capable of degrading perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). With further research and enzyme optimization, our enzymes could offer a powerful, inexpensive prospect for PFAS biodegradation.:::2021
