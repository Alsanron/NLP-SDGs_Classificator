Rio_UFRJ_Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Ammit: the new serological diagnosis strategy for arboviroses:::Dengue flavivirus (DENV) is responsible for many deaths worldwide. The existing diagnostic assays are non-specific and may cross-react with other flaviviruses, such as Zika which leads to false-positive results in serological tests. To solve this problem, we developed Ammit: a chimeric protein made from DENV epitopes, used as an antigen to capture anti-Dengue antibodies. Based on the bioengineering cycle, we selected the most promising epitopes for Ammitâ€™s design. For this, we analyzed its structure and binding to antibodies using different computational tools. The DNA sequence of the best protein was synthesized and cloned into a plasmid. After transformation of E. coli, expression was induced and the protein was purified. Next, we tested the binding of Ammit to commercial anti-DENV2 antibodies. We also consulted professionals to verify the project's impact on complications due to misdiagnosis. Eventually, Ammit will constitute a point of care device that will provide fast and specific results.:::2021
