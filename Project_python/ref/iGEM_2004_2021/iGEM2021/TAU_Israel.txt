TAU_Israel:::Asia:::Israel:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Communique â€“ A generic platform for designing genes with selective activity in microbial communities:::Microbiomes include networks of microorganisms that share genetic information via horizontal gene transfer. Most bacteria in nature are organized in such interconnected communities; thus the ability to engineer microbiomes constitutes an important frontier for the field of synthetic biology. Effective engineering of microbiomes heavily relies on selectivity: the ability to make the desired changes (e.g. introducing new functions) to certain species but not others. Selectivity is also critical from a biosafety perspective as the introduction of genes into unwanted hosts can cause large ecological impacts. We have developed the first computational tool to selectively engineer microbiomes, along with experimental means to evaluate it. By addressing the main biophysical processes related to gene activity and expression, our software designs microbiome- specific plasmids that are expressed optimally in certain microorganisms while having impaired expression in others. Our tool can be applied to any plasmid and microbiome.:::2021
