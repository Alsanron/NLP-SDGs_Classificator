IOANNINA:::Europe:::Greece:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Antibyeotic: Bacteria against AMR:::The increasing amount of antibiotics in the environment has led to a rising number of antibiotic resistant bacteria, putting human and animal health at risk. Antibiotic use in poultry farming remains high and leads to antibiotic pollution. The problem of AMR is now a serious threat to the achievement of many of the Sustainable Development Goals as indicated by the United Nations. Defending the One Health approach, we aim to design a bacterial mechanism, which can inactivate tetracyclines and macrolides in the surrounding environment, while containing a self-destruction mechanism, activated when it has fulfilled its role. For this purpose, we partnered with iGEM IISER-Tirupati, to share their kill switch based on the action of a modified bpDNase1. The bacterial cell death is regulated by the presence of antibiotics using TetR and MphR as antibiotic sensors. Our idea could be applied in chicken manure making the final product safe and antibiotic-free.:::2021
