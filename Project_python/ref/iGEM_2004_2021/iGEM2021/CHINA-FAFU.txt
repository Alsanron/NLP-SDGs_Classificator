CHINA-FAFU:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Microscopic Algae，“Macroscopic” Energy.:::Microalgae are among the most efficient carbon sequestering organisms known, and the CHINA-FAFU iGEM team has used synthetic biology and molecular biology as the core tools to explore the association between key genes of ascorbic acid metabolic pathway and carbon dioxide fixation and lipid anabolism in microalgae, and to construct various engineered algal strains to verify the functions of related genetic elements. At the same time, we will use mathematical models to predict the possibility of practical production applications of the algae strains. Our project can provide a reference for the design and cultivation of excellent engineered strains of microalgae, and promote the reduction of biodiesel production cost and the international trend of new energy and carbon neutral economy.:::2021
