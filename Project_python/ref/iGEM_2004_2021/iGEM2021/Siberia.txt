Siberia:::Europe:::Russian Federation:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::LEAP2BRAIN:::The goal of our project is to provide a novel drug delivery system by combining the principles of living therapeutics and N2B delivery. We demonstrate this concept on LEAP2, an endogenous antagonist of the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a, found in the hypothalamus. The results of an existing mural model suggest that LEAP2 may be used to treat Class I and II obesity in humans. To achieve this, LEAP2 must be periodically supplied directly to the brain. For nasally administered proteins, such delivery is possible via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves, thus bypassing the BBB. We created DH5 alpha and BL21 strains of E.coli that secrete a fusion protein composed of LEAP2, LMWP (a CPP) and a Myc-tag. We're also investigating how CPP's affect membrane permeability to proteins from the "inside". We plan to test our system using an in vitro ALI Transwell system with an artificial mucosal layer.:::2021
