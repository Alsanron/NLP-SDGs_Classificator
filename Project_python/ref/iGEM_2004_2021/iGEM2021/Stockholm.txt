Stockholm:::Europe:::Sweden:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mikroskin: an aptamer-based biosensor for the detection of skin microbiome dysbiosis:::One third of the world's population suffer from skin diseases, like acne and atopic dermatitis. These diseases can cause a negative effect in peoples mental health. There are several sources to skin diseases and dysbiosis in the skin microbiome is one potential source. In order to find the source of the disease, improve to the research community and strive for more personalized health care, we at iGEM Stockholm developed a semi-quantitative rapid test to detect potential dysbiosis that causes the skin diseases. This has been done by developing aptamers targeting teichoic acid that exists in all gram-positive bacteria, which constitutes nearly all bacteria of the skin microbiome. Moreover, other aptamers target C.acnes and S.aureus, which are known to cause skin problems. After conjugating the selected aptamers to 10,12-Pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA) polymers, a color change visual to the naked eye will be obtained when the aptamers bind to their target.:::2021
