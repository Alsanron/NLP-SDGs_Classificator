Alma:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Poisoned River:::The Pine River is found in central Michigan, near Alma College's campus. Following the closure of the Velsicol Chemical Plant in 1978, many environmental pollutants -- including DDT and its derivatives -- were improperly disposed of and leached into the surroundings, thus coining the name, the Poisoned River. These organochlorides are endocrine disruptors and possible carcinogens have wreaked havoc on the local ecosystem. More than this population were affected. Our solution: a biosensor that uses estrogen receptors to detect these harmful pollutants. Several species of animals have estrogen receptors known to bind DDT, a known xenoestrogen. Linking this to a reporting gene, such as RFP, within a microbe will allow the detection of organochlorides. This can lead to the screening of contaminated areas locally and globally. Ultimately, this biosensor has the potential to save thousands of dollars in not only our superfund sites, but pollution cleanup effort across the globe.:::2021
