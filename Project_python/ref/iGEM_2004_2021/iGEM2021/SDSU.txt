SDSU:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering Methanococcus maripaludis for Methanol Biosynthesis, Wastewater Treatment, and Desalination in a Bioelectrochemical System:::Globally, close to 80% of wastewater receives no treatment and it is anticipated that 40% of people will lack access to clean water for drinking or irrigation by 2030. Additionally, given the effects of climate change on the planet, sustainable, carbon neutral fuels are essential to mitigate anthropogenic damage to the planet. SDSU's iGEM team addressed these issues using a three chamber Bioelectrochemical System(BES) inoculated with Shewanella oneidensis in the anode chamber and Methanococcus maripaludis in the cathode. The third chamber is used for water deionization by taking advantage of the BES cell voltage and permeable membranes. Although the BES desalinates, treats organics in wastewater, and creates a biofuel(CH4) from CO2 using the wild type organisms, reactive oxygen species(ROS) genes, protein folding chaperones, and a methane monooxygenase(MMO) were constructed to allow M. maripaludis to synthesize methanol from methane within the BES.:::2021
