ULaval:::North America:::Canada:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::aSAP: a Solution Against maple Polymers:::Maple syrup is a Canadian emblem. It’s a big part of our economy and culture. In 2021 alone, Canada produced 45M litres of maple syrup. Maple syrup is produced by boiling maple sap to make the sticky sweet syrup we Canadians know and love. Sometimes, contaminating microorganisms create exopolysaccharides in the syrup. These polymers are dextrans: very long sugar molecules that ruin the syrup’s taste and texture, making it very viscous. When this occurs, it creates ropy maple syrup. This syrup cannot be sold, and so producers must pay for it to be destroyed, creating a waste of food, energy and money. We created a treatment using a designed dextranase to put into the barrels of ropy syrup to make it usable again for producers. Over the past two years, our team was able to express, purify, characterize and do the proof of concept of our dextranase.:::2021
