HKUST:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ShellBi - Prokaryotic Biosensor for Detection of Paralytic Shellfish Toxins:::Paralytic shellfish toxins (PST), such as Saxitoxin and Tetrodotoxin, are neurotoxins found in shellfish like clams, mussels, and oysters, that cause Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) by blocking the sodium channels in neurons. Current methods to test for PSTs suffer from massive drawbacks in terms of ethics, complexity, accessibility, and cost. Hence, we are building a prokaryotic biosensor for the detection of a wide range of PSTs that is ethical, cheap, simple, and direct. The biosensor utilises the antagonistic interaction between Shellfish Toxins and Veratridine to induce significant ionic changes within the cell. An engineered Two Component System in the cells senses this change in intracellular ionic levels and modulates gene expression leading to expression of different reporter proteins. Red fluorescent colour is expected when the toxin is present while green when it is not. Small-scale testing laboratories and even shellfish farms could employ our kit for quality assurance of shellfish.:::2021
