NAU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::High-efficiency selenium recovery bioreactor : E. coli:::Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are a kind of elemental selenium wrapped in biological macromolecules such as proteins. Some microorganisms have the nutural ability to reduce selenium-oxide anions to SeNPs. However, they are not always perfect. There are problems such as low reduction efficiency and low activity due to large particle size of SeNPs. We chose E.coli BL21, which has the natural ability of reducing selenium oxide anions to SeNPs, as the chassis, added ssuE enzyme and Sef A protein which could improve the reduction rate. Finally, a high-efficient selenium recovery bioreactor with higher reduction rate and higher product activity was obtained. The SeNPs produced in the bioreactor has been used to inhibit drug-resistant bacteria, adsorb heavy metal ions and improve the quality of crops with satisfactory results.:::2021
