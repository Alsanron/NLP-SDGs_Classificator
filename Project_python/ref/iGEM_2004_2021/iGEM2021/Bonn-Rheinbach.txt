Bonn-Rheinbach:::Europe:::Germany:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioLan – Protein-based extraction of rare earth elements from ores:::Lanthanides form the majority of the highly important rare earth elements (REE) and possess outstanding catalytic and magnetic properties. REEs are essential in all fields of modern technology – from automobility to medical diagnostics. The current REE mining is energy-intense and relies on many synthesized chemicals. We developed a protein-based process to increase sustainability and selectivity of REE mining. The bacterial protein lanmodulin (LanM) was heterologously produced in E. coli and purified in a novel, chromatography-free one-step method. LanM was added to an ore leachate to form an REE-LanM complex. After isolation of this complex, REE ions were released by pH reduction. Upon removal of LanM, this biological chelator was regenerated and a highly pure REE solution was obtained. Our project is characterized by iterative process optimization tailoring the approach to industrial application. Overall, it was demonstrated that the protein LanM can replace current chemical chelating agents in REE mining.:::2021
