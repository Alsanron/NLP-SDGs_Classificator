WVHS_SanDiego_CA:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Project Purified:::Aridification and rising sea levels are increasing salinity levels and the little-known effects of global warming are drastically affecting coastal plants, like Liquidambar and Jasmine. This project focuses on the HKT1 pathway and overexpresses the pathway in plants battling higher concentrations of salt, to adapt and over time and breed new generations of more-tolerant plants. HKT1-type transporters are key determinants of Na+ and K+ homeostasis under salt stress and they contribute to reducing Na+-specific toxicity in plants. We created four new parts using knowledge from previous literature in which the chassis, E. coli will act as a device to insert a sequence to overexpress the HKT1 gene in plants. The CrGPDH3 promoter gene from C. reinhardtii was found to be inducible under NaCl treatments from previous laboratory experiments, therefore, the project focused on combining the RIA1 section of the CrGPDH3 promoter to initiate overexpression for the HKT1 transporter.:::2021
