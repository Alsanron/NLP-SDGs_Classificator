Austin_UTexas:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::OCTOPUS (Ocean Clean-up Targeting Oil and Plastics Using Synthetic-biology):::Ocean pollution by crude oil and its derivative, plastic, is a pervasive environmental issue. With OCTOPUS, we intend to create a P1 phage-based system for delivering surfactant and plastic-degradation genes to marine bacteria to disperse oil slicks and degrade PET plastics, creating more accessible droplets and simple hydrocarbons to allow both pollutants to be metabolized by native hydrocarbon-degrading marine bacteria. We are focusing on the surfactant genes Ranaspumin-2 and Latherin which work individually, and the plastic-degrading genes PETase and MHETase which work together. Using Golden Gate assembly, we are creating plasmids containing either surfactant or plastic-degrading genes plus a packaging sequence that allows P1 to take up the plasmid. Once these phages have been successfully produced, we will analyze their lysates with a variety of assays such as the oil spreading assay for measuring surfactant activity and the blue-dye assay for measuring plastic degradation.:::2021
