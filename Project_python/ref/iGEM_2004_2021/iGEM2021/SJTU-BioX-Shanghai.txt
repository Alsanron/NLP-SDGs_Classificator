SJTU-BioX-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Detection Blitz:::We live in a world where monstrous industries operate ruthlessly, while the environment is crowded by numerous unknown hazardous bacteria and virus.  Emergencies could occur without anyone foreseeing——by then, a lightning fast detection tool would play a vital role. SJTU-BioX-Shanghai think out of the box, constructing a platform that enables the automatic development of new fast detection test strips. With the help of an in vitro evolution strategy for aptazyme, we can effectively find biosensors for wide-ranging targets. Then two rational designed probes are introduced by our prediction model, which enables our nanogold based lateral flow system to show a positive signal with targets in existence. By virtue of the extremely short development cycle and equipment-free final products, our project possesses a bright prospect.:::2021
