Whittle:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Mural artist: Cyanobacteria-produced Auxin to Engineer Plant Growth in Horticulture:::Plant hormone plays an important role in agriculture and horticulture manufacture. As such, they have gained widespread commercial use in nurseries and in farming. This year, Whittle iGEM tries to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a main plant hormone, by using Cyanobacteria PCC6803. First, we introduced the gene of yeast into Escherichia coli, and construct the IPA pathway. By taking Trp as the substrate, we verified that the genetic pathway is able to convert 80% of Trp into IAA within 48 hours. Afterwards, we built the expression vector of cyanobacteria and convert it into Cyanobacteria PCC6803. We hope to manufacture cyan sponge bricks that contain this microorganism to produce our product Auxwall, and promote the growth of plants in garden landscaping. We hope that this product will transform the agriculture and landscape design in the future.:::2021
