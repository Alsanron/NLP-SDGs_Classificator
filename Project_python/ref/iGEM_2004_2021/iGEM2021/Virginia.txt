Virginia:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Manifold: Protein Shells with Encapsulated DNA Scaffolds for Increasing Efficiency of Biosynthetic Pathways:::Utilizing prokaryotic, biosynthetic processes to produce pharmaceuticals and commercially valued organic compounds provides a safer, greener, and more cost-effective alternative to traditional chemical synthesis. Unfortunately, metabolic flux imbalances along with biosynthetic pathway-chassis interactions complicate metabolic engineering and stymie an industry-scale shift to biosynthesis. To mitigate these complications, we have designed a platform technology known as Manifold that sequesters and spatially organizes synthetic, zinc finger-bound enzymes on dsDNA scaffolds inside bacterial microcompartments. Here we detail our progress toward a resveratrol-producing, proof-of-concept device built using the Manifold framework, and present adaptable models which further the utility of Manifold to metabolic engineers. Through the application of Manifold, the process of metabolic engineering is greatly simplified, marking a major step toward a less expensive and more sustainable means of global chemical production.:::2021
