Yucai_SZ:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::A composite material for fresco restoration based on engineered E.coli:::The restoration of traditional frescos is a difficult process. Our project is to operate the modified E.coli which can be induced by blue light to produce a layer combined calcium carbonate, pigment and adhesive directly at the damaged position of the fresco. After the combination of these three, a micron level colored calcium layer will be formed on the wall surface, so as to repair the damaged frescos.:::2021
