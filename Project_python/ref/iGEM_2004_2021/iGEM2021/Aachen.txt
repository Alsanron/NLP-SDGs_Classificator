Aachen:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Enzyme-based semi-specific DNA synthesis for long-term data storage:::In the last few years, DNA sequencing has developed rapidly while DNA synthesis still relies on the decades-old chemical phosphoramidite system. However, this process is toxic and has already reached its limit at around 200 bases. Thus, the demand for more environmentally friendly and effective novel approaches is evident. In this project, we report an enzymatic ssDNA synthesis system with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). In each synthesis cycle, an unspecific number of nucleotides is incorporated. Our unique automated hardware can selectively attach nucleotides to immobilized primers in order to synthesize preset DNA sequences. We present a ternary system to encode and recover the information stored on DNA. This system enables the semi-specific approach, in which information is saved only in the transitions between bases, therefore specific synthesis is not necessary. This opens up a much more approachable and robust system that even allows adding proof-reading properties.:::2021
