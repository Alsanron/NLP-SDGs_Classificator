Guelph:::North America:::Canada:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CRISPR to Combat Climate Change:::Our project this year aims to address the threats posed to global food production by climate change in the form of abnormal or unseasonal weather events. Using a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system in conjunction with a molecular switch, we aim to create genetically modified plants for which specific stress-response genes can be manually upregulated following the human-mediated input of a chemical stimulus. Our team has also developed and executed a strong outreach plan. We have worked with professionals in the industry and experts in the fields of agriculture and genetic engineering in order to better understand how our research can be applied. We have also partnered with other iGEM teams to create a series of academic materials covering different facets of synthetic biology. We have partnered with teachers in order to gain feedback on this work, and to determine how this material could be effectively deployed in a classroom setting.:::2021
