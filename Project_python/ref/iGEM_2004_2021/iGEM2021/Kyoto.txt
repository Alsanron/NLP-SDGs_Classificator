Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::FLOWEREVERã€€-A colorful palette of approaches for sustaining flower life-:::Since time immemorial, flowers have been providing us with comfort and beauty on occasions ranging from mourning to celebration. While cut flowers are in high demand, they are ultimately treated as disposable products leading to large amounts of pre- and post-consumer waste. To make this intimate and essential relationship sustainable, iGEM Kyoto proposes a colorful palette of measures for each process from flower production to consumption. Our discussions with stakeholders revealed that many flowers are lost to insects or diseases. Accordingly, we attempted to kill pests with RNAi, and developed a virus detection device based on RT-LAMP and CRISPR-Cas12a. Alternative to chemicals, we suggest dsRNA and peptides to delay flower wilting. Notably, for more efficient syntheses of these eco-friendly materials, we proposed a system using asymmetric plasmid partitioning. Although fragility and mortality may add to a flower's beauty, an extended life span will allow them to be enjoyed by many.:::2021
