KCL_UK:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Developing Novel Strategies to Advance the Treatment of Spinal Cord Injuries:::Spinal cord injuries (SCI) result from spinal cord damage and are characterized by nerve degeneration, growth inhibition and inflammation at the lesion site. As the central nervous system has limited regenerative abilities, neural recovery plateaus and a glial scar forms inhibiting axonal regeneration. Between 250,000 to 500,000 individuals worldwide are impacted yearly by life-altering repercussions, including paralysis. Our project focuses on developing a therapy for SCI through the convergence of synthetic biology, recombinant protein technology and regenerative medicine. We have designed a personalised 3D-bioprinted polycaprolactone scaffold, with growth-supporting topographical features for implementation alongside our synthetic mussel foot protein bioadhesive. This multidirectional approach ensures our scaffold remains fixed and encourages axonal regeneration. Furthermore, we have incorporated the use of our optimised chondroitinase ABC enzyme to enhance functional recovery and improve our treatment. Our enzyme degrades chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and has the potential to improve axonal sprouting following SCI.:::2021
