NJMU-China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Stairway to starlight:Maternal prevention and offspring treatment of autism induced by maternal infection during pregnancy:::Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability. According to American CDC, the prevalence of autism in the U.S. has increased from 1 in 68 births in 2010 to 1 in 54 births in 2020. However, to date, there is no effective drug to treat ASD. Apart from genetic factors, the potentially dangerous environmental factors to the maternal generation, such as Maternal immune activation(MIA) and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), can also be the cause of ASD. According to the gut-brain axis theory, whether it is maternal immune activation or genetic factors, the etiologies of autism are all related to the gut microbiome. Children with ASDs are also what we call ‘Children From the Star’.Our project aims at building up a stairway to the starlight, using engineering probiotics to prevent autism caused by maternal infection during pregnancy and treat children, thus structuring a way to health for the ‘Children From the Star’.:::2021
