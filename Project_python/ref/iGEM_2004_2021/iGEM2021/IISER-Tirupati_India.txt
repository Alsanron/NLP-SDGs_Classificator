IISER-Tirupati_India:::Asia:::India:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::OviCloak: A Novel Contraceptive for Uterus Owners:::The modern contraceptives used at present have improved efficiency, but they have certain drawbacks that need immediate attention both from a human health and environmental perspective. Keeping in mind the importance of contraception globally, we aim to develop a safe and environment-friendly contraceptive for uterus owners by utilizing commensal bacteria of the fallopian tubes. Using synthetic biology, we plan to equip the bacteria with a progesterone sensing system that regulates the production of ovastacin, an ovum-specific human protease. Ovastacin acts as a contraceptive molecule by specifically targeting the outer layer of the ovum to prevent sperm entry. The bacteria is also engineered with a xylose inducible kill switch to ensure reversibility of the contraception and a blue-light inducible kill switch to kill the bacteria upon any environmental release. OviCloak aims to offer its users control over their fertility and uphold their fundamental rights without compromising their health or the environment.:::2021
