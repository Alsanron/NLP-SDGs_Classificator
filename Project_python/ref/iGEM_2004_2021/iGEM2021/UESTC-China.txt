UESTC-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Deink the dark:::Nowadays the recycling rate of office waste paper (OWP) in China is dramatically low. We find that cellulase, xylanase, lipase, and laccase will allow bio-deinking to occur, by helping the ink detach from the waste paper and decomposing hazardous substances. We also design a new surface assembly of a functional cellulosome by using Pichia pastoris. Otherwise, to bring our idea to the real world, we design a paper recycle machine (Deinker) ï¼Œwhich includes the transmission part, enzyme liquid smearing part, deinking part, and paper drying part. Through this device, the OWP will be reborn. In addition, 5 mathematical models are built for improving experiments, hardware, and implementation. Moreover, Human Practice has been constantly advancing as the project progresses, we design related activities from four aspects: practical issues, technology, market and industry, policy, and law to understand the exact needs of stakeholders.:::2021
