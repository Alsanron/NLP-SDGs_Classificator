UiOslo_Norway:::Europe:::Norway:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PFASeOut:::PFAS is a collection of per- and  polyfluoroakyl  compounds that are water-repellent, which in ski wax gives the skis better gliding properties. The International Ski Federation (FIS) has banned the use of PFAS in ski wax during skiing competitions due to the toxic effects they have on the environment and on the health of ski wax appliers. For this ban to be effective and fair for the athletes, there must be a way to efficiently detect PFAS containing wax during competitions. Currently, there are no functioning test for field-use. To tackle this problem, we are using synthetic biology to develop such a detection device.  Our detection method exploit two different genes from bacteria which can recognize PFAS compounds and cleave their C-F bond. The presence of PFAS compounds will be based on detection of released fluoride ions , either colorimetrically or by measuring changes in conductivity.:::2021
