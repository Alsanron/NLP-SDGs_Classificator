SCU-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Vibrio natriegens "Marionette": Achieve strict and subtle gene regulation in Vibrio natriegens:::Vibrio natriegens can propagate in 10mins and has been applied in metabolic engineering, protein production as well as other fields. Until now, no efficient strategy for gene regulation on V.n has been developed. In our project: Vibrio natriegens "Marionette", we develop a new strategy for strict and subtle gene regulation aiming at promoting the use of V.n in synthetic biology. By introducing artificial promoters, insulators, UTRs, controllable ORI and Marionette collection, we build a golden-gate-based part collection, which enables strict and tunable gene expression in V.n. Furthermore, we engineered miniature CasÎ¦(751aa) and AsCas12f1(422aa) taking high sensitivity of V.n to burden caused by protein expression, to achieve efficient CRISPRa and CRISPRi of multiple genes. We also explore the possibility to build incoherent feed-forward loops (iFFLs) by Cas protein. Our strategy showed a fantastic performance in the regulation of VioABCDE cluster and production of flavoind.:::2021
