BS_United_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Quorum Sensing Disabler for fooD Decontamination:::Food bacterial contamination impacts human health everyday. Food is easily colonized by pathogenic microorganisms, using quorum sensing (QS) to form biofilms on food surfaces, during production, processing, transportation, and serving. QS is the regulation of gene expression reacting to cell density and is used by both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria to regulate various physiological functions. Our synthetic biology framework consists of two E.coli constructs, Part1(E.bsuahlscout), possessing LuxR to sense and combine AHL in the environment, which will be activated and initiate the expression of mcherry report gene, and Part2(E.bsuahlterminator), containing quorum quenching acylase pvdq fused with GFP to convert AHL into LHL, blocking QS signals. To improve LL-37 peptide generated by Jilin_China, we conjunct it to our Part 2, so P. aeruginosa are exposed to it and killed, and will live under a low-AHL environment. Thus, biofilms are not formed, and food decontamination is achieved.:::2021
