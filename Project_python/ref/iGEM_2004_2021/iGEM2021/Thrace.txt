Thrace:::Europe:::Greece:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Salica: A device for early screening of colorectal cancer using salivary biomarkers:::Colorectal cancer has high incidence across the world and the 5-year survival rate for people with a localized stage colorectal cancer is 90%, but only one third of patients are diagnosed at such stage. This problem persists despite the existence of many screening solutions such as colonoscopy and stool based tests. Our proposed solution is Salica, a non invasive, easy to use home device, that accurately quantifies salivary colorectal cancer biomarkers such as specific strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and microRNAs. Firstly, the biomarkers are isothermaly amplified using recombinase polymerase amplification and the produced nucleic acids are targeted by the cas12a enzyme. Upon target recognition a fluorescently labeled ssDNA probe is cleaved by cas12a resulting in a colorimetric output that is quantified by a 3d printed smartphone fluorimeter. In the future our system can be adapted to any improved biomarker just by changing only the RPA primers and the cas12a crRNA.:::2021
