TU_Kaiserslautern:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MoClo Mania - revolutionizing protein production by establishing the Modular Cloning system in Leishmania tarentolae:::Large quantities of protein are needed every year for research and medical purposes. Production of heterologous proteins in genetically modified microbial hosts has long been established as a biotechnological standard. Still, the production of proteins destined for therapeutic application in humans, often proves to be challenging for conventional host organisms due to complex post-translational modifications most mammalian proteins undergo. Specific modification patterns, such as human-like glycosylation, cannot be replicated in microbial expression hosts, yet are essential to the proteinÂ´s functionality. Recently, the protozoan parasite Leishmania tarentolae has emerged as a favorable eukaryotic expression host because of its human-like glycosylation capabilities. To facilitate the use of Leishmania tarentolae, we established a library of genetic parts suitable for the usage of the Modular Cloning system within Leishmania tarentolae. This paves the way to a versatile and expandable gene part collection, making the expression of human-like glycosylated proteins more feasible and effective.:::2021
