Crete:::Europe:::Greece:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A PLANT-BASED EDIBLE VACCINE EXPRESSING A CHIMERIC TRIPARTITE SPIKE-S1 PROTEIN OF SARS-CoV-2 FOR COVID-19 CONTROL:::SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19 pandemic, caused over 200,000 deaths globally in the first 4 months. Overcoming this pandemic is a great challenge for humanity and it is still a main concern for the scientific communities worldwide. We decided to develop an edible vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 aiming to be a more accessible and easily distributed alternative to conventional vaccines. To create this vaccine, we designed a synthetic gene that expresses specific SARS-CoV-2 antigens into plant cells. Our synthetic construct codes for a chimeric tripartite Spike S1 protein that covers three distinct mutants of SARS-CoV-2. Using the agroinfiltration method we produce high levels of the chimeric S1-protein at the lettuce cells membrane. This antigen protein will specifically activate the Mucosal Immunity in lab animals upon consuming of the plant tissue. This is the first step of our vaccine development that will be followed by the immunization of lab mice.:::2021
