NJTech_China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Saving Rose Planâ€”Design and Construction of Synthetic Yeast-Microalgae Consortia for Biosynthesis of Phenylethanol:::Phenylethanol has been widely used in cosmetics and other fields owing to its rose aroma. This project chooses Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the chassis microorganism, optimizes the phenethylamine pathway of different sources and expression modes, improves the activity of phenylacetaldehyde synthase through promoter engineering, establishes a yeast-microalgae microbial consortia system based on nutritional complementation and metabolites exchange. The combination with 3D printing microcapsule embedding technology will eventually guide to establish a robust, stable, and controllable artificial microbial consortia system for the green and efficiency phenylethanol biosynthetic.:::2021
