These counterfeit products have significantly harmed the rights and interests of consumers and even more disrespect for artists. However, the current appraisal of artworks is poor, complicated and expensive. In this regard, GreatBay_SZ has developed ARTAG - Artificially Revolutionized Tracking Art Gadget. In ARTAG, yeast spores, which have strong tolerance and adhesion, were used as an ideal carrier for long-time DNA barcode storage. Customized DNA-encode barcode information was integrated into the genome of the yeast through homologous recombination. A CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection system was introduced to detect sequences quickly and efficiently in terms of information decoding. In general, ARTAG offers an accurate, rapid, durable, invisible and cost-efficient spore detection system to verify the authenticity of artworks. It provides new possibilities for all anti-counterfeiting technologies and markets.:::2021
