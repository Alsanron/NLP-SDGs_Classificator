Lethbridge_HS:::North America:::Canada:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Knaptime is Over:::Our project is an RNAi-based herbicide targeting the invasive plant species, Centaurea stoebe, more commonly known as spotted knapweed. This project was inspired by the 2017 Kenow wildfire’s devastating aftermath in Waterton National Park. The fire created the ideal environment for spotted knapweed to exponentially spread, limiting the resources for native plant species. Biological controls, manual removal, and chemical treatments are presently utilized to combat the infestation. However, these methods can be costly, time consuming or risk affecting local native species. Our project avoids these drawbacks. The bioengineered RNAi system would be delivered to specifically eliminate spotted knapweed by targeting a unique sequence in the Clp protease gene of the plant’s chloroplast genome. We are using a new “one-pot” method for siRNA production and will first test our product on Arabidopsis thaliana. Knaptime is Over will help to preserve the world’s biological diversity and test a new siRNA production method.:::2021
