FAFU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::"Mystery of Fragrance":Photoperiod Microbial Fragrance Production System:::This year, our team developed a system of aroma production by light-regulated microorganisms, which gives microorganisms the ability to produce aroma by regulating endogenous pathways and cutting into different exogenous enzymes, and through mathematical modeling, determine its optimal culture conditions so that it stably exists in the developed system. By adding light-controlled switch elements to microorganisms, the concentration of the aroma can be changed according to the intensity of light. The inhibition of linalool synthase in Escherichia coli is relieved under light, and linalool can be produced. Saccharomyces cerevisiae can produce nerol in dark conditions, and the related proteins are eventually degraded under the light. Finally, we designed an ingenious hardware device for the whole system, which effectively solved the problem of microbial leakage and aroma diffusion. Looking to the future, our team hopes to apply the system to the development of new nightlights and into people's lives.:::2021
