ACIBADEM_ISTANBUL:::Europe:::Turkey:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Rapid Easy Point of Care Diagnostics by Combining Antigen Tests and Nucleic Acid Amplification:::Nucleic acid amplification tests like polymerase chain reaction have high sensitivity and are the standard test for the diagnosis of infections like Covid19. However, they require molecular biology laboratories and trained personnel. Therefore, they are not point of care (POC) diagnostics. Rapid antigen tests fix an antibody to a chromatic paper strip, detecting antigens binding to this antibody. However, since there is no amplification, sensitivity is low. Combining the principles of these methods, our kit works by binding a molecule of the infectious agent on a strip via antibody or DNA probe, then doing signal amplification on the bound molecule. This involves an innovative isothermal nucleic acid amplification at room temperature, not requiring sophisticated instruments. The nucleic acid amplification depends on a synthetic original enzyme that can cut one strand enabling strand displacement by DNA polymerase. This method may enable rapid diagnosis of diseases at POC and help control pandemics.:::2021
