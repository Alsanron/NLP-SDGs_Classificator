USP-Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Let.it.bee.:::Bees are very important for the environment and economy since they are responsible for the pollination of about 70% of crops worldwide. Some crops are completely dependent on bee pollination to exist. Since the 1990s, registers show a decrease in beeâ€™s populations, associated with multifactorial causes, such as the Colony Collapse Disorder and Acute Intoxication. One of the most worrying causes is the misuse of neonicotinoids pesticides, of which the most used is Imidacloprid. Bees when in contact with contaminated pollen take it to the colony, spreading the toxicity and causing mass deaths. To address this we developed a plant (Solanum lycopersicum) that can metabolize Imidacloprid specifically in pollen. We associated a pollen specific promoter, pLAT52, to the expression of the enzyme CYP6G1, responsible for metabolizing Imidacloprid in the pesticide resistant Drosophila melanogaster. This way pollen remains safe for pollinators while the rest of the plant is protected against pests.:::2021
