Gunma:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Breakdown Biofilms in Baths:::Hot spring facilities all over the word have various problems caused by biofilms. For example, biofilms protect infectious microorganisms from disinfectants. Biofilms are communities of microorganisms that irreversibly stick to non-biological surfaces and grow on the surfaces, producing exopolysaccharides that facilitate attachment and matrix formation. To break down such biofilms, we constructed a vector for expression of a glycolytic enzyme fused to RFP (red) that degrades exopolysaccharides. An Escherichia coli strain was used not only as an expression host but also as a carrier of the enzyme to biofilms. The strain also contained a suicide vector as the second vector that can cause bacteriolysis under some specific condition. Our findings showed that experimental biofilms were efficiently degraded by the glycolytic enzyme that leaked from the lysed transformant cells . The use of the red transformant may make it easier to kill infectious microorganisms with disinfectants or remove biofilms from bathtubs.:::2021
