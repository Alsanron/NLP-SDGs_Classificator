IISc-Bangalore:::Asia:::India:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CellOPHane:::Project CellOPHane seeks to create a functionalized bacterial cellulose filter to combat organophosphate pollution. Organophosphates are used as pesticides globally but are extremely potent neurotoxic agents, which cause adverse reactions on reaching living organisms through contaminated agricultural runoff. We are seeking to degrade the organophosphates present in water into relatively harmless products by using a broad-spectrum organophosphate hydrolase functionalized on a bacterial cellulose sheet. We're also seeking to create a one-of-a-kind modular plug-n-play platform to combat other kinds of pollution with minimal modifications. The platform that we seek to create can be used for any bioremediation strategy by just cloning the corresponding enzyme; one need not therefore spend resources on reimagining the exact design implementation for every individual contaminant. Project CellOPHane will thus help in reshaping the bioremediation landscape and make bioremediation strategies easy to develop and implement.:::2021
