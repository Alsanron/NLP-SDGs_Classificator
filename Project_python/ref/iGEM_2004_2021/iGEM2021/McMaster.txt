McMaster:::North America:::Canada:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genetically Modified Bacteria for Targeted Elimination of Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli in Inflammatory Bowel Disease:::Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of immune-related diseases, characterized by chronic inflammation and severe tissue damages in the human gastrointestinal tract. Therapeutics developed using synthetic biology methods showed some efficacy in laboratory studies but failed to produce clinically relevant results. In this project, we performed a comprehensive literature review of recent advancements in the field and we proposed the use of bacteriocin to target the pathogenic bacteria adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), which are closely involved in the development of IBD. We constructed a genetic circuit that can simultaneously detect the inflammation marker nitric oxide, and a pathogen-specific quorum sensing factor named autoinducer-3. Upon activation, the genetic circuit expresses colicin E1 and E9, two bacteriocins that can selectively eliminate the AIEC. We designed detailed experimental workflows for circuit construction through Gibson assembly and for functional verification. A mathematical model was also established to predict the outcomes of our design.:::2021
