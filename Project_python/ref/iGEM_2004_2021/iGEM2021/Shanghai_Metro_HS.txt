In the selection of the desired gene, PKC-001 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reported to secrete the cellulase which maintains well activity under both acid and base conditions. Therefore, we optimized its codon and further constructed the plasmid to combine the optimized gene-PKC-OP, which was transformed into the E. coli for expressing itself. Even though we encountered many difficulties in lab work, we finally obtained our engineered E. coli which could express the desired cellulase. We hope this silage additive could contribute the stockbreeding development and improve life quality in the future.:::2021
