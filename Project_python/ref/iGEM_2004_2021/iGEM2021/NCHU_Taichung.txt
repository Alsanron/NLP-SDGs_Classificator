NCHU_Taichung:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Artificial endophyte for future agriculture:::Our main goal is to use the synthetic biological strategy for achieving an example of circular agriculture. Rice could feed half of the global population, and tons of rice straws are produced after harvest. Inappropriate rice straws management, straws burning, causes problems releasing CO2, PAHs, and PM2.5. In this project, we constructed the Clostridial cellulase genes within Bacillus subtilis WB800 and the cellulosomal enzymes could be formed. It will be used for effective straws decomposition and used as a medium for culturing our beneficial endophyte. Furthermore, we constructed an artificial endophyte through versatile biostimulant, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) producing Bacillus subtilis and cultured by saccharified straw liquid. The PQQ containing broth will exogenously apply to the rice and/or other plants to promote their growth. Our example for circular agriculture could be completed by the above strategy, while agricultural waste can be recycled into valuable products and also could reduce CO2 emission.:::2021
