UCAS-China:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DeCaffi: Personalized Caffeine Intake Management Scheme Based on Synthetic Biology:::With the popularity of caffeinated beverages, more and more people are troubled by caffeine sensitivity. People drink coffee during the daytime, but toss and turn at night because of the exciting effect of caffeine. In order to help humans better manage caffeine intake, we designed DeCaffi Project. Utilizing the conversion from caffeine to theacrine catalyzed by Cdh and CkTcS, we realized caffeine removal from customers' coffee. In view of the special liquid environment of hot coffee, we improved thermal stability of these enzymes through directed evolution and software PROSS. Using immobilized enzyme technology, we constructed a cell-free system that can quickly remove caffeine in our specially designed coffee cup, in which the sensor can monitor the changes of caffeine in real time. Additionally, considering convenience and user-friendliness, our software group has designed an App, which can collect data from coffee cups and bracelets, providing users with real-time caffeine intake suggestions.:::2021
