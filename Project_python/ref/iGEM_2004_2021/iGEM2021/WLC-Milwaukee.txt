WLC-Milwaukee:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BlacOps:::iGEM teams use synthetic biology to solve thousands of problems around the world. From diagnostic tests for cancer to biosensors that detect water contamination, using bacteria and their environment to influence gene expression is commonplace in synthetic biology. However, there are few resources available to those wanting to learn the foundation of all synthetic biology: gene regulation. Especially in urban settings like Milwaukee, a reliable gene regulation curriculum is absent. Furthermore, the concepts integral to understanding gene regulation are intricate, complex, and incredibly difficult to communicate. A reliable, hands-on educational kit simplifies the learning process tremendously. Using the well-documented and understood regulatory components of the lac operon, WLC-Milwaukee created BlacOps, a laboratory kit that effectively teaches the principles of gene regulation.:::2021
