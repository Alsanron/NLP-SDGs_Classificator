An efficient gold extraction process with less complicated wastewater treatment to minimize the production cost is the ultimate objective of our Auviola project. Bioleaching based on the cyanide-producing bacterium will be engineered, improving the gold extraction and subsequently degrading the off-process cyanide. The Auviola project utilized an engineered Chromobacterium violaceum. To optimize and design the system, kinetic and genomic scale models were demonstrated in both the extraction process and the cyanide degradation afterward. The bioreactor was also designed as the pilot scale for implementing the engineered gold bioleaching process. In the future, this project has the potential to be implemented as a sustainable low-cost gold bioleaching system for the artisanal and small-scale gold miners to bring achievable and beneficial impacts. Moreover, we also contribute to educating the students for understanding and implementing synthetic biology.:::2021
