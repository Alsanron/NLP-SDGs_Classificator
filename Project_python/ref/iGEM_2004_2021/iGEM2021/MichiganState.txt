MichiganState:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A multi-tiered biocontainment strategy for the prevention of horizontal gene transfer in transgenic microbes:::To combat unwanted horizontal gene transfer in transgenic microbes, we are creating a multi-faceted biocontainment system designed to work in Escherichia coli. First, we use the GhoST toxin-antitoxin system to induce cell death in unintended recipients without the corresponding antitoxin. We are also designing a CRISPR-Cas9 based artificial immunity system to cleave conjugative plasmids that enter the host cell, preventing it from gaining conjugative machinery that would allow transfer of synthetic parts. In order to understand how our strategy would behave in a microbial community, we developed an assay to assess horizontal gene transfer from donor to recipient. We also use a Markovâ€™s model and an agent-based model (ABM) to imitate genetic transfer using biophysical and community-based methods, respectively. We hope this system could be used by future iGEM teams to enhance their biocontainment efforts and allow teams to move towards implementation in less controlled environments.:::2021
