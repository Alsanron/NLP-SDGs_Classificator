GDSYZX:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Reconstruction of a highly efficient feather degrading Streptomyces sp. SCUT-3 for waste recycling:::Feather is one of the highest protein-containing resource in nature but is poorly reused. Previous reports have showed that Streptomyces sp. SCUT-3 can efficiently degrade feather. Although co-overexpression of CDO1 and protease Sep39 improved SCUT-3’s feather degradtion efficiency distinctly, SCUT-Ocdo1-sep39 yield fewer cells than SCUT-3. In this study, we revealed how to use different promotesr such as pro22610, pro24880 and pro1380 to increase SCUT-3’s feather degradtion efficiency without influence the growth of Streptomyces sp. SCUT-3.:::2021
