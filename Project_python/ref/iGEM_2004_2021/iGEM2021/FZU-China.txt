FZU-China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of optogenetic switch-based gut bacteria to potentially alleviate depression by supplying GABA:::Depression is a common but serious mood disorder. Although there are treatments for depression, the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication and the decline of treatments from patients can be problematic. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), as an important inhibitory neurotransmitter, has been shown to play a significant role in the regulation of mood disorders. Studies show that in healthy individuals, GABA-producing pathways are actively expressed in human gut microbiota. Based on these findings, we aim to engineer a dynamically controlled gut bacteria which can synthesize GABA to alleviate depression. We engineer a strain of E. coli to contain an optogenetic switch. When the switch is on, GadB (enzyme) and φX174E (lysis protein) can be made. GadB can catalyze the conversion of glutamate (which is abundant in foods) into GABA inside the cell. After the GABA concentration reaches a threshold, φX174E can lyse the cell and release GABA into the environment.:::2021
