DNHS_SanDiego_CA:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Vigilantly Optimizing Cancer Detection: Using E. coli to detect volatile organic compounds in the breath:::Lung cancer remains the deadliest cancer type, and is often undetected until stages 3 or 4, when it becomes difficult to treat [1]. W decided to investigate a noninvasive method: VOC (volatile organic compound) detection using a breath test. Our goal is to use the K-12 strain of E. coli bacteria that will produce a quantifiable color change in response to the presence of a VOC. Using published research, we identified a set of VOCs whose concentration in the breath is higher in lung cancer patients: propanol, trimethylbenzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene, hexanal, acetone, and isoprene [2]. We will insert promoters that are induced by these VOCs into plasmids and a GFP gene that will produce a color change, transforming E. coli with these plasmids. This product would be implemented as a test that could use one breath sample to detect the levels of 8 separate VOCs. 1. https://www.cancer.org/cancer/lung-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/how-diagnosed.html 2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6044508/:::2021
