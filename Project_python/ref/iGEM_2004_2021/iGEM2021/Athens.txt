Athens:::Europe:::Greece:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AdAPTED: Augmenting dNTPs And Polymerase Through Enzymatic Design:::Nucleic acid amplification (NAA) techniques, such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), are a standard biological laboratory technique, also used for diagnostics. The aim of this project is to make NAA techniques more accessible. Two of the key components of PCR are a polymerase and the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). However, the total cost of dNTPsâ€™ production is significant and they are often produced by complicated, unsustainable chemical processes, mainly feasible in centralized laboratories with expensive equipment. For this project, a high yield genetic circuit is designed in order to produce ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and thymidylate synthase (TSase), two enzymes necessary for the production of dNTPs. The produced dNTPs, along with thermostable Pfu DNA Polymerase, also included in the designed genetic circuit, allow for a low-cost PCR, with components not requiring cold storage. This procedure allows for an alternative approach for the production of basic PCR reagents.:::2021
