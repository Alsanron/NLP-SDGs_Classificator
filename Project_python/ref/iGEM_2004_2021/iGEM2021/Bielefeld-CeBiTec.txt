Plant-based Ligand Activated Noxious agent Tracker - make the invisible visible:::As an invisible threat to the environment and human life, remnants of chemical weapons from both world wars still contaminate the soil. In Germany alone, there are over 200 suspected locations. We develop a plant-based detection system for degradation products of chemical weapons that is highly specific and allows cost-efficient screening of large areas while being easy to use. Our plant indicates the presence of toxic chemicals by changing its color to red. For this, we introduce two new reporter systems called RUBY and ANTHOS, enabling the synthesis of the plant pigments betalains or anthocyanins, respectively. If the chemical is present, it is specifically bound by a receptor, which then activates a signaling cascade, resulting in the synthesis of the pigments. Both computational design and site-directed mutagenesis are used to design new receptor proteins. In the future, our plant allows the detection of further chemicals by replacing the specific receptor.:::2021
