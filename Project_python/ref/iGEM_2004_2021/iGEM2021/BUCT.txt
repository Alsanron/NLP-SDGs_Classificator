Focusing on two grand challenges: overwork-induced obesity and anxiety, as they reflect disorders in both gastrointestinal and nervous systems, we based our approach on the current theories of the ‘brain-gut axis’. *E. coli* Nissle 1917 was used as a chassis with enhanced capacity of β-oxidation of fatty acid, thereby increasing fatty acids consumption from diets to facilitate weight loss. Meanwhile, with a synthetic biology thinking, GABA and 5-HTP with anxiety-relieving effects were synthesized from the catabolic products of fatty acids in our engineered bacteria.:::2021
