Tongji_Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Phage-MAP:::Phage therapy has become one of the most promising alternatives to antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial diseases, and identifying phage-host interactions helps to understand the possible mechanism through which a phage infects bacteria to guide the development of phage therapy. Compared with wet experiments, computational methods of identifying phage-host interactions can reduce costs and save time and are more effective and economic. Through two methods, alignment-based and alignment-free, our team attempted to find accurate Phage-bacteria interactions, contributing to phage therapy, and further contributing to the application of phage as a model organism in synthetic biology.:::2021
