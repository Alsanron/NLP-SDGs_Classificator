RDFZ-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Killer-X:::The bacteria Xanthomonas has caused agricultural diseases worldwide. Meanwhile, the use of traditional pesticides and antibiotics is causing problems including antimicrobial resistance and social ethical issues. Therefore, we seek to find out an alternative way to treat microbial plant diseases. Through research, we found that phage therapy can be useful towards infectious diseases. However, storage difficulties and limited functional time result in the phage therapy's low popularity. Due to these problems, we intend to use synthetic biology technologies and phage delivery bacteria to develop a more efficient phage therapy towards Xanthomonas diseases.:::2021
