UBrawijaya:::Asia:::Indonesia:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Clean Harvest of Overexpressed Protein System:::Indonesia is struggling to independently meet industrial enzyme demands despite efforts to develop cheaper technologies to produce them. Although various enzyme overexpression systems are available, the cost of purification remains a major obstacle. To help address this, we propose the Clean Harvest of Overexpressed Protein (CHOP) system. The system works by anchoring an enzyme of interest (EoI) onto the extracellular terminals of an outer membrane protein (OMP). As the cells grow, they will naturally shed their outer membrane as vesicles (OMV) containing OMP-EoI fusion. Due to OMVs being smaller than cells yet larger than free proteins, they can be separated from the bulk of protein impurities, simplifying the downstream processing. Once separated, the EoI may be released from the OMP by cleaving off a specific linker between the fusion with specific proteases. The development of overexpression systems that simplify downstream purification is expected to significantly reduce enzyme production costs.:::2021
