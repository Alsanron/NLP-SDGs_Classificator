NNU-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Construction of the BL21 (DE3)-derived variant strains library to rapidly improve the antimicrobial peptides production:::With the overuse of antibiotics, more and more antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains have emerged. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered the promising alternatives to antibiotics. Escherichia coli is the extensively used host for the production of AMPs. However, the expression of AMPs genes is low due to the toxicity of the AMPs. In order to improve the production of various AMPs, the BL21 (DE3)-derived variant strains library with different RBS sequence of T7RNAP was constructed by base editor and CRISPR-Cas9, respectively. Excitingly, the CRISPR-Cas9 system enables to obtain 87.5% of the theoretical values variants in a single editing. Furthermore, the high throughput host screening platform for AMPs production was built, and it takes only 3 days to get the best expression host for certain AMPs production. As proof-of-concept, the production of ten hard-to-express AMPs were greatly improved. We aim to protect the human health and environment by reducing the abuse of antibiotics.:::2021
