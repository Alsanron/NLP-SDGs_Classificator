ShanghaiTech_China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mussel Inspired Biocompatible Osteogenic Material(MIBOM):::This year, we decided to challenge the comminuted fractures and develop a new strategy for bone repair. We get inspiration from mussels, a creature that can adhere tightly to reefs through mussel protein in aqueous environment, and we designed a new biocompatible osteogenic glue. We designed adhesion, hydrogel, regulation and drug systems to make it a qualified osteogenic material. The adhesion system is based on mussel protein, which provides the adhesive ability in aqueous environment. The hydrogel system is designed to provide structural strength and UV-induced mechanism makes it friendly to clinicians. The regulation system is based on cells, we construct a Piezo1-based pathway to make cells sense the stress during the bone growth and secret enzymes to degrade the hydrogel, and then drugs mixed in the gel are released. We name it MIBOM, Mussel Inspired Biocompatible Osteogenic Material.:::2021
