Mingdao:::Asia:::Taiwan:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::deSALMONEtor â€“ a phage-based Salmonella detector:::Designer phage is a synthetic programmable bacteriophage utilized in diagnosis, vaccine, drug delivery in medicine. Salmonella spp. are a leading cause of food poisoning. Phage typing is a traditional method for characterizing distinct bacterial strains through specific recognition. Phage reporters have been genetically equipped with GFP or luciferase gene and applied in detecting Salmonella in contaminated food. However, the limitation and challenges still hinder its application to routine sample examination. In our project, we have created a Salmonella detector by introducing phi29 DNA polymerase gene into an isolated Salmonella phage genome through in vitro Tol2 transposon system. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) will be triggered in the presence of phi29 DNA polymerase generated by the reporter phage-infected Salmonella cells. The RCA products can be easily measured with a DNA-binding dye. Implementation in mathematical modeling and hardware design will help to understand the potential use in the real world.:::2021
