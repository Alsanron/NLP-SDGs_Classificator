RHS-Calgary:::North America:::Canada:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::GlucoLitter: A colorimetric biosensor for detecting glucose in feline urine:::The purpose of our project is to address the issue of effectively revealing signs of feline diabetes, as current solutions are often limited and time-consuming. Our primary goal was to produce a biosensor that creates a purple pigment in the presence of elevated levels of glucose which will act as an indication of feline diabetes. A reaction will occur between the glucose in a cat's urine and oxygen, catalyzed by glucose oxidase. This will produce hydrogen peroxide, which will react with a colorimetric assay to produce a color change. Through synthetic biology principles, we aim to apply our biosensor to provide cat owners with an early detection method for feline diabetes and other conditions.:::2021
