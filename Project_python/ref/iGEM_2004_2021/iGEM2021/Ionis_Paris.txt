Ionis_Paris:::Europe:::France:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cobatect:::Vitamin B12 (VB12) deficiency is a common and prevalent condition which can engender neurological and hematological abnormalities. However, current measurements of VB12 level are usually erratic and lack sensitivity. Here, we offer a portable and easy-to-use bioelectronic sensor for assessing the VB12 level in the blood. This home health monitoring device is similar to those that evaluate blood sugar level, with finger-prick testing. Our biosensor uses a modified bacterial co-culture to produce electricity in the presence of VB12. More specifically, a genetically modified Escherichia coli carries a vitamin B12 riboswitch which controls the biosynthesis of lactate. The latter is subsequently metabolized by Shewanella oneidensis to produce a reducing potential. Shewanella oneidensis has the prodigious ability to reduce metal ions, so when it is in contact with an anode it is possible to create electricity. Your B12 levels needs to be kept in check?
