Toulouse_INSA-UPS:::Europe:::France:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Elixio, a synthetic microbial consortium for sustainable violet fragrances:::Perfumes influence perception in our daily life. Behind flowers and chic clichés, perfume reality is not so glamorous as most are issued from non-sustainable processes. This is especially true for scents impossible to extract from the so-called “mute flowers” like the violet. Our Elixio project aims to demonstrate that valuable fragrances could be easily recreated using synthetic biology, even by a small team of students. We designed a synthetic consortium involving engineered cyanobacterium and yeast and allowing a sustainable production of the violet scent molecules from atmospheric CO2. Over the summer, we successfully engineered both strains to conditionally express all the enzymes necessary to recreate the violet fragrance. Moreover, we demonstrated the production of ionones by our yeast which actually smells like violet! The Elixio project has already drawn attention from the industry and we are definitely proud of the new openings created between iGEM and the world of perfume.:::2021
