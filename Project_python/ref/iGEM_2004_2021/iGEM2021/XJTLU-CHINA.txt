XJTLU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Dr. Phage:::In summary, our project aims to quantitatively detect the bacterial pathogens in food by using the edited assembly-deficient phage to target and lyse the bacteria, and then release the exogenous protein LuxR; the released LuxR can then activate downstream cell-free gene circuit and generate visual signals. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is applied to disrupt gp24 gene, an essential gene for T4 phage assembly, with LuxR gene to produce LuxR as signalling molecules for downstream system activation and prevent phage assembly at the same time. The assembly-deficient phage cannot therefore replicate in the host cells more than one generation. The downstream circuit outputs binary signals indicating whether the concentration of bacteria exceeds the national standard or not: if the concentration of the target bacteria is higher than the standard, the system will output a visual signal, otherwise, the signal will not be displayed.:::2021
