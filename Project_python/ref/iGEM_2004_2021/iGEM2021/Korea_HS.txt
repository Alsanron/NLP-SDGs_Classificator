Korea_HS:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Designing a Cancer-Specific Cell-Penetrating Peptide for the Efficient Delivery of siRNA into Cancer Cells:::siRNA is a potent therapeutic agent because of its specificity and efficiency suppressing genes overexpressed during pathogenesis. However, due to lack of cell type-specific and safe delivery methods, it shows limited success in cancer treatment. Therefore, we aim to design CPP which forms a siRNA/CPP complex targeting neoplasia. Two engineered CPP based on buforin IIB - MV1 (-RLLR) and MV2 (-RLLRRLLR) - were tested. Among three types of CPPs, MV1 displayed highest specificity for A549 (cancerous). Next, our goal was to enhance the anticancer efficacy of doxorubicin (chemotherapy drug) mediated by MV1/siRNA complex. Since CYP1A1 is upregulated in doxorubicin-resistant cancer cells, siRNA was designed to target CYP1A1. Our result showed that MV1/siRNA complex efficiently suppressed CYP1A1 gene expression. Finally, MV1-DOX/siRNA complex increased anticancer efficacy of doxorubicin in A549, while showing minimal cell death on MRC5. Overall, results suggest MV1 could deliver antineoplastics and siRNA to improve anticancer efficacy.:::2021
