THIS-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Dental Plague Detection:::Dental plaque is an ecological environment in which bacteria grow, reproduce, decay, and carry out a series of metabolic activities. In this project, an E. coli biosensor is built to activate the phosphorylation of ComE membrane protein and ComD protein in sensor cells and activate the downstream CotA gene to cause color degradation. At the same time, we also try out different chromoproteins that directly produce the color and enable instrument-free detection. This sensor cell uses short-length peptide CSP secreted by Streptococcus mutans as a signal to detect the amount of S. mutans in the patient's mouth. To demonstrate this, contactless cell-free system hardware is designed, which the customers can use the oral rinse to collect the sample and put into our hardware to see the color is shown. The product will therefore be portable and reasonably priced, allowing more customers to have the ability and willingness to purchase.:::2021
