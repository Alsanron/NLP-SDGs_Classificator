CSU_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Sweet Guard:::Our project aims to find a new method of treating type 1 diabetes with the help of synthetic biology. Our engineered cells will be implanted subcutaneously by mature embedding technology.When the cells meet two conditions , hyperglycemia and shinning blue light, they are able to secrete insulin and make the levels ofblood sugar become lower until it gets back to normal level. However, when the level of insulin is highï¼ŒInsulin molecule will be combined with insulin receptor and the signal would be activated by it. Then, miRNA will be expressed and inhibit the expression of insulin. Meanwhile, because of Tet-off system, we can use tetracycline to force the loop to stop, in order to improve the safety of our design.:::2021
