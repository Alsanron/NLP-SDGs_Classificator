MADRID_UCM:::Europe:::Spain:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::4C_Fuels: Cyanobacterial Cyclic Carbon Capture (for sustainable bioFuel production):::We will use cyanobacteria as living catalysts for light-driven direct carbon dioxide conversion to valuable products, upgrading the conventional biomass-based biorefineries. To do so, we will engineer the newly discovered Synechococcus PCC11801. A robust fast-growing cyanobacteria for direct sun to chemicals production. Our goal is to test the potential of photosynthetical chemical manufacturing producing n-butanol; an ideal biofuel and comodity chemical. We are implementing an artificial n-butanol biosynthetic pathway, an synthetic pathway for enhanced carbon fixation towards acetyl-CoA as central metabollite and genetic modifications for enhanced solvent tolerance. In addition we will explore cyanobacterial encapsulation in nano-structured biohybrid materials, while performing an insight into the requirements for the industrial scale-up of photobiocatalytic technology. Likewise, we will develop tools for easing cyanobacteria genetic engineering. We will develop a software for neutral integration sites identification. Also a recombination-based system for the easy generation of unmarked mutants will be developed.:::2021
