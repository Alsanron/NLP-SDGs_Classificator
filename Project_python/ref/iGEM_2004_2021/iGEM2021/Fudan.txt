Fudan:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Candicamera:::Candida albicans cause diseases as vaginal infections, affecting up to 75% of women. However, current detection methods are either professional, time-consuming, inaccurate, or expensive. We have develop "Candicamera", a product that allows rapid detection of Candida albicans in resource-limited settings and for point-of-care analysis. By applying loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) combined with lateral flow assay (LFA), our detection method is accurate, fast and independent of expensive equipments. Besides, We designed gene circuits using new iGEM Registry parts gp2 and gp5.7 which reduce the background protein production of engineering bacteria and specifically produce the enzyme entailed in detection so that the cost can be reduced tremendously, thus providing access for women in resource-limited areas to routinely perform the test. We carried out extensive human practices to bring forward our project as well as synthetic biology into people.:::2021
