WFLA_YK_PAO:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::PEToracity: Intestinal probiotics to digest microplastics:::PET is a clear, strong, and lightweight plastic that is widely used for packaging foods and beverages. Because microplastics are not digested by living organisms, they will be accumulated inside human body, causing uncertain harm. Actually, chemical traces of plastic particles have been found in human organs and tissue. Therefore, we focus on the constrcution of the genetically engineer probiotics to produce the IsPETase and MHETase, two enzymes that could break down PET and degrade the micro-plastics in the human digestive tract.:::2021
