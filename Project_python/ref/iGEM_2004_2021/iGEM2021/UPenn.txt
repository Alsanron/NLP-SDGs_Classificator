UPenn:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering the OptoReader: a device for high-throughout optical stimulation, measurement, and feedback in microwell plates:::Optogenetic tools allow for unprecedented dynamic control, immediacy, and reversibility of metabolic processes. However, there lacks methods to stimulate and monitor optogenetically-responsive samples simultaneously in a high-throughput manner. We developed the OptoReader to address this gap. The OptoReader is an affordable, open-source device that couples optogenetic stimulation with real-time fluorescence and optical density measurements, allowing for 96 programmable parallel experiments. It consists of two circuit boards. The stimulation assembly is a modified optoPlate-96. The reader assembly is an array of photodiodes and UV LEDs compatible with a standard 96-well plate. Arduino microcontrollers control both circuit boards to communicate with a general computer and each other. We demonstrate OptoReader measurement of OD and fluorescence in bacterial cultures and show how OD readings can be used for feedback controlled optogenetic stimulation parameters. We expect that the OptoReader will enable entirely new optogenetic experiments with impact in both basic and applied sciences.:::2021
