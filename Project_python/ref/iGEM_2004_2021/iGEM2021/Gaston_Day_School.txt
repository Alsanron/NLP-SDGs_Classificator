Gaston_Day_School:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Risk of Bacteriophage-mediated Lateral Transfer in the Environment:::Bacteriophages exist in both natural and artificial environments and are able to transfer DNA from one type of bacteria to another. Bacteria, such as E.coli, released from synthetic biology labs may be infected by certain bacteriophages and the antibiotic resistance transferred to other bacteria leading to biosafety issues. To better understand this problem, we will assess the potential risk of lateral transfer of E. coli plasmids by T4 bacteriophages under different conditions. We have shown that T4 can transfer plasmid DNA, which does increase the risk of lateral transfer. However, the number of E. coli phages present in our local environment appears to be quite low, reducing the risk. We added four new T4 early promoters to the registry to support our project. Additionally, our team focuses on providing students who have visual and motor challenges a way to measure liquids through 3-D printing.:::2021
