Washington:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RhizoMet:::Although centuries of technological advances in manufacturing and industry have improved humanityâ€™s standard of living, they have often come at the expense of environmental well-being. The industry of mining, smelting, and refining heavy metals often leaves behind hazardous waste in the soil and air. Our project, RhizoMet, addresses these toxic levels of arsenic in soil through the use of bioremediation. As our proposed proof of concept, we plan to test the binding efficacy and specificity of our modified metallothionein proteins to arsenic. To accomplish this, metal tolerance and accumulation assays were performed on E.coli overexpressing these proteins. Given an effective model, we plan to incorporate these E.coli into the roots of Lomatium triternatum and other RhizoMet plants, remediating arsenic-polluted areas like those around metal smelteries. Through future iterations of our RhizoMet plant-E.coli system, we hope to expand the impact of this bioremediation method for areas like Northport and beyond.:::2021
