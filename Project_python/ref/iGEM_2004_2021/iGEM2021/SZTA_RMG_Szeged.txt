SZTA_RMG_Szeged:::Europe:::Hungary:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Developing a novel, inexpensive method to detect small RNAs in biological samples:::Our team aims to create an entirely new way of RNA detection. This method can serve as an alternative for the expensive rtPCR method in miRNA- or other small RNA-detection in research or medicine. We collaborated with GPs and researchers. The method is based on a unique idea of RNA amplification loop. We use magnetic beads coated with single-stranded probe DNAs on which the target RNA acts as a primer for second-strand synthesis. The resulted dsDNA is the starting point of a transcription process in the same medium. The newly synthesised RNAs start the process again and again, thus producing a high amount of dsDNA detected by increasing SYBR Green fluorescence. We calibrated a simple fluorimeter and proposed a self-designed and 3D-printed adaptor for PCR tubes as inexpensive hardware for qualitative analysis. A software tool was also developed to create appropriate DNA-probe sequences for any small RNAs.:::2021
