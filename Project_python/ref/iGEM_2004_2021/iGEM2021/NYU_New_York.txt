NYU_New_York:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Flutec - Influenza Diagnostic Test:::The NYU iGEM team is currently developing an affordable, portable, paper-based diagnostic device for the influenza A strain using novel techniques such as toehold switches that can be performed at home without the need for expensive laboratory equipment. Research done over the past year revealed the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare staff and services, as well as the need for expanded home testing options for common illnesses. As a response to this need, our device creates a simple method to detect influenza A with a saliva sample that can be easily distributed to aid local and global public health efforts by increasing access to care.:::2021
