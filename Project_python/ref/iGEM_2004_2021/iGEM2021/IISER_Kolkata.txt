IISER_Kolkata:::Asia:::India:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::naMOOste - A novel solution to the problem of Subclinical Bovine Mastitis in dairy industry:::Subclinical Bovine mastitis is a ubiquitous problem in the dairy industry. Clinical stages of this are associated with inflammation of the bovine mammary-parenchyma tissue following pathogenic infection. Whereas the early subclinical stage has invisible symptoms - making it difficult to detect and cure. Present detection techniques are either expensive, inaccessible, or time-consuming, and current treatment methods use antibiotics leading to the development of AMR in causative pathogens resulting in a lot of harm. Our team aims to develop an antibiotic-free treatment method along with a real-time cheap, colourimetric detection kit which when used at regular intervals will detect subclinical stage from milk samples. Early detection complemented with better treatment methods and hygiene maintenance can reduce the rate of disease progression. The team engaged in learning real-world problems faced by stakeholders due to bovine mastitis - tried to mitigate those in our project and spread awareness about preventing its transmission.:::2021
