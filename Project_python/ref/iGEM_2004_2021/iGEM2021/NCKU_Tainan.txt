NCKU_Tainan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MenTAUR - Your Life’s Mentor.:::Mental health disorders, especially chronic stress-induced depression (CSID), have heavily impacted the lives of many. During the COVID-19 pandemic, humanity has been under more irregularity, and currently, 25% of the global population is highly stressed out. To alleviate mental dysregulations caused by aggregating stress, iGEM NCKU_Tainan invented “MenTAUR”, a revolutionary solution to CSID. MenTAUR consists of two components: Menbles and f(int). Menbles are edible Taiwanese bubbles containing E. coli Nissle 1917 that can autoregulate the production of taurine, a well-known neuroprotective agent, in the intestine by sensing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which are of higher levels in stressed-induced depressive patients. f(int) is a microfluidic chip that simulates the intestinal environment where the auto-production of taurine occurs, allowing us to model the metabolism of Menbles. iGEM NCKU_Tainan believes that MenTAUR, as your life’s mentor, serves as guidance on your journey to a stress-free world.:::2021
