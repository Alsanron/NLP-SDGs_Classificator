OUC-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ALLPASs(Amplifying Low-leakage Platform for Antibiotic Sensors):::Due to the large-scale abuse of antibiotics, the environmental pollution and food residues caused by antibiotics have posed a great threat to the ecological environment and human health. Therefore, this project aims to design a series of whole cell biosensors (WCBs) to detect three kinds of common antibiotics.. To break through the common limitations of WCBs, a fluorescent RNA aptamer is used as the output signal to increase the response speed, and it is hoped that the signal-noise ratio and dynamic range of the sensor can be improved by the NIMPLY logic gate gene circuit composed of CRISPRi and strand replacement reactions.:::2021
