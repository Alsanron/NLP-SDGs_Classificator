Little Odor Killer:::Since the implementation of household garbage sorting regulations in Shanghai, the amount of food waste has reached a peak. However, problems caused by odor like unpleasant smell and health problems, have aroused great attention everywhere. This year, Tongji China launches the "LOOK!" project to solve the problem. We construct two kinds of bioengineered E.coli to absorb hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, which are the two main ingredients in the odor. One uses enzymes related to sulfide oxidazation(Sqr, Sdo, AprBA and Sat), converting hydrogen sulfide to sulfate, while the other uses enzymes AMO, HAO and NOD to convert ammonia to nitrate. Besides, a three-gear adjustable kill switch based on the concentration of H2S and NH3 is added to ensure biosafety. Also, we optimize our pathway by high throughput screening and machine learning. With such efforts, we hope to solve the problems the odor brought to people and downstream industries.:::2021
