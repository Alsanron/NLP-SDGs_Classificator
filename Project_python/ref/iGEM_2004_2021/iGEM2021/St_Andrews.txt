St_Andrews:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Overproduction of Shinorine (a UV-Protecting Molecule) and its Potential Application to Probiotic Sunscreens:::Chemical toxins such as octinoxate and oxybenzone, found in many commercially-available sunscreens, contribute to coral reef degradation. To combat this problem, a solution was designed whereby Shinorine, a natural, UV-protecting compound could be synthetically overproduced by probiotic Nissle 1917 E. coli - these bacteria would be combined with a lotion containing a carbon-rich nutrient medium, creating a sustainable, ocean-friendly sunscreen alternative that could be applied directly onto the skin. The aim during the Phase II stage was to clone constitutive genes into plasmids, transform these into BL21 E. coli cells, and finally test for the expression of the enzymes of the Shinorine-producing pathway. ATPG, the initial gene in the Shinorine-producing pathway, was successfully cloned into the pETDuet-1 plasmid, however cloning the other three genes into their plasmids proved difficult. To conclude, it was shown that ATPG can be successfully cloned into the pETDuet-1 plasmid via Gibson assembly.:::2021
