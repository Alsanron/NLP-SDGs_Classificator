Purdue:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Argonaute Mediated Viral Point of Care Diagnostic Device:::The COVID-19 pandemic has strained global diagnostic capacities and highlighted the limitations of conventional lab-based assays. Current on-site kits have false-negative rates as high as 33%. In an effort to provide accurate, non-invasive, affordable, and rapid Point of Care(POC) diagnostic tests for COVID-19 and other emerging pandemics, Purdue iGEM since the summer of 2020 has been working on cArgo: an Argonaute mediated microfluidic viral diagnostic device. cArgo extracts viral RNA from saliva for amplification and conversion into dsDNA. The TtAgo Argonaute protein then cleaves the dsDNA using viral strain-specific DNA guides producing ssDNA fragments. These fragments serve as secondary guides allowing the Argonaute to cleave the molecular beacon emitting a quantifiable fluorescent signal for conclusive result determination. Coupling the biologics with chip barcoding and app integration, we hope to revolutionize POC Diagnostics while making data more accessible for simultaneous detection and contact tracing.:::2021
