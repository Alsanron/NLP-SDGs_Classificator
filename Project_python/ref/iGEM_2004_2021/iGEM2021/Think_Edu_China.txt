While, conventional methods to degrade antibiotics like high temperature composting, fermentation and microbial degradation had relatively low efficiency and high costs. More effective methods are urgently needed to cease this global issue. Our group had invest in the field and found out that the whole Cell Biocatalyst Ecn-IL, which is renowned for its practicability, strong stability and low-resources demand, can be a favorable solution to the mentioned issue. Firstly, the utilization of the Ecn-Il can effectively avoid the accumulation of the antibiotics in animals. Without the mountainous usages of antibiotics, the tolerability can be largely reduced, thus the formation of the super-bacteria can also be avoided. With the technology of cell surface display (EcN-IL), the Laccase gene lacc6 be displayed on the surface of Probiotic Escherichia coli, Nissle 1917 (EcN), can be used to degrade antibiotics residues.:::2021
