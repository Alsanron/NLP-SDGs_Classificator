Tuebingen:::Europe:::Germany:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ATHELAS: A modular screening platform for stabilized antimicrobial peptides expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana:::Antimicrobial resistance is one of the ten most severe global health threats to humanity, according to the WHO. Pathogenic bacteria are constantly acquiring resistance to further antibiotics, leading to the emergence of multi-drug-resistant and therefore untreatable strains with the drugs available. A class of new potential antibacterial drugs are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are part of the innate immune response of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, the medical applicability of unmodified AMPs is limited by their low in vivo stability. Therefore, we invented ATHELAS: an AMP-thioknot herbal expression and low effort activity screening platform. In our project, we use highly stable cyclic peptides from plants called cyclotides as a scaffold to stabilize AMPs. We developed a convenient platform to screen the properties of arbitrary stabilized peptides. Our platform includes an array of fast cloning, transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, efficient extraction and purification, and antibacterial activity testing.:::2021
