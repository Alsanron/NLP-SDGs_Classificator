HKBU:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Ostamer: Tackling Osteogenesis Imperfecta:::Osteogenesis imperfecta is a group of genetic disorders that results in brittle bones due to improper collagen formation. In osteoblasts of OI patients, the Wnt signalling pathway is inhibited by sclerostin via binding to LRP5/6 co-receptors, thus lowering beta-catenin concentrations, gene expression and thus bone formation. Suppressing sclerostin by a sclerostin antibody has been shown to enhance bone mass and bone strength. However, in phase III clinical trials, the antibody also imposes severe cardiac ischemic events and worsen cardiovascular diseases in OI patients. Ostamer, our therapeutic aptamer, tackles this development via selectively binding and inhibiting loop3 of sclerostin in order to prevent sclerostin from binding to the osteoblast receptors for treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta, as well as to preserve sclerostin's secondary role as a cardiovascular regulator. Our Ostamer has received US FDA Orphan Drug Designation in 2019 in response to successful clinical testing on OI mice.:::2021
