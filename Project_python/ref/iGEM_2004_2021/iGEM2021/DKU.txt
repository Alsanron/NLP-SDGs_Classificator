DKU:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::“Cyano Killer”: Biological control of cyanobacterial blooms:::Harmful algal blooms have been a severe environmental issue threatening water quality and habitat. Efforts have been made through physical and chemical methods, but with little influence. Biological methods might be more efficient and eco-friendlier. We produce and deliver algicidal polypeptides with E. coli as the agent. The polypeptide works by penetrating cyanobacteria, which triggers cell aggregation and division. The physical delivery unit is designed using mathematical modelling. It is a floating unit with adequate mobility and precise targeting that releases the drug at a controlled rate. For human practices, we asked for advice from algicidal companies and bureaus. We also made efforts in spreading environmental awareness, especially by presenting our iGEM project at the School Club Fair and publicizing our discovery through the DKU MediHealth podcast.:::2021
