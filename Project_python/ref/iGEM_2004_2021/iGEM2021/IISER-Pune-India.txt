IISER-Pune-India:::Asia:::India:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SynBactory - Recycling carbon dioxide for biomanufacturing using a co-culture of cyanobacteria and E. coli:::Fossil fuels are the primary contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, making chemical synthesis based on petrochemical feedstocks unsustainable. Photoautotrophic microbial biomass is a promising alternative to produce renewable carbon feedstocks for chemical synthesis. We have cultured previously engineered cyanobacteria, S. elongatus UTEX 2973, which can recycle carbon dioxide as secreted sucrose. Parallelly, we have engineered butanol-producing E. coli KJK01 to consume sucrose as a carbon source. Growing the two organisms together in a co-culture would allow for a sustainable, single-step, single-pot conversion of carbon dioxide into biobutanol. Our in silico models probed the stability and dynamics of the co-culture system to identify optimal conditions for the production of butanol. We used genome-scale metabolic models to identify key gene deletion and overexpression targets to improve butanol and sucrose yields. Furthermore, we designed constructs to characterise the strengths of native promoters to boost sucrose secretion in cyanobacteria.:::2021
