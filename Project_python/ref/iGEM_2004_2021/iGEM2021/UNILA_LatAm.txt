UNILA_LatAm:::Latin America:::Brazil:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioPank - A paratransgenic platform for control of Leishmania transmission:::Project BioPank is in honor of Pank, a little dog rescued from the streets that had her life shortened by complications from Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). VL is a neglected tropical zoonosis that affects humans and other animals and has been growing in the region of Foz do Igua√ßu and the triple border (Brazil, Paraguay and, Argentina). The SynFronteras team (UNILA_LatAm) will develop a strategy to stop VL transmission by improving the paratransgenesis technique with synthetic biology. We will engineer a Bacillus subtilis to produce an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) inside the midgut of the vector, preventing the parasite from developing, without killing the sandfly. Because of its antibacterial effects, the AMP with leishmanicidal activity DRS-N1, will be produced in its non-activated form and then, activated by enzymes present in the sandfly midgut.:::2021
