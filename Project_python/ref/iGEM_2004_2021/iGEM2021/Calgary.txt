Calgary:::North America:::Canada:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Neocycle: The development of novel REE extraction, recovery, and measurement methods from electronic waste:::Rare earth elements (REEs) possess unique physical and chemical properties that make them an essential component of many everyday technologies, such as cellphones, televisions, and automobiles. Presently, REEs are not mined sustainably, and current trends indicate that an alternate source is critical to avoid a period of REE scarcity. Neocycle is a system that works to selectively recover REEs from an underutilized source, electronic waste. First, REE extraction is necessary through the process of bioleaching, where the acid-producing organisms Gluconobacter oxydans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, solubilize the electronic waste feedstock. Next, REEs are recovered from the e-waste leachate through the use of the novel lanthanide-ion binding protein, lanmodulin, in an adsorption column system. Finally, the recovered REE ions are measured using one of three novel measurement systems, which are based on lanmodulin fusion proteins. Through this pipeline, Neocycle aims to provide a sustainable and more accessible source of REEs.:::2021
