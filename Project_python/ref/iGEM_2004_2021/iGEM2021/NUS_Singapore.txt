NUS_Singapore:::Asia:::Singapore:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Photo-Regulated Yeast for Synthetic Biology Manufacturing (PRYSM):::COVID-19 has disrupted global food supply chains, exposing the fragility of Singaporeâ€™s food supply chains, of which 98% of food is imported. As Singapore moves to accomplish the national goal of locally producing 30% of its food consumption by 2030, the demand for suitable pest control in the ever-increasing number of farms will surge. Synthetic pesticides are still considered the gold standard in pest control. However, concerns with the negative environmental/health effects of synthetic pesticides limits their use. Biological antimicrobial peptides have been identified as potential substitutes, however, with current Bioproduction methods it is economically infeasible to produce such compounds for use as bio-pesticides. This project aims to produce Human Beta Defensin (as an exemplar) using a more cost effective approach for use as a bio-bactericide/fungicide at the farms. This is achieved through the development an optogenetically controlled yeast chassis and an open-source bioreactor designed for the chassis.:::2021
