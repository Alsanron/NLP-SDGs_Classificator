Studies point to about 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic floating in our oceans, and our society is only now beginning to grasp the extent of the health risks associated with microplastic consumption. All these concerns led us to develop P(L)AST, a simple solution to battle this ongoing crisis. By transforming Bacillus subtilis with the Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degradation pathway present in Ideonella sakaiensis, we aimed to create an efficient, versatile, and easy to deploy plastic degradation platform â€“ qualities further improved through our metabolic optimization models. P(L)AST is also a project concerned with social impact; as such, we spent a portion of our resources inspiring the younger generations and educating the masses by organizing, promoting, and participating in events related with the environment, sustainability, and science.:::2021
