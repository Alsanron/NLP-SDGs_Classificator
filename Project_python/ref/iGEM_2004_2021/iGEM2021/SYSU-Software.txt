SYSU-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Phoebus:::Currently, there lack of approaches to precisely control the bio-chemical process in target cells. Non-neural optogenetics is promising, but there is no universal workflow for designing a fusion protein. So we present a new workflow for designing the so-called “opto-controllable elements” which is build with three basic parts: opto-switch, linker, and target protein, and build a software platform to automatically perform this workflow. The core module of our software is called opto-controllable elements designer, it has a database that collect detailed information about natural opto-switches, a linker database, a structure predict algorithm, and a protein activity evaluator. Theoretically, with opto-controllable element designer, every bio-chemical process can be controlled with light. We also build two supplementary modules based on the core module, one for controlling cascade reaction rate with light, and one for controlling gene expression level with light.:::2021
