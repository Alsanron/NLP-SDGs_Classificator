Lubbock_TTU:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ChiSPY: a Chitin-Sensing Pathway for the novel detection of chytridiomycosis in amphibians:::The global chytridiomycosis pandemic caused by fungi, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salmandoris (Bsal), is responsible for the decline and extinction of many amphibian species. Standard in-field detection methods such as MicPCR and MinION sequence internal transcribed spacer regions from swabs of epithelial cells to indicate the presence of fungal zoospores. However, these methods are expensive, time-consuming, and result in varying infection intensity across Bd strains. To address these concerns, we developed a microbial biosensor by engineering E. coli to express the chitin-activated V. cholerae one-component system coupled with a GFP reporter. Diverging from traditional detection methods that indicate zoospore presence, chitin in the cell walls of fungal zoosporangia will serve as the biomarker to indicate infection. This novel biosensor will provide field ecologists with an accessible alternative method to conduct preliminary site testing.:::2021
