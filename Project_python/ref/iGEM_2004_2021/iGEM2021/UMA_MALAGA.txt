For every single litre of waste cooking oil (WCO) spilled, more than 1,000 litres of water are polluted. While classic recycling is unattractive, synthetic biology is a powerful tool in order to change this view and attract people to the new paradigm of a circular bioeconomy. To do so, we aim to expand the molecular toolbox of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica for developing a bioprocess that creates value from waste. This microorganism stands out due to its ability to use oleaginous substrates to grow. First, we are implementing the full carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in this chassis. Besides, we are optimizing the stock of WCO as its carbon and energy source to produce sustainable paints based on these carotenoids pigments. Finally, we will improve the extraction of pigments and preparation of bio-paints for scaling-up.:::2021
