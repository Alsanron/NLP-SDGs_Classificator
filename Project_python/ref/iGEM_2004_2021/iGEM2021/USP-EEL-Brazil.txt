USP-EEL-Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Honorato:::Ophidic accidents are categorized as a neglected tropical disease by the World's Health Organization (WHO), which means that even though there is a high incidence of these accidents, they don't get enough attention. In Brazil, Bothrops is responsible for 85% of snake bites, with 20,6% resulting in necrosis, therefore our project is focused on producing a recombinant Î³PLI, a broad spectrum inhibitor for the treatment of ofidic accidents with the Bothrops genus. Our inhibitor aims to act against phospholipase A2, one of the main groups of enzymes present in the venom, responsible mainly for the necrosis that also has a synergyc effect with the other enzymes. The expectatives with our project is to provide to our community a faster and more accessible treatment, hence, reducing the sequels and death rate due to Bothrops ophidic accidents.:::2021
