Heidelberg:::Europe:::Germany:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::How to train your microbiome:::With our project, we try to lay the foundations for a new therapeutic approach to treat microbiome-associated diseases. The currently used treatment, FTM, represents a severe interference with the patients microbiome. Our method should be able to treat diseases without changing the composition of the microbiome by giving it new capabilities. We use the natural competency of specific bacteria to take up DNA from their environment. Our idea is to deliver transforming DNA into the intestine to be taken up by these bacteria. Our drylab team processes microbiome 16s rRNA data to find natural competent bacteria. In the laboratory, we performed natural transformation of Acinetobacter baylyi. Additionally we tested the efficiency of phenylalanine lyase and demonstrated that it degrades phenylalanine in gut microbiome related bacteria species. Furthermore, we discussed novel natural selection advantages because antibiotics are no possibility in a patient. Between certain sugar catabolism, beta-glucosidase was the most promising.:::2021
