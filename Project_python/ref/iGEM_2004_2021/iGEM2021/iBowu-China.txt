iBowu-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::GlycyrÎ²: synthesis of glycyrrhetinic acid:::Glycyrrhetinic Acid (GA) is an important herbal extract from the most widely used Chinese herbal medicine Licorice with applications both in the food and pharmaceutical industries. It is an approved effective medicine for peptic ulcers and has expectorant properties, and current research reported potential use for anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and in cancer treatments. The conventional extraction method using hydrolysis of glycyrrhizin (GL) suffers from high cost and high environmental pressure, which undermines its large-scale usage. Syn-bio pathways can potentially lower the cost, and are eco-friendly. Therefore, Team iBowu-China investigated synthetic methods using the enzyme beta-glucuronidase (bG) to hydrolyze GL into GA by experimenting with the coding sequence from different species. Our results indicate the enzyme can be stably produced with a good hydrolysis activity under proper conditions.:::2021
