Gifu:::Asia:::Japan:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Trans-cleavage endonuclease specific fatigue quantification system (TESTIFY ):::Japan has often been reported as a stress-filled society in recent years. However, many Japanese neglect the excessive stress that can cause depression and other problems. We assume this is due to the difficulty of quantitative measurement of stress and that patients cannot be diagnosed by appearance whether they are suffering or not. Human Herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) is a virus that infects 90% of humans in childhood and has the characteristic that it can remain latently in the human body for a lifetime. It has been reported that fatigue over a period of about a week reactivates the virus and is detected in saliva. Accordingly, we decided to create a system to quantify HHV-6 by using CRISPR based DETECTR assay (2018 Doudna et al.), based on our idea that the amount of the virus in saliva can be correlated with the stage of medium-term stress.:::2021
