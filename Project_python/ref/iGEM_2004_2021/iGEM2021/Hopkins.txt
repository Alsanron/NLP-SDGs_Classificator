Hopkins:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Symbiotic Bacterium Engineering for Treatment of Coral Disease:::Corals are threatened by human activity as they are the victims of rising ocean temperatures and habitat destruction. Certain species are also impacted by infection from pathogenic fungi—one fungus in particular, Aspergillus sydowii, can cause the “localized mass mortality” of Gorgonian corals, commonly known as sea fans (Kim and Rypien). Previous iGEM projects have approached the issue of coral bleaching with the aim of preserving corals. Our goal is to engineer bacteria to fight Aspergillus infection of corals with minimal impact on other aspects of the ecosystem. We plan to engineer symbiotic bacteria (Endozoicomonas euniceicola) common to the affected coral species (Gorgonia ventalina) to secrete antifungal peptides after detection of an infection. As part of our proposed implementation we have developed a quorum sensing cell death circuit to be used in conjunction with hydrogel beads. This project is supported by feedback from stakeholders including NOAA, the Smithsonian, and Hopkins APL.:::2021
