MIT:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::B. Syruptilis, a Probiotic Treatment for Maple Syrup Urine Disease:::Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by the inability to break down branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Untreated, accumulation of toxic byproducts results in irreversible neurological impairment and death. Besides liver transplantation, there is no curative treatment. Those unable to undergo such treatment must strictly control dietary protein intake to prevent metabolic decompensation. However, the gut represents a promising non-invasive intervention point, demonstrated by the amino acid enterorecirculation model. After consulting industry professionals engineering a probiotic treatment for phenylketonuria, a similar metabolic disorder, academic and medical experts, and stakeholders affected by MSUD, we designed a B. subtilis probiotic strain to more efficiently catabolize BCAAs in the gastrointestinal tract. Our approach focuses on overexpressing genes for BCAA importers and catabolic enzymes via a regulatory recombinase switch; and developing an ODE model of probiotic BCAA metabolism based on B. subtilis growth, gene expression, enzyme kinetics, and recombinase activity.:::2021
