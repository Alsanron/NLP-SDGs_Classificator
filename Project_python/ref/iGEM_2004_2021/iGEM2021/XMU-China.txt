XMU-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SALVAGE:::Nuclear power is an important source in electricity production. The plants need to be built on coast for the huge requirement of cooling water. However, marine organisms such as Phaeocystis globosa and Mytilus eduli sometimes cause blockage, making the cooling water system less efficient. Here, we show our solutions that the Lectin-SpyTag/SpyCatcher can pull down P. globosa colonies and then the hutH-fused proteins suppress the activity of P. globosa. To inhibit M. eduli fouling, Vibrio natriegens are engineered to express LC1KR2, PPO, and TnaA, which function jointly to attach engineered bacteria to the coarse grille and to inhibit M. eduli attachment. Genes rhlA and rhlB are also introduced to remove protection from mussel foot protein(mfp). As for biosafety, a blue-light-activated device, pBlind system, is implemented to control the expression of toxic protein BlrA, which can constrain the engineered bacteria in a reservoir with two blue light strips upstream and downstream.:::2021
