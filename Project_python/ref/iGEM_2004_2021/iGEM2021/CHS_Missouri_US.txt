CHS_Missouri_US:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::AquaeSCOPE: Investigating our Water Distribution Systems:::While communities lacking access to safe and regulated water distribution need alternative water sources, a general rise in distrust and misinformation towards the microorganisms in municipal water has led many individuals to avoid safe tap water for the environmentally costly alternative of bottled water. In order to investigate this problem in our community, CHS_Missouri_US created a synthetic biology system that can examine tap and bottled water microbiomes. Utilizing shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we have built sequencing libraries targeting the V4 region of 16S rRNA genes extracted from the water samples. Unique molecular barcodes were attached to the samples to comprehensively identify the taxonomic profile and relative abundance of all genera within both samples. Research was then conducted to determine the pathogenic risk of the microbiota detected. The documentation for this process can be applied to characterize the microbiome of water sources globally and provide insight towards improved water contaminant testing.:::2021
