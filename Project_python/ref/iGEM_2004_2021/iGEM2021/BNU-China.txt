BNU-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cheat Me If You Can:::In industrial production, inevitable mutations and phenotypic variations will lead to the appearance of cheater cells which avoid the burden of synthesizing exogenous products. Given the liberation from synthesis, cheaters may gain remarkable survival advantages over common workers. Such strain degeneration will therefore lead to a great loss in both quality and quantity of the products. To solve this problem, BNU-China seeks inspiration from a natural colonial model, in which guard bacterial cells can specifically eliminate cheater cells to maintain the balance of the population. We decide to develop a universal cheater-proof platform for industrial production by introducing carefully engineered guards and workers into the system.:::2021
