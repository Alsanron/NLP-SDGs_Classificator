CCU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AgenT Dressing, Mr. Superbug Assassin fight with MRSA:::Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are an emerging threat to global health and development. MRSA infects victims through open wounds and remains latent in macrophages. The infected MRSA is efficiently beat by the healthy immune system but causes bacteremia and endocarditis in patients with weak immunity. Here, we generate an antimicrobial dressing, namely AgenT, to prevent MRSA infection through open wounds on patients with weak immunity. AgenT Dressing is composed of an outer physical defense Polyurethane layer, an absorptive middle layer composed of alginate and chitosan, and an antimicrobial collagen layer with antimicrobial peptides and cell-penetrating peptides to target both intracellular and extracellular MRSA infections. We believe that AgenT will be a new treatment option to stop MRSA infections before it becomes worse. Fight MRSA with Mr. Superbug Assassin!:::2021
