MiamiU_OH:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CROP: Creating RuBP Optimized Photosynthesis:::Global agricultural productivity is projected to not meet the needs of increasing populations developing higher standards of living. On a cellular level, crop yield is limited by the inefficiency of photosynthesis. Our project aims to improve this efficiency by implementing an alternative RuBP regeneration portion of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. Two alternative pathways, which use enzymes from other reactions that act on common metabolites used in the CBB cycle, were explored first via computational modeling. Impacts on growth and reaction fluxes in silico assessed the validity of these pathways in creating a more robust photosynthetic cycle. One of these pathways which overexpresses the native enzyme transaldolase, was also assessed in vivo. Ultimately, we showed the validity of two alternative pathways in allowing a more efficient regeneration stage of the CBB Cycle. These pathways could eventually be implemented into higher plants to allow more robust cycling and therefore higher crop yield.:::2021
