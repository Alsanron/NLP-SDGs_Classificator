Hamburg:::Europe:::Germany:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.T. - The ElectronTransferrestrial:::Terpenoids are a large class of plant secondary metabolites used as food-flavors, fragrances or pharmaceuticals like artemisinic acid. Today, terpenoids are either extracted from plants they naturally occur in or produced synthetically using petrochemical starting materials.Only in a few cases have biotechnological approaches been successfully implemented for the production of terpenoids. Despite their chemical diversity, mainly two enzyme classes are required for terpenoid biosynthesis: cyclases and oxygenases. While cyclases are widely used in prokaryotes, oxygenases naturally occur as membrane-bound protein complexes. For functional expression in E. coli, soluble versions as well as compatible reductases are required. Additionally, protein expression places significant strain on the energy metabolism of E. coli. We are addressing these problems by creating fusion constructs of oxygenase and reductase proteins, as well as increasing the availability of NADPH. Advances in this field will lead to more sustainable and economical terpenoid production in the future.:::2021
