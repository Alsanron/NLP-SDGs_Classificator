NEYCFLS_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::ANTI-Virus:::Since its emergence in December 2019, Covid-19 has become a global threat, infecting hundreds of millions, and affecting billions. To help lower the risk of being infected while outdoors, NEYCFLS_China introduces to you: Argentum Nanoparticle Tie-dyeing Indigo against Virus (ANTI-Virus). Inspired by the traditional Chinese methods of tie-dyeing, we will use E.Coli to produce indigo, modify the indigo with silver nanoparticles, and apply the modified dye to the most outer layer of surgical masks. The masks dyed with ANTI-Virus will prevent the viruses and bacteria in the air from adhering to the masks and kill those that somehow find a way to stay on masks, all when retaining the maskâ€™s electric discharge and polypropylene network.:::2021
