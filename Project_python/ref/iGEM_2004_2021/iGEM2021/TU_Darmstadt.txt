TU_Darmstadt:::Europe:::Germany:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PHIRE BYRD - Phage mediated Immune Response by Recognizing Defensive Sleeper Cells.:::Biofilm formation is an important characteristic of many bacteria, which enables them to survive under harsh conditions. Nowadays, biofilms are essential for a variety of industrial applications such as food fermentation or wastewater treatment. This year, our team is working on a self-defensive biofilm to protect it from pathogen invasion. We will biologically engineer our biofilm prototype chassis Bacillus subtilisâ€¯to automatically sense pathogens threatening the biofilm via quorum sensing (QS) signalling molecules. The PHIRE BYRD gene circuit will trigger the production of lytic bacteriophages in presence of pathogens. The phages will then selectively kill the pathogenic bacteria while being completely harmless to humans, hence providing a powerful alternative to antibiotics. Finally, our complementary QS based kill-switch will protect our system from unintentional release of GMOs into the environment. By building on synthetic biology principles of modularity and standardization, our self-defensive biofilm system will be easily expandable to multiple pathogenic bacteria.:::2021
