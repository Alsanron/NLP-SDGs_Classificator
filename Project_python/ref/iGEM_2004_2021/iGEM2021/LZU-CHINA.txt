LZU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of CRISPR-Cas13d as a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral Strategy by targeting ACE2:::Currently, the world is still faced with the COVID-19 pandemic caused by novel coronavirus(SARS-CoV-2) which urgently requires flexible and targeted protection measures. The spike protein on its surface binds to receptors called ACE2 and then enters the cell through endocytosis. Inhibiting the expression level of ACE2 is considered to be an effective treatment for COVID-19. CRISPR-Cas13d is an RNA-guided ribonuclease that targets ssRNA. The design of gRNA does not need to consider specific adjacent motif. We select human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) to establish ACE2 stable transfection lines and lentivirus with novel coronavirus spike protein is used as pseudovirus. Through bioinformatics screening of crRNA pool for ACE2 conserved sequence, the lentivirus /CRISPR-Cas13d system was constructed. The system is designed to knock down the mRNA of ACE2 in cells, which leads to a decrease of ACE2 on cell surface. Thus, entry of the pseudovirus into cells is inhibited.:::2021
