Istanbul_Tech:::Europe:::Turkey:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Enhanced Vitamin B12 Synthesis from the Waste Li-ion Batteries by Using Scaffold System:::Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most common batteries used in the 21st century, particularly for electric cars. When their lifespan is over, metals especially found in their cathodes, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, should be recycled both to avoid contamination and to regain these valuable materials for further usage. LiCoO2, their main component, can be separated by chemical/biological leaching process, and the remaining cobalt metal can be used for different purposes, in our case for vitamin B12 (a.k.a. cobalamin) synthesis. Although the demand for cobalamin has been increasing, its commercial production is still time-consuming and inefficient. Our purpose is to enhance the Vitamin B12 synthesis by improving the efficiency of rate limiting-step in the pathway via enzyme scaffold systems. Besides, by using the cobalt ions from waste lithium-ion batteries for B12 synthesis we aim to increase B12 production and decrease the waste of lithium-ion batteries.:::2021
