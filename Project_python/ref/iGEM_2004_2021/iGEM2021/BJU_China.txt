BJU_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Indyego: application of bio-synthetic tyrian purple on semiconstructor:::Chemical production of indigo and its derivatives will result in heavy contamination of environment. In order to improve our environment, we use genetically modified Escherichia coli to produce derivatives of indigo such as 6,6-dibromoindigo, forming indigo dyes without generating large amounts of wastewater and harmful chemicals. In addition, in order to response to the green and sustainable development, we apply 6,6-dibromoindigo on dye-sensitized solar cell to release the heavy load on semiconductor production. Also, this method gives a new way on the synthesis biology and industry engineering.:::2021
