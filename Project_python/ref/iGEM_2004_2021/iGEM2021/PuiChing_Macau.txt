In synthetic biology, researchers have been developing bacteria that decompose food waste and bacteria that produce bioplastic. In this project, in hope of turning food waste into bioplastics, we first engineered acid-tolerant E. coli which survive the acidic food fermentation process. Through overexpressing fabB gene, we demonstrated significant improvement in E. coli proliferation under acidic conditions. Next, we further engineered E. coli which produces bioplastics, Polylactic acid (PLA). We improved the bioplastic-producing constructs from previous researchers and iGEM team by 1) optimizing heterologous genes PhaC-PCT; 2) adding a Phasin gene to the construct. With IR spectroscopy, we proved that our E. coli can produce PLA. Using Nile red to quantify the PLA, we also demonstrated that our constructs can increase PLA production. In addition, we also built computational models and hardware to maximize PLA production from food waste.:::2021
