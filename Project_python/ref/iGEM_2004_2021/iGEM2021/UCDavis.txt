UCDavis:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::UC Davis iGEM 2021 Project Cargo:::Team UC Davis seeks to optimize mRNA delivery in vitro for the foundational advancement of mRNA vaccine technology, namely to reduce side effects caused by an innate immune response due to sudden influx of spike protein. We plan to insert an RNA secondary structure known as an Iron Response element (IRE) into the 5â€™ UTR that reduces the sudden influx of spike protein by gradually releasing the available mRNA transcripts for translation. The protein known as an iron response binding protein (IRBP1/IRBP2) binds and blocks translation until an iron allosterically binds and IRBP/1IRBP2 unbinds to allow for translation. A working pipeline was created to automate the insertion process and structural stability by utilizing the RNA folding package, Vienna. To prove the mRNA/IREBP system constructs were expressed transiently in mammalian cell cultures and translation was monitored with destabilized YFP. The design is modular and able to integrate into any mRNA therapy.:::2021
