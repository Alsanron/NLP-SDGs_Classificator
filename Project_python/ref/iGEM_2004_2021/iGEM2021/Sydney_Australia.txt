Sydney_Australia:::Asia:::Australia:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Free Coli: Improving accessibility to synthetic biology by engineering a naturally transformable Escherichia coli:::Free Coli aimed to improve accessibility to synthetic biology by designing a genetically modified naturally transformable strain of Escherichia coli to produce a more affordable and efficient host organism that does not require chemical treatment or electroporation to become competent. Literature on natural transformation in E. coli and related bacterium was reviewed and experts were consulted to identify twenty-five putative natural transformation genes in A. baylyi for insertion into E. coli via a novel recombineering strategy for insertion of multiple gene clusters. K-means clustering used existing data on transcriptome concentration and promoter strength to model the optimal clustering of genes into eight <5kB DNA fragments. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to assemble the genes into fragments with salicylate promoters and selectable markers. The wider community was engaged and consulted to affirm the project’s purpose and align its future implementation with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal to ensure quality education for all.:::2021
