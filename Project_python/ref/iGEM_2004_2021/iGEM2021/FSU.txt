FSU:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ChiFresh: Combatting Food Insecurity by Extending the Shelf Life of Fresh Produce:::Florida's Big Bend Area consists of 11 counties. At least,150,000 members of our community are experiencing food insecurity. There are multiple causes of food insecurity including low household income and food deserts. We are addressing the problem by extending the shelf life of fresh produce so more members of our community have access to balanced meals. Our solution is the ChiFresh system composed of debit card-accessible refrigerators in areas with decreased access to fresh produce, a chitosan-based protective coating that extends the shelf life of fresh produce, and chitin-based packaging that is biodegradable. We focused on lowering the cost and environmental impact of chitin production. We developed engineered cells intended to secrete chitin known as the Chitin Secretion Cells and we converted Brewer's Spent Yeast into a medium for growing the Chitin Secretion Cells. ChiFresh has the potential to combat food insecurity in the Big Bend area and beyond.:::2021
