Sorbonne_U_Paris:::Europe:::France:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Chlamy'n Space:::Acute or chronic exposure to ionizing radiation (UVC, gamma rays, X raysâ€¦) leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which affect the genome and the proteome of cells. Thus, although photosynthetic microorganisms such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii constitute one of the main hopes for developing Bioregenerative Life-Support System during long-term space travel, their use is called into question by the decrease of efficiency of the photochemistry and by the growth arrest caused by ROS. Our project aims to make Chlamydomonas reinhardtii produce a peptide complexing with the Mn2+ ion inspired by a metabolite found in the radioresistant organism Deinococcus radiodurans and acting as an antixoidant. This study requires to demonstrate a decrease in ROS within the cell during production of the peptide and verifying the growth of microalgae cultivated in minimum medium (photosynthesis dependent growth).:::2021
