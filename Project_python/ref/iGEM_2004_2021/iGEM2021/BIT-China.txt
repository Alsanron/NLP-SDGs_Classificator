BIT-China:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Creative Tasting Officer:::Taste is the soul of food. Food companies all over the world are looking for better ways to quantify the basic flavors of newly developed food products. In the food industry, human sensory panel and electronic tongue are most commonly used to evaluate taste. However, human sensory is costly and subjectively affected, while one electronic tongue cannot measure the taste of multiple food. This year BIT-China devotes to design a Creative Tasting Officer-a yeast cell biosensor to quantify the basic tastes of umami, sweetness and bitterness. Genetic circuits are designed to express human taste receptors heterologously in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the intensity of fluorescences would quantitively reflect the respective taste degree of food samples. Furthermore, we develop a series of Soybean based Creative Seasonings and a Flavor Card Website to help people discover their favorite taste. Everyone can click the link and find the satisfying flavor with personalized color panel!!!:::2021
