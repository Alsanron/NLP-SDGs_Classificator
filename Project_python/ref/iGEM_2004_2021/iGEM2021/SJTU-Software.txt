SJTU-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::An intelligent platform for DNA nano machine contriving:::Dry Lab can provide pre-experiment reference and guidance for wet experiments, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of the wet laboratory. Our project served wet lab in two different directions via multi tools. Firstly, conducting an in silico analysis of miscellaneous medical data, we can determine the dominant biomarkers (miRNA, mRNA, etc.) for subsequent wet experiment, thus reducing workload. Next, for the purposes of our Nano DNA machines our team have built a deep learning model to assist probe design. With the combined utilization of our tools, wet lab's productivity will be improved significantly.:::2021
