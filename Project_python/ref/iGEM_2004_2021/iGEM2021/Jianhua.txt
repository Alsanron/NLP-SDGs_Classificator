Jianhua:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Producing 2'-FL by Saccharomyces cerevisiae:::2′-Fucosyllactose (2’-FL), one of the most abundant oligosaccharides in human milk, has potential applications in foods due to its infant health benefits. Due to it is prohibitively expensive to obtain 2’-FL directly from human milk, alternative microbial production of 2’-FL is considered promising. Microbial production of 2-FL has been studied mostly in Escherichia coli. To avoid endotoxin contamination and bacteriophage infection in the fermentation process to produce 2’-FL using E. coli, Jianhua aims to produce 2’-FL by engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is generally recognized as safe and has been widely used in food industries. First, using FKP to produce intracellular GDP-l-fucose. Second, Lac12 transports lactose, a fucose acceptor in 2’-FL production into cytosol of S. cerevisiae cells. Finally, FucT2, which catalyzes fucosylation of lactose into 2’-FL using GDP-l-fucose needs to be introduced.:::2021
