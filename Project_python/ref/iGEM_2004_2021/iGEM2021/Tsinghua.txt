Tsinghua:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Gut matters: A diagnostic tool and multiprobiotics therapy for IBD:::Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic disease severely impacting the life quality of an increasing number of patients worldwide. As IBD is hard to diagnose and difficult to cure, Tsinghua iGEM 2021 team aims to develop a solution to facilitates IBD diagnosis and therapeutic cures. For the diagnostic tool, an RNA-guided fusion protein is used to specifically label miRNA biomarkers for IBD, enabling fast detection of these biomarkers from blood/saliva samples. For the therapy, our approach contains the following points: strains of probiotic E. coli and L. lactis are engineered to produce microcin, treatment protein, and bile salt hydrolase, targeting gut microflora composition, mucus healing process, and metabolic environment regulation respectively. Additionally, a new cell-coating technology is employed to improve the delivery efficiency. This approach should bring new light to the understanding and treatment of IBD.:::2021
