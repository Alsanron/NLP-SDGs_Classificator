NDNF_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Hidro - Say Hi to the World:::There is no denying that synbio is a hugely potential field. But for engineered strains to function beyond laboratories, some obstacles are holding them back. NDNF_China hopes to help these strains work beyond the laboratory in a safe, stable and traceable way. Here we present Hidro: a hydrogel system enclosing engineered bacterial strains. The outer layer of Hidro is a compact shell, offering both protection and containment, preventing the strains from escaping into the wild; the inner core of Hidro provides a supportive environment for them under harsh conditions, thus enabling their stable function; A genome-integrated Tracing and Control system offers tracking and specific killing of engineered strains in case of emergencies. We have experimentally demonstrated that Hidro can be implemented in diverse scenarios, such as heavy metal sensing, food-quality detection, drug secretion, etc. The Hidro system has the great potential to promote synthetic biology applications beyond the laboratory.:::2021
