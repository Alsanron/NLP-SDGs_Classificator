UM_Macau:::Asia:::Macao:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BADY--Beer Antioxidation and Depurination Yeast:::Gout is a common rheumatic disease. Symptoms including swollen, red, hot, and stiff joints. The accumulated purine in beer is one of the reasons that cause gout after drinking beer. Low purine beer, therefore, can reduce the risk of beer drinkers suffering from gout. Meanwhile, oxidation in beer causes off-flavors and darkened color. Based on these problems, our team proposed to edit the yeast used in beer fermentation in order to produce a beer with low purine content and good antioxidant properties. We engineered the wild-type yeast by synthetic biology method such that the engineered yeast is able to produce and secrete three enzymes--purine nucleoside phosphorylase1 (PNP1), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and endochitinase (chit42). PNP1 can improve the utilization of purines, hence prevents purine accumulation in beer. The SOD1 and endochitinase will increase antioxidation in the final product.:::2021
