UNIZAR:::Europe:::Spain:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NANOBODY DE NOVO DISCOVERY BY ARTIFICIAL CDR RECOMBINATION:::Nanobodies are proteins that selectively bind to an antigen. Due to its smaller size, they present advantages in diagnosis and therapeutics. However, they are animal-derived, expensive and difficult to produce. Complementary determining regions or CDRs (CDR1, CDR2, CDR3) are unique nanobody regions involved in antigen binding. However, even nanobodies that bind to the same antigen have different binding affinities, as they present different CDRs. Our goal is creating a library of artificially developed nanobodies that bind to a specific antigen. Inspired by nature, this is achieved by random in-vitro recombination of the different CDR genetic sequences of already characterized nanobodies that bind to said antigen. These newly formed nanobody gene fragments are expressed in E. coli, generating a library for the screening of nanobodies with higher binding affinity than the starting ones. This way, our system improves the traditional method for nanobody production, being faster, cheaper and cruelty-free.:::2021
