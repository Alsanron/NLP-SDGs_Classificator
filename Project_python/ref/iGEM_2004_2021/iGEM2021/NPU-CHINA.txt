NPU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A self lysis feed toxinicide:::Aflatoxin is a strong carcinogen widely existing in feed crops. Aflatoxin residues in livestock deep-processing products seriously threaten food safety. This project uses Bacillus subtilis, which is generally considered safe, as a carrier to assemble aflatoxin degradation proteins, stable-phase promoters and self-cleavage protein. Combined with the selenium-enrichment function of Bacillus subtilis, a strain of intelligent Bacillus subtilis with self cleavage function, which can simultaneously degrade aflatoxin and enrich selenium, is constructed. Finally, a new, safe and selenium rich high-value feed additive is provided.:::2021
