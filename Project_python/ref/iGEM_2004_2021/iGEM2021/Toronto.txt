Toronto:::North America:::Canada:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Python Package for Machine Learning Driven Protein Engineering:::Applications of machine learning to protein engineering has progressed rapidly in the recent years. Traditional methods of rational protein design can be complemented and greatly enhanced by data-driven methods which predict function from protein sequence. We present a Python package which contains common functions used in ML-guided protein engineering. We also provide implementations of baseline discriminative models for protein property prediction from sequence and generative models for generating novel protein sequences. Finally, through a collaboration with TJUSLS China, iGEM Illinois, and iGEM UT Austin, we provide a curated dataset of PETase enzymes using which we demonstrate the prediction and generation of novel PET plastic degrading enzymes.:::2021
