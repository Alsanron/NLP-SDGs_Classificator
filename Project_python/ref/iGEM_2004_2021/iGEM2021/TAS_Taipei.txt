TAS_Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::UniversO: Enzymatic Blood Type Conversion to Eliminate Transfusion Incompatibility:::Blood transfusions are an integral component of healthcare, but the availability of blood is limited by patient-donor blood type specificity. This leads to blood shortages worldwide, especially in developing countries and during times of pandemics or natural disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic. To alleviate the blood shortage issue, this project aims to increase the supply of universal donor blood through the enzymatic conversion of A, B, and AB blood types to O type, eliminating patient donor incompatibility. We have identified 3 glycoside hydrolases that act as molecular scissors to cleave off terminal residues on A and B RBC surface antigens, preventing cells from eliciting an immune response. We propose a modular, two step blood conversion kit housing our recombinant enzymes that can be implemented into blood banks and processing centers, increasing access to universal donor blood for all.:::2021
