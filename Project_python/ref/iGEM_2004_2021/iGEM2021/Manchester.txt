Manchester:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::UriGel: Fighting Catheter Acquired Urinary Tract Infections With Engineered Bacteria:::Catheterization is required in many hospital patients, and long-term catheterization leads to catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in most patients. Talks with doctors identified there was no system in place to effectively prevent CAUTIs. To address this issue, we designed a hydrogel coating containing engineered bacteria which would sense pathogens and secrete biofilm degrading enzymes, secrete inhibitors of virulent enzymes, express a binding domain to attach to the hydrogel and depend on the urinary tract environment for survival (kill switch). Mathematical modelling of our hydrogel found that our secreted products would efficiently diffuse through the hydrogel. We created a model for our antibiofilm mechanism that can be used by future teams with similar mechanisms. Molecular docking modelling identified a candidate virulent enzyme inhibitor. Finally, a urea- and a sarcosine-responsive promoter were characterised to validate our kill switch mechanism. Overall, we have successfully designed a potential solution to CAUTIs.:::2021
