Encs are relatively simple protein shells, yet they are stable and can carry robust cargo. We believe this represents an opportunity for novel drug delivery. In this work, we investigate the intake of assembled Encs by living eukaryotic cells and whether the Enc containers can be disassembled by protein-degradation enzymes native to the targeted organism. Brewer’s yeast (S. cerevisiae) was selected as the proof-of-concept organism for this project, and mNeon green was chosen as the model Enc cargo. We are cloning bacteria that will produce Enc shells with yeast mating pheromone tags displayed on their surfaces. The tags will encourage the yeast to endocytose the disguised Encs into the cell from the environment. Success will be measured by using fluorescence imaging to confirm the presence of assembled mNeon green-bearing shells within live cells.:::2021
