KEYSTONE:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Rubber Eater———on the biodegradation of rubber (cis-1,4-polyisoprene):::In the enormous yet growing global rubber production, we see an urgent issue: waste rubber. By interviewing rubber recycling managers in China, we found that only 7% of 12945000 tons of rubber is recycled in 2020, meaning most rubber waste has either entered a landfill/open dump or an incinerator, both entail serious ecological/safety hazards. To combat this issue, we employed Latex Clearing Protein (LCP) as a means of rubber biodegradation. However, the implementation of LCP still faces many obstacles. To facilitate real-time rubber degradation, we introduced a signal peptide named hlyA that allows for the extracellular secretion of LCP, and for water solubility, we added a fusion protein named NusA. In addition, the signal peptide provides our project the potential for sustainable industrial-scale use. With improved efficiency, this project will become a promising and environmentally friendly rubber waste management method, hopefully contributing to the solution of this pressing global issue.:::2021
