NWU-CHINA-A:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::An adventure of ancient snails: Revive Tyrian purple by E.coli:::Tyrian purple is a natural dye that originally extracted from the secretion of sea snails in the ancient times, whose production cost thousands of snails and heavily relied on manpower. Nevertheless, there is not a method to prepare Tyrian purple in a large scale by now. Thus, we aim to realize the biosynthesis of 6,6-dibromoindigo, which is the main chemical constituent of Tyrian purple. The pathway begins from tryptophan and sodium bromide and end in 6,6-dibromoindigo, consisting of three successive reactions. To reduce the insolubility of the halogenase in the first reaction, we add a flavin reductase as a soluble tag on the N-terminal of the halogenase. Moreover, we get a tryptophanase knocked out strain by CRISPR/Cas9 to avoid the potential side reactions. Also we established a whole-cell reaction system to produce 6,6-dibromoindigo cheaply and efficiently. In addition, a dyeing protocol was developed to utilize our Tyrian purple products.:::2021
