Wageningen_UR:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cattlelyst - Reducing the ecological hoofprint of cattle:::Our planet suffers from a large excess of reactive nitrogen, impacting local and global ecosystems. In the Netherlands, almost 50% of total nitrogen emissions originate from the cattle industry, mainly in the form of ammonia. Additionally, cattle naturally emit the potent greenhouse gas methane, contributing to global warming. Experts informed us that currently, no combined solution exists to both threats. Therefore we have developed Cattlelyst, a biofilter for cattle stalls targeting ammonia and methane emissions. Cattlelyst relies upon a synthetic co-culture of two non-pathogenic bacterial species that remove these harmful gasses. We modelled and established ammonia conversion in Pseudomonas putida alongside engineering Escherichia coli to consume methane. Containment of the bacteria in the biofilter is ensured by a combination of auxotrophy and two safety circuits. Thanks to these features, Cattlelyst provides a biological, animal-friendly and biosafe solution to reduce the ecological hoofprint of the livestock sector.:::2021
