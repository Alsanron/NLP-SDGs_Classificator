CKWA-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::LonEase:::Cancer recurrence after surgical treatment is currently a major problem facing humans, and cancer recurrence is a huge threat to cancer patients. For example, bladder cancer has a recurrence of up to 24%-84% of patients within 5 years after surgical resection, and the overexpression of C-MYC protein is approximately related to 44%-69% of the cases. We investigated the urinary tract pathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) Lon protein and find it can effectively degrade C-MYC protein, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. We use E. coli to produce highly active Lon protease this year, and propose this protein can be designed into drugs to improve the surgical prognosis of bladder cancer populations with C-MYC gene overexpression.:::2021
