IISER_Bhopal:::Asia:::India:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BLAST : Bifidobacterium Longum induced Apoptosis using Smac and Trail (Therapeutic for Solid tumor cancers):::Cancer, the second leading cause of death in the world, registered 19 million cases and about 10 million deaths in 2020 globally. Cancer treatment is both financially and mentally traumatizing for patients as current therapies suffer from a plethora of side effects and are very expensive. Our project presents an innovative approach to treat cancer using apoptosis-inducing peptides SMAC & TRAIL. TRAIL binds to the cancer cells extrinsically, thereby activating caspases, whereas SMAC induces apoptosis intrinsically and also sensitizes TRAIL-resistant cancer cells. Our chassis organism, B.longum, is an obligatory anaerobe and grows only in hypoxic regions providing specificity to target solid tumours. Furthermore, it has a lactate-based KILL SWITCH to ensure it gets killed outside the cancer environment and an AND GATE ensures secretion specificity to cancer cells only. We'd be establishing the Proof of Concept in E.coli. The objective is to design cheap and viable therapy for cancer treatment.:::2021
