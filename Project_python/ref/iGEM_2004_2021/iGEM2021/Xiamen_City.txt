Xiamen_City:::Asia:::China:::High School:::Commercial:::Accepted:::Pecteast: the construction of the functionable wine yeast to directly degrade pectin:::Pectin will cause impurity and lower the texture of fruit wine, which leads to unfortunate sales. Moreover, the discouragement of pectin during fruit wine production has a negative impact on the environment that goes against the UN sustainable development goals. Therefore, we use the CRISPR-Cas9 technique to insert part of the pectinase gene into the yeast gene to form yeast with the function of decomposing pectin. By using this multi-functional yeast, the pectin in fruit will be decomposed during the fermentation of fruit wine. And the multi-functional yeast is going to be filtered out at the end of the fermentation.:::2021
