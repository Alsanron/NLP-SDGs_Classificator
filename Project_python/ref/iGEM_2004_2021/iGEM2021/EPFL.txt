EPFL:::Europe:::Switzerland:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CuRe: Copper Bioremediation to Revitalize Vineyards:::Mildew is a destructive fungal disease of plants including wine-producing grapevines. For more than a century, mildew has been treated with ‘bio’ farming compatible copper-based fungicides which adhere to plant leaves. However, though only trace amounts of copper is present in wine made from treated plants, when rain washes the fungicide away, toxic levels of copper contaminate the surrounding soil, inhibiting new cultivation and biodiversity. Our goal is to remove copper from grapevine rainwater runoff to prevent this pollution. We generated yeast strains which express the normally intracellular copper-binding protein CUP1 in multiple copies and configurations on their surface to enable bioadsorption of environmental copper. As a proof-of-concept for a real-world implementation of our decontamination strategy, we have designed and built a prototype bioreactor to enable the removal of copper from rainwater by our modified yeast. We envision our solution could help protect wine growing regions from copper soil pollution.:::2021
