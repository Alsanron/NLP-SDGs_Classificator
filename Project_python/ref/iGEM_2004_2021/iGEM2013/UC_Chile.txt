Carboxysomes are proteinaceous bacterial microcompartments that evolved to optimize bacterial metabolic reactions. We sought to take advantage of this biological principle to design a platform for in vitro metabolic engineering. Whateversisome itâ€™s based on two hypotheses: the targeting signal to the microcompartment is present in a subunit of RuBisCO and that after isolation Carboxysomes can maintain their metabolic capacity in vitro. To address these hypotheses, we designed a system to target proteins of interest to the Carboxysome using RuBisCO subunits as targeting signals. We showed colocalization of GFP fusion proteins and Carboxysome shell-proteins fused to RFP. Second, we designed a simple system for Carboxysome purification based on biotinylation that should enable easy isolation of recombinant Whateversisomes. Our approach would enable combinatorial in vitro metabolic engineering by producing and combining arbitrary Whateversisomes. This project takes advantage of subcellular organizational principles for metabolic engineering.:::2013
