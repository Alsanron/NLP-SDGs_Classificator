UNIK_Copenhagen:::Europe:::Denmark:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Project Magneto:::Project Magneto is a biological system that allows us to find better ways to treat cancer, acts as a sustainable energy source or just enables us to visualize our environment in a new way. We created it using magnetosomes. Thanks to these specialized organelles magnetotactic bacteria are able to navigate in the earthâ€™s magnetic field. The magnetosome is a nanomagnet which consists of a magnetic crystal housed inside a lipid membrane. Magnetosomes arrange together in chains and act as a compass needle thereby orienting the cell. They show various properties that give them an advantage over industrially synthesized nanomagnets. We demonstrate their usability by fusing fluorescent proteins to their membrane. Through this we open the way for using magnetosomes in various different applications where the fluorescent protein could be simply replaced by a drug for targeted cancer therapy, an ATP-synthase to create a biological dynamo or dye for magnetic paint.:::2013
