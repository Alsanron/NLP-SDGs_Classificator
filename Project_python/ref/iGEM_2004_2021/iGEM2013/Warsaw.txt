Warsaw:::Europe:::Poland:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::FluoSafe:::We are presenting to you FluoSafe- a biosensor for acrylamide, known for its carcinogenic and neurotoxic effect! This compound is present not only in biological laboratories but also in starch-based food products (fries, chips etc.). We aim to construct a bacterial strain that would serve as a detector of acrylic amide. This will be attempted in two ways: through the use of roGFP (redox sensitive GFP) fused with glutaredoxin 1 (the presence of acrylamide is known to affect the cellular gluthatione pool) and by expressing hemoglobin α- and β- subunits fused with split fluorophore (adducts formed by acrylamide on the N-terminal valine are known to affect interactions between subunits). We also constructed a BiFC toolbox in BioBrick standard. We sought to find out what was the effect of acrylamide on a variety of human cell lines and asses the toxicity of different concentrations of this compound.:::2013
