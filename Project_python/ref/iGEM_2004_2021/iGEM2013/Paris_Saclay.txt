Paris_Saclay:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PCBbusters:::PCBs (Polychlorobiphenyls) are synthetic chemicals widely used during the late 20th century. These compounds are extraordinarily stable, not readily biodegradable and have accumulated in the environment. PCBs also accumulate in animal fatty tissues including human tissues. As PCBs are probably carcinogenic and some are endocrine disruptors, they constitute an important health issue. Although PCBs have no natural equivalents, some bacterial communities have developed the capacity to degrade PCBs. Highly chlorinated PCBs undergo anaerobic reductive dechlorination, lowering the chlorine atom number. Lightly chlorinated PCBs are then degraded via the aerobic biphenyl degradation pathway. Our project is to construct an Escherichia coli strain capable of degrading PCBs by introducing in the strain genes involved in PCB degradation in various bacteria. Because some steps are anaerobic and others aerobic, we want to use an oxygen-based regulation of gene expression. We also want to develop a sensor system to detect PCBs in the environment.:::2013
