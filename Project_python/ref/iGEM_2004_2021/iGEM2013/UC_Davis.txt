UC_Davis:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RiboTALe: A Tunable and Modular System for Control of Gene Expression:::Despite the fact that the Registry of Standard Biological Parts contains a large number of inducible promoters, the actual usage of these parts is dominated by a very select few. In order to increase the versatility of expression control systems, we propose a new system coupling transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) with inducible riboswitches. TALEs are proteins secreted by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas that contain engineerable, sequence-specific DNA binding domains and can act as transcriptional repressors or activators. We plan to manipulate TALE activity by subjecting them to inducible expression through riboswitches and promoters. By pairing TALEs with riboswitches, we can expand the existing library of inducible repression systems. In addition, we hope to modify the parameters of our system to show the tunability and modularity of our overall construct. Through proper characterization, we believe that iGEM teams may also use these modular repression systems for the development of future devices.:::2013
