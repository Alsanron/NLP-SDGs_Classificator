GeorgiaTech:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacterial BioBots: Integrin-Based BioSensors:::Our team goal is to develop novel bacterial BioBots that respond to the extracellular tissue environment. Mammalian cells communicate with the extracellular matrix (ECM) using heterodimeric cell surface receptors, called integrins, which can signal in a bidirectional manner between the cell interior and ECM. We aimed to express the integrin αIIbβ3 in E. coli cells. To promote dimerization of the integrin subunits, we attempted to optimize bimolecular fluorescence complementation of split GFP using surface display technologies. We cloned split GFP parts, assembling the T7-promoter, LacI-operator, and ribosomal binding site (RBS) upstream of the protein-coding region. To verify αIIbβ3 function, we developed an integrin activity sensor consisting of the ligand derived from fibrinogen (KQAGDV) coupled to GFP. Finally, we successfully created a new standard for RBS addition that inputs the strong RBS (BBa_B0034) in front of any standard BioBrick part, which is efficient and more successful than the usual 3A/standard assembly.:::2013
