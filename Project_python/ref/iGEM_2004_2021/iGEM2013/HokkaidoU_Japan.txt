HokkaidoU_Japan:::Asia:::Japan:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::“Maestro E. coli” ~optimization kit for expression~:::Thousands of genes are expressed in living cells. Their expression is cleverly controlled by promoters and RBSs. Precise regulation of recombinant genes is hard to achieve. Imbalance in regulation results in little production. However, it is hard to objectively select promoters and RBSs. We thought that E. coli could do the selection for us. We created a kit for E. coli to find the best suited promoters and RBSs. It enables our lab E. coli to be like “Maestro” who creates excellent harmonies with lots of instruments. For the kit we created an original promoter and RBS families with different strengths. We checked and made these parts to be reliable. And it only takes a single golden-gate assembly to get your construct! We made the promoters and RBSs by selecting from randomized libraries. Using the kit, E. coli can choose optimal promoters and RBSs by her/it/him-self, just like the maestro.:::2013
