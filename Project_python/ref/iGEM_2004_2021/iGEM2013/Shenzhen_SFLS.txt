Shenzhen_SFLS:::Asia:::China:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Detection and Digestion of Phosphates: A Method in Eutrophication Response:::Eutrophoication is mainly caused by too much phosphate and nitrogen in water and it can cause serious affction towards environment. When Eutrophication occurs, water-bloom will explosively boosted in water and caused heavy casualty of aquative living beings due to hypoxia. Our project is working on digesting phosphate in water. Due to our research, once we control the N/P ratio can we effectively control the situation of Eutrophication. And we manily focus on digesting Phosphate. Our project is consited of two connected devices. The first device contains a phosphate sensitive promoter which can be induced by phosphate starvation, a RFP system, and a supressor protein. Device 2, contains a promoter which is limited by the suppressor protein featured in Device 1, a PPK coding sequence that is key in digesting phosphate and a GFP with LVA that allows the bacteria to emit a green fluorescence while it is doing so.:::2013
