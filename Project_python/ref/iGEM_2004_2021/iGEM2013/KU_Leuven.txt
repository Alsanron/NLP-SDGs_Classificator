KU_Leuven:::Europe:::Belgium:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. coligy: Plants with BanAphids:::Aphids, the little green plant-sucking bugs, can pose serious threats to a farmer's proceeds. Not only physical damage to the crops caused by the sucking is a problem, but aphids also transmit harmful viruses to the plants. The magnitude of loss is difficult to quantify as it changes with aphid species, crop species, location, year and other factors. The use of insecticides to control aphid population is contested, as it has a negative effect on the natural predators and aphids grow resistant. That's why we, the KU Leuven iGEM 2013 team, decided to do something about it in a sustainable way, using an insecticide-free controlling mechanism. With E.coligy: Plants with BanAphids we will teach E.coli cells to hack into insects signaling systems to drive off the aphids and attract the natural predators, such as the ladybug.:::2013
