Biwako_Nagahama:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AgRePaper&E.coli-ink:::Cellulose is used as raw material for paper, so our team experimented various ways to increase the amount of cellulose produced by agrobacterium and using it to make papers. For this we developed the different parts to insert into the system of agrobacterium. Among them are the genes used for expression of the curdlan. Similarly, genetic parts in order to increase the expression of the cellulose, along with the agrobacterium type binary vector were also developed . We are also working on recycling the produced paper by degrading the cellulose to D-Glucose using various enzymes. We worked for the preparation of the biological ink using the sperm whale's cells by genetically modification to increase amount of myoglobin. Then, we observed the change on the color of the product by altering the formation of myoglobin and the production amount of myoglobin with the insertion of T7 promoter to the cell system.:::2013
