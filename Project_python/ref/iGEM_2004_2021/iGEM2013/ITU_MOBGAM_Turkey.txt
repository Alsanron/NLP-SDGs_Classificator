ITU_MOBGAM_Turkey:::Europe:::Turkey:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Intrinsic Factor-y::: Pernicious anemia is described first by James S. Combe in 1822. Pernicious anemia is a type of anemia occurs due to malabsorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine due to problems with the production of Intrinsic Factor, which is responsible for the absorption of vitamine B12. Pernicious anemia shows its stiking effects on blood, gastro-intestinal tract and nervous system and pernicious anemia usually develops together with an autoimmune disease. Our aim as ITU MOBGAM IGEM Team, is to design a bacterium that is capable of surviving in small intestine and secreting Intrinsic Factor dependent on pH. Also, we design a genetic circuit for controlling the overgrowth and containment of bacteria.:::2013
