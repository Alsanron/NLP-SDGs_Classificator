ITB_Indonesia:::Asia:::Indonesia:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Aflatoxin Biosensor:::Aflatoxins are naturally occuring mycotoxins that are mutagenic and carcinogenic. Aflatoxin contamination of foods that are found in many developing countries may cause a serious problem for human health. ITB_Indonesia team for iGEM 2013 focuses on designing a whole cell biosensor for aflatoxin B1 detection in foods. The biosensor uses Escherichia coli as the chassis to build a genetic circuit using SOS response system to detect DNA damage caused by aflatoxin B1-oxide attack. The SOS response promoter is followed by a reporter gene coding a chromoprotein, therefore the concentration of aflatoxin B1 in food samples could be easily detected by the color change of the bacteria. For the ease of usage, we will design a syringe shaped device with our whole cell biosensor in it. This device would allow aflatoxin B1 to enter the device, but would not permit the cells to leave the device.:::2013
