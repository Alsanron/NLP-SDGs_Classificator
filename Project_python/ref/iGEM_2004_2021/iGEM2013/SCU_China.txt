SCU_China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Imitations of Gametogenesis & Sexual Reproduction using E.coli:::We intend to construct two groups of differentiated E.coli,one imitates the male multicellular organism ,the other for the female. When cultured separately, the male/female multicellular system gets bigger and matures, and cells will differentiate into gametes,which cannot divide any more but are capable of gene transfer. After that, you mix this two liquid cultures,the male gametes will recognize the female cells and begin to transfer modified F plasmids into female gametes through sex pili. The conjugation makes female gametes return to the state of un-differentiation(called G cells),which means they can divide again but are not sexually determined.Then,after several cell divisions,one G cell will differentiate into a G+ or G-,which, like zygote, can grow into next generation of the multicellular system maybe containing genes from both male and female gametes.:::2013
