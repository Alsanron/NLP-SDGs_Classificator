XMU_Software:::Asia:::China:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biobrick evaluation and optimization software suit and lab assistant tool:::The biobrick evaluation and optimization software tool suit (Brick Worker) provide analysis of biobrick sequences, namely, promoter, RBS, protein coding sequence and terminator. We use PWM algorithm to evaluate the relative strength of promoters and RBS and precisely locate the key region of the sequence that affect its performance. Through codon optimization and GA algorithm our program can analyze and then optimize the protein coding sequence so as to enhance the protein expression level. Terminator efficiency prediction is also included in this suit. As for the lab assistant tool (Eâ€™Note), it is a powerful experimental recording platform with exhilarating functions such as multi-line operating, software tool integration and template customization, providing a all-round as well as customized tool to significantly enhance the efficiency of experimental work.:::2013
