Tufts:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus modification toolkit:::Our goal is to develop a way of expressing a user-defined protein during the discrete life stages of the gram-negative predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. In order to accomplish this, we have selected a number of promoters from the bacteriovorus genome that will precede the user-defined protein. The region to be expressed and the vector which carries it will recombine into the bacteriovorus genome, and recombine once again popping out under the pressure of sucrose counterselection.:::2013
