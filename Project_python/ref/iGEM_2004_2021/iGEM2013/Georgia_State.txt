Often, the compounds used in these medicines are naturally occurring, such as aspirin and opoids. In 2012, Diochot et al from the Institut de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire in France, was able to extract and isolate an analgesic peptide found in the African Black Mamba. The peptide, Mambalgin-1, has been shown to have comparable analgesic effects to morphine but does not induce the debilitating withdrawal affects. However, extracting this peptide is expensive and dangerous work. Using a cassette of standardized systems (the pGAPzα expression vectors) in P. pastoris, we sought to produce high quantities of pure, functional proteins in a safe and cost effective manner.:::2013
