Alberta:::North America:::Canada:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Littlest Mapmaker:::Inspired by a 2007 iGEM joint project by Davidson College and Missouri Western State University, "The Littlest Mapmaker" is the University of Alberta's effort to create a biological computer capable of solving the Travelling Salesman Problem, a logistical challenge in which a hypothetical salesman must find the shortest route through a series of destinations. Our travelling salesman computer is built from a combination of raw DNA chemistry and bacterial colonies: first it assembles the routes by stringing genes together, treating them like roads on the salesman's map, then the bacteria sort the good routes from the bad, identifying the answer through the quantity of bacterial colonies making use of each route. The most commonly used route is the winner!:::2013
