XMU-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A SynBio Oscillation Signal Converter:::Oscillations permeate every corner of the world, from the alternative current （AC） in power lines to our tiny microorganism friends. To use oscillations in bacteria as a strong and steady signal transmission method like AC, we need to tackle with the noise of transcription and translation in the cellular environment by coupling millions of cells through the synchronizing genetic oscillations in E.coli. At the colony level cells could be synchronized via quorum sensing, which is limited to tens of micrometers by the AHL, and between colonies a gas-phase redox (mainly H2O2) will serve as a signal that can give positive feedback to the whole circuit over millimeter scales simultaneously. On a liquid crystal display (LCD)-like microfluidic array bacteria grow in separate colonies, so that synchronization in both levels could be verified visually. Now a robust synthetic biology signal converter is accomplished and ready to show the growth environment of cells.:::2013
