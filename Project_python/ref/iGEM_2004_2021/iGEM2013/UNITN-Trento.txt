UNITN-Trento:::Europe:::Italy:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::B. fruity:::B. fruity envisions an environmentally friendly way to control fruit ripening by exploiting an engineered, light regulated strain of B. subtilis. The system works by synthesising ethylene or methyl salicylate (MeSA) upon photoinduction. Everything is housed in a vending machine-like enclosure that regulates fruit ripening in response to consumer demand. Ethylene is a natural plant hormone that is widely used to ripen fruit, such as bananas and kiwi. However, the synthesis, handling, and storage of ethylene is expensive and dangerous. In contrast, B. fruity produces ethylene from inexpensive material by exploiting a TCA cycle intermediate, 2-oxoglutarate, and the activity of P. syringae 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase. The inhibition of fruit ripening results from the synthesis of MeSA via a pathway built with wintergreen parts. As a proof of concept, we engineered E. coli with the above systems plus the YF1/FixJ blue light receptor device.:::2013
