SharonBasicallyAcid:::North America:::United States:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::SuperBacteria:::Our SuperBacteria will detect dangerously low or high levels of various nutrients, indicate a fluctuation with a flashing red or green light, and correct the concentrations by secreting or absorbing the appropriate nutrient. It is the savior of hydroponics that the world has been looking for! Hydroponics is a system in which plants are grown in a nutrient-rich solution. These bacteria are self-sustaining and will cut the costs of expensive machinery that is currently required to monitor nutrient levels. Currently we are working on having our SuperBacteria detect and indicate non-ideal levels of pH.:::2013
