SDU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacteriorganic Rubber:::The growing demand for natural rubber causes deforestation of the rainforest or occupation of arable lands, all due to the founding of new plantations. If producing rubber by bacteria succeeds, production of natural rubber will not be limited to the regions where the rubber tree can grow. Our project aims to make an E. coli strain able to produce natural rubber while grown under controlled conditions. Natural rubber is composed of polymerized IPP (isopentenyl pyrophoshate) units. E. coli already possesses the ability to produce IPP, but it lacks the polymerization enzyme, prenyltransferase, from the rubber tree. In this project we introduce prenyltransferase into E. coli and simultaneously manipulate the bacteria to produce more of the IPP links, consequently leading to the production of natural rubber in the bacterial setting.:::2013
