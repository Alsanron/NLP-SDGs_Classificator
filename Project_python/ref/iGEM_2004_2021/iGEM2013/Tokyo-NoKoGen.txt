Tokyo-NoKoGen:::Asia:::Japan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Twinkle.coli -Fast cycle! Fast response!-::: We created Twinkle.coli, which “blinks” fast　like a firefly. An oscillator is a system that responds in periodic changes. This response is usually regulated by positive or negative feedbacks by using inducer or repressor proteins. However, the use of proteins might delay the response because transcription and translation must happen before the next output. To design an artificial fast responding oscillating circuit, we designed an　RNA-based oscillator. We used RNA-responsive self-cleavage ribozymes whose cleavage is regulated by an RNA molecule. The ribozyme cleavage cuts-off an “RNA scaffold” that harbors RNA aptamers. This aptamer binds to its specific target proteins, which are directly fused to reporter protein. This binding recruits the already translated split reporter protein complementation resulting in the output (twinkles).　Our system enabled fast response and short oscillation cycle.:::2013
