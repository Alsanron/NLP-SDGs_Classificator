Michigan:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Completely Unidirectional Biological Transistor Utilizing an Engineered Fim Switch:::Recent studies have just started to explore the possibility of utilizing existing recombination systems, to store information and perform computations. However, the only systems studied so far are not completely unidirectonal in their ability to flip a segment of DNA. Instead, previous systems have relied on “recombination directionality factors”, which when complexed with the unidirectional recombinase, reverse the direction in which it flips the DNA segment. The fim system from E. coli, has been shown to contain 2 unidirectional recombinases, hbif and fime, which flip a promoter containing segment of DNA. Our project seeks to engineer the fim switch by replacing the native promoter with another promoter. We demonstrate that it can function as a reliable and efficient biological transistor, or “transcriptor”. Beyond storing information and performing basic computations, the system would serve as a very useful, tightly controlled switch.:::2013
