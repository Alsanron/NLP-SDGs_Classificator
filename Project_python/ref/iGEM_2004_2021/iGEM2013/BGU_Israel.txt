BGU_Israel:::Europe:::Israel:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::P.A.S.E. - Programmable Autonomous Self Elimination:::Bioremediation and biosensors often require the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to the environment. After being released, these GMOs are no longer under direct control. As their effect on the environment is unknown, they pose a potential threat. In order to eliminate this threat, we are developing a genetic circuit, using e. coli as a model GMO, that limits the lifetime of a bacterial population after it is released to the environment. Our goal is to allow the end user to program a GMO population to survive in the environment until it has completed its task, after which the entire population will disappear without any further external intervention. We employ two approaches to achieve this goal: One relies on the dilution of a synthetic control element through cell division, and the second is based on the lifetime of an essential protein containing an unnatural amino acid.:::2013
