Shenzhen_SZMS:::Asia:::China:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::The biosensor of nitrate and nitrite::: Nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) are chemical roots of nitric acid (HNO3) and nitrous acid (HNO2) respectively. They exist in the aquatic environment, the living organisms and artificial products, as pollutants, which can cause food poisoning, cancers or even death. It's important to detect and eliminate such chemicals with the efficient methods. Based on the previous work of the UT Dallas 2010 and Cambridge 2009, the goal of our project is to provide an efficient and a more environment friendly method of detecting nitrates/nitrites and we strive to design biosensors to avoid the disadvantages of traditional methods. To be more specific, our team aims to create a new and efficient biosensor by adding our own design into the previous parts as improvement.:::2013
