OU-Norman_OK:::North America:::United States:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: A Shuttle Vector for Clostridial Chassis Organisms:::Concerns about energy security, sustainability, and the environmental impact of fossil fuels have renewed the interest of both the public and the scientific community in the development of renewable energy sources, including biofuels. Recent research in synthetic biology has resulted in the production of alcohols not known to be produced naturally, and the extension of carbon chain length. These systems have been expressed in E. coli. Historically, the alcohol titer obtained with native alcohol producers, such as Clostridium acetobutylicum, an acetone/butanol/ethanol producer, and Clostridium beijerinckii, an isopropanol/butanol/ethanol producer, has been greater than that obtained wtih non-native producers. One major problem with these systems is the lack of tools available for genetically manipulating them. The goal of our project has been to develop a shuttle vector that will allow the heterologous expression of these and similar biosynthetic pathways in these organisms.:::2013
