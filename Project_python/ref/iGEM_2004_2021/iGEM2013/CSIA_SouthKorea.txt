CSIA_SouthKorea:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of::::::High School:::Accepted:::Connecting ATP and redox pool to bioluminescence improvement.:::Our project aims to improve the bioluminescence system of Escherichia coli in which bioluminescene protein from Vibrio fischeri is expressed. The 2010 Cambridge iGEM team increased the duration of bioluminescence by making H-NS mutant E. coli strains, derepressing the Lux gene repression. We engineered E. coli to overexpress phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck) to harbor a high intracellular ATP concentration and express proteorhodopsin to make ATP production possible when nutrients were limited. However, contrary to our prediction, the intensity and duration of bioluminescence in E. coli did not increase. After further literature search, though, we discovered that replenishing FMNH2 is crucial in maintaining bioluminescence. Therefore, to maintain a high redox pool, our team will utilize pathways that can increase redox pool or couple ATP concentration with NAD+ reduction in response to ATP formation.:::2013
