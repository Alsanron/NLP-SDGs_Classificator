BIOSINT_Mexico:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Smartpro:::This year Biosint Mexico team will be developed a smart probiotic. Along the competition have been present several projects about probiotics, nevertheless the main disadvantage was that most of them were not being created in a lactobacillus strain. Because of this we constructed a Lactobacillus platform for others iGEM teams. Continuing with the idea of the smart probiotic system we include a sensor for xenobiotic substances that could detect and decrease intoxications by pesticides. Also the team implemented a kill switch for safety issues. This project contributes to resolve one of the Mexican food and health problems.:::2013
