Greensboro-Austin:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bioadhesive Production Using an Expanded Genetic Code:::	Mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs) are water-resistant bioadhesives that have a variety of biomedical and construction applications. Replicating the natural properties of MAPs through in vivo production using microbes is difficult as it depends on post-translational modifications, primarily the hydroxylation of tyrosine residues to L-DOPA. Since adhesiveness is correlated with L-DOPA content, our project aims to improve the adhesive properties of MAPs by utilizing a strain which inserts the non-canonical amino acid L-DOPA at UAG stop codons during translation. When combined with the in vivo production of free L-DOPA, this system is a significant step towards rapid, cost-effective MAPs production. Our team also worked on degrading odorous compounds, computationally modeled the detection of potentially dangerous oligo orders, and created BactoArt using inducible fluorescent proteins. Additionally, we created the Open Sequence Initiative, which is focused on updating the standards for submitting BioBricks to the iGEM Registry.:::2013
