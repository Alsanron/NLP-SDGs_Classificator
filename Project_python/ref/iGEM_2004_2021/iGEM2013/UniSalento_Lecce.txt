Our project aims to develop a living system in two easy monitorable bacterial platforms who would work as a Nickel detector and a Nickel remediation system. The devices are based on genetic parts from Helicobacter pylori: from the nickel sensing device, H.pylori NikR protein, to the Nickel storage system, Hpn protein, whose role is to store the Nickel ions inside the cell. The two devices are split in two separate populations, which intercommunicate through Quorum Sensing. The system allows to remove the Nickel ions from polluted environmental substrates through bioaccumulation and could be easily implemented in purification plants.:::2013
