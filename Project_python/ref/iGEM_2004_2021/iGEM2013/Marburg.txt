Marburg:::Europe:::Germany:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Phaectory: Antibodies grown with sunlight:::The use of proteins in medical treatment and diagnosis is steadily increasing. Many pharmaceutically relevant proteins, such as antibodies, have a complex biological structure with specific posttranslational modifications. Furthermore, these proteins need to be highly pure because of their use in diagnostics and treatment. Therefore, a major challenge is the development of systems that produce pure, posttranslational modified proteins - best at low costs. Recently, the sunlight-driven microalgae Phaeodactylum tricornutum has been established as an elegant tool for the production of proteins. A major - however yet unchallenged - advantage of this system is the production of advanced proteins with specific posttranslational modifications and the ability of their direct secretion into the medium allowing easy purification with low effort and costs. Our mission is to challenge Phaectory for the convenient production of antibodies and make the system accessible to following iGEM teams.:::2013
