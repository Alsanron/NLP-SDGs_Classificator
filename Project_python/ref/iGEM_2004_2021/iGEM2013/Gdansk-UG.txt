Gdansk-UG:::Europe:::Poland:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MetOli:::The aim of our project was to construct a biological system that would be able to detect methanol in ethanol solutions. Our idea was to create a test that could be performed not only in the laboratory, but also at home. We believe that such test would reduce the rate of intoxications by methanol during ethanol consumption. To achieve it, we used a methanol-dependent promoter from Methylobacterium organophilum which would control the production of a dye, for instance GFP, or an enzyme that would produce visible product, such as catechol oxidase. Our eventual goal is to find a bacterium that would not only react to methanol, but also survive in high concentrations of ethanol.:::2013
