BostonU:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Fuse, or Die: The Case for the MoClo Revolution:::In order for synthetic biologists to be able to use automation technologies, we need a well-characterized library of basic biological components that can then be used to design more complex systems. MoClo is a one-pot digestion-ligation assembly technique developed by Weber in 2011, which enables faster and more efficient construction of genetic circuits when compared to BioBricks, the current iGEM standard. With our project, we are proposing that iGEM teams replace the inefficient BioBricks format with MoClo. We have expanded our library of basic MoClo DNA Parts and characterized devices using various promoter-RBS combinations via flow cytometry. We also designed and implemented a standardized data sheet with a JavaScript software program in order to easily share our library and data with the community. Our MoClo library, characterization data, and data sheet tool fill an essential role in the implementation of automated synthetic biology protocols.:::2013
