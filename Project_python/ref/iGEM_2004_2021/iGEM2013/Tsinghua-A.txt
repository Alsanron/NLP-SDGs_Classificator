Tsinghua-A:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synthetic gene switch shows adaptation to DNA copy number variation:::In some natural and synthetic biological networks, DNA copy number which transfection into cells is fluctuantï¼Œinfluencing gene expression. We hope target gene expression level has a strong adaptability and ability to DNA copy number by using the method of engineering and bringing in incoherent feed-forward circuit. The robust circuits we designed may apply to cancer detection and gene therapy in the future. Generally speaking, we modeled three and four nodes motifs to find some appropriate circuits, which function reliably in the face of fluctuating stoichiometry of their molecular components. Two designed circuits have been tested and we found that the motifs has certain robustness to DNA copy number.:::2013
