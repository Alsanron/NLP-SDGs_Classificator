Osaka:::Asia:::Japan:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Beat the discrimination against E.coli !:::Since the middle of the 20th century, Escherichia coli(E.coli) have made great contributions to various field of our society. Although they have played essential roles in the society, it seems that they are not properly appreciated by general public. People's common images to E.coli are very negative (dirty, stinky, dangerous etc). So in our project, to wipe away the negative images to E.coli, we have created a circle that enable them to communicate with each other via nutrient production.And we made “empathetic E.coli” that lives cooperatively with each other. Then, by conducting experiments and using computer simulation, we have examined how they live and grow in liquid medium culture and what kind of pattern they form on solid medium culture.:::2013
