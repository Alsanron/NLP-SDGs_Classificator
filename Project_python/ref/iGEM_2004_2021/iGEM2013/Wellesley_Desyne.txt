Wellesley_Desyne:::North America:::United States:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Enhancing Bio-Design with Next-Generation Human-Computer Interaction:::Systems that integrate the wide array of technological tools available to synthetic biologists are needed more than ever. As the field of synthetic biology continues to advance, it is critical to communicate the applications, goals, and limitations of synbio research to the public. Our team is creating a software suite, which addresses technical synbio challenges while improving end-user experience and harnessing human-computer interaction (HCI) to engage the public in synbio concepts. Eugenie is a visual language and integrated development environment for Eugene that allows biologists to specify biological parts, properties, and device composition rules. zTree is a tool for visually representing the Registry of Standard Biological Parts to support sense-making of complex, hierarchical data sets. Bac to the Future is a web-based, interactive application that utilizes Twitter to illustrate synbio ideas to the public. The application of HCI techniques to synbio fosters more effective, collaborative, and intuitive software tools.:::2013
