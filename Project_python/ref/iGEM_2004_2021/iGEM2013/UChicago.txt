UChicago:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Keratinase Expression System in E. coli and B. subtilis:::Each year, the poultry industry produces over two billion pounds of feather waste that is mostly processed into nutrient-poor animal feed but recent research has shown that feather keratin can be used to produce biodegradable plastics, fertilizers, detergents, and pharmaceuticals. However, current chemical methods for keratin degradation are energetically costly and previous efforts at keratinase production in heterologous hosts have been stymied by poor protease expression. To address both these problems, our team constructed BioBricks based on kerA, a serine keratinase gene native to B. licheniformis active on whole poultry feathers. We designed two biobricks for expression in E. coli and constructed a high copy number BioBrick plasmid with an origin of replication compatible with B. subtilis. By designing a new keratinase expression system in B. subtilis, we hope to provide a faster, cheaper alternative to current methods of industrial keratinase production.:::2013
