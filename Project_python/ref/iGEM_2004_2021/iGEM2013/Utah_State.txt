Utah_State:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AMPed up E. coli:::Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are peptides that have activity against a wide range of microorganisms. AMPs can vary greatly in their size, structure, and mode of antimicrobial activity. Due to the immense interest in both testing and characterizing AMPs (from various forms of life) a sustainable method to produce and purify them is necessary. Using Synthetic Biology as a platform, the production of AMPs in E.coli could potentially offer a cost-effective approach for large-scale peptide manufacture, as opposed to isolation from natural sources. After successfully manufacturing several AMPs using E.coli, these peptides will be tested on a wide variety of organisms to screen for antimicrobial activity.:::2013
