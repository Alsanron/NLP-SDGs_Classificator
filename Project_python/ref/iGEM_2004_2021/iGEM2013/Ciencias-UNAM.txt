Ciencias-UNAM:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Skully coli:::The human peptide LL-37 is an antimicrobial peptide shown to protect against H.pylori and other pathogenic bacteria. Synthetic expression of active LL-37 in vivo is challenging due to the cytotoxic effects it has in the host. To make a resistant host that can export LL-37 to the media we intend to overexpress the E.coli acrAB and tolC operons, which activate the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, a mechanism related with resistance to this and similar peptides by expulsion. To create a system in which E.coli expels LL-37 only in the presence of specific pathogenic bacteria, we use the LsrA promoter, which allows transcription in the presence of AI-2, a molecule produced by these bacteria to communicate via quorum-sensing. To avoid self-induction we designed an antisense RNA with specific secondary structure to inhibit the translation of LuxS, the enzyme responsible of the production of AI-2 in E.coli.:::2013
