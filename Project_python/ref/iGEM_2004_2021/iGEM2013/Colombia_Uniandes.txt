Colombia_Uniandes:::Latin America:::Colombia:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Nicko & Chimi: The magneto and the chimera:::This year we are developing two projects: The first one, that we call Nicko, is an alternative solution for water pollution caused mainly by mining, it is a system capable to detect and absorb nickel, to later be removed magnetically, using parts of the homeostatic system of E. coli and Ralstonia metallidurans and the magnetotactic property from Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 which will be used as our final chassis. The second one, Chimi, is a stress-tester for animals (or even humans). It is based in a glucocorticoid sensor that is able to discern between basal levels and stress levels of glucocorticoid hormones in a sample with an easily recognizable signal, such as color, to allow the sensor to be used in the field, household or the laboratory.:::2013
