LZU-China:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Twinkle Cancer Hunter:::To construct a regulating vector of NF-κB signaling pathway by gene recombination technology, introducing into tumor cells with NF-κB to form a signal feedback control system. Using NF-κB binding elements as promoter,and IκB-GFP fusion protein as reporter.Then inverted into HEK-293T cells and DU-145 cells.Through the observation of the GFP to probe the expression of IκB. The expressed protein was identified by Western blot, etc.The constructing of a regulating vector of NF-κB signaling pathway provides a new method and thought for tumor gene therapy, and propel forward the research of NF-κB signaling pathway.:::2013
