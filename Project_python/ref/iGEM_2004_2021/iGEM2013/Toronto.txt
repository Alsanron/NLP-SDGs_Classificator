Toronto:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biofilm: System engineering in E. coli:::Microorganisms frequently adopt a lifestyle in which they excrete extracellular biopolymers to aggregate and form biofilms. We are researching the pathways that induce biofilm formation and maturation in E. coli, for modulating surface-specific adhesion of E. coli biofilms. We are constructing and characterizing E. coli strains with targeted deletions or recombinant protein expressions that are crucial in biofilm formation pathways. In response to environmental stimuli such as temperature, blue light, or sodium, the phenotype of each mutant E. coli strain will be characterized using a specially developed high-throughput protocol. Biofilm formation control has applications for bioremediation, in which we are pursuing in a related project on heavy metal precipitation. Another potential application is in medical treatment of pathogenic infections, since the generally slow diffusion rate in biofilms gives pathogenic bacteria/fungi an additional mechanism for antibiotic resistance phenotypes.:::2013
