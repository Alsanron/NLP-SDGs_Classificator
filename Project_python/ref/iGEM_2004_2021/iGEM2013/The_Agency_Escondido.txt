The_Agency_Escondido:::North America:::United States::: :::High School:::Accepted:::ROSHAMBiO:::Our game of Rock, Paper, Scissors (ROSHAMBiO) has three different E.Coli systems. Each strain is composed of an inducer coding region upstream of an inducible promoter, and a fluorescent protein (green, red, or cyan). When two different strains are inoculated and mixed on the same agar plate, an inducer coded by the losing strain will contact the winning strains promoter, causing the victor strain's expression of fluorescent protein. The victor will be visually identifiable because of its specific fluorescent protein. Our design is dependent on successful extracellular signaling by the inducers' hydrophobic behavior; only a hydrophobic inducer will be able to travel across cells. We will be using this experiment to test Lamda cl repressor's and Lux cassete protein's solubility in water.:::2013
