HUST-China:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Antihypertensive Ecoli::: Hypertension causes grave concern worldwide for its notoriety, there’re not many therapeutic methods to hypertension besides various antihypertensive drugs. However, this comes along with heavy financial burden to developing or underdeveloped countries. In addition, almost all these drugs have side effects to liver and renal. Here is a novel method to treat Hypertension by constructing human-friendly engineering bacteria that can produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) periodically and naturally to help maintain the blood pressure in safe level. SCFA, especially acetate and propionate, has been proved to induce vasodilatation and ensuing hypotensive response via receptors in smooth muscle cells of vessels. This year we have found a metabolic pathway in Escherichia coli that converts succinate to propionate through Wood-Werkman reaction. An operon consisting four genes encodes enzymes in this pathway. By combining bio-oscillator and key gene together, we want to make E. Coli release propionate periodically in patients’ intestine periodically.:::2013
