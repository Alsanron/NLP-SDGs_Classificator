IIT_Delhi:::Asia:::India:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::pHColi:::pH induced response elicited by certain promoters in bacteria may have major practical applications. The response can be targeted for specific pH ranges, for example in tracking the anomalies associated with the gut micro-biota or detecting pH inside a bioreactor. There are only limited studies reported in the area. In the present project, a genetic circuit has been created, using the promoters of the acid shock response gene from E.coli and the F0F1 ATPase operon from C. glutamicum that produces a pH dependent colour gradient, much like a universal pH indicator. A mathematical model has been developed to simulate the experimental findings. The present study will form the basis for further research in the field of synthetic biology.:::2013
