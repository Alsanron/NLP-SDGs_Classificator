Consort_Alberta:::North America:::Canada:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::ECOS (Environmental COntaminant Sensor):::The aim of this yearâ€™s Consort high-school iGEM project is to engineer a bacterial strain which can be used to test xylene levels. Every time the oil is transferred there is an opportunity for some spillage. Our project would allow anyone to easily and quickly differentiate between more and less dangerous spills. Early identification of contamination will facilitate rapid clean-up and minimize health risks. Our project has been the development of ECOS (Environmental COntaminant Sensor). The heart of the sensor is an E. coli culture that has been modified to produce GFP when exposed to xylene. Xylene was chosen as a trigger because its presence is well correlated with the presence of the more dangerous benzene/benzene derivatives which are carcinogenic. The XylR transcriptional activator is a protein which in the presence of m-xylene will bind to the Pu promoter resulting in the expression of green fluorescent protein.:::2013
