NTU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::YeasTherm - against the cold:::During winter season, due to low temperatures, fish farming is one of the most heavily affected economic venues. Due to this, year after year, several farmers are faced with many problems as a result of a loss of fish product. Using our background in bioengineering we suggest an innovative alternative: Our idea is based on heterologues expression of SrUCP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rhodotorula glutinis. Through the expression plasmid, yeasts are transformed from the wild-type phenotype into a thermogenic phenotype. To implement this idea and make it simple and efficient, we plan to drive the expression of SrUCP under the control of cold shock promoter Tir1. In this way, yeasts will generate heat only when the temperatures drop. Moreover, the temperature-responsive range of Tir1 may be regulated by applying genetic circuits, providing the means to manipulate the biological device to suit different temperature conditions and needs in application.:::2013
