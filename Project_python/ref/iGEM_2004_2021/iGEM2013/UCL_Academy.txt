UCL_Academy:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Mutare Papyrum:::12.5 million tonnes of paper and cardboard are used annually in the UK. We are proposing an alternative solution, a home system that converts cellulose into glucose that allows the up-cycling of paper into a commercial product of PHBs. Consumers who have the home system would be able to rather than put the bio-plastic into a recycling bin to be collected, they can instead exchange their bio-plastic for money. Exchanging recyclable objects for monetary gain, has been used in many European countries where the consumer exchanges plastic and glass bottles. We decided to construct a two stage apparatus containing two reactors- first reactor contains cellulolytic enzymes that output glucose. A filtered feed from the first enters the second (containing Cupriavidus metallidurans), a PHB producing organism. Ideally we would like both parts to be contained in one stage reactor where all organisms and enzymes would be placed in one compartment.:::2013
