Beijing_HDFLS_High:::Asia:::China:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::The UV-responsive wintergreen odor generator:::The UV-responsive wintergreen odor generator catalyzes the conversion of the precursor salicylic acid to the wintergreen odor methyl salicylate under extensive UV irradiation. The biosynthetic device is composed of two transcriptional devices: Rec A (SOS) promoter (BBa_J22106) and a wintergreen odor enzyme generator (BBa_J45119). The odor generator takes as input extensive UV irradiation and produce as output an enzyme that catalyzes production of an odor from a chemical precursor.:::2013
