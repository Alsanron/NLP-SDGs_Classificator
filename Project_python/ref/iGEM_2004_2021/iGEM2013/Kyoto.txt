Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cycoli:::Every organism has its own cycle such as the periodicity of cell division, ordered patterns of its body. Some kinds of the cycles are regulated just by two factors. Using E. coli, we applied this kind of periodicity formation. Firstly, we focused on oscillation regulated by RNA. We suspected if RNA world hypothesis is correct, there could be protein-depended oscillatory system. To show the possibility of cycle formation by RNA, we constructed an oscillator by utilizing two different types of functional RNA, which are transcriptional activator and repressor. Secondly, we also targeted on planar oscillation forming mechanism. A. Turing (1952) suggested a simple principle containing just two variables which explains many organisms’ epidermal pattern formation. However, it is not confirmed whether the pattern formation is only based on Turing’s discourses. To check this, we used two types of E. coli, which secrete different factors, and regulated their population.:::2013
