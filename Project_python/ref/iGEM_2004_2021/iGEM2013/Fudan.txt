Fudan:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ALeader: leading the advance of RNA synthetic biology:::RNA regulation patterns, which have not been fully understood so far, is a research hotspot still deserving exploiting. A recently-discovered riboswitch ALeader updated our ideas by its delicate, 75nt-structure consisting of an aptamer, a recombination site, and even a bicistron motif. Inspired by this natural design, we proposed a series of novel strategies this summer, with dynamic rather than static perspectives. Guided by the theoretical study on functional multistable states and semi-static states of a riboswitch, and the kinetics involving impacts from other systems such as CRISPR, RNA polymerases, ribosomes, and degradation complex, the ALeader-based functional multi-phase and tricistron switches are designed. We also tried to regulate aptamerâ€™s function by manipulating its working environment instead of itself, with SpinachALeader-based real-time monitors to avoid the signal distortion. Furthermore, to demonstrate the advantages of RNA biobricks, we constructed an antibiotic-detector with ALeader, optimized by a network with a RNA-OUT/IN translational regulatory system.:::2013
