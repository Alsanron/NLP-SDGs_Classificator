AMU-Poznan:::Europe:::Poland:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::sh-miR designer - tool for construction of RNA interference reagents: sh-miRs:::sh-miR Designer will be a software aimed at fast and efficient design of effective RNA interference (RNAi) reagents - sh-miRs, also known as artificial miRNAs. sh-miRs are RNA particles whose structure is based on miRNA precursor pri-miRNA, but sequence interacting with transcript is changed depending on research purpose. Maintenance of structure of pri-miRNA is very important to enable cellular processing and therefore ensure functionality of artificial particles. sh-miRs delivered to cells on genetic vectors - plasmids or viral vectors - enter natural RNAi pathway and silence target mRNA. They can be used in genetic therapies and basic biomedical research.:::2013
