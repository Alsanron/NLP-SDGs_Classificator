The design is based on cell surface display of nacrein in E.coli. Nacrein is a major protein component in nacre(an organic-inorganic composite layer found in outer coating of pearls). We divided nacrein into functional regions - carbonic anhydrase(CA), calcium binding and scaffold repeats. CA domain fixes CO2 into carbonic acid changing to bicarbonate ion in aqueous solution. We will examine if displayed nacrein in E. coli can make a pearl powder in a solution or fabricate a nacre-like structure while atmospheric CO2 is fixed into bicarbonate. Once a nacre material can be prepared from Pearl-coli, we will grow E. coli in a confined container to make synthetic pearl. The Pearl-coli has dual-function such as (1) mitigate the global warming by CO2 reduction, (2) prepare valuable pearl-like raw materials.:::2013
