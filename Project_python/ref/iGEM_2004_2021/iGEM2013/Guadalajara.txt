Guadalajara:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. coli Metascillator:::We aim to improve complex biomass treatment programs by engineering new metabolic pathways in E. coli cells. Tequila distilleries in Mexico produce large amounts of vinasses (complex biomass with high biochemical oxygen demand) that are difficult to treat with current bioremediation technologies. We are trying to simplify this treatment process by transforming E. coli cells with enzymes and metabolites that participate in the anaerobic digestion of these vinasses. We have designed regulatory networks that allow us to control the expression of specific metabolites at different timepoints of the treatment program. We believe this method will prove superior to the "free-for-all" microbial consortium approach that is currently employed by government agencies and the alcohol industry to biologically digest vinasses.:::2013
