Manaus_Amazonas-Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Electrobacter: from used frying oil to electricity:::Used-frying-oil is produced in deep-fried food preparations and is one of the most serious environment hazards.In our project we are using the Shewanella which is a genus of proteobacteria widely found in Amazon region(called also as Shewie).They can reduce long-chain fatty acids, being a versatile new chassis to study and work in the iGEM competition. The fat acid degradation via Beta-oxidation is done by enzymes which expression is regulated by the genes FadR, FadL, FadD, FadE producing acetyl –CoA. All these features are remarkable for bioremediation of fat and oil spills.Besides that,is also known for its ability in “delivering” electrons to external media.we modified Shewie β-oxidation pathway silencing regulators and enhancing expression of some genes for fat degradation.In this years' project we aim to make a micro power plant using a bacteria hungry for used-frying-oil.:::2013
