Tsinghua:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mobile Health---Pathogen detector:::In a long term, the testing of pathogenic diseases is via comparably complex procedures. This year, we aim to design a sensing yeast powder based portable test paper, that is, the " mobile" testing system, take advantage of querom sensing system in bacteria, to achieve the testing of specific microorganism caused disease. In the same time, we built a frame of testing any pathogen that will cause diseases, using different the input and output combination. Furthermore, in order to achieve the simultaneous testing of different pathogens, we design a “fast-shifting box” to accomplish the combination of input and output signaling. This will in theory:::2013
