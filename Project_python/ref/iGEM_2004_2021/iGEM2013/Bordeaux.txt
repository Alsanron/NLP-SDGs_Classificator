Bordeaux:::Europe:::France:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Dairy Planet:::The economical stakes of food-processing industry have always been a concern in society. Technological innovations have improved the yield and production costs of daily use products. Advances in health sector and biotechnology made it possible to offer food products rich in substances that are nutritious and possess medicinal properties. Our project aims at producing a new range of lactic cultures able to produce natural flavours and colouring substances in a yogurt; including ones producing resveratrol, a molecule responsible for the red wine beneficial effects, implicated in the "French paradox‚Äù. Necessary routes of biosynthesis will be introduced in Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, agents of lactic fermentation. Thus, a work of optimization on the genetical modifications of lactic bacteria has been done. This project will allow an easier production of custom yogurts with beneficial and healing properties, avoiding the use of substances derived from expensive chemical synthesis harmful to the environment.:::2013
