Yale:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Converting E. coli into a foundry for bioplastics:::Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a biodegradable, biocompatible, bioresorbable, thermoplastic bioplastic that offers many advantages over other biomaterials in both commercial and medical applications. The current chemical method of synthesizing PLA is expensive, and the required processing and purifying steps use many environmentally unfriendly chemicals. Recently, E. coli has been engineered to produce PLA, but low yields and short chain lengths prevent the approach’s commercial use. Here, we evaluate the potential of using multiplex automated genome engineering to raise both yields and chain lengths of biosynthesized PLA by directing the E. coli metabolism to funnel resources toward PLA production without sacrificing the organism’s viability. Efficient biosynthesis of PLA, which may be thus achieved, would be a significant step in reducing the impact of plastic waste, and would benefit those receiving bone implants. It would also open up a new possibility in rapid manufacturing of personalized bone implants using three-dimensional printers.:::2013
