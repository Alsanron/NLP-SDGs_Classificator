UCL_PG:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Spectra:::Spectra aim to use a novel configuration of synthetic gene networks (SGNs) to drive evolution of a fluorescent protein with dramatically improved spectroscopic properties. In future we intend to use the capabilities this enhanced fluorescent protein will provide to enable better dissection of differentiation pathways in stem cells.:::2013
