BYU_Provo:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Phage Pharming: Two Approaches to Expanding the Use of Bacteriophage in Synthetic Biology:::Bacteriophages are the most abundant organism on the planet, yet most are still uncharacterized. Current research is focused on finding new ways to use bacteriophage either in their wild-type state or after they have been modified for use in synthetic biology. We studied two ways to modify existing well-characterized bacteriophages. First, we employed random mutagenesis, CsCl purification, and plaque-size selection to isolate T4 and T7 bacteriophage with altered capsid sizes. A library of capsid sizes will allow researchers to select the appropriate bacteriophage for use in biotechnology or nanotechnology applications. Second, we designed a cholera sensing and destruction circuit using bacteriophage lambda. In this circuit, lambda contains biofilm-degrading enzymes controlled by a cholera quorum-sensing system transferred to E. coli. Upon sensing cholera, this E. coli will activate lambda, leading to cell lysis and biofilm degradation. This research demonstrates the versatility and utility of bacteriophages in the field of synthetic biology.:::2013
