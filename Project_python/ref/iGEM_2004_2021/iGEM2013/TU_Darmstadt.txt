TU_Darmstadt:::Europe:::Germany:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hunting Fungi:::The danger of fungal contamination of grains and cereals but also other food sources has severe consequences. Undetected contaminations can render large quantities of food stocks useless â€“ with detrimental effects on the economy and the food supply. We want to develop a handy device which allows an easy, fast and reliable detection of mycotoxins. For that our team uses various methods from the fields of synthetic biology, electrical engineering and information processing. Our system relies on E. coli with modified TAR receptor interacting with specific mycotoxins. If these are present in the sample they induce a conformational change of TAR and thereby generates a measurable FRET-beacon by bringing two fluorophores in close distance to each other. The modified E. coli will be embedded in exchangeable capsules. Together with a handheld-device and a controlling Smartphone App they will guarantee that measurements can be done quickly, easy to operate and secure.:::2013
