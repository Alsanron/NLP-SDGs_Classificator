UT-Tokyo:::Asia:::Japan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Multicellular Analog Clock:::We designed a "multicellular" E.coli clock with a clock hand. Your naked eyes see the red clock hand moving along a circle of E. coli population on an agar plate. The clock hand, expression of mCherry gene, is driven by an “engine” which is constructed under the inspiration of the mechanism of action potential conduction in nerve cells. The engine consists of a positive feedback loop of AHL and negative feedback loops of TetR, AiiA and 2 types of artificial sRNA. We also designed UV reset devices using UV sensor construct. In addition, small RNAs were designed for metabolic engineering of E. coli, which is the first trial in iGEM competition. We show you the new and easy approach in genetic engineering with the BioBrick parts, which will lead to future application of sRNAs in synthetic biology.:::2013
