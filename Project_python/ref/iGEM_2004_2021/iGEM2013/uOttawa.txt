uOttawa:::North America:::Canada:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Fold-change molecule detection using the Type-I Incoherent Feedforward Loop:::Many synthetic gene networks are susceptible to cellular noise, as they rely upon the absolute levels of gene regulators which can vary greatly between individual cells. To address this, uOttawa has engineered a network in S. cerevisiae that is responsive to fold-changes as opposed to absolute changes in stimulus. This allows the network to maintain sensitivity despite noise, and also permits response to stimuli in a much larger dynamic range. By modifying the promoter driving the stimulus, the network can be engineered to detect fold-changes of any molecule with a responsive promoter, thereby serving as a structural chassis for the next generation of molecule detectors. In addition, we have also authored a children's book aimed at disseminating the concepts of synthetic biology to the public, and have designed an online interface that will facilitate the rapid construction of devices built from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.:::2013
