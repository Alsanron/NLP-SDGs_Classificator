SYSU-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CAST (Computer Aided Synbio Tool)- An Integrated Tool for Synthetic Biology:::Accurate simulation and gene circuit design are essential but difficult parts in synthetic biology.Here, we designed CAST to cover the workflow from beginning to end, users can focus on function design and the gene circuit would be automatically designed. Furthermore, we developed a new simulation model that work with standard dynamic characteristic and verified by wetlab experiments. Moreover, we build an expandable database that users can contribute their own dynamic information which would lead to more accurate and sufficient dynamic information of all the Biobricks. Finally, our software is designed as an easy deployed server so that it can be used on personal purpose or shared by a whole lab or institution.:::2013
