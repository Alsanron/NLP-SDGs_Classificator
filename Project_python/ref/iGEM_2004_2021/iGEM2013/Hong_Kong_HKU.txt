Removal of phosphate from wastewater is required to treat phosphate-containing discharge to reduce eutrophication, algal blooms and “dead zones” in lakes, rivers and coastal marine ecosystems. The aim of this project was to remove or reduce the levels of inorganic phosphate from a system or environment by employing engineered bacteria E. capsi, capable of accumulating phosphate in the form of polyphosphate. Our strategy is to express polyphosphate kinase together with the ethanolamine utilization (eut) bacterial microcompartment from Salmonella enterica to provide an environment for polyphosphate synthesis. Furthermore, the project provides a novel way to recover accumulated polyphosphate, an energy rich macromolecule with many industrial uses. This paves a way towards living system-based phosphate pollution treatment to tackle critical environmental challenges.:::2013
