Current methods are costly, which is a major deterrent for research on these applications. We have designed a system consisting of three strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) which will convert spent grain waste from breweries into Eucalyptol. The design utilizes two strains of E. coli overexpressing and secreting enzymes to degrade hemicellulose into xylose. The third strain of E. coli will utilize the xylose and convert the molecule into Eucalyptol using the Mevalonate pathway. A scale-up model was developed to assess industrial feasibility. The cost of production would drop two-thirds, which would make industrial uses plausible. Future studies will be transforming our E. coli with the genes of interest and testing for production of Eucalyptol.:::2013
