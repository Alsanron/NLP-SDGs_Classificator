Valencia-CIPF:::Europe:::Spain:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Project - Freshellent Yeast:::Our team will try to develop a project based on the production of aromas and repellents. The aim is to create a biological platform within a model organism, such as common yeast, to develop an alternative method for production of several aromatic monoterpenoids. The advantage of this organism as producer lies in its capabilities of genetic modification, robustness and culture simplicity. We can also control the production of these compounds using different promoters, so we can choose our favourite aroma while there is repellent activity. The microorganism is completely harmless as it is responsible for fermenting bread and beer. The project aims to establish the basis for future production of repellents in a sustainable and organical manner in developing homes that are under the risk of pandemics caused by mosquitoes and other insects.:::2013
