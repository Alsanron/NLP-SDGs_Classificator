ATOMS-Turkiye:::Europe:::Turkey:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Project Oncoli:::According to the World Cancer Research Fund, the estimated number of cancer cases around the world every year is 12.7 million and is expected to increase up to 21 million by the year 2030. Taking this widely popular and alarming obstacle into attention, we have devised a system which is aiming to tackle cancer from a very different perspective to before. Our choice of bacteria Nissle 1917, a probiotic strain of Escherichia Coli, once inside the body will secrete a cancer tracing protein which recognizes and builds up around the cancer cells. Using the quorum sensing system, E.coli Nissle 1917 detects the bacteria inducing substance AI-2 produced by the tracing proteins. Nissle 1917 bacteria motion towards the region of AI-2 and once in the region, produce our cancer killing protein called apoptin. Apoptin enters the cancer cells and induces apoptosis thereby eliminating their existence.:::2013
