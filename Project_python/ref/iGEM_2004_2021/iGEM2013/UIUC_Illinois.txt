UIUC_Illinois:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cardiobiotics - A Genetically Engineered Approach to Cardiovascular Health:::Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of death in the United States for over twenty years and is a rising global health issue. Recent studies demonstrate a correlation between CVD and atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the arteries. One associated risk for atherosclerosis is the production of Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) by natural gut flora when metabolizing L-carnitine, a chemical found primarily in red meat and energy drinks. We created a probiotic to attack the root of this problem by outcompeting the gut bacteria for L-carnitine in order to suppress the production of TMAO. L-carnitine transporters (caiX and cbcWV) and L-carnitine dehydrogenase (CDH) derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were expressed in a safe strain of E. coli (Nissle 1917). This engineered E. coli can uptake and metabolize L-carnitine along an alternative, safe pathway into 3-dehydrocarnitine. Together, this system offers a novel solution in preventing TMAO-related cardiovascular health conditions.:::2013
