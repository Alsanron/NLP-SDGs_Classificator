Linkoping_Sweden:::Europe:::Sweden:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A novel immunochemical detection system for food allergens.:::Antibodies are usefull for recognition of antigens in food. Antibodies have, however, a very complex structure that is not suitable for expression in E. Coli. The Camelid antibody IgG (cIgG), however, has lower complexity than the Human IgG. We present a new approach for recognition of food allergens with a synthetizised cIgG for expression in E. Coli. The epitope of cIgG is designed for Hen Egg White Lysosyme (HEWL). The cIgG is designed with a linker that connects to the bioluminescent enzyme Luciferase. We also synthetizised an HEWL antigen carrying the protein RFP, A-HRFP, that reacts to the luminescence of luciferase as the A-HRFP attaches to the cIgG. The recognition of HEWL in a sample leads to the release of luminescent green-light as a result of HEWL binding to the cIgG. If, however, no HEWL antigen is present in the sample, A-HRFP binds to cIgG resulting in a luminescent red-shift.:::2013
