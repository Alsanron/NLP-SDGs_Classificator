Coli into a Nitrogen Bio-Fertilizer Using a Cyanobacterial nif Cluster: an iGEM project:::The nif cluster of Cyanothece 51142 consists of 29 genes that construct and regulate a nitrogenase protein complex. This year, our iGEM team worked on harnessing the power of nif to produce ammonia in Escherichia coli. After synthesizing a nif-containing plasmid (28 kbp) using the DNA assembler method (Shao et al 2009) and transforming that plasmid into E. coli, our team tested for nitrogenase activity using the acetylene reduction assay. The transformed E. coli were then compared to wild-type under limited nitrogen conditions to check for a competitive advantage. Tests were used to evaluate the expression of various nitrogenase subunits. Our team also aimed to further characterize the promoter sequences of the Cyanothece 51142 nif cluster. Between the cysE and nifB genes, there is a 958bp uncharacterized, bidirectional promoter region of particular interest. We used fluorescent reporters to identify key regions within this promoter sequence under various environmental conditions.:::2013
