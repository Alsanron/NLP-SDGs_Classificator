Shenzhen_BGIC_0101:::Asia:::China:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genovo:::Genovo is a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tool used for denovo design of genome. The current version consists of 4 parts. The first, Chromosome Construction will grap genes in a common pathway and chromosome features to build a new genome and let user to define the order and orientation in drap-drop way. The second, Nucleotide Modification will optimize and soften the sequence of CDSs. It also help design the CRIPSR sites so that we can silence the wild type genes. The third, Chromosome Segmentation will cut chromosome into pieces and add 3A & Gibson & Goldengate & Homologous Recombination adaptors to the pieces automatically for assembly. The last one, OLS Design will guide users to gain the chromosome by microarray. Genovo will enable user to design their innovative chromosome as their wishes and further the research on genome on pathway level.:::2013
