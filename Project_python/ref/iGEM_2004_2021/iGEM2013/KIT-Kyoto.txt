KIT-Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Fregrance coli:::We are trying to construct a novel E.coli that has fruity flavor like Japanese rice wine (Japanese sake). In order to accomplish the purpose, yeast genes related with production of the Japanese sake fragrance were introduced into E. coli cells. We also tried to develop a way to eliminate bad smells of E. coli in parallel. Although we previously won a gold prize by the development of a novel pen (E. coli Pen) in 2010, its bad smells were weak points and must be improved. We will overcome this problem through the progress of our new project in 2013. So far, “smell” is not a popular keyword and not a major field in iGEM. However, we believe that our project will provide a new point of view to iGEM friends:::2013
