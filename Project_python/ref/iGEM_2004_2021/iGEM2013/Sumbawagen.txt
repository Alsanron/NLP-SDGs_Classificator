Sumbawagen:::Asia:::Indonesia:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. coli which able to measure the level of sugar in honey by emitting light:::Glucose and fructose are major sugar component of honey. Sumbawa honey is protected as geographical indication by Indonesian patent office. Sode Lab at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology has created a fusion of mutant glucose binding protein and firefly luciferase, which able to measure glucose level by emitting light - intended initially for blood glucose sensor application (Taneoka et al, 2009). In this project, we plan to create this construct in Biobrick format, and evaluate the ability of transgenic E. coli for the measurement of glucose in honey. Our final goal is to create a device which can be used for quality control of Sumbawa honey, which we call "ECONEY".:::2013
