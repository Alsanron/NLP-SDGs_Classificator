York_UK:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Electricus Aureus: Our greatest source of power comes from the smallest organisms on Earth:::We envisage a world where your mobile phone my one day be powered by synthetically engineered microorganisms, when non-renewable energy is a thing of the past. Our project comes at a time when all sources of energy are fighting to be the lesser of many evils; we would therefore like to propose a cheaper, greener and more effective source of energy. Currently, fuel cells do not produce sufficient power to be used for household appliances. Our genetically engineered organism will help us change this and be the first step in the Renewable Revolution. Bacteria are the most abundant form of life on Earth, they survive in harsh environments and they divide rapidly. Thus, they can be a renewable, sustainable source of energy. Our organism will deposit gold nanoparticles on the battery to increase its conductivity. These gold ions come from toxic pharmaceutical waste which is extremely harmful to the environment.:::2013
