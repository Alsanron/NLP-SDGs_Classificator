AUC_TURKEY:::Europe:::Turkey:::New Application(P):::High School:::Accepted:::BactoCooler:::​Just like how it has been in the past, cooling is still a problem today. With the BactoCooler that we have designed, we plan to introduce a synthetic solution to the problem. We will make our engineered bacteria conduct a high efficiency cooling reaction. ​For the endothermic reaction, we were required to select an organic one. After our research and consultation with chemists, we designated the breakdown of urea. For our bacteria to do this at a significant rate, we are required to use the urease enzyme. ​Although this cooling is useful and wonderful, there are certain situations in which there is no need for cooling so we had to implement a control mechanism. For the heat sensitive control mechanism, we used the RNA Thermometer. ​With our BactoCooler’s design, we will make a controlled and efficient cooling system. Watch out for us, Global Warming!:::2013
