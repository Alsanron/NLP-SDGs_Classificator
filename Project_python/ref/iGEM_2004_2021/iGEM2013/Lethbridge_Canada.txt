A Synthetic Biology Approach to the Production of Natural Oxytocin:::This project revolves around the production of the hormone oxytocin within a bacterial cell. Due to the short half-life of the hormone, it is difficult to study and expensive to store and transport. The ultimate goal is to allow for oxytocin to be produced quickly, efficiently, and inexpensively to allow healthcare professionals and researchers access to a hormone that is not yet well understood. To accomplish this we will be constructing two separate systems: one to produce the Oxytocin-Neurophysin compound, and the other to produce NEC1, a cleavage enzyme responsible for detaching oxytocin from itâ€™s carrier molecule which stabilizes oxytocin. The second system will be optimized to produce NEC1 at a rate that will allow maximal efficiency between production and cleavage. Upon completion, we intend to thoroughly characterize our parts and then submit them to the registry. Our human practices component is rooted in public education about synthetic biology.":::2013
