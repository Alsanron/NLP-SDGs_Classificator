Bonn:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::LOV Wars - May the light be with you:::A reliable, yet easily adaptable mechanism for controlling protein activity is key to most areas of life and medical science research. Still, the most common approaches suffer from various flaws. iGEM Bonn 2013 aims to overcome these drawbacks by engineering a novel tool based on blue light-inducible degradation of targeted proteins. The use of a modified ClpXP protease system allows a significant increase in rate and scale of activity change while keeping the modification of the target protein to a minimum. Combining this system with a tool for photo-activatable heterodimerisation based on a LOV domain results in a superior tempero-spatial control. To demonstrate the capabilities of our device, we designed a photosensitive kill-switch. This contributes to the security of synthetic biology in such a way that bacteria accidentally brought out of a safe work environment, for example a red-light-hood, would be killed by sunlight within a short period of time.:::2013
