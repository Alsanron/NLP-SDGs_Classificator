HZAU-China:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Safe moving vaccine factory:::For HZAU-2013iGEM project, we are creating a safe moving vaccine factory by synthetic biology which can spread Rabies vaccine in dogs rapidly and actively. Our aim is to help in the achievement of the WHO goal of being free of human rabies by 2020 through the improvement of the vaccination coverage in dogs. The idea comes from Yersinia pestis and fleas. We make use of fleas as our moving injector. When flea feed blood from dogs, our vaccine vector Bacillus subtilis will be regurgitated into blood and successfully transferred to mammalian host. Bacillus subtilis can express antigens which can stimulate the immunity of dogs. Meanwhile, endogenous or exogenous expression of "Antimicrobial Peptides" by B. subtilis can kill Yersinia pestis in fleas. In this way we achieved a safe moving vaccine factory.:::2013
