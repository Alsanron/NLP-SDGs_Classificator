Westminster:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hungry for chitin:::This year the Westminster iGEM team are tackling the growing bed bug problem. Serratia marcescens has been identified as an efficient chitin degrader, however as it is a pathogenic organism it can not be used as a biocontrol agent. Our idea is to use the chitin genes from this bacterium and create a chitin degrading E.coli. We will test the efficiency of the activity of chitinase which is expressed by our engineered E.coli compared to that of S. marcescens by using a chitin azure assay.:::2013
