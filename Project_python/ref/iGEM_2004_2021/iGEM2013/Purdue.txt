Purdue:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Back to the Basics:::Synthetic biology has striven to prove that classical engineering principles are applicable in the field of biology. Several challenges have yet to be overcome including design of robust genetic circuits, reliable gene expression, and a standard way to characterize parts. To assess circuit robustness, we utilized the power of the Taguchi Method, a statistical analysis which optimizes a set of parameters to form a robust system against outside noise while minimizing experimental time and cost. Making bicistronic expression operating units, which reduce the variability of gene expression, available in the Registry of Standard Biology Parts will enable efficient engineering of large networks. Finally, collaboration among teams allowed for a new standardized form of submitting characterization of parts to the Parts Registry. These three approaches to improve part standardization and robustness will help move the field of synthetic biology one step closer to proving that biology can, in fact, be engineered.:::2013
