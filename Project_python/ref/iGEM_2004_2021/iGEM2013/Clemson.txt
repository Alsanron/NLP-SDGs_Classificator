Clemson:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of a Universal Self-Amplified (USA) Biosensor for Repaid Detection of Viable Pathogens:::Many regulatory agencies such as the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency have specific standards for pathogen concentrations in sample materials, including “zero-tolerance” for some foodborne pathogens. However, current detection methods for these disease-causing bacteria suffer from one or more of the following limitations: 1) requiring sample enrichment, 2) inability of low-level detection, 3) indiscrimination between viable and non-viable cells, 4) small sample volume capacity, 5) tedious procedures, and 6) high assay cost. Our Universal Self-Amplified (USA) Biosensor uses a genetically modified detection bacteria to solve many of the aforementioned issues. The engineered USA bacteria will recognize a target chemical produced by the pathogen of study, which will trigger a cascade of genes to both amplify the chemical signal and produce a visible alert to the pathogen’s presence. The USA pathogen detection mechanism strives for rapidity, economy, and simplicity.:::2013
