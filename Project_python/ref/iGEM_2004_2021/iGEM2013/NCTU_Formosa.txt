NCTU_Formosa:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.colightuner:::We have proven a sRNA-regulated system of our own to be an effective and competent way for regulating gene expressions. Recent studies have shown that sRNA-mediated regulation is an important factor to bacterial growth. sRNAs work by base pairing with limited or extended complementary target mRNAs, regulating protein productions. Using sRNA mechanism, we can control gene expression in RNA level, in contrast to common promoters that functions on DNA level. Since the existing sRNAs in Escherishia Coli have important functions in other metabolic processes, we designed an artificial sRNA with high specificity to avoid undesired base binding in vitro. By using the sRNA-regulated system, red light induced operator, and thirty seven degree Celsius ribosome binding site (RBS), we constructed a manipulatable system that is capable of expressing four different genes under different conditions. In other words, it is a multitask machine.:::2013
