UESTC_Life:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Multistage Degradation of Environment Haloalkanes Contaminant by Co-expression Enzymes:::1,2,3-Trichloropropane (TCP) and an organic pesticideγ-Hexachlorocyclohexane (Lindane，γ-HCH) have been shown to be serious pollutants as they are toxic and quite persistent in the environment, and need to be removed to low levels from polluted sites. Microbial degradation of these compounds represents an important and efficient way to fulfill the target. In order to improve biodegradation efficiency, several powerful genetically engineered E. coli strains have been constructed by the co-expression of key enzymes involving in the biodegradation pathways of the two compounds. For this, foot and mouth disease virus 2A peptide and polycistronic co-expression strategies were adopted. The results showed that all enzymes could co-expressed as a soluble protein with P2A peptide acting as a linker and F2A could function the same as in eukaryote system. Moreover, the resulting engineered E. coli exhibited an excellent capability for the degradation of TCP and γ-HCH.:::2013
