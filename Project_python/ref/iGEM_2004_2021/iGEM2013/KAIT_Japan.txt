There is more Th2 than Th1, and the mast cell and others that is humoral immunity become active, and inflammation is in this way caused. We perform following four this time. ①Expression of IL-10 receptor to E.coli. ②Phosphorylation of STAT3. ③Preparation of gene array with HlyA and L-12 promoter and receiving the STAT3. ④Preparation of gene array with TolC and HlyB and HlyD promoter and to receive the STAT3.:::2013
