NC_School_of_Sci_Math:::North America:::United States:::Information Processing(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Implementation of a Novel Multibiosensor in Detection and Notification of Water Contaminants:::Biosensors provide a wide variety of applications, particularly analyte detection in the environment. Positive results in biosensors lead to the output of a reporter, commonly in the form of fluorescent proteins. Here we construct a biosensor that is capable of indicating the presence of various pollutants in water through expression of several different fluorescent proteins. We selected lead, copper, phosphate, and nitrate/nitrite promoters and paired them with specific reporter coding sequences. Presence of these ions drives the transcription of specific fluorescent proteins. Detection of these proteins is enabled through a light detection apparatus and the information can be sent to mobile devices in a user-friendly interface via a modified Google ADK. This novel multibiosensor can be implemented to detect pollutants in sewer systems, septic tanks, and other sources of water, and provide an early-detection warning system, preventing the pollutants from causing serious harm to equipment, animals, or people.:::2013
