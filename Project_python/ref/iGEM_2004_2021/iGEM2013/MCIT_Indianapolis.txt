MCIT_Indianapolis:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Early Melanoma Detection Fluorescing Biosensor:::According to the World Health Organization, 132,000 people are diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer each year and 48,000 deaths occur from this diagnosis. The development of a yeast based early detection system has the potential to save thousands of lives. Team MCIT Indianapolis is working on a topical cream that will detect the early onset of malignant melanoma. The biosensor system will be developed within a Saccharomyces cerevisiae chassis, using a plasmid containing Firefly Luciferase and Renilla coding that will enable fluorescence in the presence of precancerous cells. The bioengineered yeast will express the receptor protein FGFR-1 on its surface allowing the device to detect increased levels of Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF2) commonly expressed by precancerous melanocytes. Detection of bFGF will initiate the production of Firefly Luciferase and Renilla proteins, which will cause the yeast to fluoresce showing the patient where potential malignant melanoma cells may be located.:::2013
