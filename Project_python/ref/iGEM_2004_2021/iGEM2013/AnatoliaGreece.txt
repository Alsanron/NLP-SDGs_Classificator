Due to the harmful consequences of UV radiation to the human skin, the applications of a construct like this would be numerous. The plan was to insert two genes, one that recognises UV radiation, and one that produces RFP in the plasmid, and connect the two so that the RFP is produced in response to UV recognition.:::2013
