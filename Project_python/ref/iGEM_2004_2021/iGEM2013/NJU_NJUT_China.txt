NJU_NJUT_China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Application of Cas9 as a Gene "Missiles":::Most bacteria and archaea can resist invading DNA and/or RNA elements via the clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs).It is believed that the integrated CRISPR sequences have the ability to form a genetic memory which prevents the host from being infected.The memory exist as a DNA library in genome, artificially modified to set its target. The CRISPRs and Cas (CRISPR-associated) interact and form this prokaryotic adaptive immune system. Cas9, as a core of CRISPR system, can play a role of targeted-attacking gene "missiles". Therefore, we build a sort of plasmids, loading CRISPR system, to realize the "killing" of harmful genes and/or organisms.:::2013
