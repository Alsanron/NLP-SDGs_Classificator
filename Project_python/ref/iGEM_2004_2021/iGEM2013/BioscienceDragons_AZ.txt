BioscienceDragons_AZ:::North America:::United States:::Food & Energy(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Biopannel:::Renewable energy needs are higher than ever before requiring new alternative methods of fuel production. Our team is using E. coli bacteria which we will transform with two new genes. Proteorhodopsin is the first protein produced from the first gene, which is a light driven proton pump that will allow the bacteria to produce ATP from sunlight. The second protein will allow the bacteria to ferment sugars into ethanol. The sunlight driven energy will allow for more of the sugar to be used for ethanol fermentation than actual consumption so the output will be higher. The bacteria will in time be placed in a panel that will allow it to gather sunlight and produce ethanol daily which will be distilled and gathered. For now we are just focusing on the creation of the bacteria with the two new genes.:::2013
