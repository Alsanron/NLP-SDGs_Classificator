Jefferson_VA_SciCOS:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Production of FGF in response to near-anoxic oxygen thresholds:::Wound oxygenation is a key determinant of wound healing because oxygen is crucial to the healing process and for resistance to infection. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing vessels, is essential for tissue repair and can increase oxygen delivery to wounds, enhancing growth and recovery. Production of growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) can be elevated to promote angiogenesis in possible chronic wounds. To address inadequate oxygen during wound healing, we coupled the VHb promoter to a downstream gene encoding FGF. The VHb promoter is activated at an oxygen threshold below 2%, inducing transcription of the FGF gene in response to hypoxic conditions. We also tested the production of KGF under the influence of various constitutive promoters. This oxygen-sensing device is an addition to the growing treatments targeted towards angiogenesis promotion to improve healing in patients with severe wounds.:::2013
