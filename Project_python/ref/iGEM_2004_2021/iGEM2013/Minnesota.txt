Minnesota:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The pMNBB vector system: A toolkit approach for engineering Pichia pastoris:::Currently, there is a significant gap in available resources for transformation and expression of foreign proteins in the industrially-relevant yeast model, Pichia pastoris. To address this, we have constructed pMNBB, a versatile shuttle vector system. pMNBB vectors provide researchers a modular BioBrick platform to introduce synthetic pathways into E. coli and also the option to rapidly transfer these constructs into P. pastoris. Not only is this vector system designed for integration of expression cassettes into the P. pastoris genome, but we have also added elements which allow for the episomal maintenance of these plasmids. Moreover, these vectors are amenable to trans-kingdom conjugation (TKC). Rather than following a yeast transformation protocol that can take days to weeks, our constructs may be introduced to a yeast culture in roughly one hour. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we use the pMNBB vector system to produce and secrete active human insulin from P. pastoris.:::2013
