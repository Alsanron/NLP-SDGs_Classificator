Poznan-BioInf:::Europe:::Poland:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SR-MUX: a biological multiplexer with 3-bit editable transcriptional memory.:::Our goal is to engineer a device allowing to save up to three binary input signals in living E. coli cells, resulting in expression of red, blue and green fluorescent proteins as reporters. Converting inducer signals into expression of serine recombinases, enzymes capable of specific DNA editing, we are able to create three transcriptional analogues of transistors - transcriptors - and to use them as elemental memory units called SR-latches under control of a fourth, strobe signal, providing a mean to reset the system to its original state. This complex biological memory unit opens the way to cheap, reversible gene induction, useful both to the industry and researchers, not only lowering inducing cost but also being less stressful for the studied organisms, e.g. plants. It is also another step towards Von Neumann-inspired biocomputers.:::2013
