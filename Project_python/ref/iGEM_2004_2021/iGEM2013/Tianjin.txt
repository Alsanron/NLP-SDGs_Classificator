We constructed and characterized a device named Alk-Sensor, which can sensitively detect a wide range of alkanes and generate certain response. Alk-Sensor is composed of ALKR protein——a transcriptional regulatory protein, and promoter alkM. ALKR recognizes alkanes and their interaction triggered a conformation change of ALKR dimers which isomerizes the promoter-RNAP complex and led to activate the downstream genes of PalkM. Based on Alk-Sensor, we built a relationship between productivity of alkanes with strain’s growth rate under certain environmental stress. Starting from this relationship we further designed a novel selection method to select out the engineered strains with highest productivity of alkanes. We demonstrated that this novel selection method could enable us to select out the optimized strains effectively and efficiently.:::2013
