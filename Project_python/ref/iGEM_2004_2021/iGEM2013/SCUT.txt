SCUT:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.cerevisiae:::E.cerevisiae is a sophisticated signal transport system between E.coli and S.cerevisiae. Producer, the E.coli, is assigned to distribute a special volatile—butanedione periodically with a stable oscillation circuit, which defines the meaning of the signal. On the other side, Sniffer，the yeast, transplanted with a nose from nematode, can respond to the signal immediately. We hope this can realize the communication between prokaryotes and eukaryotes for the further research on symbiosis.:::2013
