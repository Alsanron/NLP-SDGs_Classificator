Waterloo:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Controlled Modification and Intercellular Transmission of a DNA Message:::In nature, intercellular communication allows coordinated cellular behavior on a population level. Engineers seeking complex programmed population-level behavior require tools enabling controlled, information-rich intercellular messaging. Given its versatility and universality as an information-encoding molecule, DNA suggests itself as a message-carrying molecule to enable information-rich messaging. The Endy group at Stanford recently published a proof-of-principle demonstration of such DNA messaging wherein a DNA message was transmitted from one bacterial population to another carried by M13 bacteriophage particles. Here we propose an intercellular communication program that extends DNA messaging by controlling modification and transmission of a DNA message. Modification is controlled through flipping a DNA switch on the message DNA â€“ a promoter sequence that is invertible using serine integrases and recombination directionality factors (RDFs). Transmission is controlled by placing expression of the M13 major coat protein, which is required for viral packaging of message DNA, under control of such a switch.:::2013
