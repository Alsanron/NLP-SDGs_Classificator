UESTC:::Asia:::China:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Nebula:::Nebula is a biological circuit design tool composed of Interactive Part & Automatic Part. We classified the parts released in 2013 and constructed a database for users to choose what they want. In the first part, you are free to link any parts that we have already classified together to meet your requirement. In the second part, once you determine the inducer and the product, our software will offer you the optimized circuit with the input and output that you designated. We use Analytic Hierarchy Process to score every part and edges (passage linking two parts) according to attributions including availability, usefulness, sample status, part status and sequencing. According to weight of edges, we regard the shortest passage between input and output as the optimum presented to users. You can also save the circuits made in Nebula in case you want to check or change it later.:::2013
