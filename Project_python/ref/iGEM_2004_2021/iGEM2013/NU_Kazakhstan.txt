NU_Kazakhstan:::Asia:::Kazakhstan:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Detection of Carcinoembryonic antigen with sandwich-biosensor:::Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the cancer biomarker at early stages of several cancers including colorectal carcinoma, lung carcinoma and others. The aim of the study is to develop a biosensor that can be used in the detection of CEA. In the first part of the study ssDNA aptamers, with strong affinity for CEA, were selected by 12 cycles of Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment procedure, and characterized with dot-blot analysis and Surface Plasmon Resonance methods. In the last part, it is planned to clone the genes that will assist in expression of streptavidin on the surface of E. coli and S. cerevisiae membrane. E. coli will deliver streptavidin on the surface via Lpp-Omp expression system, while S. cerevisiae via Aga1 â€“ Aga2 system. Modified model organisms, aptamers and CEA will be used to construct sandwich-biosensor.:::2013
