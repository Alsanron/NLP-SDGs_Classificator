OUC-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Reconstructing the Magnetosome Membrane in E. coli:::Membranous organelles are unique structures of eukaryotic cells, rare bacteria and paleontology. Magnetospirillum magneticum is an important biological model system of prokaryotic organelle study because the structure of magnetosome in Magnetospirillum magneticum has similar traits to eukaryotic organelles with membranes. Our task is to reconstruct the magnetosome membrane in Escherichia coli. Magnetospirillum magneticum requires a micro-aerobic and oligotrophic environment in order to produce magnetosome, so the significance of our project lies in simplifying the magnetosome produce method, opening up the path for futher functional gene research. We use homologous recombination to transfer the mamAB gene into E.coli to build an IMS part. Also, as the mamK gene is crucial to the IMS construction. We want to improve the mamK gene's expression by stabilizing its mRNA with a new method, hoping it can be used to promote the IMS construction. So we design a DNA segment to slow down mRNA degradation.:::2013
