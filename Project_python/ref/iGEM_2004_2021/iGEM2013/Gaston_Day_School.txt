Gaston_Day_School:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Fluorescent Detection of Cadmium in Water Supplies:::Heavy metal contaminants pose a serious health threat around the world, especially in locations with poor irrigation. Cadmium, in particular, is a known carcinogen that affects the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry compiled a Priority List of toxic substances, on which Cadmium was seventh. We combined the Green Fluorescent Protein coding region with a Cadmium Sensitive Promoter to create our detector, which provides a simple and inexpensive test for the presence of Cadmium in water supplies. We will incorporate sensitivity tuners to decrease the detection threshold, and we will use mutagenic PCR on both the promoter and the entire detector to increase its sensitivity. Proper use of this BioBrick could result in early detection of cadmium polluted water and potentially prevent deaths worldwide.:::2013
