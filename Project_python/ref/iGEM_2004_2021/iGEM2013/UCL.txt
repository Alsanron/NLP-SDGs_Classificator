UCL:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Spotless Mind:::This year, the UCL iGEM team is taking a radical new step with synthetic biology. We intend to explore the potential application genetic engineering techniques on the brain, by tackling Alzheimer's disease, which is linked to the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain. Targets for the project include: establishing microglia cells as a new Synthetic Biology chassis and constructing new BioBricks to enable engineered Microglia to detect and destroy disease-associated amyloid plaques.:::2013
