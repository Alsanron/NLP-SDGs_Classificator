NGSS_AEI_TURKEY:::Europe:::Turkey:::New Application(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Photo-Communicator:::Today, communication between bacteria is a very commonly used technique. It is a system which is permanently tried to improve and mostly required for the purpose of enhancing a signal or for activating chain reaction pathways. Our goal is to develop an alternative way of signal transfer instead of the classic manner by using chemicals like the quorum sensing molecule Acyl Homoserine Lactone (AHL) or several inducible promoters. Within our project, we will analyze the potential of a single bacterium to affect another bacterium or colony solely by the products of simple biochemical pathways like light or color and finally the effectiveness of the whole system. Regarding the importance of safety procedures, we will test the ability of a colony to induce the death of another colony by ‘’photo-communication’’ and the effects on developing a secondary resistance beside the backbone resistance against contamination cases. Be ready for a grand innovation!:::2013
