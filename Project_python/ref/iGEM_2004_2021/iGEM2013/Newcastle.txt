The lack of a cell wall imparts a range of interesting properties and we show that L-forms can be used as a novel chassis for a range of fundamental applications in synthetic biology. We produced a BioBrick for Bacillus subtilis, that allows cell morphology to be toggled from normal to L-form. We have explored some of the interesting opportunities that L-forms provide including cell fusion, genome shuffling and the generation of differently shaped cells using microfluidics. L-forms are thought to exist naturally within plant tissues and we also studied their use as agents for delivering novel functionality into plants. For project outreach, we created a game as an Android application and considered the implications raised by our project and also look at the exciting relationship between synthetic biology and architecture.:::2013
