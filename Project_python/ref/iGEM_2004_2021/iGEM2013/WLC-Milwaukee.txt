WLC-Milwaukee:::North America:::United States:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The One Ring to Secrete Them All:::Our construct utilizes removable purification and secretion tags separated by a single enzyme cut site NheI that is the insertion point for any coding sequence of interest. The induced gene can be secreted from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space via a tripartite secI pump. A cymR-regulated T5cumate promoter within the plasmid controls a Tse2 toxin to avoid horizontal gene transfer, while the plasmid also encodes a chimeric ompA-monoclonal antibody gene, which when expressed, inserts into the outer membrane and the antibody selectively binds norovirus within the gut to hinder infection. This plasmid construct was used to over-express and secrete plant-based, polymer-degrading enzymes bglS, yesZ, and xynA isolated from the cellulosome of Bacillus subtilis subtilis 168 to digest plant material. We utilized Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 containing a chromosome-integrated cymR gene to secrete these enzymes in the hope to accentuate dietary uptake for humans and livestock in impoverished countries.:::2013
