Beijing_BHSF:::Asia:::China:::New Application(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Bacteria Engineered to Identify Blood Group Antigens:::Blood type antigens are present in red blood cells, epithelial cells and endothelial cells. Blood typing is important because it can transfuse blood and identify individuals; in addition, changes in pattern of blood type antigen expression can even demonstrate malignancy. The current blood typing approaches mainly include slide agglutination, absorption-agglutination, PCR-RFLP and PCR-sequencing based method. In this project, we will use bacterial surface display method to display specific antibody (against type A or type B antigen) section (single-chain variable fragment, ScFv) onto the surface of the bacteria, thus expressing GFP or RFP. Bacteria producing ScFv and cells containing blood antigen will adhere to each other by incubation if the corresponding antigen exists on target cells, so we can characterize blood types and identify the intensity of the antigens on cell surface.:::2013
