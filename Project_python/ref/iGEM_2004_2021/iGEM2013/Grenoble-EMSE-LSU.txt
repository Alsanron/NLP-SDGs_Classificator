Grenoble-EMSE-LSU:::Europe:::France:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Light Automated Cell Control by Talk’E. coli:::Maintaining cell growth state during culturing is generally difficult due to metabolic adaptation and changing cell division rates. Using light-induced promoters and a phototoxic fluorescent protein, we've designed Talk’E. coli. It uses light signals to communicate with bacteria allowing the researcher to remotely control the cultures using a computer. Cell density is monitored through fluorescence recordings and, thanks to a predictive model, Talk’E. coli responds by illuminating the culture with one or more wavelengths to obtain different effects: killing off cells beyond a threshold density, or producing or degrading protein. The tool is portable and mountable in an incubator making it a handy device for research.:::2013
