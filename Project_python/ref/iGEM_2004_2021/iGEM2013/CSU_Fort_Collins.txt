CSU_Fort_Collins:::North America:::United States:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mission: Continue Last Year’s Success, with a side of ‘Save the World’:::We sought to develop a strain of yeast that would have the ability to desalinate sea water enough to result in potable drinking water. Our goal was to modify the yeast ion regulation system such that it would take in much higher than normal amounts of sodium and sequester it within its vacuoles. This posed a serious problem, as biological systems will naturally work to maintain a low internal concentration of sodium ions, while concentrating potassium ions within the cytoplasm. Because of their like charges and relative size, these elements compete with each other for protein interaction within the cell, and because potassium is much more important for biological processes and much less available in the natural environment, yeast actively avoids accumulation of sodium and works to concentrate potassium within itself. If you have Celiac Disease or are Gluten-Intolerant (and are over 21), stop what you are doing right now. Your prayers for a great tasting gluten-free beer have finally been answered, or at least are in the process of being answered. Think of it as a delay in the mailroom. All of those nights when your friends were taunting you with the ice cold, delicious, golden liquid that gives courage to even the most faint of heart are quickly coming to an end. Your desire to enjoy a "cold one" without having a gut-wrenching reaction should be fullfilled by the end of the summer. The CSU iGEM team is working on producing a "gluten-free" beer that can be brewed from wheat or barley so you can savor that same great taste you know and love. So cross your fingers, bust out your lucky rabbits foot, and watch out for black cats because we are gearing up for something big, and it has never been done before.:::2013
