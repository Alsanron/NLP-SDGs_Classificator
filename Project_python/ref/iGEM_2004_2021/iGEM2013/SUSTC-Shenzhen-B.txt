SUSTC-Shenzhen-B:::Asia:::China:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Circuit+:::To standardize genetic circuits and bring the idea that relations exist in circuit between parts back to synthetic biology, we proposed our Technical Standard RFC 101 and RFC 102 to define genetic circuits and logical gene gates. To solve the problem that synthetic biology lacks such a database to systematically record genetic circuits and to make the standards work, we built Circuit+, an online registry of standard genetic circuit which records information of circuits based on the two standards. Users can retrieve circuits, browse information, share by exporting SBOL and upload new circuits. We also have developed Clotho version Circuit+, Circuit List and transplanted TTEC to Clotho. And we have developed an online platform for synthetic biology lab management. We also did human practice to promote synthetic biology and iGEM.:::2013
