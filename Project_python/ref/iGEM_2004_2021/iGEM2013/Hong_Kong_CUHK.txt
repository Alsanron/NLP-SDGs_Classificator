Hong_Kong_CUHK:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Switch off PAHs:::To rapidly regulate biological process, we designed a novel transmembrane protein called Voltage Switch (VS), which is a fusion protein utilizing the voltage sensing domain from potassium ion channels. Triggered by change in potential across the cell membrane, VS can separate or bring targeting enzymes into proximity, thus allowing an instant control of enzymatic reaction. We also utilized VS to accelerate the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) degradation system â€“ another highlight of our project. The metabolites of certain PAHs are mutagenic and carcinogenic. We codon-optimized laccase from Bacillus sp. HR03 and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for Escherichia coli, which when forming a cascade, PAH degradation into less toxic simple carboxylic acid would occur. Since quinones are intermediates in the degradation of PAHs, we also added quinone sensing and response repressor (QsrR) to control the degradation process.:::2013
