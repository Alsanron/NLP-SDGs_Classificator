NO has been proven to have a detrimental impact on the environment and iGem Team Kent 2013 will provide a solution that focuses on reducing the amount of NO formed in waste water. Our system will utilise an engineered strain of E. coli which will be capable of converting this excess NO into ammonia. Our Biobricks have been designed to enable the detection of NO using the norV promoter. The NO can then be converted into ammonia via the nitrite reductase enzyme encoded by the E. coli gene NrfA. Our solution will have many advantages over the current approaches to waste water treatment such as reduced cost and risk of contamination. Our system will provide a source of recycled ammonia and could be a greener alternative to the Haber Bosch process.:::2013
