RHIT:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Constructing a Unique Platform for Interspecies-Dependence (CUPID): The evolution of multicellular machines.:::CUPID aims for stable obligate symbiosis for the model prokaryote Escherichia coli (bacteria) and the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). We address this goal by constructing a unique platform for interspecies-dependence based on inducible expression of a required histidine biosynthetic gene (HIS) in each species. Expression of the bacterial HIS gene is induced by lactic acid produced by constitutive expression of a lactate dehydrogenase gene in the eukaryote. Expression of the yeast HIS gene is induced by the binding of its mating factor receptor to mating factor expressed constitutively on the surface of the prokaryote. Histidine deprivation necessitates physical contact and symbiosis for survival. Such pressure may facilitate evolution of a stable exosymbiotic form of the two species. Study of isolates and further manipulation could provide insight into the use of obligate symbiosis in synthetic biology and yield a chassis for the synthesis of novel multicellular machines.:::2013
