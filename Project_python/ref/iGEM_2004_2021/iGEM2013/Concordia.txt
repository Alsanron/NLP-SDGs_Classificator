Concordia:::North America:::Canada:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Comput-E.coli:::Our aim is to achieve universally computational cells through the exploitation of cell-cell communication to generate biological cellular automata. To achieve this, we are using an array of E. coli colonies, which implement the same logical functionality while using different input/output interfaces. The strains process their inputs (two inputs from neighbors plus their own current state) to decide what their next state will be, after the application of a global clock. At the heart of our project is the construction of the clock, to synchronize information processing. We are making a fusion protein of ETR1 from A. thaliana and EnvZ from E. coli to allow cells to respond to ethylene gas concentrations. All cells will produce this gas at cyclic intervals, thus creating a truly autonomous clock. We have also devised an RNA-based system that can process information reliably and expediently with the use of ribozyme-based XOR and AND gates.:::2013
