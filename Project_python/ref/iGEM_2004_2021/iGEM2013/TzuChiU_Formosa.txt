TzuChiU_Formosa:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hypnoseq.:::The new pattern of antibiotic resistance is a spreading global issue that may soon leave us defenseless against bacterial infections. Taking a closer look, the lack of comprehensive pharmaceutical management system in Taiwan has come to our concern as it results in easy access to antibiotics. Large amount of antibiotics are added in the forage of animal husbandry and aquaculture,hence, leading to the increase of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan. In order to ameliorate this growing threat, we attempt to carry out “Hypnoseq.” to make this world a better place. Our aim in this project is to combine the sense and antisense mRNA of the antibiotic resistance gene to inhibit the expression of the antibiotic resistance gene. Knowing that they have the ability to conjugate and deliver our designed plasmid to other bacteria, we are able to predict that they can decrease the percentage of antibiotic resistance in the environment.:::2013
