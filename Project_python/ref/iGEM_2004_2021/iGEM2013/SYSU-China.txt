SYSU-China:::Asia:::China:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: iPSC safeguarding Device::: Since Shinya Yamanaka published the epoch-making paper in 2006, the induced pluripotent stem cells(iPSCs) has become one of the most promising techniques in regenerative medicine. Like embryonic stem cells(ESC), iPS Cells can be differentiated into any tissues. Compared with ESC, iPSC is easier to attain, immune rejection-free, and ethical issue-free. However, Further application of human induced pluripotent stem cells(hiPSCs) in tranlational medicine requires the concerns of two problems: the specificity of directional differentiation and the safety of the transplant. Here we design a new device which can spontaneously select hepatocytes from iPS differentiated cell mass and prevent potential carcinogenesis.To achieve accurate spatiotemporal control,we build a miRNA-122 sensor and make use of the tetracycline induction system.Our work may also be extended to the field of gene therapy, and provide a new direction to our train of thought about how to solve the safety problem in genetic manipulation of human cells.:::2013
