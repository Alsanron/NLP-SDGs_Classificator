Rutgers:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Sensteria: Quorum Sensing E. Coli:::Our project aims at developing a self-regulatory system for the degradation of virulent factors. We plan to integrate quorum sensing and pon1 to create this system of self-regulation. Quorum sensing will be used to detect the presence of high cell densities and to activate pon1 upon detecting high cell density. Pon1, acting as a repressor, will degrade the signal molecules needed for quorum sensing and thus turn off quorum sensing as well as itself. It will reactivate upon the reactivation of quorum sensing and this cycle of self-regulation will persist. This prototype system is meant to test the application of this system but the main goal is to introduce this system to pseudomonas aeruginosa as a means to prevent the harm that it causes.:::2013
