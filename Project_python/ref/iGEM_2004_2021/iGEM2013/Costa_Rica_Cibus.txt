Costa_Rica_Cibus:::Latin America:::Costa Rica:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genetic transformation of Bacillus subtilis for lactose consumption:::Cibus 3.0 takes biodiesel production to a new level using dairy industry wastes. Annually, about 675 thousand tons of whey are thrown into rivers. This because at the present time there isn’t a program for reusing this waste, and producers find it difficult to treat them properly because of its chemical composition. Our idea consists in the modification of the bacteria Rhodococcus opacus to enhance the absorption of lactose and the overexpression of the natural triglycerides (TGA) producing ability of R. opacus, achieved by inserting an optimized sequence of a DGA acyltransferase gene and lactose absorption genes, constitutively expressed, also with an optimized sequence of a lipase from B. cepacia which is the responsible to break down the TGAs and an inducible “suicide device” in order to extract them with ease. Now all what it takes to finish the job is adding some ethanol to obtain our biodiesel!:::2013
