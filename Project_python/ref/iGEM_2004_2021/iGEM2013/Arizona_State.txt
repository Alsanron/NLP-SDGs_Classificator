Arizona_State:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BactoVax: A Modular, Bacterial-based Cancer Vaccine Platform:::Cancer kills eight million people each year, a number unchanged over the past five decades. The current paradigm for cancer treatment involves non-specific therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation that cannot differentiate between cancerous and healthy tissue. We propose a novel vaccine delivery system of tumor associated antigens and immunomodular agents encapsulated within probiotic bacteria to harness the patient's own immune system to fight cancer. The bacterial vaccine should activate macrophages and dendritic cells in order to teach the immune system to recognize cell surface antigens that distinguish tumors from healthy tissue. We aim to engineer lab-strain Escherichia coli and E. coli Nissle 1917, a commercial probiotic, to train the immune system to target and destroy tumor cells. This provides a distinct advantage over current bacterial vaccinology platforms, which rely on pathogenic bacterial chassis such as Salmonella and Listeria.:::2013
