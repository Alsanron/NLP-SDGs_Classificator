INSA_Toulouse:::Europe:::France:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. calculus Project:::The E. calculus project consists constructing a full n-bits adder capable of transmitting a carry to the next step. The designed strain contains specific devices that should ensure a relatively precise calculation and will be decomposed as follows Various logic gates using specially designed recombinases and recombination sites to avoid reversibility of the gates states. A strict control of the expression of recombinases via a tight riboregulation control of the translation of recombinases genes. A general inducer, switching the strain from inactive to active counting. A carry system based on the diffusion of a messenger molecule to the second bit. An artificial input system based on photoreceptors sensible to blue and red lights. The envisioned system should approach as much possible the reliability of an electronic two digit device and may help the Synthetic Biology community designing strong and robust Genetic Boolean Operators.:::2013
