ZJU-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Tale of Aptamers: Ghost and Elf:::This year we aim to utilize aptamer to specifically detect and clear molecules of different sizes. In order to detect and clear certain protein, we make tunneled E.coli called bacterial ghost that allow protein to diffuse in. We then build two types of inner-membrane protein scaffold, which will dimerize when pulled together by two aptamers attached to two sites of the protein. The dimerized proteins have enzymatic activity that can be detected via commercial test strips. The device will also sequester the proteins and allow us to clear them. In order to efficiently detect and clear a small molecule called atrazine, which is an herbicide causing tremendous environmental problems, we split our aptamer-based detection module and clear module into two strains. The first strain is chemotaxic to atrazine and will release quorum sensing molecules to attract the second strain, which contains atrazine hydrolase to clear it.:::2013
