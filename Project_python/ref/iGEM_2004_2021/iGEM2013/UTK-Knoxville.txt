UTK-Knoxville:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Modular Design of Chimeric Biosensors:::The major limitation in synthetic biology today is the lack of numerous, well characterized sensors. Our project aims to provide a reliable scaffold to test potential sensing domains with unknown substrates. We have created a standard platform to test a range of intracellular and transmembrane domains. Positive results are reported with red fluorescent protein for easy identification which can be done with high throughput methods such as 96 well plates and flow cytometry. We test our platform on sensors with interesting known responses. The chimera proteins are also useful in creating signals orthogonal to the cell.:::2013
