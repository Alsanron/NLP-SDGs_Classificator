NRP-UEA-Norwich:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Developing Biosensors to Identify Antimycin-Producing Actinomycetes:::Antimycins, anti-fungal compounds primarily produced by Streptomyces (a sub-set of actinomycetes), function by inhibiting the final stage of the electron transport chain. Our aim is to develop Biosensors to aid identification of novel antimycin-producing actinomycetes. Homologues of the AntA sigma factor, the key regulatory protein in antimycin biosynthesis, are present in all 14 known biosynthetic gene clusters. Due to this property, Biosensors have been designed with the AntA-regulated promoter (antGp) controlling the expression of three reporters: neomycin resistance gene, RFP (red fluorescent protein) and GUS (providing β-glucoronidase activity). The Biosensors will be produced, trialled and optimised where possible after sub-cloning into two actinomycete-specific integrative plasmids, pMS82 (φBT1 integrase) and pAU3-45 (φC31 integrase). Worldwide soil and sediment samples have been collected to produce a library of actinomycete strains, which will be screened using our Biosensors, the ultimate goal being to screen bacterial strains for antimycin production.:::2013
