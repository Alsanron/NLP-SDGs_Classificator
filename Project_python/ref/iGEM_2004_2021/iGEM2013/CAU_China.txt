CAU_China:::Asia:::China:::Food & Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Alcohol-detoxic Beverage::: Alcoholism is prevalent in China. Here we decide to invent an alcohol-detoxic beverage that can considerably prevent alcoholism by adding one healthy bacterium-lactobacillus. In principle, this engineered bacteria can survive in the extremely acidic stomach environment and reduce the toxicity by converting alcohol to corresponding carboxylic acid through a two-step reaction. The two-step reaction is catalyzed by intracellular alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH),respectively.We try to engineer both enzymes, ADH and ALDH, to be acid resistant for higher performance in human stomach.:::2013
