BIT-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Intelligent Microbial Heat Regulating Engine::: To keep the cells in a good condition, cooling system is used to control the temperature in fermentation process. However, the cooling system can result in a great consumption of energy, which increases the cost of production and causes resources wasting, global warming indirectly. To settle this problem, we constructed an Intelligent Microbial Heat Regulating Engine (I'MHeRE), which includes the customized thermo-tolerance system and the intelligent quorum regulating system, to help cells resist heat by regulating the expression of heat shock proteins and controlling the density of cells. The chassis host with I'MHeRE may make the fermentation less depend on the cooling system and shrink cost. Besides, cells could live well in higher temperature, because we extend their optimum living temperature and make them live in optimizing density. Owing to this, the activity of the enzymes in cells could be increased and the efficiency of microbial metabolism could be improved.:::2013
