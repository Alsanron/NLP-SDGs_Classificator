Nevada:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Lysesavers: A novel endolysin-based bactericide for the treatment of gram-negative pathogens:::Endolysins are the bacteriophage proteins responsible for lysing target bacteria by degrading the peptidoglycan layer. The use of endolysins to fight bacterial plant disease is an emerging field, but it has largely been limited to gram-positive bacteria, as the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria prevents endolysins from accessing the peptidoglycan. Recombinant E. coli have been created to express endolysins which target various plant pathogens. These proteins can be used as a novel gram-negative bactericide when coupled with a treatment to disrupt the outer membrane. A system to easily detect outer membrane disruption will be critical to our project, as well as any future studies on gram-negative endolysins. To address this, a registered iGEM part used for cell surface detection was improved and incorporated into a fluorescence-based assay. Erwinia amylovora, a gram-negative bacterium responsible for fire blight in fruit trees, was chosen as a model target for proof of concept.:::2013
