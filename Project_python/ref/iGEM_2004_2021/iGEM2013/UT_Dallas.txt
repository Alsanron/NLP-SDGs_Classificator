UT_Dallas:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Multifaceted Approach Against Tooth Decay:::Cavities are a problem faced by people and animals worldwide and are primarily caused by the bacteria Streptococcus mutans. S. mutans digests certain sugars, consequently forming lactic acid that can lead to tooth decay. Our system starts with the detection of saccharides essential for S. mutansâ€™ survival. Using dextranase, the E. coli are able to attach onto the dextran layer that S. mutans normally live on. This allows the E. coli to deliver a targeted dose of norspermidine, helping with the breakdown of S. mutans biofilms. We also took another approach that utilizes a natural quorum signaling molecule, competence stimulating peptide (CSP). This peptide is responsible for population control in S. mutans. By using these approaches, we hope to aid in the treatment of cavities in both humans and animals.:::2013
