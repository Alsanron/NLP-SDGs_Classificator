NYMU-Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bee. coli: to bee, or not to bee::: To save bees from Nosema ceranae, the culprit of colony collapse disorder, we created Bee. coli. from E. coli K-12 MG1655, a bacterium residing natively in bees. Bee. coli is strategically designed to work as follows. First, it continuously secretes mannosidase to inhibit the sprouting of N. ceranae spores. Second, if the bee is infected, the fungus-killing-circuit with a positive feedback design will be turned on to wipe out N. ceranae. Third, if these designer weapons should fail to conquer N. ceranae, our designed bee-suicide-operon will be activated to kill the infected bee and save its companions. Fourth, a light-inducible lysis system is included to ensure our Bee. coli only lives inside of the bee. Fifth, we apply encapsulation as the way to send Bee. coli into the bee. Since the capsule will only dissolve in a beeâ€™s gut, our Bee. coli will not spread to the environment.:::2013
