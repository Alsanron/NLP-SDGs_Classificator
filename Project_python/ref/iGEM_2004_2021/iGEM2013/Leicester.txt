Leicester:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biological routes to recycling, re-using and re-purposing polystyrene:::Polystyrene is a useful material, but also a visible pollutant that locks up oil-derived hydrocarbons. For 2013 we are diversifying, to reduce polystyrene’s various environmental impacts. Recycling - Building on 2012’s project, we are adapting the toluene degradation pathway from Pseudomonas species to work on polystyrene, in E. coli. Re-using - Consumer 3D printers use a variety of thermoplastics but virgin plastic is usually required. Recycled polystyrene can be a support for making complex 3D shapes, and removed later. Polystyrene is soluble in limonene (an environmentally friendly solvent) so we are adapting limonene biosynthesis biobricks, to enable biological "finishing" of 3D printed objects. Re-purposing - Polystyrene is a great building insulator, but needs to be flame retardant. Currently this involves adding halogenated hydrocarbons, proven environmental pollutants. Recently DNA was shown to be an effective flame retardant, so we are using synthetic biology to generate cheap DNA, for flame retardant polystyrene.:::2013
