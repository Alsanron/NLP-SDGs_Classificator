Northwestern:::North America:::United States:::Health & Medicine:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NU Balance:::The purpose of this iGEM project is to combat oral diseases by engineering a bacteria to neutralize the lactic acid produced by Streptococcus mutans. Due to the time constraint, the scope of the project is limited to a dual-state promoter where an acid-responsive promoter is placed upstream of a constitutive promoter. This novel transcription regulation element will have both constitutive and inducible activity. The construct will be tested by linking green fluorescent protein to the downstream promoter. Based on preliminary results, the extra promoter should allow for a significant increase in gene expression. These pieces have wide implications in any fields that require a quick upregulation of any gene in response to acidic environments.:::2013
