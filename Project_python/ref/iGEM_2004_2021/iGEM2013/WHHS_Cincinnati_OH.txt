WHHS_Cincinnati_OH:::North America:::United States:::Environment(P):::High School:::Accepted:::Biosensor for Iron Detection:::A biosensor is a device that utilizes organisms (e.g., e. coli) or biological molecules (e.g., enzymes) to detect the presence of a designated chemicals. These chemicals incluse toxic metals, like iron, arsenic, and mercury. We chose to pursue a biosensor that detects iron in water because iron is an essential nutrient that allows cells to generate energy, but more importantly because iron can be damaging when it accumulates in the body.:::2013
