Wageningen_UR:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Aspergillus niGEM A lov story:::The fact that secondary metabolites are often synthesized as polymer backbones that are subsequently diversified greatly via the actions of tailoring enzymes sets the stage for combinatorial biochemistry because their biosynthesis is modular. One of the goals is to establish a modular system of domain shuffling to generate a plethora of novel enzymes with new and improved functionalities. The production of lovastatin, a drug used in lowering LDL cholesterol for patients suffering from cardiovascular disease, has been chosen as a proof of principle. The aim is to transfer the entire lovastatin metabolic pathway from A. terreus into a GRAS organism like Aspergillus niger. To expand our scope we will also be working on host engineering, trying to create a single cell phenotype of Aspergillus niger. To increase the accessibility of our host we also deliver a set of tools, which include ATP and pH biosensors, cytoskeletal gfp-fusions and chromoproteins.:::2013
