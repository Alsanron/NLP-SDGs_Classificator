In a synthetic biology approach, we are working to create an artificial futile cycle in mammalian cell by introducing glyoxylate enzymes native to bacteria. Past research has shown that mice expressing enzymes constituting an active glyoxylate shunt are shown to be resistant to diet-induced obesity. Our team plans to introduce an inducible system that allows us to couple the sensing of circulating fatty acid concentrations with an inducible circuit of glyoxylate shunt. Our inducible system is intended to prevent the risk of fatty acid deficiency, while facilitating greater fatty acid uptake at higher fatty acid circulating concentrations. Such a system should increase the feasibility of a glyoxylate cycle engineered to function in vivo.:::2013
