Hong_Kong_HKUST:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Combined CRISPRi and Antisense RNA Toggle Switch:::A core concept of synthetic biology is controlling gene expression, often achieved through inducers and protein repressors to create feedback loops and switches. Our team has combined the CRISPRi system with RNA regulators to achieve a toggle switch. The switch utilizes the catalytically inactive form of Cas9 (dCas9) to achieve targeted and reversible repression of genes via specific single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Alternatively, the transcription of antisense RNA (asRNAs) reverses the effect of the dCas9 modulated repression on the desired genes. This method of regulation would allow for the ability to fine-tune and easily customize the execution of highly complex genetic circuits. Using GFP and RFP in our circuit as a proof of concept, RFP is suppressed under the first inducible promoter while GFP is produced. Under the second inducible promoter, the dCas9 is unable to bind to mrfp, derepressing mrfp and suppressing GFP.:::2019
