XHD-WS-Wuhan-A:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::miRNA-based Detector For Gastric Cancer Early Diagnosis and Future Therapy:::Gastric cancer (GC), a malignant epithelial cancer disease, is associated with a high global incidence of mortality. There are only limited diagnostic methods for early detection of GC. Thus, there is an urgent search for new, non-invasive, biomarkers to allow early detection of GC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 bp) nucleic acids that function by regulating the expression of target genes. Previous studies indicated miRNAs can serve as a potential source for biomarkers for detection of human malignancies, including GC. We chose four miRNAs (miR-17, miR-21, miR-196a and miR-148a) expressed in patients serum of different stages of GC and established four miRNA sensors to detect these miRNAs in GC cells. Our results suggested the sensor of miR-196a and miR-148a is a better monitor to detect miRNA expression in GC cells than others. Our project may provide a new non-invasive method to diagnosis gastric cancer in early stage in the future.:::2019
