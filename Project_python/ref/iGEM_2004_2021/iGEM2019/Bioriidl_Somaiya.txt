Bioriidl_Somaiya:::Asia:::India:::Foundational Advance:::Community Lab:::Accepted:::Steriport - Making sterilisation and dispensing system portable:::To this date, many research and developments have been implemented but the primary source of development is still lagging, which is our autoclave. So we developed, steriport, a system that can sterilize and dispense the media within just 8-10 mins. The best thing about our model is that it's very handy in use and also portable. The sterilization is carried out by the action of AMPs such as Lantibiotic nisin-A, AlbB, and sporulation killing factor. These all are mass-produced by the use of chassis Escherichia coli BL21 DE3, and will mainly target on bacteria contaminants. For fungal contaminants, we make use of endophytes extracted from Holy Basil and Indian lilac. The main feature is the Ohmic heating and UV type C (inactivate or kill the contaminant). While, UV-C effects on human skin aren't harmful, but only irritable to the eyes, for that reason, we coated our UV chamber with acrylic.:::2019
