MIT:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Perfect Swarm: Directed Attraction of Neutrophil-Like Cells through Engineered Chemokine Secretion:::Cell coordination within a population depends on an individual cellâ€™s ability to accurately receive and respond to extracellular stimuli from the environment and neighboring cells. Coordinating cellular motility, where cells move in response to external cues, is central to many physiological responses. For example, human neutrophils demonstrate migratory behavior towards chemokine gradients as part of the adaptive immune system. Here, we present a mechanism to harness cellular chemotaxis to control cellular swarming and directed movement. We engineered human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells to secrete chemokines that induce chemotaxis in unengineered neutrophils. To evaluate chemotaxis, we first differentiated HL-60 cells into chemotactic neutrophils. We then introduced chemokines produced by our engineered HEK cells and evaluated neutrophil movement utilizing several cellular migration assays. We anticipate our engineered system will provide insight into how immune systems develop as well as form a preliminary toolbox for recruiting mammalian cells selectively in tissue engineering applications.:::2019
