Poitiers:::Europe:::France:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::To Bee... Hornet to Bee:::Have you ever wondered how important the natural pollination of plants is? Nowadays, a lot of edible plants and food producing plants rely heavily on the pollination, tying the diversity of our diet to the well-being of pollinating species. But these species, and specifically bees, are threatened by a new predator in France and Europe: Vespa velutina nigrithorax, better known as "Asian hornet". This predator slaughters European bees’ population, and there is no efficient ways of fighting against it without compromising the environment. At “To Bee... Hornet to Bee”, we designed a new metabolic pathway, integrated in bacteria to produce specifically attractive molecules for the Asian hornet. These molecules could then be used in every kind of hornet traps, making them specific to the Asian hornet.:::2019
