SEU:::Asia:::China:::Open:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synthesizing Neurons in Artificial Neural Networks with DNA reactions:::Artificial intelligence has become a hot topic for years, as it has the potential to provide a general tool for solving different problems. However, the area complexity and power cost of traditional silicon-based circuits implementation of artificial neural networks have somehow limited its application. To implement artificial neural networks more efficiently, DNA computing provides an alternative to silicon-based circuits, due to its high computation parallelism and low energy cost. In this project, we propose and demonstrate molecular computation models for basic arithmetic operations in artificial neural networks, based on which we synthesize basic neural networks with DNA reactions. We developed a webpage tool that generates DNA reactions and relevant DNA sequences according to the required parameters of neural networks. Therefore, users can use this tool to obtain expected DNA-based artificial neural networks, which may help them with further molecular computer design and bio-robot design.:::2019
