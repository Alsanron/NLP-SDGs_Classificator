SCU-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CORegulaTINï¼šThe Co-fermentation of Cordycepin and Pentostatin:::As one of the precious Chinese medicine, cordyceps militaris has been used for hundreds of years for health care and disease treatment. Cordycepin, one of cordyceps militaris' components, has been proved of great clinical potentiality. But its price is too high to afford at approximately 1500 dollars per gram. So, 2019 SCU-China wants to decrease the price of cordycepin by using engineered yeast for factories. We add the delayed expression system to automatically ferment cordycepin and its protector, pentostatin. As a result, we can produce cordycepin in a cheaper and more automatic way.:::2019
