The existing solutions, which usually require bringing soil samples into a lab, are costly and ineffective. Our team implemented multiple MerR-like regulators to drive the expression of the reporter genes and monitor the concentration of several heavy metal cations. Through mathematical modeling, we used an algorithm to take the effect of all ions -- conjugate and non-conjugate -- into count, giving a reliable readout to multiple types of co-existing heavy metal ions and avoiding errors caused by the crosstalk of non-conjugate metal inducers during the quantitative analysis. In addition, we found out that the absorption of heavy metal cadmium by CapB gene enables the removal of cadmium once it is detected. Combining the metal detecting MerR-like regulators and cadmium absorbing CapB, we have devised a prototype to reduce cadmium concentration in soil and address related agricultural and environmental issues.:::2019
