Montpellier:::Europe:::France:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::KARMA, a new tool for specific protein degradation:::The discovery of the CRISPR tool has led to a real revolution, allowing genome editing to be controlled in a very specific way. However, this type of tool is not available when it comes to proteins. The first aim of the KARMA project was to create a new tool for specific protein degradation. In order to accomplish that, we thought about using a non-specific protease, to which we add a VHH that will act as a research head to make it more specific, and targeting a protein in a complex environment. We chose to perform a complete proof of concept using well-known systems, the TEV protease and a VHH against sfGFP, to characterize in detail whether this type of tool could be effective. We then considered the possible applications of this tool, particularly to counter the antibiotic resistance caused by outer antibiotic degrading-enzymes like beta-lactamases.:::2019
