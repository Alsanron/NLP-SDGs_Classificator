Aalto-Helsinki:::Europe:::Finland:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::VibXPRESSO - A Vibrio natriegens strain for efficient production and secretion of recombinant proteins:::Recombinant proteins are widely used in biomedical research and as biopharmaceutical compounds. Even with today’s technologies, improved efficacy is necessary as the demand for recombinant proteins is increasing – it has been estimated that within the next ten years half of all medicines developed will be biopharmaceuticals. Our iGEM project introduces VibXPRESSO - Vibrio natriegens with Xtreme PRotein Expression and Secretion Optimization. We harness the gram-negative bacterium's generation time of under 10 minutes to rapidly produce large amounts of protein for efficient purification. This is achieved via the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, that secretes proteins into the bacterium's periplasm. By environmental modifications we have increased the outer membrane leakiness of V. natriegens, to direct proteins from the periplasm into the growth medium for easier protein harvest. As a proof of concept, we compared the yield of human growth hormone between V. natriegens WT ATCC 14048 and our modified VibXPRESSO strain.:::2019
