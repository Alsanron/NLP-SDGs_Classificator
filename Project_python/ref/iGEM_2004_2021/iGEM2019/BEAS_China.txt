BEAS_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::A Modularized & Smart & Safe Machine for Heavy Metal Bioremediation:::Heavy metal pollution can be widespread in the city water supply, which is hard to be detected or eliminated by citizens. Our project is designed to solve both the detection and the remediation of heavy metal pollution in one system. Implementing the MerR and PbrR sensor proteins, as well as an amplifying module downstream involving TEV and CI434, the detection system can reliably output a zero-or-one signal on the presence of mercury and lead through GFP. We have also incorporated the curli and spytag-spycatcher mechanism in our remediation module. Such mechanism creates an interconnected biofilm of spycatcher “sockets”, on which metal-binding proteins can be attached to the surface of our engineered bacteria. We have applied this to maximize the surface area of reaction, which magnifies the remediation efficiency. Combined with our purification hardware, our product offers an affordable yet smart solution for heavy metal pollution.:::2019
