CMUQ:::Asia:::Qatar:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CASPRE - Preliminary Genetic Testing Kit:::In an effort to reduce the inequality in global healthcare, increase the efficiency of labs, and minimize biohazards, our team developed CASPRE; a synthetic biology kit that provides preliminary genetic testing for carriers of recessive traits. CASPRE’s biological mechanism utilizes CRISPR-Cas12a protein, specifically- designed guide RNA (gRNA), and fluorescing reporters to identify the presence of a disorder-causing SNP. Upon the extraction of the DNA from a saliva sample, Cas12a scans the DNA searching for a complementary sequence to the gRNA. If complementary binding occurs, a reaction complex forms and triggers an indiscriminate cleavage activity. Through this, a single-stranded DNA linking the reporter and its quencher degrades and allows the emission of fluorescence. Then, CASPRE’s developed, hand-held device and user-friendly application work in tandem to detect and interpret the emitted fluorescence producing a +/- diagnoses. Within a few minutes, we become a step closer to a more aware community.:::2019
