Stony_Brook:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Potential prevention of TMV mottling and necrosis via yeast XRN1 gene expression in plants:::Despite being coined the Tobacco Mosaic Virus, TMV is known to infect over 350 different species of plants around the globe, threatening crop yields for dependant farmers. Because the virus is spread between plants via pollinators such as bees, the preventative solution has been to use pesticides to avoid interaction between the bees and the affected crops. To alleviate the spread of TMV while simultaneously preserving environmental safety, we looked into expressing the yeast gene, XRN1 in plants. By producing the protein XRN1-p, yeast has a means of breaking down non-local and invasive RNA, a system that the eukaryotic N. Benthamiana does not have. Ultimately, by expressing the yeast gene in our tobacco plants, we hope to both test whether it would successfully breakdown the viral RNA while also exploring whether yeast gene expression in plants is viable.:::2019
