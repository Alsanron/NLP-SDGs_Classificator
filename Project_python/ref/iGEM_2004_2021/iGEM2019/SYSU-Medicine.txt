SYSU-Medicine:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Construction of targeted chemotherapy mediated by oncolytic alphavirus M1 and its multimodal anticancer effect:::Cancer remains a leading cause of death in the world. Oncolytic virus, as a kind of new anticancer therapy combining the advantages of immunotherapy, gene therapy and targeted therapy, may be a promising solution. Alphavirus M1 is a natural existing non-pathogenic oncolytic virus. However, a large proportion of tumors are not sensitive enough to M1. To further enhance the therapeutic efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy, cancer chemotherapy is commonly use, which usually lacks tumor specificity and causes severe systemic side-effects. Our project is to engineer M1 to specifically encode and express enzymes that can convert prodrugs into active therapeutic metabolites, and enhance bystander effects. We also utilize riboswitch to enhance the dynamic regulation of M1. Meanwhile the Chemotherapeutic drugs can boost the tumor infectivity and lethality in diverse tumors with low sensitivity to M1. We hope to provide a novel anticancer therapeutic modality by combining oncolytic virus M1 with targeted chemotherapy.:::2019
