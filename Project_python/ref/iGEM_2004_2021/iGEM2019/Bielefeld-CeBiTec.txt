Bielefeld-CeBiTec:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Troygenics - The Odyssey to World Transforming Shuttles:::Remember the trojan horse? With this trick Greeks snuck into Troy. Inspired by this story we engineered Troygenics, molecular trojan horses, that enter and transform eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic pathogens including numerous fungi are a growing threat to crops, animals and humans. Common treatments lack specificity and are frequently overcome by resistances. In a novel mode of action, our Troygenics enter these pathogens via endocytosis and deliver a Cell Death Inducing System (CeDIS). Troygenics consist of modified M13 coat-proteins assembled by Escherichia coli and contain ssDNA encoding the specific CeDIS based on Cas13a. Pathogen-specific ligands fused to the coat proteins enhance uptake via endocytosis. We incorporated sophisticated biosafety mechanisms to achieve selective transformation of the targeted pathogen. Among other methods, we demonstrated the functionality of the Troygenics applying a self-developed low-cost microfluidic system. In conclusion, we engineered an innovative platform technology customizable to target various eukaryotic pathogens.:::2019
