DUT_China_A:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cell in CELL: Encapsulation of Living CTCs using DNA Hydrogel CELL:::Living circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as escaping pioneers of tumor cells in the blood cause cancer metastasis. In order to address the difficulties on recognition, visualization, and capture of living CTCs with high purity and integrity, we construct a multifunctional DNA hydrogel like a prison CELL capsuling CTCs, and defined this new platform as “cell in CELL” (CiC). CiC contains 3 key components: i) the fluorescence-labeled ssDNA aptamers for specifically targeting the receptors of CTCs and visualizing them; ii) once successfully targeting CTCs, the ssDNA aptamers will expose the sticky end further for triggering the adhesion of sticky-end pairing ssDNA; iii) the pairing ssDNA can induce rolling circle amplification, subsequent multi-primed chain amplification, making the formation of CiC around CTCs. Finally, CiC can enlarge CTC size for centrifugal isolation and meanwhile keep their bioactivity. In this work, we achieve a feasible and economical CiC for clinical CTCs-capture and analysis.:::2019
