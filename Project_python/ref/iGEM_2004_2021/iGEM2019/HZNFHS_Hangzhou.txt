The symbiotic plasmid encodes all of the known nodulation (besides NolR) and nitrogen fixation proteins, such as the very important gene nif-specific transcriptional activator (NifA). We cloned the NifA gene from Sinorhizobium fredii, constructed the over-expression vector of pHT43 and transformed into Bacillus subtilis. The NifA over-expressed Bacillus subtilis modulated the soil pH from 4.0 to over 7. It could also provide Nitrogen and improve cotton plant growth. Further research shows that it could maintain the pH about 7 in soil around tea plants and provide Nitrogen for them.:::2019
