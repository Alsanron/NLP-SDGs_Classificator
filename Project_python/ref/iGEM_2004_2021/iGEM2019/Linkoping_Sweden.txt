Linkoping_Sweden:::Europe:::Sweden:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Novosite - A novel and modular antimicrobial bandage:::Burn wounds are being treated with high doses of antibiotics which are used systemically and does not treat the affected area. The mortality rate of burn victims after surviving the primary trauma is mainly caused by infections and bacteria prone to antibiotic resistance. The purpose of this project is to produce an antimicrobial bandage of a cheap and environmentally friendly material which in this case is cellulose but can be applied to other materials as well, such as chitosan and alginate. Antibacterial peptides and lysins are attached to this bandage via a carbohydrate binding domain. The agents are released upon exposure to thrombin which is present in the patientâ€™s own blood. Therefore, the bandage could be an alternative to antibiotics or to an extent decrease the amount needed. The antibacterial spectrum of the bandage can either be broad through the use of antimicrobial peptides, or narrow by utilizing bacteriophage lysins.:::2019
