EDC is a collection of chemicals that have long-lasting negative impact on human. EDC exposure is linked to diseases such as cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies suggested that laccase can degrade various EDCs. In this project, we used engineered E.coli BL21 (DE3) to produce our selected Laccases. We cloned a collection of Laccases into E. coli, which include a stress-tolerant laccase. To develop a sustainable EDC degradation system, we also added a secretion signal peptide, NSP4 to the laccases expressed in E. coli. Moreover, we also built a green laccase production system. We transformed the laccases, with a PilA secretion signal peptide, into cyanobacteria (Synechococcus sp). In addition, we also designed a water filter that fits our engineered bacteria. All together, we believe that our project can help to find a solution for EDC water pollution.:::2019
