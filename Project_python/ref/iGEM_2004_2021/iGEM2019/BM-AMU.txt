BM-AMU:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Building a bridge from phenotype to landscape:::Cell landscape, a collection of biological bigdata of cell that integrates genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and immune group, which is the basis for understanding the complex system of cells. However, existing techniques for acquiring cell landscapes have defects such as complicated operation, time consuming, and destruction of cells. Our goal is to accurately reflect the landscape of cells by detecting several simple indicators such as fluorescent phenotypes. After in-depth communication, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of embryonic stem cells is used as our research vector. Our experiments focused on giving cells specific and regulatable fluorescent phenotypes, controlling EMT processes, monitoring fluorescence changes and collecting RNA omics data.:::2019
