Ionis_Paris:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cinergy Project: Degrading cigarette butt filters to produce electricity and limit their environmental impact:::Cigarette butts represent a major danger for our environment, with one cigarette butt polluting up to 500 liter of water. Thus, our project Cinergy aims to add value to cigarette butt filters, made of cellulose acetate (CA), by producing electricity. The microbial fuel cell used will include genetically modified bacteria, Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis, and be linked to a battery device. This system will contain two E. coli populations: the first one degrading the CA into substrate molecules to produce lactate and the second one producing flavins. These will be used by Shewanella oneidensis to produce a more efficient electrical current. Modified bacteria were produced by transformation process and/or gene knock-out. Cellulose acetate degradation ability was quantified and compared to the original bacteria, Neisseria sicca. Electrical current was successfully produced and measured. Finally, a functional prototype was built and tested.:::2019
