Sriwijaya:::Asia:::Indonesia:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CEAgar: A Reliable, Practical, and Affordable Lung Cancer Diagnostic Tool:::Lung cancer is a condition where cells grow uncontrollably inside the lungs. In 2018, new cases of lung cancer account for 30.023 cases and the numbers are estimated to go up each year. Based on that fact, an effective, rapid, and accurate diagnostic method is needed to change the patient recovery rate in treating lung cancer. The gold standard of diagnosing lung cancer right now is histopathological examination with the specimen is obtained by biopsy. Nevertheless, biopsy has lots of disadvantages such as misdiagnosis and invasive. The writers proposed a non-invasive serological diagnostic tool, CEAgar. The purpose of this project is to create a CEA detecting diagnostic tool through genetically engineered plasmid with Escherichia coli as the vector which can express transforming growth factor-beta receptor type 1 (TGFRBR1), a natural CEA receptor found in human body.:::2019
