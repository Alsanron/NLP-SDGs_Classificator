Victoria_Wellington:::Asia:::New Zealand:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Glycerol based enzymatic fuel cell:::The rise of electric vehicles has created a large demand for batteries. And, with the recent push to declare a climate emergency, it seems that this problem will not be solved by building greater quantities of environment-damaging rare metal batteries (eg. lithium-ion). This iGEM project attempts to solve this issue by building an enzymatic fuel cell to use the abundant, industrial by-product, glycerol to efficiently create clean energy. A three enzyme pathway and the mild radical oxidant TEMPO-NH2 are used to carry out the complete oxidation of glycerol. The three enzymes were manufactured via E. Coli and 6-His tag purification. Finally, the kinetics data is reported with either spectro-photometric measurements of NADH or quantitative H-NMR.:::2019
