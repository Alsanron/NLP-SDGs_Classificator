Alma:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Plaque Attack:::Cardiovascular disease is a class of disease consisting of illnesses that affect the heart and blood vessels. This class of disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, responsible for one in every four deaths. Atherosclerosis is a type of cardiovascular disease that begins as macrophages and cholesterol infiltrate arterial walls forming atherosclerotic plaques. Formation of these plaques is instigated by Trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO), with originates as the Carnitine metabolism byproduct Trimethylamine (TMA). Production of TMA is carried out by gut bacteria in the small intestine. We have sought to develop a counteracting bacteria that would degrade TMA before it is absorbed into the bloodstream. This probiotic strain contains genes from a Methanogenic bacteria that can convert the TMA into less harmful by-products.:::2019
