Aix-Marseille:::Europe:::France:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::I WANT TB FREE:::Tuberculosis is a major public health problem in many regions of the world, both developing countries and in “risky” populations in richer countries. The Aix Marseille University iGEM team has developed their project “I Want TB Free”. The aim of this project is to develop a diagnostic test for tuberculosis that is cheap, rapid, specific and sensitive, has a long shelf-life and easily deployable in regions of the world with little or no scientific infrastructure. The test will specifically detect low levels of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in readily accessible sputum samples generating a colored band on a test strip, enabling earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment than currently available tests. The “I want TB Free” project is developed by a multidisciplinary team of students from different faculties and departments of Aix-Marseille University over the summer of 2019. The design builds on published work and integrates several innovations to achieve its aims.:::2019
