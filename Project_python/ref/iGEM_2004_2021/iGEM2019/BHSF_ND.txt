Such releases may interfere with the balanced microbial ecosystems before and even destroy the original ecological balance. To solve this problem, our team designed a digitalizing bistable module that can detect and prevent the stealing or release of engineering bacteria form labs or factories.We utilize the mutual bistable system that enable conditional suicide of engineered bacteria. To better function, we use a sensor to sense the change of external environment, a recombinase as a flip to form memory which could record the action of stealing or release, and DNase/toxic protein to decompose the functioning bacteria.:::2019
