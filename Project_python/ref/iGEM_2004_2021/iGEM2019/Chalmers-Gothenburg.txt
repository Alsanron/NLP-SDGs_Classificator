Chalmers-Gothenburg:::Europe:::Sweden:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DePCB: Engineered yeast for degradation of PCB:::Our project aims to use synthetic biology to develop a method for bioremediation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated soil. PCBs are a very persistent group of pollutants that bioaccumulate in the fatty tissues of many animals, and although their use was prohibited long ago they still remain a problem. To solve this, we attempt to engineer Saccharomyces cerevisiae with genes from several bacteria encoding enzymes that are able to both dechlorinate and degrade the compounds. The designed system uses two separate yeast strains, one which can use the enzyme PcbA5 to dechlorinate PCBs and another which hosts eight enzymes from the Bph-pathway which can be used to degrade the biphenyl skeleton. The envisioned implementation of this system would allow us to remove PCBs from both soil and water in an efficient way, ultimately removing this long-lasting problem from the environment.:::2019
