These undesirable organic compounds range from endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals, to personal care products, pesticides, and fertilizers. The existing wastewater treatment plants lack adequate infrastructure for removing these pollutants. In this project, we employ a synthetic biology approach to develop a self-assembling catalytic bacterial biofilm capable of degrading ECs. The bacteria were engineered to express fusion proteins that assemble into fibrous structures extracellularly and enable greater accessibility of the enzyme substrate. This platform for the degradation of emerging contaminants is a versatile and promising avenue for the removal of these toxic compounds from wastewater.:::2019
