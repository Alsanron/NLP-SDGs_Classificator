BGU_Israel:::Asia:::Israel:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::FlyGEM- The Trojan Mosquito:::Life-threatening diseases such as Malaria, Dengue fever and Zika fever are caused by parasites transmitted through mosquitoes. Most of these diseases have no treatment or effective prophylaxis, and vector control is the preferable mode of action. However, traditional methods using insecticides are not efficient and an environmental hazard, indicating the need for an effective and eco-friendly solution. In the FlyGEM project, we took advantage of the Bacillus thuringiensis israeliensis (Bti), a gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that produces insecticidal toxins and virulence factors that selectively target the larval mosquito stages. We genetically engineered a bacterium that expresses Bti toxin in the gut microbiome of adult mosquitoes. Mosquitoes fed by Bti-toxin expressing bacteria were not affected, however the bacteria are delivered to the eggs and the expressed Bti is toxic for the hatching and nearby larvae. Thus, our Trojan Mosquito can specifically target the larvae and reduce mosquito population to control mosquito-borne diseases.:::2019
