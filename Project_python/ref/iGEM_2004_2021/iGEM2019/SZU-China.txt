SZU-China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Micrancideâ€”An RNAi-based herbicide for Mikania micrantha:::Mikania micrantha Kunth is one of the most destructive invasive species in the world. It was introduced into China in the early 20th century, leading to great destruction of local environment. However, at present, the major approach for controlling Mikania micrantha Kunth is still chemical herbicide spray, which is associated with significant hazards to crops and environment. RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved mechanism in eukaryotic organisms, in which sequence specific gene silencing is triggered by the introduction of dsRNA. In this project, we used RNAi technology to silence the genes encoding proteins with essential functions to induce mortality in Mikania micrantha Kunth through topical application of E Coli expressed RNAi molecules. In the meantime, we have developed a synthetic kit that can be used to synthesize RNAi nanoparticles of different sizes, and a siRNA sifting program for other researchers to select RNAi molecules for their specific purpose.:::2019
