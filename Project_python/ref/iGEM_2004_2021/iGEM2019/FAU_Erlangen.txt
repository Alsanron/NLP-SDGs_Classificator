FAU_Erlangen:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational:::Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::B.A.A.C.C. - Bispecific Antibody Against Colorectal Cancer:::Whilst monoclonal antibodies were the first breakthrough in immunotherapy a few years ago, now bispecific antibodies are at the forefront of research. Our iGEM Team at FAU Erlangen chose to explore the parts and components of bispecific antibodies in a comprehensive manner. Our wet-lab team is testing three different designs inspired by the Bispecific T-cell Engager (BiTE), which differ in their linker. Bispecific antibodies, such as the BiTE are a promising approach to hurdles otherwise faced in current treatment methods, as BiTEs enable immune-cells to target colorectal cancer cells (Graber K. 2014). We envision a modular and simulation-aided (MD-simulations) approach to engineering such bispecific antibodies, thus allowing a higher adaptability to different treatments . We hope that one day the modularity of BiTEs will be a new standard and we want to make our contribution to creating these foundations.:::2019
