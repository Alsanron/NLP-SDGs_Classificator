UCSC:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Vitrum: Protecting Newcastle Disease Vaccine with Intrinsically Disordered Proteins:::The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) 2019 iGEM team, Vitrum, is developing a heat-stable vaccine formulation. Our novel approach uses intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to protect the live-virus vaccine for Newcastle disease. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is highly infectious among avian species, most notably chickens. This can result in the euthanization of an entire flock to prevent further spread of the disease. IDPs have previously been shown to provide protection for desiccation and heat at the level of organism, individual cells, and isolated protein. In this study, we examine protection of live-virus, potentially relaxing refrigeration requirements for this essential vaccine.:::2019
