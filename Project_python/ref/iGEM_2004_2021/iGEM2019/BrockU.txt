BrockU:::North America:::Canada:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Lights, Camera, Flip!:::Flip recombinase is a versatile and important recombinase enzyme with broad applications in molecular genetic applications. Flip recombinase has been used to induce genetic mutations in vivo in numerous model organisms including bacteria, Drosophila, Zebrafish, and mouse and human cells. However, Flip recombinase activity is binary and thus cannot be precisely activated in time and space. Utilizing light-sensitive protein interaction domains termed “magnets”, we have developed a light-sensitive optogenetic variant of Flip recombinase that can be controlled in Escherichia coli with exquisite spatiotemporal precision. We believe this Opto-Flip recombinase has the potential to be utilized in multiple model organisms and will provide a novel tool allowing for precise molecular-genetic control for numerous future research and industrial applications.:::2019
