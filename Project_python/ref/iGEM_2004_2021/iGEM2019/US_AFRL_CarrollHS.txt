During maintenance of aircraft, hexavalent chromium can be released causing severe environmental and health impacts. With increasing regulations, there is a critical need for a cheap, quick and effective detection test. Through our human practices, potential users were reticent about using engineered live microbes and since hexavalent chromium is toxic to bacteria, we set out to develop a cell-free system which includes the repressor, ChrB, that binds to the chromium promoter ChrP. In the presence of hexavalent chromium, ChrB is released from ChrP, allowing for the expression of a reporter gene. We explore the use of two different reporter genes: a green fluorescent protein, and a bacterial flavin-containing monooxygenase, an enzyme that results in visible indigo production. Therefore, in the presence of hexavalent chromium, the system will produce a visible color change.:::2019
