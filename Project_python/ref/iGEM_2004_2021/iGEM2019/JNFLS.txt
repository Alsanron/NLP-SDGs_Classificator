JNFLS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Indoor formaldehyde recycle-producing Xylulose:::Formaldehyde is becoming the top one killer in the indoor chemical pollutants, and it has been identified as carcinogenic and teratogenic substances by the World Health Organization (WHO). Human payed more attention on the removal of indoor formaldehyde, but these removed formaldehyde is released to the environment which is a kind of waste of resources. Xylulose as a metabolic intermediate is the precursor of rare sugars, and its unique pattern of biological activity plays an important role in the fields of food, health, medicine and so on. We found a new pathway for xylulose synthesis from formaldehyde. Two important enzymes benzoylformate decarboxylase mutant BFD-M4 (from Pseudomonas putida) and transaldolase mutant TalB-F178Y (from Escherichia coli) are involved in this pathway in which indoor formaldehyde can be eliminated, and xylulose is produced with formaldehyde.:::2019
