Bonn:::Europe:::Germany:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Optoplant: Lighting up your way to a better future:::Creating a plant that can glow in the dark is not a unique project; it has been tried before and not with much success, which is why we are taking a more conservative approach to this project: By testing various parts of gene constructs and bioluminescent systems we can quantify and show the best parts available for someone to make a functional glowing plant. The parts we are testing in a bacterial chassis (E. Coli) and then in a plant chassis (Nicotiana Benthamiana) are Promoters, Mutated LuxAB Complexes, Riboswitch, and Fluorescent Reporter Genes. By using IIS Restriction we can interchange any part of a gene construct with relative ease allowing us to quickly test and compare various constructs due to the modular nature of our cloning method. Optoplant will provide the first basis for others working with bioluminescence systems and plant engineering.:::2019
