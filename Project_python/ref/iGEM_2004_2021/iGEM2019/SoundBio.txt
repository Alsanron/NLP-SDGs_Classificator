SoundBio:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Bacto-Basics: Spatially Controlling attachment of Functional Proteins on Bacterial Cellulose using Optogenetics:::Our project aims to create a platform for precise, light-based control of bacterial cellulose (BC) functionalization for a multitude of applications including burn wound treatment, tissue scaffolding, and air filtration. We will grow Komagataeibacter rhaeticus (K. rhaeticus), a bacterial species that naturally produces BC. We will engineer E. coli to attach fusion proteins via a double cellulose binding domain for functionalization of BC. Levels of functionalization will be controlled with focused light via two optogenetic circuits utilizing red and blue light. By designing and constructing a bioreactor compatible with our optogenetic light control system, we aim to optimize K. rhaeticus growth and BC production by using Raspberry Pi-controlled sensors to monitor our cultureâ€™s pH, oxygen levels and temperature and developing a method to optimize media conditions. Our project demonstrates a proof-of-concept regarding BC functionalization through the attachment of chromoproteins to the cellulose membrane.:::2019
