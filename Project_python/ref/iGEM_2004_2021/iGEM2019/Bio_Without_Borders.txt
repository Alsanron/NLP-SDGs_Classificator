Silencing genes in Diaphorina citri to Combat Huanglongbing Disease in Citrus:::Huanglongbing (HLB) is an infection of the bacterium Candidatus liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) that compromises the immune system of host citrus plants. It is introduced to the citrus plant when the asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri feeds on the plant’s sap. CLas migrates from insect gut into the phloem through the psyllid’s saliva. Pesticide and antibiotic have disastrous long term effects in the form of ecological destruction and creation of antibiotic resistant soil bacteria. We improved upon the work of the 2017 TecCEM team, using a modification of their system to silence critical psyllid development genes using siRNA. We targeted arginine kinase and superoxide dismutase, and we explored the use of whole bacteria instead of purified siRNA to treat plants. We envision delivery via a trap that contains the RNase minus E.coli/siRNA-producing cassette. We hope to slow down the spread of CLas through the reduction of psyllid populations.:::2019
