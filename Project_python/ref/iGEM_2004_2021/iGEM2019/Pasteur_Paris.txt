Pasteur_Paris:::Europe:::France:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DIANE: An aptamer-based device for rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria in biological fluids:::Rapid and precise diagnosis is critical to patient outcomes. Our goal is to develop a point-of-care diagnosis device, DIANE (Diagnosis is Now Easier), to be used for the detection of pathogens in biological fluids. The detection will take only a few minutes with a higher sensitivity than current serological cultures. Our device has been conceived to incorporate key design features based on feedback from physicians and scientists. It will be composed of aptamers linked to carbon nanotube electrodes, which will detect bacteria through a voltage change after binding. Aptamers are selectively identified from a library with the Whole-Cell SELEX method and chosen to recognize specific bacteria. Moreover, user-friendliness will be improved by automation with pumps and microfluidics. DIANE will enhance the diagnosis speed allowing doctors to adapt the treatment for each patient. We hope to make the diagnosis of critical life threatening situations quick and easy for practicians and NGOs.:::2019
