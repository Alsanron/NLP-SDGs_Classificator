BUAP_Mexico:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PlastiCO₂ - Producing bioplastics from CO₂ and vegetable waste:::Nowadays the excessive production of CO₂ is causing a phenomenon called ocean acidification (OA) which combined with tons of plastics in the ocean are both main problems in the marine environment. Through genetically transformation, E. coli BL-21 bacterium will combine the capability of plants to get CO₂ from the marine environment (decreasing the OA) and the skill from some bacterium to degradate of vegetable waste in order to have sugar source. Both processes are vital in order to produce great pyruvate quantities to get polyhydroxybutyrate, which is used to produce bioplastics that could replace the prevailing polymer . For maintaining the Pyruvate production and photorespiration in the highest and lowest level, respectively we will design a system which works under anaerobic conditions and repress the aerobic metabolism using arcA protein and for measuring the pyruvate production we design a biosensor.:::2019
