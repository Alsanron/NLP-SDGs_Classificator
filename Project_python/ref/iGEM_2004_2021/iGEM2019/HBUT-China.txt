HBUT-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Gluttonous Yeast:::At present, heavy metal pollution is quite serious, which has great harm to the environment and organisms. HBUT-China iGEM team noted the serious problem and focused on the treatment of nickel, one of the major ions causing heavy metal pollution. The team chose Saccharomyces cerevisiae as chassis, build an engineering strain that can actively absorb nickel ions and store nickel ions in vacuoles. Nickel ions can be first captured onto the surface of yeasts by a surface display system, then will be transferred nickel ions to cells by a channel protein. At last they are successfully transferred to vacuoles by a translocator, which can strengthen yeastâ€™s tolerance to Nickel ions. In addition to the absorption, we also envisage recovering nickel ions, so that the original nickel waste can regain its value. We also made a working model of our processing system, combining with a cell immobilization technology.:::2019
