GDSYZX:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Adorabal(Salidroside produced in Arabidopsis thaliana ):::The rhizomes and roots of Rhodiola rosea have been used for centuries for medicinal purposes.Recent interest in the species Rhodiola rosea in the West arose from the use of the rhizome as an adaptogen for the treatment of stress, but in the last few years, chemical and pharmacological studies have confirmed other valuable medicinal properties. Approaches on biosynthesis of salidroside in Rhodiola rosea and its key metabolic enzymes have been published, and the required precursor substance exist in Nicotiana benthamiana have been found. Arabidopsis thaliana has the potential of synthetizing salidroside which worth researching. Hence, we were inspired to combine the key metabolic enzymes and these two plants, which are further more competent in commercial production. Our project aims to use the techniques of synthetic biology to provide a sustainable way to obtain large quantities of salidroside in arabidopsis protoplasts.:::2019
