IIT_Chicago:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Green Ocean:::Green Oceanâ€™s aim is to genetically modify marine cyanobacteria that will enable it to degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET), most common form of plastic in the oceans. The engineered cyanobacteria harbor PETase, an enzyme that breaks down PET. Our approach is novel because instead of using the traditional e. coli, which may not survive in the ocean environment, cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria that thrive in the ocean. We have modified the prototypical Ideonella sakaiensis PETase gene to be compatible with expression and secretion in cyanobacteria. This engineering was accomplished in a dual-host plasmid shuttle vector in E coli, and then transferred to a model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus by conjugation.We also developed a PET degradation assay system consisting of fluorescent PET nanoparticles. The degradation of the PET nanoparticles was measured by a variety of imaging and functional assays. We desire to make a change in the world starting with a Green Ocean.:::2019
