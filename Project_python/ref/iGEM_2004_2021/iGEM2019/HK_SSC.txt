HK_SSC:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Expression of dCas9-sgRNA Complex in Microcystis Aeruginosa Resulting in the Repression of its Toxin-producing Gene:::Microcystis aeruginosa is one of the most common cyanobacteria responsible for harmful algal blooms. This cyanobacterium produces microcystin, a hepatotoxin that damages the liver. However, direct lysis of Microcystis aeruginosa may not best for the environment as it holds ecological values of heavy metal sorption and oxygen synthesis. We hope to silence the microcystin biosynthesis cluster(mcy) using a catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) enzyme lacking endonuclease activity. When the dCas9 enzyme is co-expressed with a guide RNA(sgRNA), the dCas9-sgRNA complex specifically binds to the McyB gene and blocks transcript elongation, leading to the repression of the McyB gene without altering the chromosome of the Microcystis. Here we provide the design of a dCas9-sgRNA expression gene in a shuttle vector that can replicate in both E.coli and cyanobacteria. We will also be conducting downstream analysis to see how our dCas9-sgRNA expression plasmid affects the microcystin-production rate and oxygen synthesis rate of Microcystis.:::2019
