Macquarie_Australia:::Asia:::Australia:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::HyDRA: Hydrogen Detection for Real Applications:::Australia is positioned to become a world leader in hydrogen production and export by 2030. Hydrogen gas detection is notoriously challenging, being odourless, colourless and explosive at low concentrations (4%). From the canary in the coal mine, to the advanced gas detection equipment available today, the reliable detection of dangerous gas leaks remains of paramount importance. Hydrogen gas detectors are prone to cross-sensitivity due to the presence of other gases interfering with the measurement. Team HyDRA designed a highly specific hydrogen gas biosensor using Escherichia coli, containing a NiFe hydrogenase, cyclic-di-GMP riboswitch and cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase. We designed this system to produce a fluorescent signal upon the detection of sufficient hydrogen gas to be considered a safety threat (40,000 ppm). Consultations with fire rescue, gas production and pipeline industries have guided us to design a prototype, resulting in a safe, reliable and efficient alternative method for quantifying hydrogen gas.:::2019
