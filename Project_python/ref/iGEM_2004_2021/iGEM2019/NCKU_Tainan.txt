NCKU_Tainan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A comprehensive solution to CKD: OH MY GUT:::Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an emerging global health problem. The prevalence of kidney disease is increasing dramatically and the cost of treating this growing epidemic is an enormous burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Recent research has proved that the accumulation of uremic toxins like p-Cresol due to a failing kidney plays an important role in the worsening of cardiovascular and renal diseases. This year, iGEM NCKU Tainan aims to provide "Oh My Gut", a comprehensive solution to this problem. We are developing an innovative life-saving therapy using engineered bacteria. We will be providing a biotherapeutic that can reduce p-Cresol production in the gut and a simple and cost-effective blood p-Cresol measuring device. Various measures have been taken to maximize biological safety, including gene knockout. With Oh My Gut, we can not only slow down the progression of CKD but also prevent complications and improve the quality of life.:::2019
