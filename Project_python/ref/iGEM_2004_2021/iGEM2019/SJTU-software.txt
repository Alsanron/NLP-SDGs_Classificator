We present here Phosyme, an online toolbox focusing on the plant synthetic biology. Phosyme provides an integrated metabolism database for plant synthetic biology as well as tools including enzyme selection system and reaction prediction systems. In addition, Phosyme integrates existing plant synthetic biology results in iGEM. Deep learning will be applied to predict the reaction between an enzyme and the base. The enzyme selection tool can help users determine whether an enzyme can react to a base in photosynthetic reactions.:::2019
