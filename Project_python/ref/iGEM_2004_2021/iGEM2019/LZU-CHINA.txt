LZU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::No-Returning Route of Pancreatic Cancer:::Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor that is difficult to diagnose and treat. We designed a system which can generate different responses by judging the current state of cells to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. We used a regulatory line of protein-protein interactions to achieve this aim. We extracted TIL cells from the patient's cancer cells and then injected the engineered TIL cells back. TIL cells can target cancer cells, while exosomes automatically encapsulate mRNA and send it to cancer cells. If the cells are normal, the system wonâ€™t start; if only a few cells are cancerous, the system will increase the amount of ALKBH5 through the ras-raf pathway receptor to attenuate the expression of the wnt pathway; if a large number of cells have undergone cancer, the system will initiate an apoptosis program through the hypoxia-inducible factor system, releasing a large amount of casp3 to promote apoptosis of cancer cells.:::2019
