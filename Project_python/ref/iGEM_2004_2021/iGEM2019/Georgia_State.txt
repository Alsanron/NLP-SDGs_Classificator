Though no single factor has been established as the cause, a solution may involve genetically modifying the symbiotic microalgae, Symbiodinium. We are optimizing culturing techniques for Symbiodinium microadriaticum and Oxyrrhis marina (model organism). We designed a codon-optimized red fluorescent protein part that was cloned into a dinoflagellate-optimized expression plasmid (DinoIII)(Sprecher, et. al 2019) for transformation into O. marina as a proof of concept. In parallel, we are attempting to replicate the only known successful transformation of Symbiodinium using Agrobacterium tumefacien carrying a binary vector, pCB302-GFP-MBD (Ortiz-Matamoros et. al 2015), and developing electroporation protocols. A genomic analysis of clade D, a clade associated with higher bleaching resistance but diminished coral growth, will identify target resistance-related genes for transformation into a favorable clade. Corals will uptake the modified algae, increasing their resistance to bleaching.:::2019
