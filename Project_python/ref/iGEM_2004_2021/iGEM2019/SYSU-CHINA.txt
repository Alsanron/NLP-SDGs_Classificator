SYSU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AdmiT: oncolytic Adenovirus with miRNA profiles Targeted:::Cancer is a threat for human welfare and finding effective drugs for a specific cancer is even thornier. As miRNA is widely used for tumor classification and prognosis, we now put forward an engineered adenovirus which can conditionally kill tumor cells by targeting unique miRNA profiles in specific cell. We assume to verify this system in colon cancer, so we developed a R package screening for specific recognition and found out miR-663b, miR-885-5p and miR-592 in COAD . Then we constructed corresponding miRNA sensors and used adenovirus early gene E1A and E1B55K to determine viral replication and tumor lysis. For safety concerns, Tet-on system is applied as a switch, and suppository or enemata may be our way of drug delivery. Math model is used to anticipate that this virus can be developed into a standardized instructive protocol for various cancer types as well as an efficient admission for cancer therapy.:::2019
