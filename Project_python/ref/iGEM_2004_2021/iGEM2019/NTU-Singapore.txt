NTU-Singapore:::Asia:::Singapore:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CasRx: More Than Meets the I:::For iGEM 2019, we were inspired by feedback from the public, academics and doctors, who desired a safer way to correct disease-causing genetic mutations. Hence, our iGEM project aims to tackle this challenge by featuring RNA editing as a safer alternative to DNA editing. By incorporating feedback from our human practices, we decided to improve upon our RNA editing project from last year and include the analysis of off-targets as a safety component. We aim to identify a dCas13-ADAR2 (Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) fusion protein that has high RNA editing activity and high specificity (low off-targets), with future applications in therapeutics and research.:::2019
