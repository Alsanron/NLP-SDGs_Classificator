SDU_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Light-controlled bacterial co-culture system:::In nature, the microorganisms donâ€™t exist in isolation, but interact and cooperate to accomplish the complex tasks in the complicated ecosystem. In the microbiological industry like fermentation, the bacteria co-culture is promising. However, it is difficult for people to achieve dynamic regulation in the co-culture system. This year, we build a LCBC system (Light Controlled Bacteria Co-culture). In the system, we use the lights with different colors to regulate and control the amount and ratio of the bacteria. This system consists of three parts: two orthogonal light-controlled systems, the QS system which is designed for bi-directional communication, and the toxin/antitoxin system that can regulate the amount and ratio of the bacteria. We also develop the matching software to help the users apply our system. In the future, we envision our bacteria co-culture system being applied in the fermentation and other related microbial engineering.:::2019
