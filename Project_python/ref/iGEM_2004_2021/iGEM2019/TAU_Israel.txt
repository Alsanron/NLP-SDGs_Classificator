TAU_Israel:::Asia:::Israel:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Pyo-Pyo is a novel approach for fighting resistant bacteria, based on the use of pyocins:::Antibiotic resistance is defined by WHO as one of the biggest threats to global health. We suggest a solution that involves the use of R-type Pyocins, protein complexes produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pyocins resemble bacteriophage structures while the killing spectra is determined by the pyocin tail fiber. Pyo-Pyo is a modular and controllable system created in a non-pathogenic E. coli which is served as a flexible “drug factory”. By replacing the original pyocin tail fibers with other tails the pyocins are engineered to target different bacterial pathogens. Our solution also includes software, based on novel algorithms, for both designing the relevant tail fibers to target specific bacteria, and for optimizing the distribution of the pyocins in a specific medium for cost-effective usage. In further experiments, we wish to regulate the expression of the pyocins by varying inducing agents and to provide a complete POC for a variety of future uses.:::2019
