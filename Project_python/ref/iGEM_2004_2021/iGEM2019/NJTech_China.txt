NJTech_China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::TAT Trap:::Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women, with the recurrence rate up to 40%. Currently, the most advanced treatment for cancer is immunotherapy. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) stimulates the growth and activity of T-lymphocytes to boost immune system. Use of an inhibitor that blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 receptor can prevent the cancer from evading the immune system. Our product targets both IL-2 and PD-L1, implementing a trap between Tumor and T cells. We evaluate the efficacy of our bi-functional fusion protein by the binding assay and T cell proliferation assay, as well as killing assay. In order to solve the short half-life and acute toxicity of IL-2, we apply Poly-Î³-glutamic acid hydrogels to encapsulate the fusion protein to achieve sustained release effect. This study sheds light on clinical treatment of breast cancer, improving the quality of life of postoperative patients.:::2019
