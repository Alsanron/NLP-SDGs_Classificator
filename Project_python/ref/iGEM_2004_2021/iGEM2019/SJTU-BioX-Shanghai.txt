SJTU-BioX-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mulan - a real-time off-target detection and biostorage device based on CRISPR:::As a significant tool in biological research, CRISPR's potential has not been fully exploited, and the off-target problems remain unsolved. Concerning this, we aim at optimizing CRISPR system in two aspects: developing in-situ detection of off-target and novel biostorage. The real-time monitor of off-target is basically composed of a lure sequence, derived from off-target possibility predictions with the Markov model, and a quick-response reporter system based on split luciferase. Luminescence is displayed upon dCas9's binding to lure sequence using luciferase complementary assay. Our biostorage is based on CRISPR acquisition. Signal initiates Cas1/2 to insert protospacer into CRISPR array, further moving the predesigned stop codon out of frame and EGFP into the ORF. When applied with Galois fields, information can be stored in binary format with optimal fault tolerance. In summary, our project provides an off-target control and a novel application for CRISPR.:::2019
