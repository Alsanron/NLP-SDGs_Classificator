However, spider breeding is not applicable due to spider's fierce behavior. The current approach is to produce recombinant spidroins (silk proteins) from other chassis and spin them into silk. This year, we aim to manufacture recombinant spider silk with E.coli and color the silk for application in cloth industry. We modularized three significant domains of spidroin - the N-terminal, the repetitive region, and the C-terminal - and integrated them into various spidroin to form silk. We then dyed the silk with microbial natural pigments deoxyviolacein and indigo. To obtain better color and a more convenient dying process, we fused the repetitive region to chromoproteins and mixed them with spidroin during spinning. Our team hopes to provide a novel approach for cloth production and explore new possibilities for spider silk applications.:::2019
