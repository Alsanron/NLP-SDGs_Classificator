How to ensure temperature never rised during the storage and transport in a precise and convenience way is critical. RNA thermometers, which are RNA-based sensors, control the gene expression by achieving certain temperature. Here, we construct a library of RNA thermometers, based on thermodynamic computations, to express chromoproteins or fluorescent proteins in cell-free system. Our results show that the RNA thermometer system reacts with visible colors by the temperature rises in a short time. Our results also demonstrate that this system has high capability of detecting temperatures in small amounts of changing. We design and try to make a commercial, cheap and simple product to put on vaccine package. We anticipate our assay is a starting point of detecting temperature and could be applied to other fields, for example, food.:::2019
