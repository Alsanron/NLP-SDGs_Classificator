Lethbridge_HS:::North America:::Canada:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::CADAR: CRISPR-Assisted Detection and Removal of pathogenic organisms disrupting the microbiome:::Although present antibiotics are credited with improving the health of millions, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a great threat to human health. Additionally, current antibiotics can cause harm to the human microbiomes due to delayed or misdiagnosis. Therefore, alternative detection methods and antimicrobials should be investigated. We propose the use of a CRISPR-Cas13a system for rapid detection and specific targeting of pathogens. CRISPR-Cas13a can target and cleave a strain-specific RNA sequence. The cleaving of the target RNA sequence will initiate non-discriminant cleavage of surrounding non-target RNA. Our system will report the presence of a pathogen by a visible colour loss due to the collateral cleavage of fluorescent RNA Mango. Furthermore, our alternative antimicrobial will consist of an engineered phagemid that encodes for the CRISPR-Cas13a system, which when inserted into a chosen bacteriophage can then infect pathogenic bacterial cells in the human body; thereby destroying the targeted bacteria through collateral RNA cleavage.:::2019
