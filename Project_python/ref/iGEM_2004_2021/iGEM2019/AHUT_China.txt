AHUT_China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Carbon Dioxide Capturer 2.0:::In this project, we intended to immobilized the mutated carbonic anhydrase (CAⅡ) estabilied last year on carriers with amino groups to further improve its application in CO2 capture. Specifically, site-specific immobilization method was realized via protein labeling. Firstly, sulphatase motif (LCTASR) was added to the terminus of mutated carbonic anhydrase (CAⅡ-LCTASR) by genetic engeneering method; then, an aldehyde tag was introduced to the mutated carbonic anhydrase by co-transforming the recombinant plasmid CAⅡ-LCTASR and formyglycine-modified enzyme expression system myc-his A Rv0712 (FGE) into E.coli TB1; finally, the aldehyde-tagged CAⅡ were immobilized via forming covalent with amino functionalized supports through the Schiff base reaction. Our results revealed that CAⅡ could be successfully immobilized and retained its original activity.:::2019
