Bilkent-UNAMBG:::Europe:::Turkey:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PRISMO - Probiotic Insulin Secreting Modified Organism:::Diabetes is a metabolic disease that affects over 422 million people globally and this number is increasing rapidly. Diabetes results in hyperglycemia due to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action or both. This year the Bilkent UNAMBG team aims to present an alternative solution to diabetes using ‘Living Therapeutics’. We plan to engineer a bacterium that will colonize itself in the gut and will secrete single-chain insulin (SCI) analogs when induced. We designed 8 different SCI constructs among which we will characterize and select the most effective analog. These SCI analogs will be displayed on the cell surface via Ag43 autotransporters along with TEV proteases which will cleave the SCI analogs. Cell-penetrating peptides will be fused to SCI analogs to induce penetration through the epithelium of the gut to the bloodstream. We envision an easier and more affordable diabetes treatment with PRISMO.:::2019
