The ensuing possibility of worldwide pandemics leading to widespread human suffering and death is now tangible. Volatect is a point of care diagnostics device coupled with a results database and API, enabling the swift detection, surveillance and control of epidemic-prone diseases. The novel DETECTR technique, combining Recombinase Polymerase Amplification and CRISPR-Cas12, is applied to collected saliva samples on a proprietary microfluidic chip to detect a customizable assay of infectious diseases. Using modified fluorescence quenchers and carefully designed primers in combination with CRISPR technology allows high sensitivity and specificity of disease detection. Volatect provides a seamless sample collection and pathogen detection platform with the unique advantage of customizable real-time diagnostics data for outbreak tracking, epidemiological data gathering and building interactions with existing healthcare and travel databases.:::2019
