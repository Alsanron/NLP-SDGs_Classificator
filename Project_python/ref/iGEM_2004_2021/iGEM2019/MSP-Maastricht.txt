MSP-Maastricht:::Europe:::Netherlands:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The RocKit:::The Receptor Open Community Kit, or RocKit, takes an innovative new approach to synthesize customised receptors. The RocKit provides researchers with a way of creating receptors for any target and access to a database containing information about all receptors made with the RocKit. Our kit is easy to use, containing all the cells, DNA and buffers to utilise this technology. The system is carried out in yeast which are transformed with the genes for all components in the genetic circuit. We use a system of directed random mutation to simulate accelerated evolution to the binding site of the receptor until it evolves an affinity for the specific target molecule of choice. Our base receptor is designed in such a way as to allow for easy extraction for use in experimentation. All receptor sequences can then be uploaded to the RocCloud to facilitate the creation of an open, information-sharing scientific community.:::2019
