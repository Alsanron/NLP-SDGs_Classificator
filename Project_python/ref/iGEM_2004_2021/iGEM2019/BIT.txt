BIT:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Microbial sensor coupled with microfluidic chip and smartphone detects oxidative damage effect:::Radiation or various unknown chemical reagents may lead to genetic diseases. Detection methods based on analytical chemistry and biology are mostly tests for DNA damage products and damaged intermediates. This passive assay does not allow identification and evaluation of the DNA damage capabilities of unknown compounds. We constructe a microbial sensor that can be used to identify oxidative damage reagents. A promoter which is sensitive to oxidative free radicals is screened to respond to the signal and regulate the expression of fluorescent proteins. using ratio of fluorescence to od to judge whether it is an oxidative damage reagent and it's strength. We designed a microfluidic chip with mixing channel and ratchet structure for the culturing and testing,which greatly reduced the amount of experimental operation. We have independently developed a miniaturized instrument based on a small program of smart phone,which is can be used for fluorescence detection and cell morphology observation.:::2019
