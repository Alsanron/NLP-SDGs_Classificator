ITESO_Guadalajara:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RubisCO:::In RubisCO, we are thinking of new ways in which we can manage the waste we put in the environment through the gas and wastewater streams that come from the city and the industry, by harnessing the capability of cyanobacteria to grow in brackish water and to fix carbon dioxide through its metabolism. But this process has become slow and prone to errors, losing part of its output through photorespiration. From this understanding, we are focusing on enhancing the carbon fixing mechanisms of Synechococcus sp. and conducting the surplus of carbon flow to the synthesis of high added-value chemical intermediates, such as free fatty acids, to increase the economic feasibility of the implementation of Carbon Capture and Utilization technologies, which are urgently needed to fight back Climate Change. Systems Biology, Bioprocessâ€™ Simulation, and integral stakeholder management have been performed to assess the feasibility and impact of the proposal here presented.:::2019
