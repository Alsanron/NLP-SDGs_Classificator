UANL:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. compa: Bacterial Synthetic Organelle for Toxicity Reduction and Metabolic Optimization:::This project aims to implement Bacterial Micrcompartments (BMC) to E. coli as nanoreactors for industrial biotransformation of phenolic compounds present in pre-processed organic waste from lignocellulosic industry called Black Liquor (BL). This will be achieved through encapsulation of a triple enzyme pathway inside of an engineered Propanediol Utilization (PDU) system, a type of BMC from Salmonella. The pathway transforms vanillate, present in BL (initial genetic circuit inductor) in to protocatechuete (secundary inductor), catechol and finally in to cis-cis-Muconate, a chemical used in some polymer production. This strategy will optimize the flux through metabolic channeling, toxic intermediate sequestration and dynamic metabolic control. PDU protein, PduU, was modified through protein engineering to increase flux of substrate into BMC, and Molecular Dynamics Simulations were performed to predict its stability, as well as the permeability of metabolites. Our goal is the design of BMCs as a device to optimize the biosynthesis of compounds.:::2019
