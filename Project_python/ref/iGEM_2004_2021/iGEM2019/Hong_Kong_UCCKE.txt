However, we noticed that those facilities are only built to solve the industrial food waste problem but not domestic food waste. It left us thinking, is there any way we can solve the problem at home using simple engineering and synthetic biology? We designed composite parts to digest amylase, lipase and produce a more pleasant smell during the process alongside a food waste conversion machine to tackle the modern-day problem in a smaller scale and faster paste.:::2019
