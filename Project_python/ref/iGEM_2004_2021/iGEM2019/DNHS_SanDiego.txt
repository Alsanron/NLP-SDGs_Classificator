DNHS_SanDiego:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Optimizing Efficiency of PETase Mutants for Solution to Plastic Pollution:::Today, approximately 269,000 tons of plastic is floating in open ocean. Using E. coli transformed with plasmids expressing PETase, an enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis that degrades polyethylene terephtalate (PET), this projectâ€™s purpose was to develop a more thermostable and efficient enzyme to combat this microplastic pollution. Nine E. coli strains were engineered, each with unique mutations to alter the PETase activity and thermodynamic properties. Growth assays were conducted at different temperatures, with and without the presence of the PET substrate. Protein expression analysis of the mutants revealed a band for every strain at approximately 31 kDa, the expected size of PETase. Using a plate reader, absorption of the samples was measured and peaks at 260 nm were compared to detect the presence of MHET, a downstream product of PET degradation. With success, a faster and more efficient PETase enzyme could eventually be the solution to end the plastic pollution problem.:::2019
