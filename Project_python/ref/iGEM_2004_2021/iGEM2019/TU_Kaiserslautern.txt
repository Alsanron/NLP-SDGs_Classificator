TU_Kaiserslautern:::Europe:::Germany:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Chlamy Yummy - Revolutionizing plastic degradation by introducing Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a eukaryotic secretion platform:::Plastic pollution is threatening life in all environment niches on this planet. We are taking action to save our planet by developing a biological recycling method for PET, a major plastic component. By inserting the genes for PETase and MHETase into the green algae, C. reinhardtii, we enable the degradation of PET into its monomers. These will be purified and used for resynthesizing PET. Our Bio-enzymatic environmentally friendly recycling method has a lower energy consumption in contrast to conventional recycling methods that rely on high pressure and temperature. Our approach allows the resynthesis of virgin PET, thereby maintaining the quality of newly synthesized plastics, while eliminating the need for new PET synthesis. We aim for our recycling system to become established in waste management and water treatment centers worldwide. Our Vision is to eliminate pollution of our environment with macro- and microplastic by developing a closed circle economy for PET!:::2019
