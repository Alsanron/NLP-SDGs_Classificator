Tartu_TUIT:::Europe:::Estonia:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Pop Culture:::The goal of our project is to develop the autolytic yeast strain beneficial for biotech companies. The use of the strain as a basis for yeast cell factories will ease the extraction of valuable compounds from the cells. Usually, chemical cell lysis method is used but it is quite expensive and time-consuming for large scale production. To achieve our goal, we want to introduce extra copies of the genes encoding for yeast cell wall degrading enzymes (glucanases) and modify some enzymes involved in the cell wall biosynthesis. Initially, we will induce the production of glucanases and downregulate cell wall synthesizing enzymes to make the cell wall weaker and to promote releasing of the cellular content into the media. As a next step, we hope to develop a fully automated system to control lysis of the cells. The lysis will be self-activated at a certain point of the cell lifespan.:::2019
