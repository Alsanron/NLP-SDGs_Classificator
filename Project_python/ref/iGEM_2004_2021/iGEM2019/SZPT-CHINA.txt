SZPT-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Antihypertensive Probiotics:::Hypertension is a worldwide health problem that can even be life-threatening.Antihypertensive peptides(AHPs),a kind of food-derived short peptides,can lower blood pressure with no side effects compared with the drugs.Our team developed AHPs functional food this year.we constructed AHPs mutimers,fused the peptides to food protein and then engineered into a probiotic.The recombinant probiotic can implant in intestine,then express the fusion protein by the regulation of gastrointestinal different pH.The expressed fusion protein can be hydrolyzed by intestinal hydrolase to release the AHPs,which can be absorbed to exert a sustainable and gentle blood pressure lowering effect.This producing AHPs probiotic could be made tablet,powder,capsule,even yogurt.These product are more acceptable to people. It can be a assistant product for hypertensive patients to lower their blood pressure and also help those person with borderline blood pressure to prevent hypertension.:::2019
