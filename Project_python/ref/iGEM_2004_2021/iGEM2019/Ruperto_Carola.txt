Ruperto_Carola:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Fantastic yeasts and how to evolve them:::Peptide detection plays a pivotal role in various synthetic biology applications ranging from point-of-care diagnostics to personalized medicine, and real-time profiling of biological systems and the environment. Naturally occurring systems for peptide detection commonly employ G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), linking extracellular cues to intracellular responses. For our project, we will harness the power of directed evolution coupled to the specificity of GPCRs, establishing a versatile platform for directed evolution of S. cerevisiae mating receptor STE2. We employ both in vivo and in silico, machine-learning-guided evolution for exploring the landscape of cognate receptor-ligand pairs. We provide a cell-level probabilistic model faithfully describing our systemâ€™s dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the signalling repertoire of S. cerevisiae by engineering fully orthogonal GPCRs and signalling cascades. We combine these features to engineer a comprehensive yeast receptor and signalling evolution toolbox, which we provide to the iGEM community.:::2019
