Manchester:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Using genetically engineered E.coli to synthesise alternative hair care products.:::Current hair dyes contain many toxic chemicals i.e. Ammonia, which breaks open the outer layer of the hair to allow dyes to penetrate. These chemicals also cause severe allergic reactions and irreparable hair damage. The University of Manchester iGEM team hopes to tackle this problem by genetically engineering E.coli that binds to hair and secretes hair dyes in situ. The coloured proteins have hydrophobic tags that will allow them to anchor onto hair without breaking the cuticle. We have also taken this opportunity to integrate reparative and fragrant compounds to our product. Research has found that the ‘pepG decapeptide’ can infiltrate the hair and reform disulphide bonds, effectively straightening and repairing hair. We have also worked on integrating limonene and vanillin production into our E.coli to make the hair fragrant. The combination of hair dyes, reparative and fragrant compounds means that our product will be an all-round hair care product.:::2019
