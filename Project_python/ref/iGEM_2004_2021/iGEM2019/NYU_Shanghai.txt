NYU_Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::C.O.D.E.S. - COllagen Derived Engineering Scaffold:::Fish scales are actually capable of producing electric potential, and we believe that this feature is best utilized in a tissue scaffold. Fish scales are rigid and can uphold structure during tissue development, are piezoelectric and can initiate signaling interactions by electric potential with certain modulators, and are biocompatible as they are mainly made of collagen. In our iGEM experiments, we have proved two major points to show the feasibility of our idea: fish scales can produce electricity by mechanical stress; bacterial cells can be controlled by electric potentials to perform complex signaling pathways. Furthermore, we have applied feedback from experts to improve our own experiments and advance our ideas to the next step, such as creating a more complex tissue regeneration system.:::2019
