D-glutamate-rich γ-PGA is industrially produced by natural strain Bacillus species. D-glutamate degrades more slowly and L- glutamate has better biocompatibility. Therefore, γ-PGA with tailored L/D glutamate ratio is demanded for more diverse applications. By constructing the biobricks of γ-PGA synthase complex, 0.696 g/L L-glutamate-rich γ-PGA was accumulated in Corynebacterium glutamicum. Using the mathematical models based on the fermentation profile, the fermentation was optimized, and 15 times more γ-PGA was produced than that before. By introducing glutamate racemase gene racE under different Ptac promoter mutants, the L-glutamic acid content in γ-PGA varies from 97.1% to 36.9%. Finally, we devoted to fine tune the D/L-monomer ratio using standarized RBS elements (RBS modified with bicistron design). Our project provides a method for customerized polymer biosynthesis with precisely controlled D/L ratio, and may expand to other biopolymer synthesis.:::2019
