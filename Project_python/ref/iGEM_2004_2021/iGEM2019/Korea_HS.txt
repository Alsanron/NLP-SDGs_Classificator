Korea_HS:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Designing a Hyperstable Antibody with Cell-penetrating Peptide for Intracellular Targeting:::Antibodies are used to treat diseases, but their targets are limited to cell surface receptors because crucial disulfide bonds are broken in reducing environments. scFv(P5) is an example of "hyperstable‚Äù antibody that maintains its function in reducing environments. We attached Cell-penetrating peptide(CPP) to the N-terminus of scFv(CPP-scFv(P5)) to design hyperstable scFv(P5) that can penetrate the cell membrane. CPP-scFV(P5) was expressed and purified using affinity and size-exclusion chromatography to check if CPP-scFV(P5) binds lysozyme, the target protein. Immunofluorescence(IF) showed CPP-scFv(P5) can penetrate the cell membrane. Through modeling, we grafted CDR regions of anti-Ras antibody to scFv(F8) to make hyperstable scFv that can recognize Ras. We performed homology modeling of engineered scFv using Modeller and showed our model is structurally similar to anti-Ras antibody. Our experiments demonstrate hyperstable scFv with CPP can go into the cell and function in reducing conditions. This opens opportunities for developing antibodies that target intracellular proteins.:::2019
