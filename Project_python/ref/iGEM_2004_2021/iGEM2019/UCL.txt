Several strategies have been employed to create targeted drug therapies which are able to effectively destroy cancerous cells while minimising effects on healthy ones. These include using antibodies and various types of polymer or lipid based nanoparticles. However, often such treatments are expensive, require substantial post-production modifications, or have stability issues. Encapsulins are highly stable, cheap, bacterially produced nano-compartments. We genetically fused HER2 targeting peptides to the encapsulinsâ€™ surface, and loaded them with photosensitisers, proteins which are able to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon illumination with a specific wavelength of light, to create a double selection targeted drug delivery vehicle. When introduced into the bloodstream, the encapsulins would travel to the tumor site, specifically bind to cancerous HER2 expressing cells, and will begin producing toxic ROS when illuminated - destroying only the cancerous cells.:::2019
