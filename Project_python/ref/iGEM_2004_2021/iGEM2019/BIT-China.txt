BIT-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Achieved Transcription Management (ATM):::Engineering microbial cells to produce fine chemicals is a sustainable and environmental-friendly way. However, low yield from microbial production hinders its industrial application. Resources within microbial cells such as carbon-source from cell medium are utilized both for cell-growth and product-synthesis. Traditional ways to balance cell-growth and product-synthesis involve using inducers to initiate product-synthesis, which is time-consuming and expensive for large-scale production. To allocate resources for increased yield and decreased cell-medium cost, we have developed an intelligent system “Achieved Transcription Management”(ATM), which allocates intracellular transcriptional resources to growth-related genes in early stages of fermentation and switches them to product-related genes after a high cell density is achieved. Under guide of mathematical models, the proper cell density is responded by QS circuit expressing genes σ-factors and T7-RNA-polymerase. Them control transcription of exogenous genes to produce lycopene. ATM system is self-responsive and could replace inducers to lower cost of fermentation and manual inspection.:::2019
