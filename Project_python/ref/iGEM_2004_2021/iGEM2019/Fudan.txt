Fudan:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ALTER:::This year, our team intend to remold E.coli Nissle1917, a kind of commonly used probiotic, to provide a universal platform for intestinal metabolic disease treatment. We introduced 3 important features to improve curative effect in vivo: high competitiveness against intestinal symbiotic as well as harmful bacteria, strong stress resistance against gastric environment, and the ability to control its own flora scale. In our project, we apply our system to solve lactose intolerance, a common disease that affects living quality of 80% Chinese, according to the National Measurement Institute. We show that our platform provides a novel, long lasting solution to this disease. By applying our platform, Nissle1917 can colonize in human gut for longer period of time, while in the meantime express higher level of lactase. This means that the rate of taking bacteria preparations will largely reduce, thus creating a more patient-friendly therapeutic approach to lactose intolerance.:::2019
