UNebraska-Lincoln:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering E. coli to Detect and Neutralize MRSA:::Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant bacteria, making it difficult to treat. Almost 120,000 infections of MRSA occurred in 2017, with about 20,000 deaths. Current treatment often uses atypical antibiotics with uncertain effectiveness. Overuse of antibiotics has led to the problem of antibiotic resistance, which begs the advent of a different therapeutic approach. Incorporating Escherichia coli into our solution, our team sought to create a chassis that can detect, move towards, and kill MRSA. Our detection system utilizes AgrC and AgrA system from S. aureus to detect AIP released from MRSA and activate the P2 promoter. The P2 promoter then initiates motility and the killing mechanism. Movement is controlled by the motility gene, cheZ, which initiates movement towards AIP. Killing is accomplished by genes gakA, gakB, and gakC from Lactococcus garvieae with a secretion signal attached, which produces the bacteriocin garvicin KS for extracellular secretion.:::2019
