SUIS_Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::K.O.I â€“ Koi herpes virus Oral Immunotherapy:::Koi fish (Cyprinus rubrofuscus) are familiar ornamental fish synonymous with Asian culture and possessing huge decorative appeal globally for their many aesthetically pleasing varieties. Similar to other high-density fish farming and breeding operations, these picturesque fish have increased exposure to infectious disease. One particularly disruptive disease is Koi herpes virus disease (KHVD) caused by the highly pathogenic Koi Herpes Virus (KHV) also called cyprinid herpes virus-3. Mass mortality in Koi results from infection. Our project aims to develop an easy to administer vaccine against this virus. Our plan is to engineer live bacterial vaccines that will be administered to fish through the oral route. We will develop and engineer systems that allow bacteria to produce antigens only upon arrival in the iron-deficient environment of the fish gut. While we will also design a system to allow bacteria to present the antigen on the cell surface to illicit the immune response.:::2019
