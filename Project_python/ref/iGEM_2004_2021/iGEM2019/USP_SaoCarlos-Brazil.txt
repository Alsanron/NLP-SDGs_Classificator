USP_SaoCarlos-Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Iara - biofilm formation and metal capture:::Mercury is a heavy metal that causes environmental and health damage when carelessly disposed. Industries and mining companies frequently discard mercury into nature along with its waste. In the past 4 years, Brazil has suffered two disasters associated with mining dams (Mariana-MG and Brumadinho-MG). The metal-contaminated mud released from the dams reached neighboring rivers, causing severe social and health impact on the local population. This project aims to create a mercury collecting water biofilter using genetically engineered Escherichia coli which express five proteins: a chimera, three secretion machinery units and a bacterial biofilm inducer. Furthermore, the biofilm will grow in green coconut fiber, a cheap abundant material that facilitates the removal of bacteria from the environment. This fiber is already used as a filter for other metals, contributing to filtering efficiency. Consequently, besides allowing mercury's removal from water, our project grants the reuse of an abundant brazilian product.:::2019
