XJTLU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::exoCar in the brain:::exoCar is designed to apply mRNA-contained exosomes to alleviate the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases, since the early treatments are limited due to the difficulty in diagnosis of specific clinical subgroups. At the early stage of neurodegenerative disease, the overstimulation-led neuronal injury, or excitatoxicity has an high risk to induce degeneration of neurons. In the extracellular matrix of CNS, the uncontrolled over-high concentration of glutamate, as a primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter, is common in the cases of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, we chose an mRNA which codes the glutamate transporter that generally expressed on the surface of mammals’ glial cells, the Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2 (EAAT2), to be enclosed in exosomes, which are designed to carry the therapeutic “cargo” to pass the BBB. The EAAT2 will be translated in the glial cells, and increase the efficiency of glutamate clearance as a useful method in the early treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.:::2019
