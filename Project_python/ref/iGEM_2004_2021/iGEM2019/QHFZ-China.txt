QHFZ-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Uric Acid Explorer and Terminator:::The incidence of hyperuricemia and gout have been increasing year by year. Many of the patients are suffering from pain, chronic kidney disease and other complications. Therefore, we hopes to build a bacterium that can detect the concentration of uric acid (UA), which is UA explorer, and a cell that can intelligently remove UA, keeping UA concentration at normal level, which is UA terminator. HucR is a transcriptional factor that senses UA. We combined HucR with the amplifier, Rin-p80Î±, so that the bacteria could sense the stimulation of uric acid and send signals to us. We also identified the gene downstream HucR operon as uricase gene smUOX-Flag, which degraded uric acid at high a concentration. So far, our UA explorer can sense to UA, and our UA terminator can break down uric acid. In all, our work offers help for defending such diseases.:::2019
