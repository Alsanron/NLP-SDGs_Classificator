UCopenhagen:::Europe:::Denmark:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Ovulaid - Rethinking Fertility Tracking:::More than 90 million people worldwide are affected by infertility issues. To combat these issues, we present an innovative femtech medical device: Ovulaid - rethinking fertility tracking. Ovulaid is a yeast biosensor in a chewing gum. Our GPCR-based biosensor utilizes the refactored pheromone pathway to measure sex hormones - estradiol and LH - in saliva, producing visible color. This allows women to track their menstrual cycle and determine their fertile window. For easy monitoring we have created an app to interpret color in a photo of the gum. We have consulted multiple experts, involved our target group internationally and integrated concerns regarding safety, yeast viability, and taste into our product. We have confronted the legal and entrepreneurial difficulties our product could face, with great help from the iGEM community. With Ovulaid we hope to spread infertility awareness and help to solve the issues of infertility for women and couples worldwide.:::2019
