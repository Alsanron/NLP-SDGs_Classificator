RIS_BKK:::Asia:::Thailand:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Improving Lives Through Rice: Transmission of Nif genes from Azospirillum to Create Transgenic Rice:::Thailand is an agriculture-based country. However, Thai farmers face economic hardships. The aim is to reduce the input cost by developing transgenic bacteria that will help plants fix nitrogen without the application of chemical fertilizers. We aim to synthesize Agrobacterium that is able to infect plants with inserted Nif genes from Azospirillum brasilense. By using Agrobacteriumâ€™s ability to infect and transfer its DNA, we hope to allow plants to independently fix nitrogen. Nif genes were extracted from Azospirillum brasilense, transferred into E.coli as part of 2 vectors, pGem and pCambia, and put into Agrobacterium. Our design allows for the creation of a product such as biofertilizers or a gel-like-substance mixed with Agrobacterium which should increase the yield of crops. Although we were not able to transform our trangenic Agrobacterium into a product due to time constraints and other limitations we still hope that others will continue this in the future.:::2019
