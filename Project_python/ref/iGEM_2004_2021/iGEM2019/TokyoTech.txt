Many of them can be almost reproduced based on the theory called “Turing Patterns”. Previously, the patterns cannot be formed unless the organism goes through inherent developmental stages. Our team applies the method of synthetic biology and engineers Escherichia coli whose group can produce Turing patterns. A few previous studies did not approach the recreation of natural environment where the presence of physical stimuli has a profound effect on the development of organisms. Thus, we fine-tuned the behavior of bacteria so that temperature and light can play a major role in the formation of pattern. One of the most familiar example of Turing pattern expressed on human body is a fingerprint. Our team also creates a new model that can regenerate a missed part of fingerprint to enhance the value of stochastic pattern formed in wet lab.:::2019
