Orleans:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Metal'OSE Project (Optimized Sludge Engineering):::Our project aim to create a bacterium able to specifically remove heavy metals from sewage sludges and produce ethanol from the cellulose is contains. To do that, we modified the natural heavy metal resistance mechanisms from the bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans strain CH34 to enhance or specify its heavy metal removal ability. Then, we provided it enzymes for alcoholic fermentation, to enable it to produce ethanol from glucose resulting from the prior enzymatic digestion of cellulose. The heavy metal resistance modification consists in an OFR deletion lead by homologous recombination. The alcoholic fermentation enzymes consists in a fusion protein created by a previous team placed under the control of the strong and heavy metal inducible "Pan" promoter from Bacillus Subtilis and is provided to our Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 chassis via a broad range host vector. The final modified strain is tested on sludge samples to demonstrate the application functionality.:::2019
