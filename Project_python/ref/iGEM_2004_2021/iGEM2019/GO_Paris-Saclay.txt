GO_Paris-Saclay:::Europe:::France:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DNA-free POETential:::DNA constitutes the book of life with all the instructions for survival and proliferation. What could happen without it? This question is at the heart of our project. The void in DNA-less cells led us to invite philosophers and haikus to illustrate our thoughts. Controlled expression of phage nucleases cloned in Escherichia coli generated cells without DNA. Could these dying bacteria host biosynthetic activities? Cells producing a nuclease along with methotrexate-degrading enzymes broke down this toxic anticancer drug showing that DNA-free cells could be used for bioremediation. In another attempt to repurpose DNA-free cells, we infected them with an RNA phage and could observe its proliferation, suggesting that our DNA-less cells may have transiently resembled cells that once thrived in the “RNA world”, i.e. cells where the replicating genetic information was carried by RNA instead of DNA. Our work opens interesting avenues in developing new kinds of DNA-free synthetic organisms.:::2019
