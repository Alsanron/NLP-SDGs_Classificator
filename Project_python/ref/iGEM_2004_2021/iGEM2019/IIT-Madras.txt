IIT-Madras:::Asia:::India:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Phyte Club:::Camptothecin is a topoisomerase inhibitor and a potent anti-cancer drug used to treat colon cancer, ovarian cancer, and small cell lung cancer amongst others. Indiaâ€™s primary source of camptothecin is Nothapodytes nimmoniana, a plant endemic to the Western Ghats. N. nimmoniana is now endangered due to overharvesting for medicinal purposes. The fungal endophyte fungal endophyte Fusarium solani can be synthetically modified to produce camptothecin as the camptothecin biosynthesis pathway has been elucidated and F. solani has most components of the pathway except for one - the enzyme strictosidine synthase (STR). This approach of engineering the fungal endophyte with the enzyme STR will reduce the harm caused to native biodiversity.:::2019
