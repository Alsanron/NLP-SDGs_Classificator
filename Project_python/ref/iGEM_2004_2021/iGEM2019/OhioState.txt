OhioState:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Maizotroph: A Synthetic Diazotroph for Supplementing Maize Growth:::The application of nitrogen fertilizers to agricultural crops often causes eutrophication of freshwater sources and environmental damage. Additionally, nitrogen fertilizers are currently produced using the Haber-Bosch process which is very energy intensive and uses large amounts of the worldâ€™s natural gas supply. With a growing population, new methods are needed to improve agricultural sustainability and yields. Some plants form a natural symbiosis with bacteria that can take nitrogen from the atmosphere and provide it to the plant, in a process termed nitrogen fixation. Unfortunately, many agricultural crops lack symbiotic nitrogen fixing partners. A major crop lacking a bacterial partner is maize. We are attempting to take a natural colonizer of corn roots, Pseudomonas protogens, and introduce a 27 kb gene cluster from Rhodopseudomonas palustris that encodes the ability to fix nitrogen. If successful, this organism could reduce the need for industrially fixed nitrogen fertilizers.:::2019
