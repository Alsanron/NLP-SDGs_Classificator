Shenzhen_SFLS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Armour from the sea: A Microbial Manufacturing Band-aid Made of Mgfp-5 and Masp-1:::Mussel Foot proteins, a strong adhesive, water insoluble and flexible protein which is nontoxic and do not impose immunogenicity to the human body, can be used as medical adhesives. Our project focuses on building adhesives with a celebrated protein: mussel foot protein, and make it into a Band-Aid that can seal the wound quickly. In order to achieve those aim, two properties, adhesion and cohesion, become crucial. The MFP is proven by many scientists to have a strong adhesive power. But for achieving cohesive, we elaborate the MFP by fusing natural spider silk protein Masp1 into it. The Masp1 protein, flexible but also adhesive, with its cohesion and strength, will further assist our product in wound sealing. By fusing them, we get the MFP-Masp1 protein and by bio-manufacturing this protein using E. coli. We consider that this could ultimately develop into a new material in daily medications.:::2019
