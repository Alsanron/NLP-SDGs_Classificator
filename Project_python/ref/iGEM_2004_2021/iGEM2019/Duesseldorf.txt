Duesseldorf:::Europe:::Germany:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SynMylk - an eco-friendly synthetic cow’s milk to save the environment:::Our project is the production of the natural components of cow’s milk using methods from synthetic biology to modify microorganisms. This solution can provide the world with milk without risking the environmental damage caused by massive animal farms, while providing an authentic alternative. This lactose-free milk will be available to a larger number of people around the world. The first step to creating our SynMylk is the production of the components of cow’s milk that the chemical industry cannot provide without using animal products. These components are the milk’s proteins and lipids. We modified Bacillus subtilis, Pichia pastoris and the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to produce the milk proteins heterologously. The synthesis of lipids is enhanced by overexpressing enzymes that are bottlenecks in Synechocystis’ natural fatty acid production. Heterologous enzymes are also expressed to specifically obtain certain lengths of lipids, which are not naturally produced.:::2019
