Peking:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Dr. Control: A dCas9-based DNA replication control system:::Many challenges impeding genetically engineered bacteria from benefiting us can be attributed to the growth rate (e.g. infections in microbial therapies) and can be solved if we can better control over it. However, previous methods for growth rate control has many disadvantages: limited application scenarios, cell function disorders, etc. Here, we developed a novel system for precise growth rate control, by using dCas9 to target the DNA replication origin. Such system is highly tunable with multiple inputs, large dynamic range and non-detectable leakage. It functions in a gentle and reversible way without harming cell activities. Furthermore, we explored the potential of replication control in synthetic biology, including control of plasmid copy number and gene expression variation. Finally, we tried to design a safe therapeutic E. coli with high targeting specificity and controllable treatment intensity, promising to reduce the infection risk, which shows the broad application prospects of our system.:::2019
