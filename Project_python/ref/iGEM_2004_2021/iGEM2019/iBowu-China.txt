iBowu-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Biocontrol of Soft Rot:::Potatoes are the fourth largest crops in the world. Soft rot is one of the main plant diseases for the decrease of potato production. Pectobacterium carotovorum (Erwinia carotovorum) is a main plant pathogen causing soft rot of potatoes as well as many other crops. We plan to develop an easily-used toolkit based on cell-free system which can detect and prevent the occurrence of soft rot. Two kinds of gene circuits are designed for the detection and prevention. One is to detect AHL (quorum sensing signal molecular) of P. carotovorum; the other is to express the hydrolase AiiA and the antibacterial peptides which could degrade AHL and generally kill bacteria separately. The gene circuits coupling with cell-free expression system are lyophilized on paper and can be used with rehydration.:::2019
