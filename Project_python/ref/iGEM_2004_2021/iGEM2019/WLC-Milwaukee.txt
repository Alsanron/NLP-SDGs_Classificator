WLC-Milwaukee:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Lead Scentsor:::As seen in Flint, Michigan, water supplies can be contaminated by aging infrastructure. Our team is based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin which also has a lead problem. Our team is developing a method to identify lead in water through our sense of smell. By putting the gene for an enzyme that produces the wintergreen scent under the control of a lead-inducible promoter and placing this construct in E. coli, we have created an engineered organism that will detect lead by providing a scent. By putting this engineered E. coli in a capsule which will dissolve in water, any individual can collect a water sample and use this test. The E. coli is safe and this kit is environmentally friendly due to the lack of any plastic parts. This will allow people to test any sample of water they suspect is contaminated by lead and seek an appropriate remedy.:::2019
