Marburg:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Green Revolution - Establishing the fastest growing photothrophic organism as a chassis for synthetic biology:::While most iGEM teams were working with conventional chassis like E. coli and S. cerevisiae, phototrophic organisms were always underrepresented. To make it more feasible for other teams to work with phototrophic organisms, a fast growing and easy to handle chassis is necessary. For this purpose we establish Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 with a reported doubling time of 90min - as a viable chassis by developing strains tailored to various applications. Therefore, we restore its natural competence, establish the CRISPR/Cpf1 system for multiplexed genome engineering and enable the utilization of plasmids as a tool for rapid design testing. Furthermore, we expand last yearsâ€™ Golden Gate based MoClo toolbox, and accelerate the complete cloning workflow by automating plating, colony picking and plasmid purification on the Opentrons OT-2. By providing our fast phototrophic chassis to the community, we would like to pave the way for other phototrophic organisms in synthetic biology.:::2019
