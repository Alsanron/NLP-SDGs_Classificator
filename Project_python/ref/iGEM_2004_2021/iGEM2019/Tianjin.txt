Tianjin:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Evolutionary Fusion:::Since the Darwin era, the formation, accumulation and even retention of differences between species and species has not only been a core issue in evolutionary biology, but also one of the fundamental problems facing the entire life sciences. Cell fusion, as an effective way to exchange genetic material among distant species, is of great significance for the study of species evolution. The goal of iGEM Tianjin this year is to integrate a new chassis organism that contains a set of heterogeneous chromosome stabilization elements. To this end, we have combined Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytic yeast to establish a key component of the chromosome by centromere, and at the same time created a new system based on sequential single-base editing technology to characterize the fusion results.:::2019
