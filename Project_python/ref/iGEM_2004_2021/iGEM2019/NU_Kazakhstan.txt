NU_Kazakhstan:::Asia:::Kazakhstan:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Circular BioEconomy: How Toxic Waste is converted into Nano-electrocatalysts and Fuel:::Our project is focused on production of Hydrogen gas using transformed cyanobacteria Synechococcus Elongatus PCC 7942. We introduce 3 genes: HydA, HydG and HydEF. HydA is [Fe-Fe] Hydrogenase and other two proteins are maturation proteins. To improve production of hydrogen our team came up with several modification. First is to indroduce bacterial Rhodopsin that will pump protons to the site where peripheral HydA resides. Furthermore favorably fluorescent Carbon Quantum Dots can be added to redirect energy of light to rhodopsin thus increasing its pumping rate. Previously introduced SQR also can be used in this case to substitute for inactivated bu sulfide wastewater PSII providing protons and electrons from sulfide. Ultimately all biomass will be converted into graphitic catalytic material that can be use as substitute for platinum catalyst in PEM.:::2019
