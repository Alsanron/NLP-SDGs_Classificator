Jilin_China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Guardian of rose: New Therapy for Vulvovaginal Candidiasis:::Vulvovaginal candidiasis is an infection primarily caused by Candida albicans that affects millions of women. Patients usually responds rapidly to antifungal azole therapy. However, continuous emergence of relapses and drug-resistant cases is reported. Developing effective approach to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce drug resistance is urgently needed. In our project, a non-antibiotic and novel strategy with the function of sensing, inhibition and killing C. albicans is generated to improve the therapeutic effectiveness. Sensing system is capable of detecting the signal molecule secreted by C. albicans and initiating the downstream genes. Once triggered, the four individual downstream genes come into therapeutic effect: inhibition of the hypha phase by BDSF, degradation of the hyphae through Msp1, degradation of the biofilm by β-1,3-glucanase, and killing C. albicans with the antibacterial peptide LL37. In addition, the suicide system is added for safety reasons，which could trigger suicide in the absence of C. albicans.:::2019
