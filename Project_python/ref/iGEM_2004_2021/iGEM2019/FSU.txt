FSU:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::FLOEMA: Rapid Prototyping of Antimicrobial Peptide Cocktails to Save Florida's Citrus:::Citrus greening is an infectious disease of citrus trees caused by Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. The bacteria is found in the phloem of infected trees. The Asian citrus psyllid, a small insect, carries the bacteria in its salivary glands from infected trees to other trees. Citrus Greening causes premature fruit drop and shortens the lifespan of trees which has lowered the production of citrus fruits in Florida by 30 to 80% in the last 20 years. Our solution to Citrus Greening is to inject infected trees with a combination of three antimicrobial peptides. We designed genetic devices that can express antimicrobial peptides in New England Biolabs' PURExpress in vitro protein synthesis kit. We combined the synthesized peptides and demonstrated the inhibition of growth of E. coli and L. crescens which are model organisms for the target species. FLOEMA is a rapid prototyping platform in the epic race to save Floridaâ€™s citrus.:::2019
