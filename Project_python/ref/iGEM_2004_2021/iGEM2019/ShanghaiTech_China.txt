Its existing treatments, including insulin/GLP-1 injections and other drugs, are inconvenient and expensive. N-acyl amides are a family of small molecules secreted by resident enterobacteria to relieve T2D. Thus, ShanghaiTech_China team aims to engineer a smart enterobacteria system that can be fed in glucose values to control the production of N-acyl amides for diabetic alleviation. Using E. coli as a demo, we cloned the synthase for N-palmitoyl serinol, the most potent group in N-acyl amides, into the E. coli expressing plasmid under a light-controllable promoter. Then, we designed a software and LED device that can accept glucose signals from T2D patients to control the synthase expression, which leads to the production of the therapeutic molecule. Together, with INSULEN, we offered a convenient, cheap and smart way to battle against T2D and proved it in principle.:::2019
