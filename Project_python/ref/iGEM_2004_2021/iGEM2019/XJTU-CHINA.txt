XJTU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacterial Fragrance Generator:::Nowadays an increasing number of people worldwide are suffering various sleep-related problems. The linalool and limonene, which exhibit pleasant aromas, have excellent performance on solving them. Our project focuses on the selective production of linalool and limonene, by construction, verification and modeling of the precursor generation system and light control system respectively. Firstly, glucose was converted to the shared precursor of these two molecules by a precursor-producing plasmid. Secondly, the thermosensitive protein CI and red-light-controlled switching elements in the fragrance-producing plasmid enabled the conversion of the precursor to limonene and linalool alternatively, leading to the synthesis of linalool at night for a sound sleep, while the synthesis of limonene in the morning to remove sleepy mind. Additionally, a primary hardware has been built to realize our design with the prevention the bacterial leakage and nutrients supplementation, coupled with another software for device control.:::2019
