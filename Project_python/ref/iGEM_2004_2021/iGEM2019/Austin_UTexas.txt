Austin_UTexas:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Measuring the burden of synthetic constructs in the iGEM Registry:::When a construct is added to a cell, resources are allocated towards expression of the construct. This creates additional cellular burden, making engineered bacterial populations less fit than the wild type. Over time, cells accumulate loss-of-function mutations within the construct, freeing cellular resources. These mutations increase cell fitness, prompting the mutation to sweep through the population. Therefore, the population cannot maintain the burden associated with the construct for a sustained number of generations. Our goal is to measure the growth rates of genetically modified cells to identify burdensome parts. We used the Ellis Lab’s “burden monitor” for E. coli to measure the burden of BioBricks from the iGEM Registry (Ceroni 2015). We transformed 500+ BioBricks into “burden monitor” DH10B E. coli and assayed growth rate versus GFP expression rate. We identified burdensome parts by analyzing measurements with a pipeline of scripts, determining growth rate reduction percentages against GFP expression rates.:::2019
