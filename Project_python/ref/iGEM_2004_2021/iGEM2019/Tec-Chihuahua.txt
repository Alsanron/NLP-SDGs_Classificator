Tec-Chihuahua:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Recombinant production of plant defense peptides to inhibit Verticillium wilt in cotton crops:::Verticillium dahliae is a phytopathogenic fungus that affects more than 300 species worldwide. It attacks plant’s vascular system causing wilting, also reduces the product’s quality affecting overall crop production. Every year, around 150,000 tons of cotton have been lost per year due to this particular organism. To prevent and inhibit the disease caused by V. dahliae, the transformation of E. coli to produce the three following plant antifungal peptides recombinantly, is presented: AtPFN1 has shown the ability to break down fungal cell walls, even when found as spores; WAMP1B inhibits the enzyme fungalysin, which is a fungal response to the plant’s defense mechanism; Finally, PsDef1 produces morphological changes to fungal mycelium. Moreover, the coexpression of the peptides with chaperone molecule Erv1p is designed to improve disulfide bond formation. Additionally, the elaboration of a systemic, preventive and treating biofungicide using the produced recombinant antifungal peptides as an active ingredient, is proposed.:::2019
