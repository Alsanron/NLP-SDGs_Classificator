Shanghai_HS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Cyanobarrier: Solve the harm caused by cyanobacteria:::Every summer, the outbreak of cyanobacteria puzzles numerous countries in the world. It causes insufficiency of oxygen in the waters, and the release of a poisonous substance called microcystin, which, even in small amount, causes serious diseases like liver cancer. However, the current method of removing microcystin is still inefficient or produces secondary pollution. Here we utilize enzyme MlrA, which is able to degrade microcystin, to solve the pollution. The mlrA genes from several different speices are expressed in E. coli and purified. The results show the microcystin is degraded with mlrA by HPLC (High Performed Liquid Chromatography). Furthermore, we try to design a device which is commercially mass produced and can be utilized by the waterworks or even at home. We anticipate our solution to aid in protecting the environment and avoiding people from getting sick because of drinking contaminated water.:::2019
