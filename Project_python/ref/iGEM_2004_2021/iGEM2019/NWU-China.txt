NWU-China:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bio-HPkuM (Bio-Household phenylketonuria monitor):::Clinicians require a simple quantitative method for the detection of both phenylalanine and tyrosine to facilitate the diagnosis of phenylketonuria, a common inherited disorder of amino acid metabolism.In our project, we designed a biosensor with RFP&GFP as a reporter gene to semi-quantitatively determine the amount of Phe&Tyr. But RFP&GFP require specific instruments to measure, so we use blue pigment protein (amilcp) and yellow pigment protein (fwyellow). By mixing the two proteins in different proportions and then using a computer for analysis, a simple color chart is created as a new reporting system.:::2019
