Penn:::North America:::United States:::Open:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MIYAGI: An open-source wax printing conversion kit:::Wax printing is used to fabricate microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (ÂµPADs), which have emerged as promising platforms for developing low-cost diagnostic devices in resource-limited settings. Before such point-of-care devices can be made available for wide-spread use, foundational research is needed to build and test their efficacy. To make wax printing more accessible to educational and research laboratories, the Penn 2019 iGEM team designed, constructed, and validated an open-source wax printing conversion kit for widely used open-source Prusa 3D-printers. The device replaces the existing extruder with a custom-designed, heated, and pneumatically actuated wax extrusion system. G-code transformed from user CAD files (in the PrusaSlicer software) is then converted by a Python script into the necessary commands required by the MIYAGI device.:::2019
