CSU_Fort_Collins:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Sense and Destroy:::One of the most pressing matters facing the medical community is the growing dilemma of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Due to their overuse, we have created bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, and more recently, cases of bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics, so called “superbugs”, such as Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA). They pose an enormous risk to human health in the coming decades. We focused on utilizing the quorum sensing system of S. aureus to build a sensitivity switch, dependent on the concentration of the autoinducing peptide (AIP) that it uses to detect its population density and become virulent and break away from the biofilm. Our system will hijack the system and trigger production of lysostaphin that will specifically target S. aureus and act as a kill mechanism. This system will be able to safely treat S. aureus and avoid perpetuating the problem of creating new resistant species.:::2019
