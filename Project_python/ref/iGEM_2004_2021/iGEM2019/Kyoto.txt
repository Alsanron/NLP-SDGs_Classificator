Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::myClothes' Plastic -Solving water contamination One wash at a time!-:::Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic accumulating in the environment, and harmful to ecosystems. They are produced in many ways, including washing-clothes processes. Microfibers from clothes are released into wastewater and eventually flows into the ocean without being processed. Our project aims to capture microfibers from household washing machines. To achieve this, we used encapsulins - protein-made spherical nanostructures - which can be engineered to display other proteins on their surface. We designed encapsulins which display proteins binds to plastic and microorganisms found in wastewater treatment plants. We picked up some proteins as plastic-binding proteins, and compared them with each other. In our strategy, microfibers may then be bound to microorganisms through engineered encapsulins and settled in sedimentation basins. This therefore avoids the introduction of GMOs into wastewater treatment processes. Combined with plastic-digesting enzymes, we believe our approach represents an effective way to deal with a common source of microplastics.:::2019
