Sydney_Australia:::Asia:::Australia:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Magi.Coli: Taking the Magic from Mushroom to Microbe:::One in four people will experience an episode of mental illness at some point in their life, and the required support services make up a significant portion of healthcare expenditure worldwide. Psilocybin, found naturally in 'magic mushrooms' (Psilocybe spp.), has shown great promise in clinical trials for the treatment of mental illnesses including treatment resistant depression and end of life anxiety. At present, psilocybin is produced via an expensive chemical synthesis process, which limits its availability for research. This project aims to clone the psilocybin biosynthesis pathway genes (psiH, psiD, psiK, psiM) into Escherichia coli, to provide a cheaper and more reliable source of this compound. Previous work has shown that the fungal enzymes PsiD, PsiK, and PsiM are functional when expressed in bacteria, but PsiH is thus far untested. We will use codon harmonisation and N-terminal modification methods to optimise PsiH expression, in order to complete the biosynthetic pathway.:::2019
