RHIT:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cobold Hunters: Bioremediation of cobalt and arsenic in contaminated soil and water:::Heavy metals, such as arsenic and cobalt, are a continued concern in industrial facilities and agricultural areas. The goal of this project was to find a cost-effective, biological means of remediating these heavy metals to meet EPA standards. To this end, a two plasmid system has been implemented in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells, involving metallothionein (MT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes. Metallothioneins work to bind and effectively inactivate the heavy metals, while SOD genes have been implemented to decrease the sensitivity of the cells to the effects of heavy metal poisoning by reactive oxygen species, thereby extending the life cycle of the engineered bacteria.:::2019
