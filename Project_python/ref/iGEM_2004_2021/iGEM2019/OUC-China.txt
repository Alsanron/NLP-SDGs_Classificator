OUC-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RiboLegoâ€”A Rational Approach to Engineer Modular and Tunable Riboswitch:::Riboswitches can sense a wide range of small molecules and regulate gene expression. However, because of the diversity of downstream GOI, the structures of the riboswitch are often unstable. So riboswitch cannot be considered as modular components. This year, OUC-China aims to design modular riboswitch consisting of original riboswitch, stabilizer, and tuner from 5' to 3'. The stabilizer can stabilize the structure of the riboswitch. The tuner can reduce the expression probability of fusion protein and allow for predictable tuning. Then more tuners are designed to make diverse expression level. Finally, we use asRNA to change the on-off state of riboswitches. All in all, we create modular riboswitch and introduce asRNA so that gene expression in engineered systems can be more easily regulated. Depending on this design principle, we'll create more "RiboLego".:::2019
