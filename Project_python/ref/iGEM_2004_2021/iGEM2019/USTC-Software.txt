USTC-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Foresyn: Making Reliable Customized Flux Analysis With Ease:::The FBA and its further study have been proved useful to make inference about the change of metabolite flux given the objective function so that the factory and laboratory can make targeted improvements to their experiment to increase productivity. There already exist some tools to do FBA, but all with shortcomings: they can't show an intuitionistic graph of the dominant metabolite in the pathway related to the object, they can't compare the modified model with the original one and they can't share with others as well. Foresyn is a user-friendly platform that solved the issues. The neoteric workflow management based on customized database allows users to build their models for flux analysis, get visualized output and easily share with others.:::2019
