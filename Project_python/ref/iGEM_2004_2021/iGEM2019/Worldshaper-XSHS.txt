Worldshaper-XSHS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Biological degradation system of Azo chemicals:::Printing and dyeing industry is one of the most important industries of our hometown, Hangzhou. However, the producing wastewater containing Azo dyes has become one of the major sources of pollution, which is not only destructive to local ecosystem but also toxic and harmful to human health. In this project, we aim to construct engineered E. coli-based system to treat wastewater containing Azo dyes. Two azoreductases (Azr, AzoR) and two laccases (CotA and ScLac) were transformed into E. coli for decolorization and detoxification of azo dyes specifically. Our results show that the laccases have very good performance in decolorization of Reactive Red. Thus, the laccase might be a promising candidate for the biological treatment of industrial dye wastewaters. We hope that through our efforts, we can provide a convenient, practical, clean and economical method to degrade azo dyes and improve the water quality environment of our hometown.:::2019
