Auburn_Alabama:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Characterization of the rcn promoter for nickel sensitivity:::The presence of nickel in cheap jewelry can often lead to allergic contact dermatitis, involving redness, dry patches of skin, and even blisters. Furthermore, nickel is prevalent in everyday items, such as eyeglass frames, coins, or zippers. With nickel being so common, a proper nickel detection method is important for those with nickel allergies. To address such issues, we will engineer and characterize E. coli for nickel sensitivity using the rcn promoter. The 2011 Lyon Biosciences team previously used this part in a cobalt detecting project, and they noted its nickel detecting ability. However, the nickel aspect of the part has not been characterized in the iGEM competition. Therefore, we hope to contribute meaningful characterization data for the rcn promoter while engineering nickel sensitive E. coli.:::2019
