The 2019 University of Exeter iGEM team is developing a microplastic filter which captures and degrades PET microplastic fibres released from household washing machines, using bioengineered PETase and MHETase enzymes. The PETexe filter will be either attached externally or housed within washing machines, preventing the fibres from entering our water systems and oceans. The fibres will be broken down by these enzymes and release two environmentally benign byproducts terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethelyne glycol (EG). The final filtration system will include an enzyme delivery mechanism to release a concentrated enzyme solution onto the microplastic fibres to break them down before washing the byproducts away prior to the next washing cycle.:::2019
