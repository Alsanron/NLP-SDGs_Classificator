Humboldt_Berlin:::Europe:::Germany:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Chlamylicious - Establishing Chlamy at iGEM while degrading plastic:::Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular algae with promising prospects for synthetic biology. Its ability to grow photoautotrophically makes it an ideal chassis to tackle a variety of problems in an environmentally friendly way. Our goal is to adress the worldwide problem of plastic pollution by creating a catalogue of genetic parts for C. reinhardtii that can enable the algae to degrade PET plastic. By combining different functional genetic parts we plan to address the problem from multiple perspectives. To do so, we are designing and building a reproducible low-budget cultivation setup which will aid us and others in the process of collecting data of algal growth under the influence of transgenic constructs and other parameters. Our overall goal is to try and show the possibility for using C. reinhardtii as a versatile tool for dealing with a complex problem such as plastic pollution from different perspectives.:::2019
