Westminster_UK:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Withdrawn:::Operation Exo-electrogen:::For more than a century, burning fossil fuels has generated most of the energy required to propel our cars, power our businesses, and keep the lights on in our homes. Even today, highly polluting forms of energy such as oil, coal and gas provide for about 80% of our energy needs. In order to reduce our dependence on these unsustainable forms of energy, our project focused on improving the efficiency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) - battery-like devices that utilise energy from exo-electrogenic bacteria. We did this by making contributions to the research of the Mtr pathway of the exo-electrogenic bacterium Shewanella oneidensis, while attempting to improve its performance by variably expressing the pathway components inside the bacterium and adjusting its functioning in aerobic environments. We also did modeling and laboratory research in collaborations on further applications of MFCs involving the breakdown of the highly prominent plastic polymer, PET.:::2019
