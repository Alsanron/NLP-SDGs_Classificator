SUSTech_Shenzhen:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::C-hoop:::Accurate manipulation of mammalian cells' behavior remains challenging, because mammalian cell processes a complex multi-level network of gene expression regulation and protein transportation. To better understand this network and actualize precise manipulation, we raised three essentials as a "controlling hoop" on the mammalian cells. First is to effectively switch the input and to visualize the output of the whole regulation network, thus we transfected into HeLa cell a light-switchable transcriptional factor "LightOn" (2012, X.Wang et al) to control cytokine gene expression (input) in and we applied a microfluidics chip to directly observe the cell migration triggered by the cytokine expression (output). Second is to prevent the cell-cell variation during the experiment, hence we designed a automatic illumination and sample collection system to standardize the various factors in experimental conditions. Third, we calibrated mathematical models from experimental data to design input sequences for achieving desired dynamic range of protein expression.:::2019
