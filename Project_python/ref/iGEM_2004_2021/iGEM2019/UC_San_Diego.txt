UC_San_Diego:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ALAIVE (ALzheimer’s AI VErifier):::Despite the billions of dollars spent researching Alzheimer’s disease (AD), it remains incurable and affects around 35 million people worldwide. Early diagnosis of AD is critical for proper disease management and accelerating AD research. Our team proposes the development of a panel of antibodies to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease years before its onset by detecting immunologic changes in peripheral blood. We will construct an in vitro model of AD by exposing microglia cells co-cultured with beta amyloid to T-cells. Using a phage display library of random sequences, we will obtain phage binding profiles for these T-cells. This profile will be processed using an algorithm based on amino acid structural similarity clustering to identify antibody sequences that can distinguish between normal T-cells and T-cells exposed to Alzheimer’s neurons. Deep learning segmentation and antibody epitope prediction will then be used to identify the most probable proteins and pathways that these antibody sequences target.:::2019
