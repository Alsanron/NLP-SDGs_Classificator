SEU-Nanjing-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Algae Terminator:::Under the background of global warming and ocean acidification, large scale of Cyanobacteria bloom forming is unavoidable and become a serious global environment problem. Recently, we have found that the unique intracellular digestion mechanism of the Branchiostoma can degrade algae into nutrients such as amino acids and polysaccharides with effectively degradation of harmful substances such as algal toxins. This discovery provides a new perspective and insipration for exploring algae resources. Methods of bioinformatics are applied to further analyze the proteome of Branchiostoma and to screen specific proteins. We will transduct the screened genes into E-coli and design an efficient expression pathway to realize scale processing of algae mud. Gradient experiments will be conducted to explore the optimum reaction ratio and reaction conditions. Furthermore, we will explore its possibility to turn into raw material for animal feed to help fight global hunger. Use earth wisdom, solve earth problem. We are moving!:::2019
