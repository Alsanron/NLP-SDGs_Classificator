BNDS_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::A Dream of Red Lacquer:::Lacquer and carmine (a red dye) play important roles in the preservation and production of traditional Chinese lacquerware. Currently, however, attaining raw lacquer requires complicated, harmful manual extraction from Rhus verniciflua (lacquer tree), and the production efficiency of carmine from cochineals is low. We utilize E. coli to synthesize laccase and todC1C2ABD, four enzymes that can convert hexadecylbenzene to urushiol, the other functional component of raw lacquer aside from laccase; in S. cerevisiae, we aim to produce carminic acid, the major red component of carmine. The laccase, urushiol, and carminic acid are mixed with several cost-effective ingredients, resulting in an artificial red-colored lacquer that can be easily applied in industrial and domestic contexts. This synthetic biological method avoids the potential danger due to unknown natural components and expands the potential of inheriting and further developing lacquerware culture.:::2019
