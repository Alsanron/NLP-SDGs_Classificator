Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biological Events (SCRIBE) uses a reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce single stranded DNA which can be incorporated into the host-genome during DNA replication using the Lambda-Red system which results in a mutation within the bacterial chromosome. This SCRIBE system can be applied to a large population of cells in order to measure the amount of a stimulus by sequencing DNA to quantify the number of times the mutations occur in relation to the entire population. The UF iGEM team seeks to couple the SCRIBE system with the DNA nuclease activity of the Cas9 protein to cut and kill the chromosome of the bacteria with wild type DNA, thereby killing the cells without mutations.:::2019
