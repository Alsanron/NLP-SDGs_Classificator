UAlberta:::North America:::Canada:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Beetector: Developing a bacteriophage-based diagnostic system for a fatal honeybee parasite:::Honeybees are an essential contributor to our food supply. In addition to producing honey, bees pollinate one-third of all plants and plant products we eat. Nosema ceranae is a debilitating fungal parasite that is the most widespread honeybee pathogen in Canada. In addition to the difficulties in treating Nosema ceranae infections⁠—a problem that Team UAlberta tackled last year⁠—current detection methods are slow and costly, and infected hives are often diagnosed too late for effective treatment. Team UAlberta is working to change that by developing The Beetector, a field-ready paper-based test for the detection of Nosema ceranae in bee samples. The system is comprised of M13 phage labelled with a chromoprotein and displaying a ligand specific to Nosema spores. Based on the colour intensity of the diagnostic paper strip, the severity of the hive infection can be assessed, thus democratizing diagnosis and facilitating effective treatment of Nosema ceranae.:::2019
