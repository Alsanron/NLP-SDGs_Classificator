ULaVerne_Collab:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A New Addition to the Insulin Vision:::Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by high glucose levels over a prolonged period of time. It affects approximately 371 million people worldwide (WHO, 2014). Current treatments include injections and pumps, but insulin production cost has been ever-increasing due to monopoly companies. The Open Insulin Project's goal is to manufacture cheap insulin and analogues and making the protocol public. We are contributing by synthesizing human proinsulin and 3 novel single chain insulins(SCI) that replace the C-peptide with different novel linkers. Our first SCI contains the native A&B chains (pI 5.50). The second SCI is a long-lasting insulin, with an AsnA21Ala mutation (pI 6.46). The third insulin is a fast-acting insulin, with the LysB28 and ProB29 flipped (pI 5.50). Our goal is to secrete these insulins from the periplasmic membrane of E. coli BL21, purify using nickel purification and TEV protease, and characterize using the Elisa and glucose uptake assay.:::2019
