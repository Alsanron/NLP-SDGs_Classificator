Vilnius-Lithuania:::Europe:::Lithuania:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Colight: Novel Optogenetic Tools For Modular Bacterial Control:::Synthetic biology aims to design cellular functions rationally. This goal often requires a signal input and for that chemical inducers are mostly used. However, chemical effectors are not optimal as they might cross-react with other pathways, be toxic, work with a delay, and are usually irreversible. In contrast, light-inducible systems are minimally invasive; also, the signal is delivered quickly and in high resolution. These features open new possibilities in research on how protein expression dynamics affect the operation of a synthetic circuit. To realize the potential of optogenetics in bacteria, we have created a three-level light-controlled system for dynamic bacterial control. It includes (1) a repressor based tool for tight transcriptional control, (2) a way to control steady-state protein levels by light-activated degradation, (3) a framework to maintain different plasmid copy numbers in bacterial growth and production stages. Thus Colight provides an innovative approach for real-time bacterial control.:::2019
