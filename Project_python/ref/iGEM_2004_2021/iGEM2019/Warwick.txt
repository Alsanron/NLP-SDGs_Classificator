Warwick:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Infatuation:::As the poet Thomas Gray once said, “ignorance is bliss”. In this case, ignorance has created a problem. A big problem. Fatbergs. These large congealed masses made of fat, oil, grease and non-biodegradable materials like wet wipes are beginning to wreck infrastructural havoc, causing thousands of sewer blockages, which the UK government spend millions clearing each year. We - the Warwick iGEM team - have begun to work towards a biological solution to this growing problem. Outside of the lab, our team have educated the public about the consequences of their everyday actions and have considered the ethical issues and legislation surrounding our research. Additionally, we’ve collaborated with various institutions; obtaining a fatberg sample from United Utilities in Liverpool and fatberg DNA from Aberystwyth University. We aim to characterise candidate lipases for the breakdown of these greasy nightmares, with the hope of keeping our sewers and our lives flowing smoothly.:::2019
