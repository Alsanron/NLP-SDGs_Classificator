It is heterogeneous, consists of a variety of phenolic groups and is highly branched. Every year the paper industry accumulates approximately 50 Mt of lignin as a waste product, which is immediately combusted. Studies have shown that the potential degradation products and monomers of lignin can be used as building blocks for further applications. This project aims to generate a multi-enzyme system, based on characteristics of wood-decaying fungi, to efficiently process lignin into high-value chemicals. To achieve this, Pichia pastoris is engineered to express horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO). HRP degrades lignin under consumption of hydrogen peroxide. AAO, in turn, utilises parts of the degradation products to create more hydrogen peroxide, forming a self-sustaining system. Both enzymes are fused with a secretion tag to create a continuous cell factory, where the supernatant contains the desired enzyme mixture.:::2019
