Edinburgh_UG:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Enhancing hydrogen production in Rhodobacter sphaeroides for use as an economically viable biofuel:::The energy supply sector is the largest contributor to CO2 emissions. With the UK's target of net zero emissions by 2050, this industry will have to reduce it's dependance on natural gas. Hydrogen is an alternative, however current methods of renewable production render it economically unfeasible. We've sought to make hydrogen a green yet cost effective solution. We've created a novel biological chassis that exploits both fermentative and photosynthetic pathways for biohydrogen gas production. By genetically engineering hydrogenases from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Pyrococcus furiosus into Rhodobacter spheroids, in order to direct more reducing power towards hydrogen synthesis. Our idea to improve photo-fermentative pathways came after researching drawbacks of co-culture experiments. We have also designed 'Hydrolytes', devices to allow our bacteria to grow and collect the hydrogen produced. While also running of waste resources, our project has specifically centered on off-the-grid coal-dependant locations worst effected by Fuel Poverty in Scotland.:::2019
