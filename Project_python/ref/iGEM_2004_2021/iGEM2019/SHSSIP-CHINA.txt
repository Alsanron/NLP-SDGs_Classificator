We are going to characterize the trehalose synthase (TSase)  in the Bifidobacterium ï¼Œwhich is widely used in the yogurt  and the Lactic acid bacteria drink. TSaes can convert maltose into the trehalose inside the Bifidobacterium ,  and the trehalose can protect the bifidobacterium by enhancing its resistance  to the freezing and dryness during the freeze dried process while fermentation. Furthermore, the inside trehalose can also extend the guarantee period and improve positive effects of the Probiotic drinks by enhancing the vitality of probiotcs.:::2019
