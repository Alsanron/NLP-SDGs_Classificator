Since conventional methods are more and more difficult to deal with this disease, we put forward a new therapeutic strategy for treating Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (Mtb) infection based on Immune-like cells. In our project, Toll like receptor (TLR) 1/2 and CD14 molecules were expressed on the surface of HEK 293 cells to recognize specific antigens of Mtb. Then, stimulation of TLRs lead to the activation of downstream NF-κB signaling pathway. The NF-κB induced promoters were designed to express granulysin and microRNA hsa-let-7f to respectively eliminate Mtb in blood circulation and macrophages. In order to deliver microRNA into Mtb-infected macrophages, modified cells secrete targeted exosomes containing microRNA after being stimulated with Mtb. In the future, by replacing TLRs and downstream effectors, our "immune-like cells" could target different pathogens, thereby serving as a novel infectious disease treatment strategy in post-antibiotic era.:::2019
