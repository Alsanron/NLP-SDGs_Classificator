TU_Eindhoven:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::dCastect: Fast detection of bacterial pathogens with the use of specific bacteriophages and dCas9-NanoLuc:::The discovery of new antibiotics lags behind the continuing increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a process heavily accelerated by the misuse of antibiotics. Antibiotics are misused in a preventive manner (mainly cattle), misused to treat non-bacterial-related ailments and misused by unspecific treatment of bacterial infections. With our fast and specific diagnostic method for bacterial infections, this will become a problem of the past. Our modular method uses the specificity and amplification speed of bacteriophages in combination with the specificity and sensitivity of the dCas9-NanoLuc-complex to revolutionize the diagnosis of bacterial infections. Our method enables the diagnosis of infections within an hour, making fast and specific use of antibiotics possible. Moreover, the application of this method is broad; from fast specific diagnosis of infections, both in human as well as in veterinary medicine, to going beyond the diagnosis of infections by detecting bacteria in drinking water or in the food industry.:::2019
