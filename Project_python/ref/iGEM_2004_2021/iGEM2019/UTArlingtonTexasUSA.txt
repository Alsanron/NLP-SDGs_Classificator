UTArlingtonTexasUSA:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Investigating the Biosensing Capabilities of Microbial Fuel Cells:::Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are electrochemical systems that rely on the reduction potential of organic matter by respiring microorganisms to produce electricity. Our research group was inspired by the 2007 Glasgow teamâ€™s use of the pyocyanin mediator and Xylr protein to detect BTEX pollutants (xylene, toluene and benzene) with an E- coli based MFC. The reduction-oxidation of pyocyanin can be harnessed by the cells to deposit electrons; If the cells were to respond to a pollutant by producing pyocyanin, we can observe the change in current as an indication of the presence of the pollutant. Our team aims to investigate this sensing system by making the bacteria produce fluorescent proteins in response to the presence of these pollutants. Utilizing change in fluorescence to correlate concentrations. This project will expand the tests done by the Glasgow team to continuously monitor if the mediator and sensor producing genes have retained their function.:::2019
