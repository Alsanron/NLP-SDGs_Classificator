Stuttgart:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PhyCoVi â€“ Phycotrophic Codonoptimized Vibrio:::Public interest in sustainable and eco-friendly processes is as high as never before. Given the growing scientific and industrial interest in Vibrio natriegens, we aim to establish V. natriegens as an alternative protein production organism to E. coli while also creating a sustainable, eco-friendly substrate based on microalgae. Our in-silico simulations revealed tRNA availability as a bottleneck in mRNA translation. Our goal was to enhance the applicability of V. natriegens by improving protein expression through increased tRNA availability. To establish a change towards sustainable cultivation of microorganisms, we used CO2 fixing phototrophic microalgae as a base for a climate-friendly substrate. In order to produce an algae-substrate, we cultivated Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella sorokiniana in a self-built bioreactor. The produced biomass was disrupted, the nutrients were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively and used for cultivation. Using optimized V. natriegens coupled with our climate-friendly substrate we aim to shape the future of biotechnology.:::2019
