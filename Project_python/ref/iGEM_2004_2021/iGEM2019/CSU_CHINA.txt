CSU_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::TNBC Assasin:::Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women. Despite success in several clinical trials, treatments remain limited by the high heterogeneity and invasiveness especially in triple negative breast cancer(TNBC). Based on these characteristics, our team has characterized a gene circuit with three modules. Controlled by TNBC-specific promoter 1, module 1 includes a miRNA binding site(BS) and a transcription factor which drives Module3 --- expression of a fusion protein composed of HIF1-Î±oDDD and yeast cytosine deaminase (yCD) working under hypoxia conditions. Module 2 includes several sponge-like domains effectively down-regulating specific miRNA when promoter 2 is driven. Supposing the miRNA is highly expressed in the normal cells and low in most cancer cells, this circuit could trigger highly selective cytotoxicity of cancer cells. Once optimized, our design could be applied to current treatments, allowing for a more powerful therapeutic effect with a comparatively low risk.:::2019
