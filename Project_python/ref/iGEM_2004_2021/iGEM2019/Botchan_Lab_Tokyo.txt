Botchan_Lab_Tokyo:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Search for Radioresistance ~the Unlimited Possibilities of Radioresistant E. coli~:::In 2011, Great East Japan Earthquake causes the nuclear accident in Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plants. This is why a large amount of radiation was emitted. Many researchers are aiming to solve the problem and have proposed various solutions. However, even today, radioactive contamination has been a serious problem in Japan which we need to solve immediately. From this circumstance, this year, we aim to give E. coli radiation resistance. By inserting three genes that are related to high DNA repair ability and oxidative stress tolerance from one of radiation-resistant microbes, we search for more effective way to make E.coli survive in the environment of high radiation dosage. If we combine this E.coli with other technologies, we can develop innovative solutions to purify polluted water, collecting rare metal, and so on. High DNA repair ability can also be used to improve cloning technology(in Vivo E.coli Cloning).:::2019
