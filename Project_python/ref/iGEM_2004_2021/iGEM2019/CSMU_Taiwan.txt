CSMU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Detection, new treatment, and prevention for influenza:::Influenza spreads around the world in a yearly outbreak, resulting in 3~5 million cases of severe illness and 250,000~500,000 deaths. The recent antibody-type flu screening is approximately 60% accurate and only distinguishes the basic types of influenza. Antigenic drift and shift make the prediction of the upcoming epidemic subtype of influenza a challenging task. Antibodies take time to be developed, but this slow yet potent remedy canâ€™t meet its urgent demands. To solve this problem, we utilize aptamer which is known for its specific recognition of unique proteins of influenza viruses. By improving the conventional method, we developed a rapid detection device which effectively targets influenza. Furthermore, we have also managed to exploit the aptamers to inhibit virus infection. Our project not only seeks to provide a lower cost, fast production and highly-stable detection tool, but also has strong potential for new treatment and prevention.:::2019
