Tsinghua:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PhASE:::Cellular compartmentation is critical for highly efficient and organized intracellular activities, yet artificial control of cellular compartments for catalysis or signaling remains challenging. This year, PhASE creatively utilized light-inducible phase separation as a switch in E.coli to redistribute biomolecules into compartments called “phase” in a spatio-temporal manner, in order to manipulate cellular activities. We demonstrated two applications of PhASE: Firstly, by driving enzymes and substrates in and out of a phase, we could control the overall efficiency of enzymatic reactions. Secondly, since some proteins only phase-separate at one end of a cell, we explored the potentiality of this system for cell heterogeneity induction with high time resolution. Additionally, we tried to explain the pattern of phase formed in E.coli using morphologically engineered cell lines. We anticipate our work to be a novel approach to modifying intracellular activities in E.coli.:::2019
