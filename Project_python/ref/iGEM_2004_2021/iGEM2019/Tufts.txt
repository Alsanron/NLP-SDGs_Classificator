Tufts:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Improving and Expanding Functions of Bioelectric Sensors:::Our team aims to improve and expand function of a bioelectric chemical sensor, by genetically engineering Shwanella Oneidensis to emit electrical current in response to concentrations of an analyte. We are focusing on dampening effects of leaky transcription by adding degradation tags to the output protein, as well as testing the sensor with new constructs for detecting different analytes than was previously used with this sensor (Arabinose, Mercury, etc).:::2019
