William_and_Mary:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Smartfilms: Engineered Biofilms as Living Materials:::Our iGEM project aims to create a toolkit for the precise, controlled design of living biomaterials. Of the many forms of living materials, we have chosen bacterial biofilms due to their ubiquity and outstanding bioengineering potential. Biofilm formation, although frequently associated with deleterious effects, also equips bacteria with emergent properties such as increased resilience, complex signaling, self-repair, and division of labor. Our project harnesses these properties to repurpose biofilms as robust, spatially controlled, patterned, and responsive biomaterials. For robustness, we engineered a library of biofilm-strengthening adhesins, and investigated naturally biofilm-forming bacterial species. To adhere biofilms with precise spatiotemporal control, we incorporated both optogenetic and chemical induction methods. To pattern biomaterials once placed, we utilized the distance-dependent diffusion of quorum signaling molecules and generated Turing patterns that are informed by mathematical modeling. Our biomaterials have immediate applications in wound healing, water and waste treatment, and the creation of next-generation biosensors.:::2019
