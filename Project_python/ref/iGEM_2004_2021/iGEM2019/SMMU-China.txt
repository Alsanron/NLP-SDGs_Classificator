SMMU-China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Wukong: an Engineered Theranostics based on Synthetic Immune Cells:::Expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on immune cells is an emerging and promising treatment strategy for cancer, however, cancer heterogeneity derived antigen modulation may limit its implementation in solid tumors. Moreover, presently it is hard to evaluate and trace the therapeutic role of Synthetic Immune Cells. Here, we designed and characterized a novel Engineered Theranostics with the core device in which the CAR-immune cells were reprogramed to co-evolve with tumor-antigens and to send secondary signals to trigger custom-designed external devices. Two kinds of external devices, a Peripheral Probe for tracing the activity of CAR-immune cells and an Antibody Pump for enhancing Immune cell killing efficacy were further developed. The whole system is named after Wukong (Monkey King) of the ‘Journey to the West’.:::2019
