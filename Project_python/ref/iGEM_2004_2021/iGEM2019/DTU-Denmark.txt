DTU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Foundational:::Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::LEAP - Library of Engineered Aspergillus Promoters:::Our modern world depends upon the production of enzymes and biopharmaceuticals from microorganisms. Some of the most important, yet underappreciated, of these organisms are filamentous fungi. Despite their biological and economical value, the genetic toolbox for filamentous fungi is underdeveloped, something that must be addressed in order to use them as efficiently as common model organisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Therefore, we have taken it upon ourselves to develop a library of synthetic promoters that offers rich choices for stable, predictable, and tuneable expression at various scales, from the microtiter plate to the industrial fermenter, across the Aspergillus genus. These promoters are based on sequences from all publicly available Aspergillus genomes and modelled through a procedure that can be replicated by others for any taxonomic group. Furthermore, we have included a variety of standard parts for Aspergillus niger, thus expanding the possibilities for future iGEM teams.:::2019
