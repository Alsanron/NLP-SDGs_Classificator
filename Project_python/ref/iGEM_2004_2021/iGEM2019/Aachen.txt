The "Plastractor" is a device which shall extract microplastics from fluids easily via magnets. Therefore the bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum "magneticum" was obtained. It is genetically modified to build magnetosomes; small magnetic and vesicle-like particles, with plastic binding peptides on its membrane. For modification we use E. coli BW29427 which transfers the needed plasmid to Rhodospirillum rubrum "magneticum" via conjugation. Two different plastic binding peptides are used, "Tachystatin A2" (TA2) and "liquid chromatography peak I" (LCI), fused with two different fluorescent proteins to enable the detection of the bound particles. Thus the device will be able to extract the plastics that are bound to magnetosomes and detect it by fluorescence.:::2019
