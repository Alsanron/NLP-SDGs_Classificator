Our novel synthetic platform for high throughput isolation and characterization of peptides with antimicrobial properties will serve as The Terminator for multi-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are planning on using the available genomic and meta-genomic sequencing data as a source of novel peptide sequences that can be used instead of antibiotics. To identify such elements, we will be using different versions of the BLAST algorithm and known antimicrobial peptides as quarries. The next step would be to have these exact sequences synthesized as an oligonucleotide pool and cloned like an expression library in E.coli. Last but not least, we will be testing the activity of this library against a selected group of indicator strains that represent most of the major important human and animal pathogens as to find the perfect Peptidator!:::2019
