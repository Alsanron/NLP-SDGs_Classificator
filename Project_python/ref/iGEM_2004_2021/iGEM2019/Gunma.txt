Gunma:::Asia:::Japan:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Self-restraining bacteria:::The conservation of biological diversity is required worldwide, and one measure to achieve this goal would be to confine living genetically-modified organisms in laboratories or plants to prevent them from outgrowing native organisms in environment. If Escherichia coli (E. coli), is endowed with the character of predetermined limited proliferability, such E. coli strain would be very useful for research and development. Here, we designed a system in which E. coli cells lyse spontaneously when they proliferate above certain densities by taking advantage of the mutual inhibition of T7 lysozyme and T7 RNA polymerase. On the other hand, advanced biotechnology cannot be utilized properly when the public does not understand their risk and benefit. As the Information Technology Literacy has become indispensable to everyone, the promotion of Genetic Literacy is now needed. We discussed the importance of Genetic Literacy with high school students by using up-to-date resources we prepared.:::2019
