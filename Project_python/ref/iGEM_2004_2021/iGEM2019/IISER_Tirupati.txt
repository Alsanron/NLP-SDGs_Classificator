IISER_Tirupati:::Asia:::India:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Potential Probiotic for Targeted Immunotherapy against Colon Cancer:::The therapeutic landscape of oncology is fast changing. However, existing interventions are often limited by their cost, side-effects and efficiency. Our project aims to engineer a bacteria which can be used to treat colon cancer. Using Escherichia coli as our chassis, we will be expressing a colon cancer homing peptide on the bacteriumâ€™s fimbriae which should aid it to attach specifically to colon cancer cells. As a fail-safe mechanism to reduce non-specific effects, we harness the abnormally high lactate levels in the tumour micro-environment as a second layer of confirmation to stimulate the bacteria to produce the immunomodulator Interleukin-12 (IL-12). We are making our bacteria lactate sensitive by tweaking the lactate metabolizing lldPRD operon.The secreted IL-12 inside the colon should trigger a signalling cascade which recruits immune effector cells to the tumour micro-environment - leading to tumour suppression.:::2019
