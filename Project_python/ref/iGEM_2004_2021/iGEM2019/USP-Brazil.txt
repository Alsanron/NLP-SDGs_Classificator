USP-Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::genSwitch:::Bioproduction, a industrial process that generates useful products through microorganisms, performed in bioreactors and occuring in two main steps: upstream (induction and production of bacterial metabolites) and downstream (isolation and purification). The most common inductor used in bioproduction are expensive chemical compounds (IPTG and arabinose) that lacks in control of what and how much metabolite can be produced. In this way, our goal is to built a genetic circuit that can switch between two different states of activation with just a single input of blue led light and to compare the efficiency between chemical and light inductors by seeing strength and lack. The circuit was built in E.coli and works based on inhibition handles and recombinases, inverting the promoter region according to the presence and absence of the same blue light input, as output fluorescent proteins are used. The project allows a more practical, controlled and economical bioproduction pathway.:::2019
