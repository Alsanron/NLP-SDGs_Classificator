Greatbay_SCIE:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Underwater Adhesives Toolbox:::Waterborne organisms like mussels and barnacles produce proteins which can be engineered into strong, durable underwater adhesives. The mussel foot and the barnacle cement contain several proteins, including MFP1/3/5 and CP19K, which makes them capable of holding onto diverse substrates. These proteins can be combined with CsgA to enhance their adhesive and cohesive function. E. coli and Pichia Pastoris are used as the chassis; Pichia Pastoris can induce higher protein yield and perform PTMs like phosphorylation that makes the proteins more adhesive. Another crucial PTM is the conversion of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine by mTyr-CNK, a tyrosinase with high catalytic efficiency. This modification is performed in vivo and in vitro to determine the optimal condition for the most DOPA content. We believe that our underwater adhesives toolbox will provide a promising space for future synthetic biologists to make advances into, thus unveiling a wide range of applications of these proteins.:::2019
