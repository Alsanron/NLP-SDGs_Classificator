Richmond_UR:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Agro Immunity:::The plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens (also known as Rhizobium radiobacter) causes millions of dollars of crop damage yearly via crown gall tumors. However, a solution might be within Agrobacterium. We wanted to prevent tumorogenesis using a biomolecule, called curdlan, which is naturally produced by Agrobacterium and exists in the cell walls of plants as structural support. As a possible solution, we synthesized a plasmid that included the machinery to produce curdlan powered by a constitutive virulence promoter. This plasmid was inserted into a lab-grade strain of Agrobacterium that is faster at reaching wound sites then the wild type. When the synthetic Agrobacterium encounters a wounded plant, it will produce curdlan in large amounts. Thus, raising the plants structural defenses. The long-term goal is to utilize synthetic Agrobacterium like a factory to manufacture curdlan at a large scale for farmers, scientists, etc. to apply it.:::2019
