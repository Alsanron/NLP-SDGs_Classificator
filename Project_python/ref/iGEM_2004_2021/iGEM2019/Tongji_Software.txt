Tongji_Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Pathlab: An integrated platform for pathway construction with enzyme information:::With the development of synthetic biology, it is possible to design metabolic pathways and achieve them. Therefore, an integrated platform for pathway construction is needed urgently. Our software, Pathlab, perfectly caters to this demand with accurate and efficient algorithms and open data in the KEGG and BRENDA databases. Considering thermodynamic feasibility, material competition of heterogeneous reactions and toxicity of intermediates, Pathlab constructs an optimal synthetic pathway in E. coli or the yeast which is based on the available substrates or desired products. Meanwhile, the enzyme required for each reaction in the pathway will be selected first according to the physical and chemical properties and the affinity with biological chassis, and then be provided after optimization by codon preference. Moreover, Pathlab provides additional functions, such as word clouds for keywords of pathway-related literature, search engine for promoters and parts used in iGEMï¼Œetc.:::2019
