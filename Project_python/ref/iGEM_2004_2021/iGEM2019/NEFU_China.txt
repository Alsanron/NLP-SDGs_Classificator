NEFU_China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacterium Oncologists: Guide Us to Cancer!:::At the stages of high-burden tumors or metastasis, cancer patients may suffer from acute uric acid nephropathy due to rapid dissolution of tumor cells caused by conventional treatments, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. To solve the issue, we designed a novel and controllable system in E.coli Nissle 1917 that releases anti-tumor drugs in response to changes of uric acid levels, preventing the trouble of manual assessment and reduce the potential of acute uric acid nephropathy. Therefore, the tumor cells can be safely dissolved under the conditions of uric acid fluctuation within a physiologically tolerable range. Additionally, we designed a normal tissue-specific CodA expressing system, which can suppress bacterial growth with 5-Flucytosine administration. To enhance tumor elimination, we made bacteria express ftnA-M, a variant of ferritin iron storage protein, to attract engineered bacteria to tumor sites when exposed to a magnetic field.:::2019
