USTC:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::microROAD:::Dressed in colorful clothes, humans have been enjoying the benefit of abundant dyes. Among them, azo dyes are the most widely used ones. However, many types of azo dyes are quite difficult to degrade. What`s worse, about 10-15% of the azo dyes in waste water is discharged without treatment. Thus, the degradation of azo dyes has become an urgent problem. At present, physical and chemical treatments have been applied to deal with the azo dyes in waste water. Both of the two ways are suffering from the disadvantages of low decolourization ratio, high cost and additional pollution. Our project focuses on ulteriorly improving the decolourization ability of Shewanella oneidensis by introducing NAT enzyme to help resist the byproduct toxicity and overexpressing electron transfer proteins. Also, we add HXK enzyme into the bacteria to make it possible for it to utilize glucose, which can reduce the cost.:::2019
