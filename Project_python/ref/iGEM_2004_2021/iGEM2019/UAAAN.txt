UAAAN:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bio Hydro-Gene:::In our project BioHydro-Gene, we are using genes from C. reinhardtii bacteria. This are related with the glucose metabolism (the hydrogenase enzyme (Hyd1), ferredoxin, ferredoxin-NADP-reductase (FNR) and the maturation enzymes (HydEF and HydG)) to transform E. coli (DH5Î±). The genetically transformed strain will be placed on a MFC so that the molecular hydrogen will be used to generate electricity and H2O as a byproduct. In this process hydrogen molecules are generated, some of those, are going to be selected using a specific proton membrane. As hydrogen fuel cells generate energy through the hydrogen redox reaction with atmospheric oxygen, the only byproduct of this process is water, electric power can be generated to manufacture and enhance homes. Through the production of biohydrogen, we seek to generate a source of clean hydrogen fuel to bring electricity to different communities that do not have the technology or support to have this service.:::2019
