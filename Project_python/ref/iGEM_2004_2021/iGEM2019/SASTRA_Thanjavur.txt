SASTRA_Thanjavur:::Asia:::India:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::House of Toeholds: Biosensor for biomarker panel of differentially expressed circulating miRNAs in cervical cancer:::Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among Indian women with 500 million people at risk, and an unforgiving 50% mortality rate. Poor awareness and access to effective screening have caused enormous disease burden. We are developing a biosensor comprising nucleic-acid toehold switches designed to bind to certain identified differentially expressed circulating miRNA biomarkers of early-stage cervical cancer, namely miRNA-20a, miRNA-21, miRNA-29a and miRNA-200a. Each toehold switch is a second-generation design, requiring a biomarker-antimiR complex to release the expression of GFP, whose fluorescence intensity is measured. We are modelling and calibrating the performance of our toehold switches, and offering a web-server for the integrated design of these switches that uses multi-layer neural networks. Our parts characterization is performed cell-free. The developed switches may be embedded in a composite biosensor to yield a paper-based device for detecting cervical cancer.:::2019
