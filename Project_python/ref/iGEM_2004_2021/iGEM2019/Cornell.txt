Cornell:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::reHAB: A comprehensive system for microcystin detection and remediation:::Every year, streams and rivers across the world are stricken with algal blooms. While already negative for the ecosystem, some are even more deadly. These harmful algal blooms (HABs) create microcystins, toxic chemicals that are long-lasting and contaminate drinking and irrigation systems. Our system has two parts: a biological sensor to detect the presence of microcystines and a filter for environmental remediation. Our sensor consists of an RNA aptamer conjugated to gold particles, which specifically binds our target microcystin-LR and produces a colorimetric change. Our filter is comprised of a specific cassette of enzymes endogenous to Sphingopyxis sp. It consists of a packed-bed-reactor, where we pass water through a chamber containing our engineered strain immobilized on alginate beads. By putting this system on a device that can traverse the span of lake or river, we hope this will stand as a major improvement in the detection and treatment of HABs.:::2019
