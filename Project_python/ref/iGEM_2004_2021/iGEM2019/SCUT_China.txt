SCUT_China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::VerProS: A versatile Promoter-Toehold Switches pool for optimizing adaptability of multi-gene system in E. coli:::Precise and reliable gene expression is critical in fine regulation of gene or pathway expression. Routinely, it always requires library construction to each genetic part, which is costly and time-consuming. Our project has developed a method to optimize the adaptability of multi-gene system in E. coli, with only one library so-called Promoter-Toehold Switches pool. A pool is built where four Toehold Switches are placed under one of 10 promoters that yielding about 10^4 combinations. This pool can simultaneously optimize up to four genes in a system. Particularly, this versatile library can be applied to fast optimization in different systems without having to build ad hoc libraries, which can greatly reduce manpower and costs. Here, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by using the pool for fine regulation of four genes to enhance the acid tolerant of E. coli.:::2019
