ZJU-China:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PaDetector, a household device for HPV preliminary screening:::The incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in China has continued to rise. To solve the problem, our team designed and manufactured a set of household HPV detector for HPV early screening. Our detector will use female menstrual blood as teat sample and support two detection methods. The first method is based on CRISPR/Cas system. After rupturing the cervical epithelial cells in menstrual blood, we amplified the target with RPA, then identified it with Cas12a protein. This method is highly specific and can be used for HPV typing. However, in HPV screening, the key is to detect multiple HPV subtypes simultaneously. Therefore, to implement multi-channel detection, we designed another method. It uses Exoâ…¢ to assist signal amplification and uses hybridization chain reaction to further amplify the signal. Both methods report the result using test paper. We have also designed three versions of PaDetector to better meet user needs.:::2019
