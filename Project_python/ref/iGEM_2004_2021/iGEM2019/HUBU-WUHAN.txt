HUBU-WUHAN:::Asia:::China:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Waste Cartons to Renewable Bioproducts by Zymomonas mobilis:::Our project aims to build up biological parts in Zymomonas mobilis for converting waste cartons into Poly-Î²-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and biofuels. For Z. mobilis engineering, we express the cellulosome in the Z. mobilis to construct CBP strains that can directly utilize cellulose, because it cannot grow normally in media with cellulose as a single carbon source. In addition, a reporter-gene system established for Z. mobilis is used to effectively characterize biological parts, and Oligo-linker mediated assembly (OLMA) method is applied for the assembly of biological parts. Moreover, through a newly developed CRISPR-cas guided gene editing technology, assembled biological parts are integrated into the genome of Z. mobilis. Finally, in order to create a highly predictable gene expression pattern to generate a high flux of transcription, we need establish a biophysical model to predict the correlation between regulatory parts such as promoter and terminator sequences with their strength on gene expression.:::2019
