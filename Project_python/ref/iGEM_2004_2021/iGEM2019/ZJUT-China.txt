ZJUT-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::HCHO-Scavenger：A genetically engineered bacteria machine as a scavenger for formaldehyde cleavage:::Formaldehyde is a serious threat to human health while it almost exists everywhere especially in newly decorated rooms. This year, our team focus on the degradation of formaldehyde using E. coli. Our genetically engineered bacteria contain three parts: the degradation device、the indication device and the photolysis device. The degradation device acting as the core turns formaldehyde into carbon dioxide with several protein. At the same time, the indication device shows users if the concentration of formaldehyde is safe to live. When the concentration is higher than a threshold value, the medium gives a blue color, otherwise it appears orange. In consideration of biosafety, we integrate a photolysis system which expresses lysin protein when exposed under blue light, thus our HCHO-scavenger works in the dark. The lysed bacteria can be recycled in the end.:::2019
