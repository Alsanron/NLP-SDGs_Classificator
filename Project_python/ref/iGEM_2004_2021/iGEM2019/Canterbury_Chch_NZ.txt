Canterbury_Chch_NZ:::Asia:::New Zealand:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Milk Protein Project:::The rise of cellular agriculture in New Zealand has inspired us to develop novel strategies to increase the value of milk proteins that will, in the future, be produced using biotechnology. Cow's milk is categorized as one of the main 8 allergens in the western world. Beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), a protein found in both bovine and caprine milk, is a key allergen in the whey fraction of milk. Allergy to proteins like BLG, occurs due to specific proteins keys (amino acid epitope sequences) which initiate an immune response and/or because the protein cannot be easily digested by the body. Our project aims to utilize biotechnology to decrease the allerginicity to milk proteins like BLG. To achieve this, we have produced genetic variants of BLG and will transform E. coli, "hijacking" bacteria to synthesize the variant-proteins. Subsequently, we will purify and run enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in triplicate to screen for allerginicity.:::2019
