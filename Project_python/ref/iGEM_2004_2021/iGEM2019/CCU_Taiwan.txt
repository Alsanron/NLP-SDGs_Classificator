CCU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ASFAST: Rapid early detection of African Swine Fever:::African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) is a serious epidemic disease worldwide. The ease of infection and high mortality rate has caused serious market imbalance. ASF has spread throughout Asia, so Taiwan is surrounded by epidemic regions. Recognizing this problem, we created "ASFAST". ASFAST combines the CRISPR Cas system with PicoGreen fluorescence signal transduction. We use Cas12a protein with crRNA to recognize the ASFV p72 capsid protein sequence. When the Cas12a protein is activated, a fluorescent signal will be detected by our sensor. ASFAST can detect the virus within 7 days of infection, which means during the incubation period. Based on this advantage, we plan to develop an early detection system as part of a routine health check for non-epidemic regions. After the test, the ASFAST device will immediately send the data to a cloud database so the government can monitor the results in real time.:::2019
