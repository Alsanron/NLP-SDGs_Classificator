NYMU-Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DiseaScent: Odorant Biosensors for Detecting the Scent of Diseases:::Volatile organic metabolites can be generated in many human samples through distinct metabolic pathways. Increasing research evidence indicates that patients’ bodies give off unique Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in different stages of human diseases. Therefore, VOCs are considered as potential biomarkers for performing non-invasive and patient-friendly disease screening in the early stages. This year, NYMU-Taipei iGEM team has taken tuberculosis disease as an example and created intracellularly expressed and surface-displayed odorant-binding proteins to detect and monitor the volatile biomarkers from the patients’ bodies. We have immobilized expressed olfactory receptor proteins to paper device prototypes to detect heptanal which is a specific VOC from tuberculosis patients. Here, we provide an example to demonstrate the feasibility of using odorant biosensors to perform non-invasive early disease screening. Our device prototypes with immobilized olfactory receptor proteins show specific bindings with heptanal. This method is also friendly to children/babies and severely ill patients.:::2019
