Hamburg:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RIBOT - programming cells with RNA:::Engineered genetic circuits have reached high complexity levels. These developments require transformation with more than one plasmid which in turn demands the simultaneous use of different antibiotics. Our aim is to enable transformation with multiple plasmids and just one antibiotic to minimize side-effects. In our study we describe a novel RNA-based approach that allows for selection of several plasmids with only one antibiotic. The strategy is based on toehold switches that easily and reliably introduce a complex AND-logic to our design, thus enabling the selection of bacteria with all required plasmids. Our new method shows clear advantages: it increases cell growth and decreases stress, pushing forward the boundaries of synthetic biology.:::2019
