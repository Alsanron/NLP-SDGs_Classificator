Aboa:::Europe:::Finland:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Expanded genetic code to control antibody orientation in immunodiagnostics:::Antibody based diagnostic tests or immunoassays are widely used to quicken treatment decision-making and to enable patients to test themselves for example for pregnancy. However, the analyte binding antibodies in conventional immunoassays are randomly immobilized onto a test surface blocking some binding sites from the analytes. When the concentration of a disease marker as the analyte is below the detection limit or the sensitivity, the signal could be improved by orienting the antibodies. Our objective was to orientate a digoxigenin binding Fab fragment of the antibody by incorporating a p-azido-L-phenylalanine, an unnatural amino acid with click chemistry properties. As a control, we used a chemically treated Fab including azide in random locations. The Fabs were immobilized onto DBCO coated magnetic beads and the bound fluorescently labeled digoxigenin was measured with flow cytometry. According to the results, orientation improved the signal and made the test surface more homogeneous.:::2019
