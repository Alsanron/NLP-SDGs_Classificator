Lethbridge:::North America:::Canada:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Algulin: a low-cost oral insulin produced and administered in microalgae.:::Diabetes, a disease caused by abnormal insulin regulation and production, affects approximately 8.8% of the population. Currently, subcutaneous injection of recombinant insulin is used to self-regulate abnormal blood glucose levels, a treatment that is painful and often prohibitively expensive for patients. Oral insulin alternatives are not yet a cost-effective alternative because the unprotected insulin is rapidly degraded by acidic stomach conditions and so there remains an unmet demand for low-cost methods of manufacturing oral insulin and/or novel methods for delivering insulin directly to the intestines. We are developing an edible recombinant microalgae strain called “Algulin” that produces either an ultrastable oral insulin analog or proinsulin peptides. Algulin reduces manufacturing costs by eliminating the need for insulin extraction and purification, improves efficacy over previous oral insulins by acting as a protective capsule and shielding the insulin from degradation, and eliminates uncomfortable injections for diabetic patients.:::2019
