BrownStanfordPrinctn:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Towards an Astropharmacy:::Astronauts rely on regular shipments of medication from Earth because drugs degrade; this is an unsustainable practice for long-term manned missions. Our solution is the “Astropharmacy” – an on-demand production system for protein-based drugs. The Astropharmacy comprises diagnostics, drug production, and purification. Within diagnostics, we enhanced paper-based microfluidics by innovating hydrophobic protein-based ink to 3D print microfluidic channels, improving resolution from wax-based channels. We designed genetic templates to produce insulin, teriparatide, and hG-CSF using cellular systems to harnesses the speed of VmaxTM, long-term viability of Bacillus subtilis, and production capability of E.coli, and commercial and lab-developed cell-free systems for their adaptability. Lyophilization techniques were applied to preserve the stability of the Astropharmacy at ambient temperatures. Drug production and purification were implemented on 3D-printed expression and PDMS purification microfluidic chips. The construction of the Astropharmacy was guided by insight from industry experts, astronauts, and doctors.:::2019
