IISER_Kolkata:::Asia:::India:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::unLeish: Designing a nitric oxide sensing bacteria to detect and eliminate Leishmania parasite inside macrophages:::Leishmaniasis comes under the category of Neglected Tropical Disease affecting millions of lives across the globe with a hotspot in India and Africa. The current treatment is expensive and comes with serious side effects. We the team iGEM of IISER Kolkata present unLeish, a genetically modified bacterium with a Nitric Oxide sensor that specifically targets the Leishmania-infected macrophages. The sensor is activated only when intracellular NO level falls within a certain concentration range, which is unique to Leishmania-infected macrophages and ensures that our targeted response is specific to these cells only. Further, the sensor activates the expression of a bacterial iron chelator Aerobactin (to reduce iron available for Leishmania) and subsequently stop Leishmanial growth and replication within the macrophage.:::2019
