GZHS-United:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::COLORAL(Color the Coral):::A coral reefs is an underwater ecosystem. Corals owe their beautiful colors in part to symbiotic algae, which live inside the coral cells. Coral reefs are sensitive to the temperature of the water for algaeâ€™s respond to elevated temperatures which connects with the coral bleaching. We concerned about how exactly the coral bleaching happened and found that the hydrogen peroxide may be the most significant signaling molecule between coral and algae in this intercellular communication . Algae has enzymes to remove hydrogen peroxide.Since the global warming,the concentration of hydrogen peroxide has been up too much that they can't afford.Hence the relationship between Corals and Algae gradually break up. We foucs on key enzyme which takes part in removing hydrogen peroxide in algae, hoping to optimize this enzyme by the help of synthetic biology analysis, so as to help restore the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis against coral bleaching.:::2019
