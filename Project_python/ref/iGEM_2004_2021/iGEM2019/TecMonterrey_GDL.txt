TecMonterrey_GDL:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Gliksys bio-ink:::Owing to the increasing prevalence of diabetes, novel approaches for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) that can be readily implemented without the need for trained personnel or specialized equipment are highly ideal. Bacterial whole-cell biosensors (WCBs) capable of continuous monitoring of diabetes-related parameters could be used to engineer devices that can help diabetic patients achieve and maintain normal blood glucose levels. We hypothesize that genetically engineered bacteria encapsulated within a polymeric matrix (a bio-ink) can be used to biofabricate wearable/implantable WCBs for CGM such as epidermal bio-tattoos, microneedles, and implantable scaffolds. Furthermore, the ability of WCBs to transduce biological recognition into a colorimetric signal will allow the design of devices that do not require expensive analytical equipment or trained personnel to be applied and interpreted. This approach provides several advantages over conventional electrochemical biosensors such as the potential for multiparametric measurements, autonomy, simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ease of administration/interpretation.:::2019
