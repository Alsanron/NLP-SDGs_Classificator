Strasbourg:::Europe:::France:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AptaTest : Hunting Allergens !:::The prevalence of food allergies is currently increasing to reach 10% worldwide. Food allergy and intolerance can become a burden in the daily life of people. This is strengthened by the evolution of food habits. New products on the market, transformation processes and the eating tendency of the population (fast foods, canteens, ready meals) contribute to the emergence of new allergens. Many new allergic reactions are due to ingredients which are not labeled correctly. We aim to facilitate the life of people who suffers from food allergies by offering a food allergen detection kit with colored signal system. It should be fast and portable for easy on-site use, as well as versatile to adapt to any allergen. It is based on a triple hybrid system implemented in E. coli. Flexibility will be provided thanks to an aptazyme which will be interchanged for specific allergens.:::2019
