Jiangsu_High_School:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Discovery of autophagy agonist against Alzheimer’s disease:::Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressively neurodegenerative disease, with typical hallmarks of amyloid β (Aβ) plaque accumulation, neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation and neuronal death extension. There are only five FDA-approved drugs for the relief or treatment of AD, including tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and memantine, despite their varied side effects in clinical use, which cannot substantially block the progress of the disease. Therefore, it is important to develop effective new anti-AD drugs. Autophagy is a physiological process for cells to remove macromolecules, cell subunits and aggregates that affect normal cell functions. It has been believed to be a promising target for anti-AD drug discovery. Here, we use mWasabi-tagRFP fluorescence-tagged LC3 (mWasabi-tagRFP-LC3) to monitor the autophagic flux in SH-SY5Y cells. We find a compound effectively increased both yellow and red puncta in SH-SY5Y cells compared with the control cells, indicating that it may stimulate autophagic flux.:::2019
