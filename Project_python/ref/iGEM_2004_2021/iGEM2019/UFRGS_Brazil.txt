UFRGS_Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::GlyFloat - Floating away with glyphosate!:::Glyphosate is a synthetic phosponate able to block the EPSPs enzymes in some plant species and is the main active compound of the most used agrochemical worldwide. Anually, more than 170,000 tons of glyphosate are applied over brazillian crops, and a considerable amount is carried by rain to the rivers and lakes. Glyphosate has already been shown to cause mutations in fish, malformation in amphibious species and superreproduction of snail species. There is still a strong debate over its effects to human health. UFRGS_Brazil team aims to engineer Escherichia coli K12 to correct its endogenous C-P lyase operon, remove a repressor and change the promoter region to a constitutive one. We designed a 3D model of a stationary filter to validate our biofiltering system. We also designed a lac-dependent kill-switch to ensure that the genetically engineered bacteria will not survive out of the alginate shells it will be trapped upon.:::2019
