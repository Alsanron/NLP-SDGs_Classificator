A potential alternative to chemical fertilizers is rhizobia, a microorganism that takes nitrogen from the air and converts it into nitrates. The nitrates can then be readily used by the host legume and surrounding organisms after the legume decays. Current challenges in the use of rhizobia in agriculture include desiccation, bacterial competition, and other osmotic stressors. Our project works to improve rhizobiaâ€™s agricultural capabilities through overexpression of a gene involved in trehalose biosynthesis, otsA. Expected benefits include increased nitrogenase activity, increased tolerance to environmental stressors, and increased crop yield of associated legumes. This next-generation of rhizobia will be a stepping stone to transforming agricultural practices to be both economically and ecologically sustainable.:::2019
