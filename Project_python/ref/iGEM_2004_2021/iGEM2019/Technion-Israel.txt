The honey possesses unique properties that make it highly attractive in fields such as medicine, cosmetics, and food industry. Nowadays, the honey industry depends on honey produced by bees, which therefore harm them and their natural social structure. Our vision is to create a sustainable "bee-free honey" using engineered bacteria, which will process a nectar-like solution and secrete enzymes that mimic the honey stomach environment. The engineered bacteria will be separated from the final product using membrane-based capsules, providing the bacteria's favorable growth medium inside the capsule, while allowing enzymes secretion to the external "nectar" solution. We have also designed a synthetic circuit that will regulate the transcription of the essential enzymes, enabling us to obtain a solution consisting of real honey properties.:::2019
