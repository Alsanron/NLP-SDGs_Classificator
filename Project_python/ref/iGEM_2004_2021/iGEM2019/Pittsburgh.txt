Pittsburgh:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Design of Novel Protein-based Logic Gates using Split-Inteins:::The design of protein-based cellular circuits offers the potential for rapid information processing. Previously, circuits were designed using kinases and proteases. Here, we propose two methods to design split-intein based cellular circuits. Upon association, split-inteins autosplice the flanking peptide sequences together to form functional proteins. Our first method involves the cascading splicing events through our nested intein design. This involves the insertion of an orthogonal split-intein within an intein half to render it nonfunctional. This creates a multi-input AND gate that can be incorporated into a larger cellular circuit. We propose a second method in which a weakly-associating intein is connected by a flexible linker. This linker is constructed from multi-input AND gates consisting of split-intein pairs, which avoids additional disruption of the extein sequence. We envision using our designed split-intein logic framework to create gene circuits capable of performing various Boolean logic operations through regulated splicing events.:::2019
