UM_Macau:::Asia:::Macao:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Self-Activating Nanoparticles Collector E. coli (SANCE):::The project SANCE targets on the nanoparticle pollution, an unneglectable issue facing by coast-line cities including Macau. We aim to engineer a controllable nano-/micro-particle collector microorganism. We hypothesize that our modified E.coli bacteria expressing the adhesive(sticky) fusion protein on its cell surface would be able to collect the nano-/micro-particle targets, through which, we will be able to help solving the current issue of excessive suspended solids in Macau wastewater treatment process. Our team also plans to largely engage in public by holding various outreach activities, including local wastewater treatment plant visiting, social survey and interview experts from other universities, university workshop, summer camp engagement and high school lecture. Meanwhile, we plan to collaborate with other iGEMers through symposiums, university visiting and lab work collaborations. Through this project, we aim to achieve a more efficient nano-/micro-particles elimination technique and thereby enhance the awareness of Macau residents in water resource protection.:::2019
