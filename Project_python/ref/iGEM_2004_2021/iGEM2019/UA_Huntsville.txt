UA_Huntsville:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CosmiColi: Using exogenous tardigrade proteins to improve radio tolerance of E. coli cell line IR9-50-1:::Increased background radiation in space causes a significant increase in the mutation rate of bacterial genes which threatens the validity of biological experiments performed in environments such as the International Space Station. K12 derived cell line IR9-50-1 contains genomic mutations to RecN, RecD, and RpoBC which allow it to withstand up to 2500 Gy. CosmiColi will be engineered by introducing exogenous tardigrade derived radiation resistance proteins Dsup and CAHS to IR9-50-1. Our team hypothesizes that CosmiColi will have greater radio tolerance compared to wild type IR9-50-1 and wild type parent strain MG1655. Radio tolerance is tested by comparing the growth and the rate of gain of function mutations in all three cell lines. Growth is quantified by measuring optical density of overnight cultures. Gain of function mutations are measured by the restoration of antibiotic resistance.:::2019
