NAWI_Graz:::Europe:::Austria:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Beeosensor:::The American Foulbrood, caused by Paenibacillus larvae, is the most dangerous bacterial disease facing bees in Austria. The early diagnosis of the American Foulbrood requires a microbiological laboratory, which makes preventative monitoring unpleasant for beekeepers, especially for hobby-beekeepers. We seek to develop a biosensor in order to make it possible for anyone to measure for P. larvae in a relatively short period of time. The sensor should be easy to use, small, affordable and sensitive enough to detect small amounts of bacteria.Bacteriophages are immobilized onto an electrode to provide the necessary specificity. The binding of the P. larvae spores from the probe to the bacteriophages causes a change in the electrical resistance, which can be quantified by electrical impedance spectroscopy.:::2019
