Thessaloniki:::Europe:::Greece:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::POSEIDON: Programmable Orthogonal Systems Engineered Into DNA Oligo Networks:::We present POSEIDON, a molecular toolkit that harnesses the versatility of nucleic acid networks to investigate intramolecular events that regulate gene expression. With functionality determined entirely by the secondary structure of DNA, strand displacement has emerged as a highly adaptable artificial molecular system with programmable behaviour for cell-free biochemical networks. Through the exploitation of DNA Strand Displacement molecular computation, our toolkit is able to quantify and characterize DNA-Protein interactions. Our team has utilized the principles of DNA circuitry to shed light into the mechanisms of gene activation and transcription factor binding by introducing the protein's target sequence in the processing algorithm. As a proof-of-concept, transcription factors participating in metastatic melanoma are being examined through the lens of molecular programming, to elucidate potential intracellular pathways and therapeutic targets. For the projectâ€™s outgrowth, we envision an ensemble of advanced modular DNA circuits able to thoroughly investigate complex protein behaviours in malignant pathways.:::2019
