Xiamen_City:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::MPD degrader: create a mirobe to degrade contaminant m-phenylenediamine:::M-Phenylenediamine (MPD) is an important raw material of organic synthesis, but it is also a common chemical pollutant which causes toxicity to aquatic animals and humans. Until now, people do not have a cost effective and convenient way to degrade MPD. Here we use three starting microbial strains with adaptive evolution to degrade MPD. The first two strans are Escherichia coli MG1655 and the strain with laccase expression plasmid which is reported degrading polyphenols, and the other is an unknown strain isolated from contaminated sludge. Under the increasing supplement of MPD in their culture media, the adaptive evolution may happen during generations. Our results demonstrate the lasccase overexpression E. coli strans has the ability to degrade MPD. We also inditified the unknown strain is Bacillus aryabhattai B8W22, and it is able to degrade the analogues of MPD. And the adaptive evolution to decompose MPD may achieve in the future study.:::2019
