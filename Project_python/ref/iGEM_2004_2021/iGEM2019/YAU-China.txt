YAU-China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biodestroyer of biofilm(Bob):::Bacterial biofilms present significant medical challenges. A key component of biofilm formation in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharides Pel and Psl, which are involved in the formation and maintenance of the structural biofilm scaffold and protection against antimicrobials and host defenses. So, we used synthetic biology methods to overexpress the hydrolyzing enzyme that decomposes the corresponding extracelluar polysaccharide in engineering bacteria to destroy the wild type P. aeruginosa biofilm. Since the extracellular polysaccharide hydrolase is an instracellular enzyme and can't be secreted into the extracellular environment, this project designed two protocols to induce the engineering bacteria to cleave, thereby releasing the extracellular polysaccharide hydroalase into the extracellular environment and destroying the wild biofilm. We hope to solve problems of antibiotic resistance caused by biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa in clinical treatment , and provide a new idea for eradication of chronic bacteria infection.:::2019
