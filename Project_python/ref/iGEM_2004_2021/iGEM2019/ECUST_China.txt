ECUST_China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Paper Transformer:::Wastepaper, as a recyclable materials, can be regenerated repeatedly in wastepaper factories. Nevertheless, the pulp fibers will shorten with every recycling processes. When it reaches a certain extent, these pulp fibers will be too hard to be reused. Furthermore, in the current recovery process, the paper quality will degrade if those short fibers are not strictly removed. However, this problem can be resolved. We have developed the Paper Transformer that can manufacture composite materials which can improve the properties of recycled paper when mixed into pulp, by achieving the former decomposition of short pulp fibers and the latter in situ synthesis of bacterial cellulose. Also we will not stop at this, as the excellent performance of our Paper Transformer is far from been restricted within the paper-making industry alone but many industries where electronic paper, artificial skin and many other products are produced.:::2019
