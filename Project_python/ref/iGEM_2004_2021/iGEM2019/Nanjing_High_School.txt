Nanjing_High_School:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Light-Catch: An engineered microbe that records blue light exposure time:::In China, with the popularity of electronic devices, we spend more time in front of electronic display screens. However, the blue light emitted by the display screen is extremely harmful to our health. Here, we develop a type of micro-organism that can record the length of time it is exposed to blue light. We find that Cas1-Cas2 complex which proteins in the process of cutting and inserting DNA fragments into CRISPR array, can be restrained by Thermobifida fusca (Tfus) Cas3. We construct plasmids with Cas1-Cas2 and Cas3 expression, and the Cas3 is built downstream of FixK2 promoter controlled by blue light sensor. Therefore, a quantitative relationship between the acquisition of new spacers of the CRISPR array in Cas1-Cas2 and the length of time that the bacteria are exposed in blue light is developed. Combining this technique with practical applications will yield a method to measure time of blue light emitting.:::2019
