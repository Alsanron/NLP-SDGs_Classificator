Hong_Kong-CUHK:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Banana Savior: The X Sense:::Banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW) is caused by the bacteria called Xanthomonas campestris pv. mussacearum (Xcm) and all the bananas are subjected to this particular bacterial infection. The aim of this project is to develop a simple, laboratory-independent detection device that could be used to identify BXW-infected bananas at early stages. It will be beneficial to limit the infection rate and prevent epidemic spreading across the border. Diffusible signal factor (DSF) is a signal in cell-cell communication, which is also used as the biomarkers of bacteria. Our design aims to detect the DSF specific to Xcm to indicate the presence of this pathogen inside the sample to be tested. By synthetic biological approach, we couple the signaling pathway of RpfC/RpfG in Xcm to the signaling pathway of E. coli. Hopefully, a transformed E. coli can recognize the DSF of Xcm and could show a red chromoprotein positive signal for warning.:::2019
