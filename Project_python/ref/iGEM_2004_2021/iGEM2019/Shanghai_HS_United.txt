Shanghai_HS_United:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::ASFVRD: African Swine Fever virus rapid detection:::African Swine Fever virus, ASFv, is a double-stranded DNA virus fatal to pigs. ASFv reached China in 2018 and epidemic was reported on August 2nd. When infected by ASFv, symptoms such as diarrhea are identified on pigs; to prevent dissemination, effective detection is momentous as the infected population must be quarantined. However, the current method in China is inefficient while the virus could spread and cause immeasurable economic loss in pork-consuming countries. Shanghai HS United iGEM team shows an innovative method to detect ASFv among the pigs by test strips with FITC probes to determine the result’s positivity. Our results demonstrate loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and Cas12a reaction together shorten the detection and satisfies our three aims — simplicity, immediacy, and accuracy. We believe our method is practical and operational by the pig owners and is cheaper and more effective than PCR, so treatments can be instantly implemented.:::2019
