TU_Darmstadt:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Real MVP - The Expression System for Modular Virus-like Particles:::Our goal is the development of a standardized, modular system based on biological nanoparticles to accelerate the research and development of novel vaccines, targeted drug delivery and other promising applications. The toolkit is based on virus-like particles (VLPs) which offer a multitude of desirable properties. VLPs are protein shells of viruses which are no longer infectious due to the lack of nucleic acids. For our purposes we use the bacteriophage P22 whose capsid can be produced via heterologous expression in variable hosts. The complex protein shell consists of two important compounds: the scaffold-protein (SP) and the coat-protein (CP). The CP is modified with an extension-tag. Therefore, an enzyme called sortase can connect any protein of interest which contains a corresponding tag. With the sortase modification the VLP functionality can be adapted to ones liking in no time, leading to a reduction in production and development costs for VLP-based technologies.:::2019
