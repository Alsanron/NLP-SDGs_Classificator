NUDT_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineered Hepatocytes for Glycemic Homeostasis Regulation:::Type II diabetes mellitus (T2D) is now one of the biggest threats to human health. Previous studies have revealed the critical contribution of glucagon and glucagon induced hepatic gluconeogenesis in the hyperglycemia of T2D patient. Here we demonstrate a designer cell approach to control hyperglycemia by degrading hepatic Glucagon Receptors (GCGR) in a glycemic dependent manner. We achieved glucose responsiveness by synthetic circuits that couple endogenous CHREBP glucose sensing pathway to a CHREBP activating hybrid promoter controlling GCGR degrading elements. The degradation of GCGR was then executed by proteasome-based system in a Trim21 based, Trim-away alike manner. Circuit-carrying HepG2 cells showed significantly decreased GCGR level and glucogenic ability, similar results were obtained in primary mouse hepatocytes with adenovirus as delivery approach as well. Mathematical modeling also indicated the potentials of this circuit in long-term in vivo uses. This method may provide a promising strategy for T2D treatment in the future.:::2019
