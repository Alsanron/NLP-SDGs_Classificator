A recent study found that up to 70% of waterways are polluted in major textile producing regions as a result of textile dyeing. Azo-dyes are the most common synthetic dyes and are widely used in the textile, leather and printing industries. Some azo-dyes and their derivatives have toxic and mutagenic effects. We are tackling this problem by (I) improving the enzymatic function of azo-dye degrading enzymes, (II) immobilizing the enzymes as a delivery system, (III) developing biosensors to test contaminants in waste effluents, and (IV) the use of azo-dyes derivatives as a carbon source to produce synthetic spider silk. The main aim of this project is to reduce the environmental impact of azo-dye pollution and to explore novel technologies to promote a sustainable textile industry using circular economy principles.:::2019
