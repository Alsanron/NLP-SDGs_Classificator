Harvard:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::FlowGlo: Graded Shear Stress-Sensing in Mammalian Cells:::Tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs), used instead of autografts for surgeries such as coronary artery bypass, fail most frequently due to atherosclerosis and thrombus formation. Resulting partial occlusion of a blood vessel increases the shear stress experienced by its walls to levels far beyond the physiological norm. We are developing a system in endothelial cells of three shear mechanosensing proteins with different sensitivities. Activation of each drives expression of distinct fluorescent reporters. We link activation to response by adapting the TANGO assay as well as the Calmodulin/Calcineurin-NFAT pathway. This system could eventually be used to secrete therapeutic agents under pathologically high shear stress, such that engineered cells seeded in TEVGs could respond to and treat local occlusions. We have worked to assemble the genetic constructs that comprise the system, and hope to demonstrate their function within microfluidics and TEVG settings.:::2019
