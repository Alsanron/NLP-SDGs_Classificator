BUCT-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering Microbulbifer hydrolyticus for plastic degradation and value-added products:::Plastics are widely used in industry and households because of their low-weight, durability and low-production cost. Nowadays, the consumption of plastics has risen sharply. However, lack of effective waste plastics management poses a major threat to the environment. For the past few years, new technology about biodegradation of plastics has been a hot spot. Polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) are the most important mass-produced plastics, which are difficult to be degraded by the microorganism. Recently, we observed a strain Microbulbifer hydrolyticus , which has the ability to degrade PE and PS. In this study, we would try to investigate the mechanism of PE biodegradation, and find the key enzymes. Meanwhile, based on the genome sequencing and synthetic biology, we aim to construct an artificial metabolic pathway, engineering this strain to enhance the ability to plastics biodegrading. Furthermore, the strain could utilize plastics to synthetic value-added products, such as PHA, etc.:::2019
