NTHU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::FarFarmIA:::Recently, excessive fertilization has become easier than fertilizing too little since the low price of synthetic fertilizer. Applying excessive fertilizer of crop requirement will harm crops and soil, moreover harming the environment and human health. Our project is aimed to give a solution to current agriculture problem. The two main problems we will solve are the lack of labor force in agriculture and over fertilization. Therefore, FarFarmIA ( Far Farm Intelligence Agriculture ) is designed. FarFarmIA is a smart farming system that contains two major product, the smart fertilizer and the IoT robot. Smart fertilizer can provide nutrition of crop requirement under different temperature and automatically fertilize the crops. On the other hand, IoT robot could provide real time detection on the soil texture, analysis the texture data and can help manage the farm land. By FarFarmIA, farmers can reduce the labor force demand and grow the crops better.:::2019
