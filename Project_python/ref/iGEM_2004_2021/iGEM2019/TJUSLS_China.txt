TJUSLS_China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Achilles' Heel of Metallo-Beta-Lactamases:::With the continuous emergence and rapid spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) resulting from the misuse of antibiotics, it is imperative to develop novel therapies against them. One of the major mechanisms of bacterial resistance is that MDRB can produce beta-lactamases which degrade antibiotics, so finding new-type inhibitors is significant in the treatment of diseases associated with MDRB. Therefore, we focus our project on hitting Achilles' heel of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs), a vital class of beta-lactamases without available clinical inhibitors. We use synthetic biology methods to express a series of MBLs in E. coli, and then screen out effective inhibitor compounds via high-throughput screening with fluorescent probe (CDC-1) from several drug libraries. Also we assess their inhibitory ability in living bacterial cells by UV-vis. Our results shows that screened inhibitors improve the effect of beta-lactams when applied simultaneously to living bacteria, which are ideal candidates for therapeutics for diseases caused by MDRB.:::2019
