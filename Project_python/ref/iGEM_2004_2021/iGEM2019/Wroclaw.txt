Wroclaw:::Europe:::Poland:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering microorganisms to fight for better quality of air at home:::The aim of the project was to develop biofilters based on eco-friendy polymers, designed for purifying air from heavy metals. Microorganism used in the research was Yarrowia lipolytica, a popular non-conventional yeast used in bioremediation, due to its ability to absorb high concentrations of heavy metals. The goal was to create a strain expressing genes responsible for the synthesis of lycopene and γ-decalactone. The genes will be placed under the control of metal induced promoters and cloned into the yeast to generate red color and peachy smell, once the concentration of heavy metals reaches high level. Out of six analyzed genes, two were expressed when cells were exposed to heavy metals. The promoters of these genes were identified and characterized, followed by their application in the pathway of lycopene and γ-decalactone production. Currently, application of Y. lipolytica cells with inducible lycopene biosynthesis pathway trapped in eco-friendy polymers are under investigation.:::2019
