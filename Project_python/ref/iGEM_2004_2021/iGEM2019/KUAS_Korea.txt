KUAS_Korea:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BTS : Bioluminescent Tatoo for Stress detection:::Like humans, animals experience stress but can't communicate even if they do. This can severely compromise animal welfare and animal rights. To address this issue, our goal is to make an eukaryotic bioluminescent system that detects stress in animals. To be more specific, if a target’s level of cortisol rises to a certain level, our system will get triggered, causing its skin to light up. This will enable people to visibly check if animals are under stress, helping them to identify and eliminate possible causes of animal stress. To achieve this, we employed a newly discovered fungal bioluminescent system to design and construct a genetic circuit that detects cellular signals. Our project also includes mathematical modeling of the bioluminescent system to reach a desired outcome. Furthermore, we intend to apply our system to humans as well and hope to provide an effective stress–managing system for people in the future.:::2019
