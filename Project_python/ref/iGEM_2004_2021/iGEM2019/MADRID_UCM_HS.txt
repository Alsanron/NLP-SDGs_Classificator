MADRID_UCM_HS:::Europe:::Spain:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::A Synthetic Biology Approach for the Sustainable Production of Stable Inks:::The use of natural and sustainable inks in many different applications such as printer cartridges, pens or textile dyeing is currently limited by two important factors. On the one hand, although pigments can be extracted and purified easily from fruits or vegetables, the use of food for these purposes is not a sustainable practice. On the other hand, natural pigments are prone to oxidation, which severely affect color stability. Therefore, as a proof of concept, we propose a synthetic biology approach in which bacteria are genetically programmed to synthesize enzymes capable of catalyzing the transformation of color precursors into pigments. Oxidation of these pigments can then be prevented by either chemical or physical strategies. We explore both the use of a yeast cell-free system as a chemical anti-oxidant and the encapsulation of the resultant pigments to prevent their oxidation using physical barriers.:::2019
