Tunghai_TAPG:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Eco-life, better life:::It is the Tunghai team’s first year to compete in the iGEM competition . Our team consists of 15 students working together in multidisciplinary teams to achieve our goal. Our members come from different backgrounds, with majors such as chemistry, chemical engineering, biology. However, we have something in common- we all are interested in synthetic biology and admire the concept of iGEM. At first, we were frustrated because of all of the details that need to be carefully accounted for, but after a lot of dedication , we observed that people are suffering HAI(Hospital Acquired Infection) these days. It can't be denied how crucial the whole environment is to this human being. Therefore, we invented a new product and named it “EcoLife", with its primary purpose being a air purifier. With this product, we are looking to provide a instrument alternative for those who pursue a healthy life.:::2019
