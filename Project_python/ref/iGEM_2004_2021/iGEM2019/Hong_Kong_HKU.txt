Hong_Kong_HKU:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineered Salmonella Typhimurium for enhanced drug delivery and cancer stem cell targeting:::Our project utilizes DNA nano-drug carrier (NDC), in combination of engineered Salmonella Typhimurium, in the treatment of liver cancer. In vivo synthesis of DNA NDC is achieved using Murine Leukemia and HIV-reverse transcriptase system in E. coli as developed last year. And the design of nanostructure consists of aptamers targeting nucleolin, cancer stem cell marker (EpCam) and also Salmonella surface antigens. It allows high specificity targeting of DNA NDC, also allowing the utilization of Salmonella as a motile vehicle to regions unreachable by diffusion in solid tumour. Salmonella Typhimurium is engineered to increase flagellar production with flhDC transcription factors, to increase tumour accumulation and motility. It is also used to transport vector encoding artificial miRNAs upon cell invasion, to increase drug sensibility of cancer stem cell. A co-culture system consisting of Salmonella and cancer spheroid culture is used to create accurate 3D tumour modelling, replacing the use of animal model.:::2019
