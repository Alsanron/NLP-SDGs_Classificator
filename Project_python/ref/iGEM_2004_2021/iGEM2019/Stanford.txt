Stanford:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Rolling the DiCE for the directed evolution of biological parts:::The current paradigm of part creation, characterization, and documentation is extremely rate-limiting for scientific discovery. The 2019 Stanford iGEM team envisions an alternative model for facile part creation where final genetic device performance necessarily conforms to initial design specifications. To make this future a reality, we focused on developing self-selecting systems (SSS): directed evolution platforms that selectively amplify the genotypes corresponding to desirable phenotypes. Specifically, we developed Directed Chassis-agnostic Evolution, or DiCE, a novel, easy-to-implement selection-based directed evolution platform built off Qbeta replicase, an RNA-based RNA polymerase, capable of evolving proteins in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we generated standard selection schema compatible with PREDCEL (Heidelberg 2017) to expand the range of synthetic biological parts that can be created by any SSS. Taken together, our work on SSS presents a foundational advance towards a future where part creation is easier, faster, and more accessible.:::2019
