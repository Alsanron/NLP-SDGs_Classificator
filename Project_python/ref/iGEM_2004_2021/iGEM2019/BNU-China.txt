BNU-China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Synthetic Leanness-promoting Intestinal Microbe (SLIM):::Obesity has become an increasingly severe health problem globally. While its relation to various diseases has been constantly discovered, few countries have succeeded in harnessing the deterioration of the problem. This year, BNU-China proposes to develop a synthetic intestinal microbe which promotes leanness by enhancing catabolism of both assimilated and unassimilated fat using two combined synthetic pathways, one leads to overproduction of acetic acid, which as a signal, promotes consumption of white fat tissue; the other enhances Î²-oxidation of excessive higher fatty acids consumed by human, which would otherwise be absorbed. A bilateral switch is put in control of the pathways, conferring the microbe an exquisite trait to express either pathway at an optimal time according to the changing chemical environment inside digestive track. Additionally, two safety modules are introduced: one enables the host to terminate the engineered bacteria whenever they want; the other prevents contamination of the outside environment.:::2019
