Wageningen_UR:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Xylencer - silencing Xylella fastidiosa:::A devastating plant-pathogen, Xylella fastidiosa, is spreading through the Mediterranean. This pathogen is wiping out economically important crops, including olives and grapevine, with no effective cure found yet. Currently, the containment methods for this disease are pre-emptively burning trees and using high doses of pesticides. Our team, Xylencer, develops an effective solution for this disease by using bacteriophage therapy for X. fastidiosa. To overcome current limitations, including UV degradation of bacteriophages, we design a protective carrier bacterium that produces bacteriophages upon sensing X. fastidiosa. Bacteriophages will lyse the bacteria, while simultaneously triggering a plant immune response with specific peptides, forming an alliance between plant and bacteriophage. In order to have the bacteriophage spread to all infected plants, we mimic X. fastidiosa's spread by fusing chitin-binding proteins to the bacteriophage capsid, facilitating their spread by insects. Using our modular approach Xylencer, we believe we can eradicate X. fastidiosa.:::2019
