Worldshaper-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Easy (blood) uric-acid monitering system:::Gout, generally induced by monosodium urate crystal deposition, is one of the incurable diseases for human now. The inefficiency faced by gout patients brought by regular blood uric acid test in hospital mainly attributes to the long waiting time for the results. Thus the ultimate goal of our project is to construct a portable, use-friendly blood test device that can be used at home. Briefly, our device was designed based on a uric-acid-responsive regulatory system, named as HucR regulatory system, with mCherry as the reporter protein. Using cellulose acetate membrane as the carrier, the HucR regulatory system was worked as expected. The results shown that the concentration of uric acid is inversely correlated with the intensity of the red fluorescence. We believe this project would open up a new horizons as a pioneer of simple-to-use home diagnostic test kit.:::2019
