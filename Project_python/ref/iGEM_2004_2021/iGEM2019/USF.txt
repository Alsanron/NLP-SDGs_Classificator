USF:::North America:::United States:::Energy(P):::Collegiate:::Withdrawn:::Expanding the Photosynthetic Range for Biofuel Production:::Our project seeks to improve the cost efficiency of biofuel by increasing the photosynthetic range of productive algae. To do this, we will attempt to introduce genes from infrared-utilizing cyanobacteria into Nannochloropsis Gaditana in effort to boost the amount of energy available for biosynthesis. This project was in part inspired by the recent collaboration between Exxon Mobile and Synthetic Genomics that resulted in a double increase in lipid production by the same algae strain.:::2019
