NAU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mars:::Malaria parasite, with powerful invasive ability, can rapidly multiply and cause acute damage to the human body. It is widely known that mosquito plays host to malaria. Traditionally, people control malaria by killing mosquitoes using drugs. However, this may give birth to drug-resistant mosquitoes. In the meanwhile, killing may jeopardize the stability of the niche of mosquitoes. Our project hopes to find a new way entitled “MARS” in synthetic biology to control malaria. We engineer the symbiotic bacteria Serratia sp., which stably colonize in the mosquito’s midgut, to produce various anti-plasmodium peptides and kill the plasmodium in their most vulnerable stage. We apply the polyprotein strategy in our project, and build gene passways to produce fusion effector protein and TEVp secreted by the alpha-hemolysin secretion system with different promotor combinations to acquire an ideal expression ratio with the aid from our modeling.:::2019
