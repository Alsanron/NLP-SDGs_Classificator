MichiganState:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Reduction of Greenhouse Gases via Genetic Modification of Methanotrophic Bacteria:::This project aims to generate a bacterial chassis capable of utilizing the methane produced within landfills, usually an anaerobic environment, and to convert the methane into an industrially-useful compound. To achieve this, we will genetically modify Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z, that converts methane gas to 2,3-butanediol, in order to oxidize methane under anoxic conditions. Further, a 3D printed bioreactor will be tested and modeled to grow the bacteria in biofilms to be cultivated in landfills. A byproduct, formate, can build up in the bioreactors, acidifying the environment and potentially impairing biofilm growth. To prevent this, a formate biosensor will be engineered, causing cells to fluoresce when concentrations are high. We plan to limit plasmid transfer by using a modified toxin-antitoxin system. Alongside our outreach efforts, our project has aimed to increase efficiency and safety of implementing an engineered methanotrophic bacteria into natural environments.:::2019
