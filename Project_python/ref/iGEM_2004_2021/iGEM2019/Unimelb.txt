Unimelb:::Asia:::Australia:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Withdrawn:::Cell Surface Glutamate and GABA detectors:::We are developing glutamate and GABA bacterial biosensors by modifying the iGluSnFr and iGABASnFr proteins developed by Marvin et al. (2013, 2019). These proteins consist of a domain that binds the target ligand and an associated fluorescent domain that becomes activated upon binding. The original sensors developed by Marvin et al. also contain sequences to facilitate expression on the surface of mammalian cells. We intend to modify these by replacing the eukaryotic localisation signal and transmembrane anchor with bacterial equivalents. To this end we have selected the truncated from of a bacterial Ice Nucleation Protein that acts as both a membrane anchor and a localisation signal. The motivation for producing these biosensors is to produce a proof of concept system for cheaply measuring serum GABA and Glut concentrations in a clinical context, since the ratio of these two biomarkers is diagnostic of early neurological deterioration following a stroke.:::2019
