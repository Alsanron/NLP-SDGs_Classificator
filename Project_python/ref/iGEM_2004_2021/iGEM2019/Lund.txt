Lund:::Europe:::Sweden:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Investigation in toxic metal remediation using genetically modified probiotics:::Toxic metals cause various health problems to our population. We propose to remedy long-term poisoning with Prodeacc - a genetically modified probiotic bacteria absorbing and accumulating toxic metals for you. By introducing proteins found in Cupriavidus metallidurans and E. coli K12 to a probiotic chassis, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, our transgenic bacteria could accumulate arsenic and lead. As shown in our model, this has the potential of relieving the user from harm caused by the toxic metals. The following proteins were inserted into a pUC19 plasmid and used for the accumulation of lead: pbrD, pbrT, alongside a T7 and Tac promoters. For arsenic, the following proteins were used: arsR, a fusion of arsR and MBP (maltose-binding protein) protein, alongside a T7 and Tac promoters.:::2019
