Northwestern:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Building an Educational Kit for Visualizing UV-induced DNA Damage in E.Coli:::As a result of various ozone-depleting substances progressively damaging our planetâ€™s atmosphere, UV exposure from sunlight is at an all-time high, resulting in an increased incidence of skin cancer in many populated areas. To increase the awareness of the potential health risks of extended UV exposure, we developed an educational kit that can visualize UV-induced DNA damage. Specifically, we utilized a global DNA repair mechanism, called the SOS response, which can be activated by a type of DNA damage known as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Upon exposure to sunlight, the kit produces GFP via a UV-inducible promoter that is found in the SOS response pathway. An educational kit incorporating this low-cost and easy-to-use biosensor teaches students about the risks of UV exposure and how biology can be engineered to illustrate the impact of these issues.:::2019
