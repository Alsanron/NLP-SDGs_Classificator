UGA:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering an Inherent Resistance to Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in Peanut Plants:::Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a highly toxic metabolite that is known to contaminate peanut crops and is responsible for a number of health complications within Georgia. An inducible expression system that can isolate aflatoxin affected crops was engineered using the Gal4/UAS system and single-chain variable fragments (ScFvs). Gal4 is a transcriptional factor that binds to an upstream activating sequence (UAS), which in turn drives the expression of a downstream gene. The primary gene of interest was BS3, an apoptotic initiator derived from C. annuum. The binding and activating domains of Gal4 were each fused to a unique ScFv that is specific to AFB1. Upon exposure to AFB1, each ScFv will bind to AFB1 and allow Gal4 to induce indirect expression of BS3. All in all, the Gal4/UAS system is a novel idea in the field of plant pathology and holds great potential to enhance peanut production within Georgia.:::2019
