QDHS_Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in pesticide detection:::When farmers spray phosphate fertilizer on crops, the excess will leach to the underground, contaminating the water and resulting eutrophication which threatens many lives. Fertilizer pollution spreads globally, especially in developing countries where agriculture still holds economic dominance, although some countries have started to deal with the problem. We find that acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme which catalyzes the reaction converting P fertilizer to phosphoric acid. Therefore, we can use acetylcholinesterase to measure the concentration of Phosphate in water by detecting the level of PH. Our goal in this research is to produce acetylcholinesterase by bioengineering. We insert the ACHE gene in mouse into multi-clone vector pGEX-4T-1 with restrictive enzymes PluTI and BspQI, and then fuse it with E.coli. After expressing AChE, we assembly it into a PH device which corresponds P-fertilizer level with PH. In this way, people could learn the level of fertilizer pollution in water.:::2019
