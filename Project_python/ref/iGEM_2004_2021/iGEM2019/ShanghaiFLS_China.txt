ShanghaiFLS_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::The Optimization of the Metabolic Pathways of P.pastoris in Medicine Production via Methanol Fermentation:::Greenhouse gases can be converted into single carbon compounds, and engineered Pichia pastoris, a type of methylotrophic yeast, is capable of converting methanol into medical compounds such as insulin and lovastatin. However, in such P. pastoris, the metabolism of methanol is highly specific and results in significant oxygen consumption and heat generation, which have limited its industrial applications. We aim to address this issue by maximizing the methanol conversion rate in P. pastoris by re-engineering its homogenous circuits expressing the transcription factors that would up-regulate the expression of AOX1, the protein allowing it to metabolize methanol. Our preliminary results have demonstrated that one of our constructs does achieve an up to 41% increase in the expression level of the reporter gene GFP. We also validated our design by building a mathematic simulation of an industrial setting.
