Amazonas-Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BeliE.V.E. - an Engineered Vehicle to End-cancer:::One of the current applications of synthetic biology is to turn organisms into living therapeutics. In this context, reprogrammed cells emerge as powerful vehicles for drug delivery. We are engineering a robust, interchangeable and modular framework composed by an AND logic gate suitable for multiple tumor microenvironment inputs (e.g., hypoxia AND high levels of lactate), as predicted by our model. As proof of concept, we genetically engineered E. coli Nissle 1917 to quantify the AND logic gate dynamic range. We envision EVE driving the production of antitumoral payloads of interest. Also, we built a low-cost and open-source reproducible CO2 incubator to help both our and other teams in cell culture. In Human Practices, EVE represents our desire to understand people, seeing them beyond their diseases. Our project aims to offer a framework to overcome the current challenges of conventional cancer therapy. Recognize. Reprogram. BeliE.V.E.:::2019
