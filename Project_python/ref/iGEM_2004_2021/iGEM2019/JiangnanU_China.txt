JiangnanU_China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Terminator of E. coli Phage:::Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used bacteria in biological laboratories and microbial fermentation industry. However, in practical application, phage infection is often encountered, which affects the process of biological experiments and causes huge economic losses. Therefore, we aim to construct a phage-resistant strain of Escherichia coli by combining two biological component circuits. In Escherichia coli BL21, we achieve absolute resistance to specific phages through phage inducible promoter PA and PB, as well as resistant protein components antP and toxic protein components kilP. At the same time, we used fluorescent protein genes gfp and mCherry to alarm phage infection at different periods and monitor the status of phage infection strains in real-time. With our genetic circuitry, E. coli has a longer-term application in laboratory experiments and fermentation production, and can produce stably without interference from phage in the fermentation production of γ-aminobutyric acid, β-aminobutyric acid, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, etc.:::2019
