UESTC-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::An Expired Drug Solution:::According to the survey, 79% of households have expired drugs. In areas where waste sorting is carried out, expired drugs are classified as hazardous waste, and the treatment methods are still landfill and incineration, which still pollute the environment. In areas where waste separation is not implemented, expired drugs are treated together with household waste, and the damage to soil and water can not be ignored. The presence of expired drugs in sewage can lead to increased antibiotic resistance of many microbial strains in sewage. How to effectively treat expired drugs has become a problem that needs to be solved. Therefore, we designed an expired drug recycling bin, taking the most commonly used antibiotic ciprofloxacin as an example, using engineering E. coli to degrade expired drugs into environmentally friendly substances, and then using mathematical modeling to design points in the city to form an expired drug solution.:::2019
