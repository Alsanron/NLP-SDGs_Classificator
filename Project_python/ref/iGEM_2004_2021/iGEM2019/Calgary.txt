Calgary:::North America:::Canada:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::yOIL: an all-encompassing solution to the green seed problem:::Excess chlorophyll in canola seeds, an issue known as green seed, requires expensive and harmful methods during oil processing. iGEM Calgary designed a protein-based emulsion system as an alternative to the current environmentally-detrimental method. A chlorophyll binding protein was emulsified and used to remove excess chlorophyll from green oil. Phase diagrams and molecular dynamic simulations were used to optimize our emulsion system, and genetic algorithms were used to engineer the chlorophyll binding protein to have improved binding capabilities and stability. Captured chlorophyll was repurposed into pheophorbide, a cytotoxic photosensitizer with antifungal properties. A novel universal spacer was developed via interaction and homology modelling, which enabled purification of the large plant enzymes required for the production of pheophorbide. This project addressed multiple challenges found within canola production and processing. Our solution has the potential to improve current practices and potentially introduce a new market stream for the canola industry.:::2019
