Lubbock_TTU:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Exploring E. coli as a Platform Strain for the Biosynthesis of Tropane Alkaloids:::The vast chemical diversity of plant specialized metabolites has provided a historically long-standing avenue for humankind to access natural products with pharmacologically active properties. Many plants that were domesticated during ancient times for their medicinal and psychoactive value are currently known to produce nitrogenous bicyclic phytochemicals classified as tropane alkaloids (TAs). Examples of notable TAs include atropine and scopolamine, which are listed as essential medicines by the World Health Organization, and even the notoriously addictive stimulant, cocaine. The commercial demand for TAs is largely supplied through plant extraction as the enzymes responsible for the formation of tropinone, an intermediate metabolite central to the biosynthesis of many TAs, were controversial for nearly a century. With the recent elucidation of these enzymes and the increasing global demand for medicinal TAs, we investigate the potential of E. coli as a platform strain for the biosynthesis of TAs.:::2019
