Baltimore_BioCrew:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Gut Wars:::Antibiotics save lives by killing pathogens, but often kill non-pathogenic gut bacteria as well. These bacteria digest food, help the immune system, synthesize vitamins, and produce neurotransmitters. Antibiotics decrease bacterial diversity by 25%, which can lead to a range of health issues and increase the risk of future infection. Microbiome diversity is regulated and encouraged by Mucus Associated Functional Factors (MAFFs), a protein produced by B. theta bacteria. Antibiotics kill B. theta, thereby reducing MAFF production and creating a cycle that prevents a healthy gut. By introducing the MAFF-producing gene onto a plasmid, inserting this into E. coli, and then transplanting the E. coli into the gut, a microbiome could be regrown. Our bacteria will have a short life expectancy because of our xylose-dependent antitoxin, which inhibits growth once the xylose is metabolized. The MAFFs produced by these regulated E. coli will promote the reestablishment of a healthy microbiome.:::2019
