BOKU-Vienna:::Europe:::Austria:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mycolactone Diagnostics - A Novel Approach to Diagnose the Neglected Tropical Disease Buruli Ulcer:::Buruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease which manifests in ulcers and may lead to lasting skin and bone deformations unless detected and treated early. Current diagnostic methods are time-consuming and barely available at the point-of-care in many endemic regions in Africa and the Americas, as they require sophisticated laboratory equipment and highly trained personnel. As a solution, we propose a novel, easy-to-use diagnostic test detecting mycolactone, the toxin excreted by the causative agent Mycobacterium ulcerans, in a patientâ€™s sample. The molecular mechanism is based on a riboswitch which, in the presence of mycolactone, specifically induces chromoprotein expression in an engineered Escherichia coli strain, generating a simple visual read-out. As an alternative to GMOs, the test may also be used as cell-free system. After expert consultations, an instruction manual was designed to ensure proper and safe use, thus rendering the test a quick and efficient tool for diagnosing Buruli ulcer.:::2019
