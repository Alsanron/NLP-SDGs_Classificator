UC_Davis:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Lighting the way: developing foundations for open-access mammalian synthetic biology for iGEM and beyond.:::Mammalian synthetic biology promises a future built on advances in personalized medicine, modeling, and manufacturing. However, fewer than 5% of iGEM teams have used mammalian cells in their projects. We examined the factors hindering the accessibility of mammalian synthetic biology, focusing on challenges that limit the rapid prototyping of synthetic systems. Specifically, we worked to simplify the process of characterizing mammalian parts and devices. Through our work characterizing the transfer functions of endogenous gene expression for light-activated CRISPR/dCas9-based effector (LACE) systems, we developed generalizable methods and tools that have application for LACE and other device classes. Our toolkit allowed us to make quantitative comparisons between multiple device variants and to explore the contextual dependence of device function in different cell lines and for multiple genes. We share our methods and propose these foundational advances may help accelerate the spread of mammalian synthetic biology throughout iGEM and beyond.:::2019
