Nanjing-China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A new method for the removal and reutilization of Phosphate in the sewage:::Our team is trying to figure out an innovative way to process the sewage and therefore generate energy for the growth of crops. We develops a simple solo medium-copy plasmid-based polyphosphate kinase (PPK1) overexpression strategy for achieving maximum intracellular polyphosphate accumulation by environmental bacteria. In the inorganic experiments, we will find the suitable concentration of phosphate radicalï¼ŒpH, and mole ratio of ions involved in the synthetic reaction of struvite. In the engineering experiments, we will design an integrated waste water processing device, which can remove phosphorus from sewage, and utilize the engineered bacterias to release phosphorus in other areas to produce precipitate. In agricultural experiments, we will use our products as fertilizers, and compare them with chemical fertilizers.:::2019
