CCA_San_Diego:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::HORIZON 2.0: Clean Energy from Crude Oil Degradation:::Contamination of aquatic and terrestrial environments with crude oil is a global issue. Crude oil contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), compounds that are difficult to degrade and environmentally toxic. To combat these compounds, a novel methodology was designed for PAH and other hydrocarbon bioremediation from various catabolic pathways upstream of innocuous intermediates. Resulting intermediates are ultimately employed anaerobically to convert into dissolved hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen synthesis is also fueled by pathways that metabolize n-chained hydrocarbons. HORIZON 2.0 also utilizes pathways for the degradation of salicylate and phthalate, compounds that resulted from previous PAH degradation constructs but are unusable by E. coli. To modulate between the various conditions for degradation and synthesis, a positively regulated magnesium riboswitch and novel synthetic CRISPRi operators under riboswitch regulation were designed for use as synthetic operators. Ultimately, this project allows broad spectrum transformation of PAHs and other hydrocarbons within crude oil into usable energy.:::2019
