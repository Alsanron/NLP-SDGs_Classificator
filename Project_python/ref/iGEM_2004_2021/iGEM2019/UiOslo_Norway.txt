UiOslo_Norway:::Europe:::Norway:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioSol - A Solar Cell Using a Pigment Producing Bacterium to Catch Sunlight:::The increasing stress on the environment demands new innovative technologies to satiate the growing energy needs of our society. The aim of our project is to create a system that can harvest energy from the sun by utilizing genetically-modified Escherichia coli. The E. coli are made to produce lycopene by expressing three enzymes from the extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans. Lycopene, an intermediate in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, is a conjugated compound that can be excited by specific wavelengths. By coating the lycopene producing cells in TiO2 we can use them in a dye-sensitized, biogenic, photovoltaic device. The material used for these solar cells would have a significantly lower cost of production compared to current solar panels, and with the addition of other pigments could absorb a wide spectrum of light for the production of electricity. We hope that this system will complement other renewable energy sources in the future energy market.:::2019
