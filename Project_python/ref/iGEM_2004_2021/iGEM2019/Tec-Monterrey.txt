Tec-Monterrey:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Breathe-in:::Cystic fibrosis(CF) is a progressive genetic disease that causes de- generation of lung conditions and induces the proliferation of mul- tidrug resistant bacterial strains (MRBS). Combination of treatments with antibiotics and mucolytics has become an alternative for treate- ments against P. aeuroginosa, an opportunist pathogen that grows in the respiratory tract of CF patients and has become their principal cause of death. We present a conceptual pipeline for the discovery of antibiotics using a variety of whole-cell biosensors that, when co-cultivated with secondary metabolite producers, sense the presence of antibiotics and the possible chemical identification of such compounds, using a mi- crofluidic system coupled to a mass-spectrometer; as well as a new treatment using a neuraminidase as a mucolytic to reduce the viscos- ity of mucines in CF patientâ€™s lungs.:::2019
