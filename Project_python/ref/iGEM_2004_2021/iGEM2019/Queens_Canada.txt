Queens_Canada:::North America:::Canada:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Green Screen: Developing a Novel Biosensor for THC Detection:::Rapid detection of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is becoming evermore important, as legalization of marijuana increases globally. An affordable one-step immunoassay has been developed for rapid detection of THC. This proof-of-concept assay uses fluorescently labelled recombinant antibodies for THC detection, and lipophilic membranes for THC absorption. The use of fluorescently labelled antibodies allows for low detection limits and high specificity when determining THC concentrations; hence, it has applications in roadside testing, as well as measuring output for industrial THC productions. Detection levels of 0.1 mg/mL were distinguished form the background; however, improvements to the lipophilic membrane could increase the sensitivity.:::2019
