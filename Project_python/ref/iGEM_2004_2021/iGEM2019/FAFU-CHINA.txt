FAFU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Fossil Fuel -1s -1s, BioDiesel +1s +1s:::We use Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as the chassis organism and build a general platform in it to produce biodiesel. Our system can produce cheaper biodiesel. We search for several enzymes and transcription factors in the metabolic pathway of algae, which can increase the oil content and biomass. We construct the corresponding vectors and use electroporation technology to improve the expression of the corresponding genes and TF. We build a light-controlled system to promote the expression of downstream self-flocculating genes when algae receives a specific wavelength of light. With this system, we can collect microalgae at a specific growth period. In addition, we determined the concentration of domestic sewage suitable for engineering microalgae culture through sampling investigation and simulation experiment, and cultivated our algae in it. This can increase the biomass of microalgae and reduce the content of nitrogen and phosphorus in sewage, which further reducing the cost of sewage treatment.:::2019
