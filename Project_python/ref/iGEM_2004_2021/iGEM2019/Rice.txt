Rice:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Thermoplant: Automated design of RNA thermometers for controlling output of plant growth-promoting enzymes in rhizobacteria:::Recent changes in climate patterns pose an enormous threat to the agricultural industry. Increasing temperatures and lower soil water content systematically decrease crop yields. This project aimed to tackle this problem from the bottom up by engineering a common soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida, to overexpress plant growth-promoting enzymes under a temperature-dependent system. P. putida, with its known root interactions with Arabidopsis thaliana, was utilized to promote plant growth through the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, and trehalose synthase. A program that couples genetic algorithms and NUPACK was created to design and optimize low temperature RNA thermometers. These thermometers with melting temperatures around 30Â°C induced the translation of the enzymes to ensure optimal resource usage for the bacteria. Maximizing crop yields now will ensure better food availability and distribution in the future.:::2019
