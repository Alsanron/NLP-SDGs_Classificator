MADRID_UCM:::Europe:::Spain:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AEGIS: Aptamer Evolve for Global InSitu Sensing:::Waterborne infectious diseases kill thousands in developing countries every year. This project develops an affordable and easy-to-use early-detection system for cholera suited for such countries. Our technological base is aptamers: single-stranded DNA molecules engineered to interact with specific disease proteins. We integrate them into two kind of sensors: lateral-flow-analysis for ultra-low-resource areas, and electrochemical sensors for electricity-enabled areas. Furthermore, with our automated aptamer-discovery protocol (Robo-SELEX), we enable future targeting of different diseases. For characterizing the resulting aptamers We have also developed a deep-learning computational folding and an automatic kinetic characterization protocol. Disease-prevention have always a socio-political dimension. We have also undertaken on-the-ground research in Cameroon, together with local people and scientists, to identify the actual needs that must be addressed and adapting the design of the final sensor to them. Our project is both interdisciplinary and intercultural, which takes us further than the simple sum of our parts.:::2019
