Northern_BC:::North America:::Canada:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of a biosensor to detect opioid contamination of non-opioid recreational drugs:::Our team chose to take a harm reduction approach to address the opioid crisis affecting Canadians by building an opioid biosensor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that can be used to test non-opioid recreational drugs for opioid contamination prior to consumption. We intend for the system to ultimately activate a transcription factor that will turn on production of a chromoprotein, producing a visible color in the presence of opioid. Since the signaling pathway used is anticipated to generate tremendous signal amplification as it passes through the endogenous machinery of yeast, we expect to be able to detect trace amounts of opioid contamination. The development of a biosensor that is capable of detecting small amounts of a variety of opioids in what is believed to be a non-opioid drug sample will allow users to modify their behaviour, whether this includes discarding the drugs, using with others present, or utilizing a monitored injection service.:::2019
