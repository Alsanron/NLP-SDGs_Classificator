Potsdam:::Europe:::Germany:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::TherMaL.UP - Evolution of thermophilic proteins with a neural network-based approach:::Thermophilicity is a highly desirable protein property relevant for industrial and scientific applications. Predicting mutations needed to convey thermophilic qualities is very difficult which is why our project focuses on developing a neural network which models the thermostability of proteins and finds more heat resistant protein variants. We hope to reduce the amount of lab work necessary to create new proteins with different properties and thereby magnify the possible scope that directed evolution can offer. More concretely, we use existing data from databases like BacDive and train neural networks on around 7 million amino acid sequences to predict the optimal growth temperature of the host organism and then apply different methods to find more stable variants. In parallel to this, a directed evolution approach will be utilized in vitro to find thermophilic variants. Additionally, we will analyse and verify the proteins that the neural network has predicted in the lab.:::2019
