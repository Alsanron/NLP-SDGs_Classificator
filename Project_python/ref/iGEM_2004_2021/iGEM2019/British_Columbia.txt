Numerous rural and Indigenous communities depend on shellfish in their everyday diet and have deep cultural connections with it. Saxitoxin, a potent neurotoxin produced during HABs, accumulates in shellfish and has caused fatalities in Canada, leading to strict harvesting regulations. Despite this, current detection techniques are time-consuming and rely on expensive laboratory equipment. To overcome this, UBC iGEM is seeking to discover a novel saxitoxin-induced promoter for the construction of a biosensor. Our approach includes Substrate-Induced Gene Expression (SIGEX) and screening of a pre-existing E. coli promoter library. The project serves as a gateway for the development of accessible, on-site detection of shellfish toxins. This device can empower coastal communities, and encourage data collection for enhanced understanding of the impact that HABs have on our lives.:::2019
