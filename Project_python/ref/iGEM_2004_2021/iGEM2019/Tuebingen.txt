Tuebingen:::Europe:::Germany:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::GLP.exe - E.coli Nissle 1917 biosafety chassis with CRISPR/Cas3 kill-switch and Exendin-4 in Diabetes treatment:::We are developing E.coli Nissle 1917 as a microbial chassis that produces a drug for the safe treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The chassis will provide glucose-dependent Exendin-4 secretion, a GLP-1 analogue efficiently increasing insulin secretion and supporting weight-loss in diabetes patients. In silico-confirmed cell-penetrating peptides will be utilized to make the Exendin-4 available in the pancreas. Moreover, a novel CRISPR/Cas3-based kill-switch with environmental-sensing systems will be used for biocontainment of the chassis. To evaluate the robustness of our probiotic strain, our project aims to extensively characterize it via RNA-seq. Finally, the first metabolic model of Nissle is under development. Concerning human practices our project involves various knowledge transfer opportunities, public outreach and data collection, as well as an overt dialogue and intense collaborations with other iGEM teams. Overall, the aim of this project is to overcome the physical, emotional and financial burden of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.:::2019
