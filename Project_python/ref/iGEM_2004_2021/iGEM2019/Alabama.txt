Alabama:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Gemcitabine / CDD Knock-Out (GemCKO) to Mitigate Chemotherapeutic Drug Resistance Caused by Intratumoral Bacteria:::Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug used to treat pancreatic, breast, bladder, ovarian, and non-small cell lung cancer. Alabama iGEM explored a previously reported link between the intratumoral bacterial environment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma to confirm and characterize the direct consumption of gemcitabine by comparable bacteria such as some strains of E. coli. It has been shown that the production of a specific type of the cytidine deaminase (CDD) protein by these bacteria render the gemcitabine unusable to treat the target cancer. We constructed a plasmid and used it to knock out the cdd gene from E. coli BL21(DE3), and compared growth of knockout and wild-type strains. Degradation of gemcitabine by the wild-type strain was determined by HPLC. We further developed a suite of modular E. coli expression plasmids, with each plasmid component flanked by a unique restriction site, that will facilitate cloning in the future.:::2019
