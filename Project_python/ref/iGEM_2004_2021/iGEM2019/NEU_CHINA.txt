NEU_CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A biological system to alleviate intestinal inflammatory diseases and prevent potential colorectal cancer:::Our project is interested in utilizing genetically engineered Escherichia coli to relief symptoms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The engineered E.coli strain should include three characteristics, including precisely colonize in the inflammatory region; successfully express and secrete anti-inflammatory proteins; without any biological hazards or side-effects. Firstly, we designed several plasmid based-bio-sensors for detecting one of the IBD signals, nitric oxide. After a series of comparison, our experiments demonstrated that yeaR based NO sensor with the highest efficiency in E. coli Nissle 1917 strain. Secondly, we integrated two anti-inflammatory factors, interlukin-10 (IL-10) and myrosinase into the Yebf expression plasmid under the tunable-gain amplifier regulation. Lastly, for the biosafety concern, we designed the “kill-switch” system which based on the mazE-mazF system, a natural toxin system found in E. coli that enable to kill bacteria under the low temperature trigger, once the anti-inflammatory E. coli was excreted out of the gut.:::2019
