Sorbonne_U_Paris:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Bi[oil]ogical Factory:::Palm oil is the most widely used vegetable oil, with over 60 billion tons per year. However, its mass production has destructive consequences for the environment. Therefore, we want to demonstrate an alternative and ecological way of producing oil by developing a new chassis for the production of lipid compounds in a photosynthetic green microalga named Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We want to build our proof-of-concept by modifying this microorganism to produce palmitic acid (C16:0) and oleic acid (C18:1), which are the main components of palm oil. To this end, we will express enzymes from the african oil palm Elaeis guineensis in C. reinhardtii using the Golden Gate Modular Cloning (MoClo) technology. Moreover, we will implement the HiBiT technology created by Promega in the MoClo kit by standardizing and integrating it into the C. reinhardtii MoClo kit in order to allow for a quick and effective measurement of our enzymes expression.:::2019
