Mingdao:::Asia:::Taiwan:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Indoor Air Freshener 2.0:::Indoor air pollution could be worse than outdoor air. Thatâ€™s why people buy air purifiers at home. Yet, CO2 and VOCs cannot be eliminated by any current machine. Algae purification system is increasingly getting attention but with limited efficiency. This year, we improve the system significantly by combining a photobioreactor device and algae culture media supplemented with natural enzymes. We produce carbonic anhydrase (CA) to enhance CO2 dissolving rate, as well as CYP2E1 to break down chloroform and benzene. The resulting molecules can easily be taken up by algae. Our device sets up with a nano bubble generator, high power LED light, and CO2/O2 sensors to optimize photosynthesis and analyze air quality, and as small as a portable 1L water bottle. In addition, we used mathematical modeling to simulate the application in the real world. We believe it will be the most common air purifier in our life.:::2019
