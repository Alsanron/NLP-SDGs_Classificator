HK_SKHLPSS:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::NANO-TECHtrahedron: Using nano-tetrahedron to check for the probiotic concentration from food sample:::In iGEM 2017, our team successfully designed a DNA three dimensional nano-structure to detect the presence and concentration of H3N2 influenza mRNA biomarker. To further prove the ability of the DNA nano-structure, this year we used four DNA strands to form a DNA nano-structure to detect the presence and the concentration of Lactobacillus instead of just a gene fragment of a bacterium. We successfully designed nano- triangular bipyramid applicable to the bacterium using Tiamat. We then successfully detect the presence and concentration of bacteria by measuring its peroxidase activity.:::2019
