DUT_China_B:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bio-microrobot: A Light Driven Reinhardtti (BALDR):::Photoautotrophic biological cells are promising actuators to perform transportation and delivery tasks, due to smaller size, power-free and wireless communication. However, motions of these biological cells could not be precisely controlled, and direction-oriented movement has not yet been realized. To make the locomotion of the motile cells in a controlled way, here, we are intended to make the movement of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular eukaryotic green motile microalga, in a precisely controlled way. The movement of robotize Chlamydomonas is activated by blue fluorescence of Renilla Luciferase in vivo, which was controlled by red light through rational design of PhyB and Pif as signal-trigger. Our work expanded the spectral palette of light to control their motions, which may open a door for site directed-cargo delivery in microorganisms under customized controlled light as a microrobot, and this novel algal guiding system could also be used in biomedical applications in the future.:::2019
