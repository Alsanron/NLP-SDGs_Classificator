Mines:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Molecular Mining of Cadmium: Detecting and Binding Cadmium for Bioremediation:::Heavy metal contamination at current and former mining sites is a significant environmental and human health problem. Cadmium (Cd) is one of the commonly found metal contaminants, and due to the highly toxic nature, even minute amounts can cause loss of function of the kidney and liver and bone deterioration. We are developing a rapid and efficient cadmium sensing and binding system that is capable of detecting cadmium down to 10 Î¼M concentrations. When exposed to a minimum concentration of Cd, the E.coli cells express the green fluorescent protein (GFP). After Cd is detected, a metallothionein protein binds to it and sequesters it in the periplasmic space of the E. coli cell. We will present data characterizing the performance of this system. The engineered system can be used for remediation efforts to remove Cd from the environment and process it safely.:::2019
