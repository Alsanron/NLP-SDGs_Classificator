NCTU_Formosa:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Synthetic Biology-Based Mutagen Sensing system - E. Phoenix:::Gene mutation can lead to cancer in human cells, however nowadays the detection of mutation is time-consuming and difficult. Thus, this year NCTU_Formosa develops an easy-use mutation detection and prediction platform with an education kit. We named it E. Phoenix. First, E. coli expresses the suicide gene. Once the suicide gene is mutated, the population will rise, and the RFP signal will show by Quorum Sensing. Next, the growth curve analytic model can transform the signal into mutation frequency. We also built up a mutation frequency prediction model based on chemical structure. We can compare the detection result from our device with already known mutagens. After collecting our results, we design an education kit to provide a more understandable data presentation. Different results from different samples turn into the speed of racing cars. By comparing its rate, the public can compare mutation frequency among different testing objects easily.:::2019
