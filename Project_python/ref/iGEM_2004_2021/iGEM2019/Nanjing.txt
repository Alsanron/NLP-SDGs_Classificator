Nanjing:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Anti-Aphid Angiosperm: use cotton chitinase gene to resist pest invasion:::Our project uses agrobacteria to produce chitinase in tobacco leaves in order to help resist insect’s infection. Chitin is the composition of insects’ exoskeleton and digestion tract. Chitinase can decompose chitin and hence reduce insect infection. This method can be used as a “green pesticide” which doesn’t damage the environment. The agrobacteria can transfer part of its plasmid into plant genome, which is the T-DNA. We inserted the chitinase gene into the vector pCAMBIA 2301 and adopted a binary system. We first let the vector amplify in E.coli DH5α. Then, we extracted the plasmids and inserted them into agrobacteria tumefacien GV3101. The bacteria can be injected into tobacco leaves and contribute to a brand new ability to defend against pests.:::2019
