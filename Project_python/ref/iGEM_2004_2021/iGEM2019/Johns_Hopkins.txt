Johns_Hopkins:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Withdrawn:::Producing Catechins in Non-Pathogenic E.Coli:::Catechins, molecules that boost cardiovascular health and prevent cancer, are found naturally in the camellia sinensis plant, which is used to make oolong tea and green tea. However, the concentration of catechins in these consumable products is quite low, and these beverages can have an unpleasant taste to some people. Therefore, we have created a genetically engineered non-pathogenic strain of E. Coli that can produce catechins. These catechins can be further purified and encapsulated to create a concentrated catechin supplement, which can be taken to boost cardiovascular health and minimize the risk of cancer. In order to create this catechin-producing E. coli, we utilized molecular biology techniques including PCR, gel electrophoresis, plasmid assembly, and high-performance liquid chromatography. We then tested our synthetically produced catechins on cancer cells in order to determine the antioxidant effects of the product.:::2019
