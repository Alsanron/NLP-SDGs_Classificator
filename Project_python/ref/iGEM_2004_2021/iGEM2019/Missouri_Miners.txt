Missouri_Miners:::North America:::United States:::Open:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Geneticist's Cell:::More than anything, the goal for our project was education. Genetic engineering is an incredible tool. However, it is often met with misunderstanding. We wanted to make genetic engineering more approachable. What better way to demystify the topic than by presenting it through familiar magic? Our plan is to develop a "House Cup", straight out of Harry Potter. We plan to develop four strains or "houses" of E. coli that secrete distinct quorum sensing signaling molecules. Another strain would then have receptors for each signaling molecule. In response to each signal, it would fluoresce a corresponding color. The House color most expressed wins the Cup! We are then presenting genetic engineering projects to several different groups to survey public knowledge on the topic. This will better our approach in providing pertinent information. Making genetic engineering approachable will ideally help anyone to make informed decisions about its place in our world.:::2019
