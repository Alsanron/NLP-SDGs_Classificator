Guelph:::North America:::Canada:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Developing an Antibiotic Biosensor as a Diagnostic Tool to Measure Tetracycline in Animal Products:::Contemporary use of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture has resulted in the sharp increase of drug-resistant bacteria. These resistant bacteria pose risks to human and livestock health, as commonly-used antibiotics become less effective for treating infections. Additionally, if animal products contaminated with antibiotics are consumed by humans, there is a risk that the consumer’s intestinal microbiota will be damaged or create their own resistant bacteria. In light of this, antibiotic detection and monitoring in the environment and in animal products are of very current relevance. In our project, we’ve used synthetic biology to develop a bacterial system that can sense tetracycline and respond to its presence by producing a non-toxic biological pigment. The resulting system produces a visible colour change after induction with water, dairy, or meat samples that contain tetracycline. This project lays the groundwork for the development of affordable and sustainable biosensors that can detect other antibiotics.:::2019
