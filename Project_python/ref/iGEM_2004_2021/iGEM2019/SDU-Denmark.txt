SDU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Conjugaid: Sensitizing Bacteria to Antibiotics by Bacterial Delivery of CRISPR/Cas:::In 2050, the number of deaths caused by infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria is predicted to exceed that of cancer (Oâ€™Neill, 2014). Existing therapeutic strategies cannot keep pace with the rapid progression of antibiotic resistance. To combat this challenge, innovative approaches must be developed. In collaboration with our local hospital, we have designed a plasmid-based CRISPR/Cas-system targeting antibiotic resistance in pathogenic strains of E. coli. This system is delivered using an E. coli vehicle, which transfers the plasmid to the target in the gastrointestinal tract by bacterial conjugation. Thus, our system can be used to sensitize pathogens to antibiotics. We believe that antibiotic resistance cannot be resolved by scientific solutions alone. Therefore, we aim to provide future generations with tools to creatively solve this global challenge. For this purpose, we have collaborated with students and teachers to develop a 5E model-based teaching material to supplement the Danish high school curriculum.:::2019
