WHU-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SilKeep:::This year, our team applied synthetic biology to the field of restoration of cultural relics. The aim of our project is to reinforce one piece of extremely precious silk relic, called "Plain Gauze Garment (素纱襌衣)". We would like to use BC (Bacteria Cellulose) secreted by engineered E.coli to reinforce the fragile area of silk relics. And to realize the accurate reinforcement, we design a light system which is cooperatively used with our hardware to reinforce the areas varying different degrees of fragility in irregular shape. Besides, we plan to assemble AMPs(anti-microbial peptides) and AOPs(anti-oxidant peptides) onto BC via biotin-streptomycin combination and CBD(cellulose binding domain) to realize a functional platform. Our project is meaningful for cultural inheritance owing to reduction of the protection cost and keeping the silk relics in a good condition.:::2019
