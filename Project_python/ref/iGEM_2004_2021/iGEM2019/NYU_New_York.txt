NYU_New_York:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Optogenetic Flavonoid Biosynthesis in E. coli:::Flavonoids are the largest phytonutrients found in plantae, well-known for their anti-cancerous, antioxidant components. A modern problem hampering access and usage of these molecules is difficulty in their isolation and quantification. This calls for optimization either through pathway engineering or possibly finding a new approach to isolate and extract these molecules. The NYU iGEM laboratory has approached this current problem from a biosynthetic perspective with a conjunction of optogenetics and engineering. We have inserted multiple pathways to induce and inhibit the production of our target flavonoids in E.coli. This will work by ligating the pathway genes with an inducible promoter that is activated by green light and repressed by red light in a matter of hours. The testing of the system is being performed in a bioreactor that follows industrial protocol and the extraction quantification will be tested by gas chromatography and High performance liquid chromatography.:::2019
