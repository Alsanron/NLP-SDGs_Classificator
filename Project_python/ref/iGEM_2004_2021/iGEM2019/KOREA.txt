KOREA:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Light Medicine: Optogenetics as an Epic Therapeutic Strategy for Parkinson's Disease:::We are currently developing a treatment for Parkinson's disease utilizing optogenetics. There were several difficulties in existing methods, such as drug tolerance and other side effects, so we pinpointed the spatiotemporal accuracy of optogenetics as a better solution. We are approaching in two ways. First, we fused protein consisting of opsin and DRD2(dopamine receptor). Light act as DRD2 agonist, thus it triggers the nigrostriatal pathway. The light increases dopamine signaling in PD patientâ€™s brain. Second, we regulated the expression of ABAT by using the CRISPR-dCas9 system. It prevents neurodegeneration by inactivating GABA, which transmits an excessive inhibitory signal. Moreover, this system is reversible so it is capable of resolving the problem induced by GABA deficiency. If this project is fully developed and applied, it can cure not only PD but also addiction, schizophrenia, and other neurodegenerative diseases.:::2019
