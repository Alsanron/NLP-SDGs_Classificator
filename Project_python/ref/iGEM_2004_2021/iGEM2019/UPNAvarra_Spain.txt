UPNAvarra_Spain:::Europe:::Spain:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Color is the new sensor:::Surface and groundwater quality deterioration is currently considered as one of the most alarming environmental problems, with major impacts on nature and human health. Some contaminants often found in potable water are heavy metals and nitrate, whose detection methods are complex, barely sensitive or cost-prohibitive. To solve these problems, our goal is to develop genetically engineered bacterial biosensors capable of quantifying cadmium, copper, mercury and nitrate concentrations in water samples. In each biosensor, the expression of a different chromoprotein is driven by inducible promoters. Hence, the biosensors achieve different color intensities depending on the pollutant concentration, which have been correlated to contamination levels by means of a mathematical study. In practical terms, our project clear the way for cheap pollutant detection kits development, composed of simplistic bacterial recipients where the water is to be poured and a phone App able to estimate the contaminants concentration from pictures of the recipient.:::2019
