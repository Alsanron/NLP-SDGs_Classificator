TU_Dresden:::Europe:::Germany:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DipGene â€“ Designing a Gene-Sensitive Paper Strip:::The identification of specific DNA sequences is needed in many contexts. Its applications range from testing for genetic diseases or viruses that integrate into the human genome to checking for the presence of antibiotic resistances in pathogens. Current state of the art methods are expensive, slow and require advanced technologies, which make genetic testing only accessible to researchers and not to most of humanity. We aim to provide a tool for detecting any nucleic acid sequence of interest from microbial samples and human cells. By combining a novel DNA extraction method with a newly designed fusion protein, it will be possible to obtain a visual color readout within minutes, which will indicate the presence or absence of the sequence of interest. Our method is designed to be utilized in the field, meaning it will be cheap, fast and easy-to-use and will not require any advanced technologies or electricity.:::2019
