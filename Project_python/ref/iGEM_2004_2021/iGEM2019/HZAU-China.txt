HZAU-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Smell Once More - A Mobile Smell Recorder & Player:::Can your mobile phone record and reproduce smells? At present, we can use mobile phones to record and replay videos and audios. But smells can't be recorded nor reproduced. In our project this year, we aim to design and build a machine composed of an E. coli assay. It can sense smell and store it by converting the smell signal to the accumulation of a small RNA, taRNA, which is accumulated via the positive feedback of the quorum-sensing system. When we want to smell once more, we just need to give another signal to the machine. Along with the accumulated taRNA, the signal will trigger the reproduction of the smell that the E. coli has sensed. The assay can record and reproduce a composite smell. In this way, we can always keep and reproduce the smell we want to remember.:::2019
