UIUC_Illinois:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::RoundDown: Engineering E. coli to Degrade Glyphosate, a Common Herbicide:::Glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine), the active ingredient in the popular herbicide RoundupTM, has been used extensively for over 25 years. Glyphosate has long been thought to degrade in the environment and pose no risk to human health. However, studies have recently shown that it persists longer in soil and the World Health Organization (WHO) classified it as a potential carcinogen in 2015. Given these potential risks, we sought to address the issue of environmental persistence by engineering E. coli to degrade glyphosate. Using Gibson cloning, we expressed glyphosate-degrading genes hph and C-N lyase in NEB 10-beta competent E. coli. Preliminary growth experiments showed engineered E. coli has higher glyphosate tolerance than the wild type. We are developing analytical methods to quantify glyphosate degradation. Our results suggest that glyphosate-degrading microbes may have a role in future glyphosate bioremediation strategies.:::2019
