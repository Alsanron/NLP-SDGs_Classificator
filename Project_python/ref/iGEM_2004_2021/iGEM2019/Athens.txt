Athens:::Europe:::Greece:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MEDEA: Machine-Enhanced Directed Evolution of Aptamers:::Nowadays, aptamers binding to specific targets are synthesized via SELEX. While effective, SELEX requires specialized equipment, trillions of initial oligonucleotides, and considerable time and cost. Therefore, our team proposes a novel mechanism of aptamer development, MEDEA - Machine Enhanced Directed Evolution of Aptamers. Our project aims to create a platform for the evolution of optimised aptamers, in E. coli cells. The evolution of our aptamer sequence is achieved through the interaction of three modules: the aptamer module, the mutagenesis module and the selection module. The aptamer module contains the aptamer sequence connected to a ribozyme. When the aptamer binds to its target, the ribozyme is activated, cleaving a Small Transcription Activating RNA. The STAR enables the transcription of an antibiotic resistance gene, used for selection. Mutagenesis is performed by the EvolvR system. The first step in our revolutionary pipeline is a software to create highly specific initial aptamers.:::2019
