CAU_China:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E.SPA：The E.coli cell factory that degrades Stalks and produces Astaxanthin:::China produces billions of tons of stalks per year. The crop stalks are abundant in cellulose, which would be an efficient carbon source. However, due to high utilization cost, low added value and low industrialization, the bulk of stalks are burned, which wastes resources and causes severe environmental pollution. Astaxanthin, one of the strongest antioxidants in nature, has broad market prospects and high commercial value, providing us with an ideal destination of stalks utilization. In our project, E. coli cells are engineered to consume cellulose as the carbon source and produce astaxanthin. To achieve this goal, three cellulose-degrading enzymes are anchored to E. coli cells’ outer membranes, while an astaxanthin synthesis pathway is constructed by transferring six additional enzymes to E. coli cells. In this way, we can transform stalks into astaxanthin in only one step, which may offer novel ideas for the reutilization and conversion of the biomass.:::2019
