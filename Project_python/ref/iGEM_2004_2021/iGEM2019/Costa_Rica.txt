Costa_Rica:::Latin America:::Costa Rica:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DiffEASY:::DiffEASY seeks for the creation of an innovative method to treat Clostridium difficile infection. This bacteria is an opportunistic pathogen with a broad antibiotic resistance and increased fitness. In Costa Rican hospitalarian system, C. difficile is considered an endemic disease. Current treatments against this bacteria are based on the use of antibiotics or faecal transplants. The latter, potentially disgusting for patients. As for the antibiotics, only few are effective and, after treatment, patients can present a recurrent infection. Therefore, there is an urge to find alternative treatments to CDI. We propose a system based on the insertion of genetic constructs into Lactobacillus casei, which will act as a probiotic. This organism will be engineered to acquire the capacity to receive a virulence signal (characteristic of C.difficile quorum sensing) and give as response the secretion of a highly specific lysis protein, avoiding the problems and displeasure of current treatments.:::2019
