Nantes:::Europe:::France:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bioâ€™Clock - Controlling gene expression over time with sugars:::E.coli consumes non-glucose sugars according to a specific hierarchy. We used this hierarchy in our project to monitor the duration of gene expression. To create our tool, we built four plasmidic constructs: each containing a sugar-responsive promoter (pLAC, pSRL, pARA or pRIB) upstream of a fluorescent reporter protein (GFP, CFP, RFP or YFP). With these constructs, we characterized the activity of the promoters in different conditions, varying the medium composition, the concentrations of sugars, the temperature and the pH. It allowed us to build a model predicting the amount of sugar needed in the medium to trigger gene expression at a certain time and for a certain duration. This fundamental tool could be used in a wide variety of fields such as administration of medicine.:::2019
