St_Andrews:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Stabilising Antibody Domains using Intramolecular Isopeptide Bonding:::Intramolecular isopeptide bonds are crosslinks found in the surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria, which confer significant structural, thermal, and proteolytic stability to the parent protein. By combining machine learning and rational design approaches, we sought to adapt this crosslinking to stabilise the antibody CH3 domain, with a view to creating long-lasting Immunotherapeutics. We also undertook a search of known protein structures to identify suitable candidate proteins for stabilisation via isopeptide bonding, and present this list for future work.:::2019
