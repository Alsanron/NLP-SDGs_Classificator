ULaval:::North America:::Canada:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A.D.N. : Air Detector for Nucleic Acids:::A.D.N., or Air Detector for Nucleic Acids, aims at improving air quality control in environments where pathogens control is critical, such as hospitals and nursing homes. The final product will create an all-in-one and easy-to-use device to collect and detect human viral pathogens in the air. Using synthetic biology tools, called Toehold riboswitches, we can identify genetic sequences that show the presence of pathogenic organisms, such as the poxvirus (chickenpox), the norovirus (gastroenteritis) and the measles virus. Our project includes the in silico design of these tools, the experimental proofs of concept and the resulting device. Using theses results, we will produce computational and experimental tools available to the community that will serve research purposes in the field of synthetic biology. Moreover, it will help further the knowledge on aerial viral transmission and contribute to the implementation of air quality control transmission procedures, thus preventing theses potentially deadly nosocomial infections.:::2019
