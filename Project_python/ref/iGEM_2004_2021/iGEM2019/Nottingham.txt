Nottingham:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NoTox: Making Botulism prevention cheaper and more effective.:::Our project aims to create Clostridium reporter strains that may be used to safely monitor the likelihood of botulinum neurotoxin production in food. Our proof-of-concept studies will use the non-toxic surrogate strain, Clostridium sporogenes, in place of the toxic Clostridium botulinum. This will be modified to produce a volatile reporter â€“ Acetone, under the influence of BotR (the transcription factor that controls production of Botulinum neurotoxin). The amount of acetone produced will, therefore, positively correlate with the amount of Botulinum toxin produced. This volatile solvent will be detected using a self-designed electronic nose, giving an accurate description of the level of toxin that would be produced. The system can then be used to test whether food packaging will support the production of botulinum toxin, serving as proof of concept that reporter-strain technology can be useful in botulism prevention.:::2019
