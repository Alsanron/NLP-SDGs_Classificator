SHSBNU_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::PROBE —— Plasmid Recorder of Biological Events:::DNA is a biological macro-molecule which can carry huge amount of information accurately, and this feature can be used to achieve data recordings in vivo. Our project aims to build a biological recorder that can monitor extracellular information and record it on DNA. Recombinase or CRISPR base-editor is used to target specific DNA addresses and generate mutations in a reporter gene, so the recordings can be quantitatively measured to infer intensity and duration information about the chemicals of disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Additionally, we designed a hardware for in situ biomolecular detection to monitor gastrointestinal health. This platform could enable more precise detection and could help improve the management and diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease.:::2019
