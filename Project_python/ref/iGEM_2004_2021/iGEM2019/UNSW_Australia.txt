UNSW_Australia:::Asia:::Australia:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Self-assembling protein scaffold for next generation Taxol production:::Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat many solid tumour cancers. It is obtained by debarking the yew tree species (Taxus Baccata), or through semi-synthesis from rare precursors in the tree’s needles. Both of these processes are unsustainable and contribute to the expensive production costs. Our project aims to address this in two ways. First, to enhance the rate of product formation by attaching rate-limiting enzymes of Paclitaxel semi-synthesis onto a hexameric protein scaffold called “Assemblase”. This spatial arrangement co-localises the enzymes, alleviating diffusion-related limitations of enzyme catalysis. The second component applies “Assemblase” to make the production of Paclitaxel from common analogues commercially viable. This reduces the need to log the yew tree, and lower reagent costs. In addition, the system allows for the recycling of co-products produced between the two pathways. Overall, our project aims to improve upon Paclitaxel manufacturing to meet the demands of the future.:::2019
