VIT_Vellore:::Asia:::India:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ARM'D UP: Antibiotic Resistance Mechanism Disruption Using Phages:::We have designed a genetic circuit to detect and specifically destroy multiple target bacterial species/strains containing antibiotic resistance gene using bacteriophage. Our genetic circuit employs two parts. The first part is the antisense RNA to determine the presence of antibiotic resistance gene. The second part is the J protein hopping mechanism. The antisense RNA is used to identify antibiotic resistant bacteria. On detection, a switch to the lytic life cycle of virus results in the disruption of the bacteria and release of more phages. In the absence of resistance gene, lysogenic state is maintained. Normally, a single virus can target a specific bacteria. J protein has been identified to play a crucial role in recognition of its bacterial target. Our system employs alternate promoters controlling the expression of multiple J protein. This allows the virus to have multiple bacterial targets.:::2019
