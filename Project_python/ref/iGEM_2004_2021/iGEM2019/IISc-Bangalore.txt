IISc-Bangalore:::Asia:::India:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SYNSHINE : Dynamic Optogenetic Regulation of Co-culture:::Co-culture has numerous applications in biology for studying natural or synthetic interactions between cell populations. In artificial or laboratory settings it is difficult to ensure the co-culture of species due to variety of factors : growth rate being the primary reason which results in one species out-competing the another. Our project aims to dynamically control the co-culture of E.coli and B. subtilis by using optogenetics. Optogenetics provides precise spatio-temporal resolution which overcomes the limitations of existing co-culture techniques(i.e. : Quorum Sensing, Auxotrophic cross-feeding etc.) .The hardware component of our project measures the ratio of population at regular intervals and utilizes lasers to regulate the growth of the species.:::2019
