UESTC-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioMaster 2.0:::Synthetic biology desiderates a gene computer-aided design (Gene-CAD) system. BioMaster is dedicated to contributing a complete and comprehensive database, which is essential for the Gene-CAD. BioMaster integrated databases such as UniProt, STRING and GO on the basis of iGEM Registry to provide more comprehensive BioBrick information. Based on the version 1.0, BioMaster 2.0 has significantly stridden in three aspects: data integrity, searching accuracy and user friendliness. We doubled our main reference databases by adding KEGG, BRENDA and other enzyme-related databases. Considering the feature of sequence annotation, we adopted filtering strategy with novel model to enhance the accuracy of mapping among databases. In addition, we redesigned and reconstructed the website architecture and database structure, and established a weight algorithm for searching results recommendation. All endeavors make BioMaster 2.0 a more integrated and more user-friendly database, which provides synthetic biologists with stable data updating and search services in the long term.:::2019
