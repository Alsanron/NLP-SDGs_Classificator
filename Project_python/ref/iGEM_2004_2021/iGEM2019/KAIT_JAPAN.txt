KAIT_JAPAN:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Activation of the symbiosis between plants and mycorrhizal fungi:::About 80% of land plants have symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. This symbiotic relationship not only strengthens plant's resistant to diseases and droughts, but also promotes growth. Therefore, mycorrhizal fungi are expected to be used as agricultural materials. However, in modern agricultures, we only uses chemical fertilizers, which doesnâ€™t utilizes the symbiotic relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and plants. Recent studies have shown that mycorrhizal fungi rely on plants for palmitoleic acids and the fatty acid is essential for fungal growth. Therefore, we aimed to construct a bacterium which synthesize palmitoleic acids.:::2019
