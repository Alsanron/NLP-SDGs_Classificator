Our purpose is to detect the presence of microcystin, a hepatotoxin produced by Microcystis aeruginosa under certain conditions. Microcystin is synthesized nonribosomally via microcystin synthetase encoded by the mcy genes. We have constructed plasmids where, after the promoter region, mcy genes are replaced with GFP genes. We would like to transform the plasmids into M. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli using shuttle plasmids. Upon addition of the transformed bacteria to wild-type M. aeruginosa cultures, we expect that the inserted GFP genes will be transcribed due to cell-to-cell communication. By taking samples from the growing cultures, we can determine the algae concentration which microcystin starts to be produced at. For further studies, since its sequence is unknown, we are going to sequence the promoter of mcy genes of Microcystis flos-aquae, another species abundant in Hungarian lakes.:::2019
