MITADTBIO_Pune:::Asia:::India:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PEred: Solving plastic based menstrual waste crisis using synthetic biology.:::The aim of this project is to create a genetically modified bacterium that has the capability of releasing extracellular degradation enzymes to degrade polyethylene (PE) based sanitary pads. The bacteria will be engineered to sense K+ ions found after RBC lysis from menstrual blood would upregulate the expression of polyethylene degrading laccase enzyme and biofilm production CsgD gene. The proof of concept will be shown in Escherichia coli. Successful transformation of these genetic components can lead to a novel and eco-friendly way of dealing with colossal amounts menstrual waste produced each year.:::2019
