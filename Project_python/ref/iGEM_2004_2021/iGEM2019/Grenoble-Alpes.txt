Grenoble-Alpes:::Europe:::France:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::NeuroDrop, another reason to shed a tear?:::What can your tears tell about you? Joy, sadness, painâ€¦ What if they could tell so much more? Tears are often neglected as potential diagnostic fluids. However, in addition to their advantageous accessibility, they are unexpectedly rich and contain lots of biological materials. Due to the close spatial proximity of the lacrimal glands and the cranial nerves, an overview of tear composition captures also the pathophysiological changes in the central nervous system. Thus, even if research in tear fluid biomarkers is at an early stage, tear fluid sampling may become a non-invasive and non-painful technique to diagnose patients with neurodegenerative disorders. NeuroDrop aims to demonstrate that the detection of small amounts of biomarkers is possible in small volumes, like tears for example. This is achievable with an innovative synthetic biosensor, coupled with a smart hardware device, enabling sensitive detection in a few microliters.:::2019
