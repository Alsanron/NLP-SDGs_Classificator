Rotterdam_HR:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Health Risk Detection Kit (HRDK):::Imagine that you're so sick that you can't leave your bed. Or that you have anxiety for the doctor or even physical impairments are making it impossible to go to the doctor. You have to take a medical test in order to know what kind of disease your have. We got the solution! Our system works with aptamers that are specific to detect a certain target. The aptamers are bonded to zinc finger targets. The zincfingers are attached to the split TEV enzyme. When the aptamers detect a target, the whole system starts to come together. The two TEV (N and C TEV) will form one TEV enzyme and B-lactamase will become active after TEV has cleaved of the fused inhibitor. If B-lactamase is active, a color change from yellow to red will occur due to activity on the Nitrocefin compound. This means a positive result.:::2019
