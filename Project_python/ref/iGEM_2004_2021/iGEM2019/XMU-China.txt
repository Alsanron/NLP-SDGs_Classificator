XMU-China:::Asia:::China:::Open:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Re_Gone with the Wind:::The far-reaching novel "Gone with the Wind" depicts the progress of change about a couple from loving each other to hurting each other, which coincidentally contains the four relationships between the bacteria we'd like to show this year. We split the "cooperative" genes--cenA, cex and bgl1A, which are capable of degrading cellulose, and respectively transform them into two kinds of bacteria so as to help these bacteria survive better under the cellulose situation. At the same time, the two types of bacteria carry different "aggressive" genes--Colicin E1 and Colicin N, who would start the period of expressing proteins due to the induction caused by different inducers and consequently harm each other. By designing genetic circuit of different relationships, the ultimate aim of us is to find the possible applications for synthetic biology in sociology.:::2019
