RDFZ-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Fragrance Library:::Fragrance generating parts are becoming more and more demanded in iGEM projects, as well as manufacture industries. While identifying that previous parts introduced by past teams were barely re-used, or integrated, thus we focus to build a library of fragrance-generating genes, in order to give better access with higher clarity, and reduce unnecessary time lost to those who may concern. The library will include about 30 coding sequences encode enzyme yielding fragrant substances from iGEM projects, constructed on vector psb4c5. Necessary information of parts will be added based on our own characterization results, as also 5 new parts will be included in the collection, for expression phenyethyl acetate, production route of Ehrlich pathway. Molecules are detected through GC/MS, to validate success of expression of each part. Also, we deem that cell free system can be used for educational purposes, as we apply our project on it for public engagement.:::2019
