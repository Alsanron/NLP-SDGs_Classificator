Tongji_China:::Asia:::China:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::IR 2.0: Indigo Revolution 2.0:::Indigo is a dye originally extracted from plants, commonly used to dye denim, the use of it dates back 6,000 years. However, plants cannot produce enough indigo for human. To fulfill the expanding demand for indigo, chemical synthesis was developed in the 20th century; this is what we call "the first indigo revolution(IR 1.0)." As time goes by, we come to realize that the new procedure to produce and use indigo is creating too many pollutions. China is the largest indigo supplier in the world, as its environmental law become stricter, local enterprises are facing challenges on the increasing environmental cost. We are trying to use biosynthesis to solve both environmental and cost problems. Based on the work of 2013 iGEM team Berkeley, we have designed an improved biosynthesis pathway to produce indican instead of indigo and trying to demonstrate it in an high-tryptophan-production E.coli strain.:::2019
