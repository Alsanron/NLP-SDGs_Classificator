UniGE-Geneva:::Europe:::Switzerland:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Fluosphera:::The replacement of animal testing by alternative in vitro methods is encouraged by the World Health Organization and the US Food and Drug Administration. However, this is a challenge for laboratories because current in vitro cell cultures poorly reflect the physiological organization of tissues. This has led to poor clinical translation, because drugs appearing efficient in vitro finally fail during in vivo trials. We believe there is an urgent need to improve in vitro drug testing to better simulate the in vivo physiology of animal models. Therefore, we created a cell culture toolbox called “Fluosphera” (provisional patent filed) that is capable of measuring the effects of drug compounds on a palette of biological activities with physiological relevance. With Fluosphera, we aim to improve in vitro drug testing by reducing the reliance on animal experimentation, as well as increasing the efficiency and accuracy of drug screening.:::2019
