Sao_Carlos-Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Astroshield: expanding the frontiers of life:::Mars is a prime destination for humanity to settle down, but the planet is dominated by a high incidence of radiation. The establishment of a colony there requires overcoming several challenges, including the need for in situ food and energy production. To solve these problems, we have engineered a fermenting yeast able to amass melanin on its surface to become resistant to ultraviolet radiation using a yeast display consisting of the protein Aga2 and the peptide 4D, which has a high affinity for melanin, that provides protection against ultraviolet radiation, since melanin is known to absorb this kind of radiation. This technology could also improve fermenting processes on Earth, considering sugar-alcohol plants lose much of their yeast in bioreactors due to contamination. Therefore, the implementation of an ultraviolet sterilization process with a resistant yeast would be profitable to this industry. A glucose-based Kill Switch was developed for biosafety issues.:::2019
