Prompt detection of Borrelia infection is crucial for effective treatment. Quick point-of-care detection of the pathogens in an extracted tick is therefore important. To solve this problem, our team proposes a portable biosensor device that can detect the presence of Borrelia spp. in ticks - LymeExpess. It comprises tick homogenization followed by detection of pathogen-specific DNA motifs. The detection is based on using specially engineered dCas proteins from various organisms fused with split domains of beta-lactamase. The dCas complexes target the complementing split domains to the nearby DNA locus allowing for the fully functional reporter protein to be formed. The products of the colorimetric reaction catalyzed by the protein are detected with an embedded spectrophotometer. This yields an easy to use, cost competitive and quick testing device that can be used even in field conditions.:::2019
