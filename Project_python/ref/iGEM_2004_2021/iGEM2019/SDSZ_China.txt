Our team designed a biosynthetic system that effectively detects bacteriophages in fecal polluted samples by inserting sequences of firefly luciferase and polyphenol oxidase in pET 28a and pET 30a vectors. After adding appropriate substrates to LB medium, enzymatic reactions occur when cell lysis takes place due to phage attack, and expressed enzymes leak from lysed cells to interact with their according substrates. Fluoresce and observable color change of the enzymatic reactions will then be tested and recorded for identification of the sample’s phage density, and thus the tested sample’s degree of pollution can be indicated. To avoid false negative responses, our team further inserted sequences downstream to express 2-Phenylethanol, emitting scent which acts as expression indicator that will not hinder luminescence detection.:::2019
