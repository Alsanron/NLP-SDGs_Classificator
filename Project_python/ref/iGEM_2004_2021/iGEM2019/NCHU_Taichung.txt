NCHU_Taichung:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Making Cloud out of Microbe: Strategy for Climate Regulation through Microbial Dimethyl sulfide:::Though earth has been suffered from global warming, the strategies for moderating the phenomenon are still lacking. On the other hand, as it has been suggested that the effects of Dimethy-sulfide-derived aerosols provide a global climate feedback loop for climate cooling, while marine coccolithophore was found to produce dimethyl sulfide for forming cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and accelerate clouds formation. Accordingly, we engineered a bacterial to express a novel DMS producing pathway to make clouds. We also optimize the system to let the bacterial performs carbon fixation capability. Making clouds out of engineered microbe could have better performance than algae do. We expect that this can efficiently release the tension of global climate extremes and solve the problem of water deficiency and dramatically cooling atmospheric temperatures as well.:::2019
