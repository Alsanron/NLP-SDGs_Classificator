In our project, we developed a tool that aims to expand the repertoire of bacterial species and broaden the range of substrates and environmental conditions which is currently used in synthetic biology. Sci-Phi 29 is a tool used to express genetic circuits independently of the bacterial host. Orthogonal replication of an exogenous DNA molecule is performed by the phi29 bacteriophage DNA replication system based on only four proteins. Furthermore, we developed a predictable and transferable expression system across multiple bacterial species. Our approach is based on an incoherent feed forward loop that ensures independence to DNA copy number and is robust to transcriptional and translational variations Sci-Phi 29 is a versatile platform to further explore the bacterial diversity providing new opportunities for the advancement of synthetic biology.:::2019
