Hangzhou_WestLake:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Engineering synthetic riboswitch for detection of polychlorinated biphenyls:::Riboswitches are dynamic RNA molecules that recognize a variety of analytes found in cells such as metabolites or ions. Most riboswitches bind to their corresponding analytes and that invoke a conformational switch that subsequently regulates the expression of the downstream genes. This project explores the design and application of synthetic riboswitch that is capable of detecting environmental contaminants in resource-limited settings. As a proof-of-concept design, we will focus on detecting PCBs, a group of manmade aromatic chemicals that had been widely used in many industrial processes. We will insert a previously discovered PCB aptamer either into the 5â€™-UTR of a bacterial reporter gene or downstream of the start codon. Aptamer binding to PCB will lead to its structural switching that leads to enhancement or reduction of gene expression. Readouts can be a reporter protein or the migration of bacteria to access the efficiency of the proposed system.:::2019
