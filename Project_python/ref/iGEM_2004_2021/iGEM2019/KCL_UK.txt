KCL_UK:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::An investigation of the fine-tuning gene expression in E.coli to advance gene therapy applications:::With the development of gene editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, TALENS and Zinc finger nucleases gene therapy has become sophisticated enough to be clinically applied. Multiple gene therapy delivery systems are currently available, including viral vectors, but their clinical use is impeded by the capacity of these delivery vehicles. In addition to these gene editing technologies, RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression is another widely used application for gene therapies. The aim of our work was to investigate the fine tuning mechanisms for gene expression and synthetically engineer bacterial short RNAs to precisely regulate protein translation. We measured the level of the GFP protein fluorescence in E.coli with each sRNA BioBrick we created and have demonstrated that the gene expression level can be sufficiently regulated. Our molecular constructs and approach can be used to regulate the ratio of viral capsid proteins to advance novel gene therapy applications.:::2019
