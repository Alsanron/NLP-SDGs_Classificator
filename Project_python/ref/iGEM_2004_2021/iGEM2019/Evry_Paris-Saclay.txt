Evry_Paris-Saclay:::Europe:::France:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::FAT and FABULOUS:::Fat is not so bad. In fact, it can be fab! Fatty acids were primordial constituents of the earliest cell and continue to play key roles in all cellular life today. It is not surprising then that fatty acids, particularly unsaturated ones (think ‘omega’), are widely used in the pharmaceutical, agrifood and cosmetic industries. However, their large-scale production is giving rise to many environmental challenges, especially as our planet faces the threat of climate change. Our team is interested in the production of medically-relevant Conjugated Linolenic Acids (CLnAs), which is a class of rare fatty acids with three conjugated bonds. In this project, we develop a launchpad for their bioproduction using the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, a powerful chassis organism, whose metabolism is naturally poised for lipid production.:::2019
