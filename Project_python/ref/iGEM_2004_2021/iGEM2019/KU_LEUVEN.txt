KU_LEUVEN:::Europe:::Belgium:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::OCYANO - The development of two low-input photosynthetic systems for sustainable protein production:::Traditional biosynthesis platforms such as E. coli and yeast require external energy supplies, commonly in the form of sugars or starch. Besides the economic cost associated with these energy sources, such systems are often not considered durable. Indeed, the production processes of sugars and starch are energy inefficient and farmland intensive. To circumvent these issues, photosynthetic systems like cyanobacteria and algae have been gaining increasing interest for biosynthetic purposes as they require only light and CO2. With our project, OCYANO, we present two new cyanobacterial technologies for protein production. The first design comprises the production and secretion of proteins in an ultra-fast growing cyanobacterium. The second system relies on a cyanophage for the conversion of its hostâ€™s biomass to the protein of interest. Along with wet-lab exploration of these platforms, the economic and ecological relevances of both systems were investigated and compared to state of the art biosynthesis platforms.:::2019
