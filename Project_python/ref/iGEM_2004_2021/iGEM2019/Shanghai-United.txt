Shanghai-United:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::The characterization protein and early diagnosis of cervical cancer:::All women are at risk of cervical cancer which has become a leading cause of womenâ€™s death. Although precancerous treatment can markedly lower mortality rates, they are still high worldwide due to limited access to cervical cancer screening. Here we demonstrate specific protein expression variations related to NFX1 over-expression, a gene found to be closely associated with cervical cancer. Hela cells were either injected with empty vectors, or plasmids containing NFX1 and GFP genes. After they fully expressed inserted genes, we ran Western Blot, IP MS, and FASP to determine and confirm the differential proteins. After careful analysis, the statistical outcomes of IP and FASP Mass Spectrum combined, indicated significant changes in the expression of 280 proteins caused by NFX1 overexpression. Our findings can serve as a convenient biomarker to identify people carrying over-expressed NFX1, signal high risk of cervical cancer, and prevent cervical cancer in early stages.:::2019
