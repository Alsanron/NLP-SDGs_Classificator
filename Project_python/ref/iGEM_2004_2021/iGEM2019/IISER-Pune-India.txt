IISER-Pune-India:::Asia:::India:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mutatis Mutandis: Evolving LEADing solutions for an enLIGHTened change:::Directed evolution, a recent hot topic, is a powerful tool in the field of bioengineering. The current methods for performing directed evolution come with certain limitations, such as instability of hypermutator strains, toxicity of chemical mutagens and inability to evolve gene networks with error prone PCR. Our project aims to overcome these problems by developing a self-regulated system which can achieve tunable mutation rates in E.coli. To demonstrate the working of the system and to address a pressing local issue of lead pollution in water bodies, we aim to develop a lead biosensor and evolve a lead bioremediating strain for higher efficiency using our tool.:::2019
