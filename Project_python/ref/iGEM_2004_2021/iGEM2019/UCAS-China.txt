UCAS-China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Ark.micro:::Microbial therapies possess unique advantages in solving key challenges that are associated with current treatments. Our Ark.micro is a universal platform for microbial therapies with safety and efficiency, allowing the easier engineering of “new generation” therapies. For metabolic disorders like phenylketonuria, our Ark.micro can support the Phe-metabolizing enzymes to compensate genetic defect. For diseases which require for a long-term drug-supply like Parkinson's disease, it can consistently provide L-dopa to free the patients from bothering taking pills frequently. Further, our therapeutic bacteria can precisely respond to the temperature change using our high-performance thermosensitive switch. Thus, they can be engineered to only survive and release drug under certain temperature condition, avoiding potential risks from unexpected bacteria distribution or negative side-effect of the drug. By the assistance of our hardware, a small electronic gut capsule, which can restrictively heat the lesion part, we consider our Ark.micro to be a promising anticancer platform.:::2019
