PennState:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Diauxie:::A common framework for gene expression at bacterial catabolic operons involves dual regulation by a global regulatory protein and a catabolite-specific regulator (e.g., AraC in the case of expression from promoter PBAD). In E. coli, the cAMP-receptor protein (CRP) acts as a global regulator in which the cAMP-CRP complex typically increases transcription at catabolic promoters in the absence of the “preferred” catabolite glucose. The result is a phenomenon known as diauxie, in which glucose is preferentially utilized in the presence of other sugars, since expression of catabolic pathways for the other sugars is not fully induced. A consequence of this dual control mechanism is that many bacterial promoters commonly used in biotechnology require the absence of glucose for full transcription activation (e.g., the lac and araBAD promoters).:::2008
