Newcastle_University:::Europe:::United Kingdom::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bug buster:::We aimed to develop a diagnostic biosensor for detecting pathogens. We wanted this to be cheaply and readily available for deployment in areas where access to medical resources, such as refrigeration and sophisticated laboratories, is limited or absent. We chose to use Bacillus subtilis as a method of delivery due to its ability to sporulate. The sensor bacteria could then be dried down as spores, which are very stable and extremely resilient to hostile environmental conditions, and rehydrated when required. The ambient temperature of much of the developing world is ideal for the growth of Bacillus spp. without the use of incubation equipment.:::2008
