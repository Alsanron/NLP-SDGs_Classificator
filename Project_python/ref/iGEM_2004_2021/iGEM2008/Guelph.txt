Guelph:::North America:::Canada::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Reprogramming microbes to cater to or silence their hosts - beta carotene production and RNAi delivery:::Humans contain billions of microbes which help digest our food and produce vitamins to suppliment our diet, while plants such as corn harbour microbes within their tissues which can extend the metabolic capacity of their host. In an attempt to exploit these patterns of microbial habitation, we built constructs which were inserted into the broad host range plasmid pDSK-GFPuv to contain either a synthetic operon of metabolic genes belonging to the soil microbe Erwinia uredovora, or Biobrick compatible RNAi constructs targetting the plant expression of either GFP or corn TB1 genes. These plasmids were to be electroporated into either probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 or endophytic Klebsiella pneumonii 342. Assays will then show whether a genetically modified enteric microbe could be made to produce vitamin A in a modelled human intestine, or whether a common corn endophyte could stably express and deliver RNAi signals against expression of GFP and corn TB1 genes while living inside a growing corn plant.:::2008
