IIT_Madras:::Asia:::India::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::stresskit beating the bacterial blues:::Regulated gene expression is an essential part of the synthetic biologist's toolkit. Bacteria have evolved 'generalized stress response systems' which generate genome-wide changes in gene expression in response to globally-integrated information. Specific types of stress upregulate specific 'alternative sigma factors', which activate transcription by binding to nucleotide signatures at the -10 and -35 boxes of their cognate promoters. We set out to design, construct, and validate a library of sigma-dependent promoters for Escherichia coli, with the following design specifications: the promoters must conform to the BioBrick standard; they must be modular so they can be used multiply in devices; and they must be LacI repressed but sigma-dependent, off by default but behaving like native sigma-dependent promoters in the presence of IPTG. All our promoters are based on the LacO promoter of Lutz and Bujard, containing two LacI binding sites, but with -10 and -35 boxes modified to bind alternative sigma factors.:::2008
