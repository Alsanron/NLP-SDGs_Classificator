BCCS-Bristol:::Europe:::United Kingdom::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacto-Builders:::Assembling particles at microscopic scales into desired patterns or structures is currently either extremely difficult, or in most cases impossible. Some structures have been shown to naturally self-assemble under speciﬁc conditions [1], but this is limited to a very small subset of all those possible. Other techniques, such as the use of optical tweezers [2], although promising, are human-intensive, a possible disadvantage in certain applications where structures need to change dynamically in response to certain conditions. With this in mind the BCCS iGEM 2008 project aims at developing miniature “Bacto-Builders” to help.:::2008
