Paris:::Europe:::France::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The BacteriO'Clock:::Our BacteriO'Clock project aims at constructing a First In First Out (FIFO) periodical system synchronized at population scale. To this end we implement a biological FIFO circuit in a negative feedback loop and a cell-cell communication channel. Such a setup is designed to trigger a sequence of several genes successive activations repeated periodically. Thus, it can be considered as a biological clock.:::2008
