Edinburgh:::Europe:::United Kingdom::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Manufacturers of weapons of mass nutrition:::We have been investigating engineering bacteria to produce starch from the cellulose in waste biomass (that is agricultural waste, wood chippings, waste from paper production etc.). This starch could be: sold to the biofuels industry for conversion to ethanol, used as feed for livestock, used as a starch supplement in the human diet if needed. This will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and free up agricultural land for the growth of food crops, ultimately putting less strain on ecosystems.:::2008
