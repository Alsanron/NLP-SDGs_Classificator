USTC:::Asia:::China::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted::: :::It is an amazing process in nature that the evolution from Protozoa to Metazoa. Even in the development of each Metazoa, it is still unknown how the genome regulates stem cells to differentiate into different kinds of cells, which can compose different tissues or organs, according to where they are in the body. There should be a self-organized process. Here we are trying to build a self-organized multiple-cell system based on the quorum sensing system to understand the mechanism of this process. We employed small molecules in the AHL family as messengers to transmit the orders of differentiation, and we use Cre recombinase as the executor of differentiation. With the use of an artificially designed network, we are trying to construct a new kind of cells, through which a ring composed by GFP will be seen on the plate if the colony is big enough.:::2008
