Tsinghua:::Asia:::China::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Poor Driver In a Strange Car:::The car is strange because it can only run forward or tumble. The probability of the two states is controlled through a handle in it. Even worth, there are no windows on this car but a barometer showing local altitude. How should the driver do to reach the top of the hill and stay at there? ... If you think about the design of bacterial chemotaxis pathway, you will find that this pathway just plays the role of the driver in the story above. Interestingly, we find E. coli chemotaxis pathway realizes this delicate dicision-making process through the interactions amount handful molecules. Our project will show how we learn the design principles from native pathway to complete our device.:::2008
