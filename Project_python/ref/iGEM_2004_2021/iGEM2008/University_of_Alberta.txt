University_of_Alberta:::North America:::Canada::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bisphenol Eh?:::The aim of our project is to create a biosensor that will detect BPA and other estrogen-like compounds in the environment. BPA is a toxin that has been shown to leech from certain types of plastic that are used in everyday life. Animal studies have shown that BPA is linked to various forms of cancer and other detrimental effects, which are likely to affect humans as well. Having a biosensor that can detect soil and water contaminated with BPA would be a useful tool indeed. Our project relies on the mechanism by which BPA affects cells. As an estrogen-like compound, BPA has the ability to mimic estrogen. When taken into the cell, it can bind to the cytoplasmic estrogen receptors, and activate genes related to estrogen, tricking cells into thinking they are in an environment containing estrogen when they are not. By introducing the estrogen receptor into "E. coli", we can use it to activate transcription of reporter genes to allow for easy visual identification of environments contaminated with BPA. Furthermore, the system can be used to activate recently characterized genes for BPA metabolism (BisdA, BisdB) in order to help with bioremediation of contaminated areas. While proving the principle in an "E. coli" system is our main goal for this yearâ€™s project, we are thinking ahead to future development of other applications.:::2008
