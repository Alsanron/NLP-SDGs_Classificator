Princeton:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted::: :::Neurotransmitters are distinct among cell-cell communication molecules, which makes the neurons that use them unique research subjects. Neurotransmitters are chemical compounds which relay messages between neurons and other cells through the stimulation of action potentials. They are released in vesicles formed on one side of a synaptic cleft and are received by receptors of neighboring cells. Once the neurotransmitter activates the receptor on the post-synaptic cell, an action potential based on chemical and electrical gradients is triggered and propogates through the axon to the cell body and the dendrites. When the action potential reaches the cell body and the dendrites of the receiving neuron, the same neurotransmitter is usually released and the electrical message is carried further along the pathway of neurons. This method of communication is incredibly fast (milliseconds) relative to transcriptional transfer of information (which usually takes hours), which allows us to see results of our work faster than usual experiments of this nature.:::2008
