LCG-UNAM-Mexico:::Latin America:::Mexico::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Controlling E. coli's nickel efflux pump:::The aim of this project is to make bacteria sing, and it will be done by modifying the extracellular medium's resistivity through the modulation of the RcnA (E. coli's natural efflux pump) which will in turn change the concentration of nickel outside the cell. By doing this we expect to gain insight into a fundamental aspect of ecological dynamics which is currently not well understood. On the other hand, we expect to show that measuring changes in resistivity is an effective way to determine the activity of the efflux pump, and that this can become an efficient indicator of real time transcription for in vivo experiments.:::2008
