Prairie_View:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted::: :::Our work is aimed at developing a biosensor for the detection of cations by introducing electron network system proteins into the chassy best suited to receive an enhanced energy flow. The flow of electrons is fueled through the network of oxidation reactions of bivalent metals across Ion channels and Cytochrome complexes. By facilitating the flow of electrons in a cell, we have showed an increase of ATP production. Bacterial cells use ATP for anabolic reactions, including the synthesis of DNA. Through our electron network system, we can enhance the expression of DNA, increasing cell replication along with the fluorescence of our reporters. Together, these incorporated proteins enhance the capacity of our sensor device.:::2008
