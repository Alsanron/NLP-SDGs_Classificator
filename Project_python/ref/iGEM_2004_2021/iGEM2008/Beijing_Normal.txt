Beijing_Normal:::Asia:::China::::::Collegiate:::Accepted::: :::We are aiming to create some magic intelligent bacteria to track and ‘eat’ pollutants PCBs (Polychlorinated Biphenyl) and dioxins efficiently, based on the methods of synthetic biology. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a family of compounds produced commercially by the direct chlorination of biphenyl using ferric chloride and/or iodine as the ctalyst.The total amount of PCBs produced in the world is estimated 1.2 million tons.Because PCBs have been released into the environment in many countries over decades, these compounds have become serious and global environmental contaminants.PCBs tend to accumulate in biota owing to their lypophilic property.:::2008
