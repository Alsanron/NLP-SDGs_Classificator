EPF-Lausanne:::Europe:::Switzerland::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genetic Network Generating Spatial Patterns Through Cell-Cell Communication and Controlled Information Processing:::Biological systems are unique in their ability to combine information and energy to generate complex entities. Genetically encoded networks drive many of these patterning processes. Furthermore, developmental studies have highlighted the importance of gradient formation and cell-cell communication for the generation of cellular patterns in the early stages of life. It has been shown that simple networks can form both static and dynamic patterns. Nonetheless, a system whose pattern formation is dependent on combinations of multiple signals has yet to be demonstrated. Here we address this question by designing a network, involving two different quorum-sensing based signaling mechanisms.:::2008
