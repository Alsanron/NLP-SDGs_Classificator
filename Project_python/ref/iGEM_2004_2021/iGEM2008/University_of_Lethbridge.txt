University_of_Lethbridge:::North America:::Canada::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The “Bacuum" Cleaner – an intelligent self-propelling keener cleaner:::Our goal is to create a modified Escherichia coli bacterium capable of seeking out and degrading toxic aromatic pollutants created during the oil refinery and mining processes. Our “Bacuum" cleaner will respond to this destructive compound through interaction with a programmed riboswitch (an mRNA capable of binding a target molecule with its 5’ UTR which causes a conformational change, thereby regulating any downstream protein translation). By using riboswitches that switch at varying concentrations of target ligand, we can alter the signal which is induced. At low concentrations, we intend to have our riboswitch express the motility protein cheZ in E. coli, thus directing the bacterium towards higher concentrations of our target molecule (i.e. positive chemotaxis). Once it reaches a threshold concentration, a catabolic pathway capable of degrading our target pollutant will be activated.:::2008
