Freiburg:::Europe:::Germany::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Modular Synthetic Receptor System:::Signaling through membranes is a characteristic of life. Transmembrane proteins control proliferation, differentiation, and cellular response and are key for the formation of multicellular organisms. Controlling such proteins enables modifying cellular behavior and ultimately programming cells at will. The complex rules for transmembrane signaling often require engagement of several proteins in a fine-tuned spatial and temporal manner.:::2008
