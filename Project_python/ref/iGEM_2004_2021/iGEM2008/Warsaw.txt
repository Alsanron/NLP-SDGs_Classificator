Warsaw:::Europe:::Poland::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacterial device for generation and selection of interactors for any bait protein:::The project goal was to create system of biological machinery, enabling the study of protein interactions and simultaneously maximization of that interaction by changing one of the proteins. Our plan consisted of: cloning the gene of tested protein in a low-copy plasmid and transformation of bacterial strain (let us call it "one-armed bandit") to mutate it. Translational fusion of tested protein with OmpA (outer membrane protein), encoded by the plasmid, would direct the protein to the outer bacterial membrane, where selection with the bait present in the liquid culture medium could occur. Such selection system would allow to screen protein libraries or produce antibodies with new specificities.:::2008
