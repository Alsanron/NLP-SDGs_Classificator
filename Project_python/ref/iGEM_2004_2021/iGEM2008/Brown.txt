Brown:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::toxipop: conductane measurement of cell lysis as a reporter of toxin presence:::Around the world, contamination of drinking water is an immense problem that is difficult and expensive to detect with current technology. As such, many 3rd World countries are unable to effectively diagnose the problem across the millions of water supply sources that exist. There is a need for a low cost, transportable, and user friendly detection system for water contamination that can be used in the field reliably. Brown Universityâ€™s Team Conductance aims to create a biosensor that interfaces biological and electrical systems and acts as a novel electrical reporting system, for which one use would be to detect toxins in water supplies.:::2008
