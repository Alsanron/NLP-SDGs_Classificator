KULeuven:::Europe:::Belgium::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DR. COLI, THE BACTERIAL DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM:::Our team’s project is Dr. Coli, an E. coli bacterium that produces a drug when and where it is needed in the human body. It does this in an intelligent way, such that the drug production meets the individual patient’s needs. And when the patient is cured, Dr. Coli eliminates itself from the body. To achieve this, a molecular timer registers the time since the last disease signal sensed. Then after a certain time, Dr. Coli self-destructs. However, when the disease flares up again – above a certain noise level - the timer is reset and new drug is produced. Finally, the timer will not start counting during the production of Dr. Coli, thanks to its disease-memory. Dr. Coli thus has several advantages over classical drugs, and, if proven successful, could have many medical applications. One example could be the delivery of a vasoactive intestinal peptide as a potential treatment for Crohn's disease.:::2008
