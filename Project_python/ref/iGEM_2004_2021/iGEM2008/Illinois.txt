Illinois:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted::: :::Our projects have one unifying motivation: cheap and robust detection of pathogens. There is a real need in the third world for simple and effective pathogen detection. These regions of the world lack the basic health infrastructure to treat many common diseases. In addition, sanitation measures that we often take for granted are substandard or completely lacking in many parts of the world. Because of these two factors, there is a large need for water quality monitoring to detect and prevent the spread of disease. Our projects focus on three different but related techniques for detecting a pathogen, specifically the cholera toxin.:::2008
