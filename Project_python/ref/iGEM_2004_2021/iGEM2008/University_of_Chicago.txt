University_of_Chicago:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering E. coli to express Mefp-3,5, and Mgfp-5 proteins:::Our research group is interested in furthering this effort by engineering E. coli to express Mefp-3,5, and Mgfp-5 proteins, which are found naturally in mussels (Mytilus edulis and Mytilus galloprovincialis). These mussel foot proteins are strong bioadhesives and powerful anti-biofouling agents, with applications for biomaterials and biomedical research . We aim to produce results that will achieve the initial goals of genetic engineering, as well as further the conceptual goals of synthetic biology. The final goal of this research is to produce four biological Systems meeting the specifications of the Standard Registry of Biological Parts: 1) Expression of Mefp-3 in E. coli, 2) expression of Mefp-5 in E. coli, 3) expression of Mgfp-5 in E. coli, and 4) concomitant expression of Mefp-3,5 and Mgfp-5 in E. coli.:::2008
