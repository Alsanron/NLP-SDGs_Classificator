Utah_State:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PHB or NOT PHB:::The Utah State University iGEM team project is focused on creating an efficient system for producing and monitoring PHA production in microorganisms. One goal of our research is to develop and optimize a method, using fluorescent proteins, for the detection of maximum product yield of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB, a bioplastic) in recombinant E. coli and in C. necator. In order to develop an optimal PHB detection system, we worked to identify the most efficient reporter genes, and the best promoter sequences that would allow the GFP reporter to indicate maximum PHB production.:::2008
