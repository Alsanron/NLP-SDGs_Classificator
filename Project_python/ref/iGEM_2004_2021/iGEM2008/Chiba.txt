Chiba:::Asia:::Japan::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. coli time manager:::We are constructing delay switches to control/preset the timing of target gene expression. Our project uses two classes of bacteria: senders and receivers. Senders produce signaling molecules, and receivers are activated only after a particular concentration of this molecule is reached. The combinatorial use of senders/receivers allows us to make a‘switching consortium’which activates different genes at the preset times. As signaling molecules, we utilize molecules associated with Quorum sensing, a phenomenon that allows bacteria to communicate with each other. Although different quorum sensing species have slightly different signaling molecules, these molecules are not completely specific to their hosts and cross-species reactivity is observed (1),(2). Communication using non-endogenous molecules is less sensitive than the original, and requires a higher signal concentration to take effect. This reduced sensitivity results in the slower activation of receivers, thus creating a system in which different receivers are activated after different amounts of time following signaling molecule release.:::2008
