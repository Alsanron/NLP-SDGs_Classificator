Heidelberg:::Europe:::Germany::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacterial killers from a genetic construction kit:::The Heidelberg team is developing a biological machine that is able to detect and specifically kill pathogens or even cancer cells. In a proof of principle study the team has genetically reengineered two E.coli strains into a prey and a killer strain. The system consists of two modules: a module for the recognition of the pathogen-presenting prey cell by the killer strain, and a module for directed movement of the killer cells towards their prey. The team utilizes the natural sensing and movement system of E. coli bacteria, which in nature is used to sense nutrients, by redesigning the receptors of the killer strain to sense a molecular cocktail secreted by the prey strain.:::2008
