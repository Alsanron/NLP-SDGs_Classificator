Mississippi_State:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Rethink biofuels:::Lignin is a nearly ubiquitous biopolymer found throughout the biosphere. It is a major constituent of plant tissue, and proves to be the major limitation of wood biodegradation. Also, its resistance to degradation decreases the availability of other plant tissue components, most notably cellulose and hemicellulose. Lignin is found in many wood products, including newspaper print, and it lends the ‘hardness’ to wood materials. Its limitation on wood product bioavailability is due to the complex polymeric structure which proves difficult to break. Therefore, it presents a formidable physical boundary to enzymes directed at the other constituents of plant matter.3 In this research, we seek to gather the enzymes and cofactors necessary for the complete degradation of Lignin. These will be integrated into a bacterial genetic system using the BioBrick standard of assembly. The system will consist of necessary genetic sensors and controls to ensure optimal enzymatic activity in the presence of lignin. It will also improve upon existing methods which use only the White Rot Fungi, or enzymes alone. This method is specific for lignin, and will not degrade other plant matter. Also, it will be more economic than purely enzymatic means due to the self-replicating and control factors built into the microorganism.:::2008
