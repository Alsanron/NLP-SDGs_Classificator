iHKU:::Asia:::Hong Kong::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Formation of new patterns by programming cell motility:::The ability of living organisms to form patterns is an untapped resource for synthetic biology. The HKU iGEM2008 team aims to generate unique patterns by rewiring the genetic circuitry controlling cell motility. Specifically, E. coli cells are programmed to autonomously regulate their movement by sensing local cell density. Interesting patterns are formed by two types of newly engineered cells. The low-density mover cells spread outwards and spontaneously form a distinctive ring of low cell density surrounded by rings of high cell density whilst the high-density mover cells form a Mt.Fuji-like structure. Moreover, we build a theoretical model that satisfactorily fits our current experimental data, and also predicts some parameters which may significantly affect the ring formation. The study of this self-organized spatial distribution of cells helps us to understand principles underlying the formation of natural biological patterns, and synthetic non-natural patterns have various potential applied uses.:::2008
