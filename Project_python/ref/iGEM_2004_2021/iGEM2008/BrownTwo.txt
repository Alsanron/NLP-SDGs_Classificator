BrownTwo:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Genetic Limiter Circuit in S. cerevisiae:::We have designed a modular genetic circuit to limit the expression level of a gene of interest to a user-defined, tunable threshold. The limiter network reacts to the transcription of an endogenous gene within each cell, entering a regulatory state only where and when the rate of transcription lies beyond an acceptable range of activity. Along with its potential therapeutic utility, we offer our device as a foundational tool for researching gene expression in a eukaryotic model.:::2008
