Bologna:::Europe:::Italy::::::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Ecoli.PROM: an Erasable and Programmable Genetic Memory in E. coli:::Our project aims to design a bacterial reprogrammable binary memory (EPROM) with genetically engineered E.coli. To engineer bacteria we designed a genetic Flip-Flop formed by an epigenetic memory sensitive to IPTG -for the memory reset- and an UV-sensitive trigger to set the memory ON. We designed the Flip-Flop circuit by model-based analysis and computer simulation. The core elements are two mutually regulated promoters.:::2008
