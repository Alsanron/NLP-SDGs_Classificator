Johns_Hopkins:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Yeast Sex Detector::: As our inaugural project, we set out to simplify one of the somewhat belaboring tasks in the field of molecular biology: S. cerevisiae mating type elucidation. Bakerâ€™s yeast, S. cerevisiae, has become an invaluable eukaryotic model for molecular biology research for many reasons. One, it utilizes many proteins and biological pathways homologous to those in humans. Consequently, investigating these molecules and systems in yeast has provided unparalleled insight into the genetics of humans. Two, because yeast is unicellular and therefore grows fast, it can be studied more readily than many other organisms, especially higher eukaryotes. Another useful characteristic of yeast is its ability to exist in populations of different ploidy, either diploid or haploid. The process in which ploidy arises is governed by the yeast mating pathway, which is well studied.:::2008
