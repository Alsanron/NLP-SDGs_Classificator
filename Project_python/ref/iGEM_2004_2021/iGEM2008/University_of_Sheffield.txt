This issue is not limited to developing countries: outbursts of diseases caused by water contamination still occur all around the world including the most developed regions. Efficient testing of water is an essential part of preventing these incidents, especially after natural disasters. It needs to be quick, easy enough for anyone to use, cheap and reusable. This was the idea behind the University of Sheffieldâ€™s project in its first entry into iGEM.:::2008
