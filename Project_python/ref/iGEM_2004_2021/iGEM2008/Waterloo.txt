Waterloo:::North America:::Canada::::::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genome-free Bacterial Bioproduct Factory:::The aim of our project is to engineer a genome-free, cell-based expression system capable of producing a desired protein or activating a pathway in response to an environmental signal. Genome degradation is achieved using the combined activity of a restriction endonuclease to fragment the genome and an exonuclease to hasten degradation. The gene for the protein of interest will be located in a plasmid lacking recognition sites for the endonuclease, allowing it to remain intact after genome degradation. The plasmid genes will be expressed using the remaining cell resources until they expire. The primary application of this design would be an in situ compound production and delivery system for agricultural, industrial or therapeutic use to continue for a period of time.:::2008
