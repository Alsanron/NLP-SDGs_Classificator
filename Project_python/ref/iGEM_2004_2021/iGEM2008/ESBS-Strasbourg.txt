ESBS-Strasbourg:::Europe:::France::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The cell division counter:::Our project is about establishing a regulatory network over several cell generations in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We want to construct a toggle switch that is triggered by cell cycle dependent factors. This would result in a binary expression pattern like for example GFP expression in every other cell cycle (0-1-0-1). There shall be the possibility to easily extend the system by adding further "bits" of similar construction (e.g. for the second bit the pattern 0-0-1-1). The resulting device would be the basis for a binary cell division counter.:::2008
