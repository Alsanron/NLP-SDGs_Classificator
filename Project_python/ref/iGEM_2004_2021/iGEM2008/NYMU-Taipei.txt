NYMU-Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BactoKidney:::After ingesting our BacToKidney capsule, it passes the through stomach without taking any action, nor being digested, and proceeds to the small intestine. Once in the small intestine, the pH Sensor detects the change in pH and activates the clearance processes of Urea, Phosphate, and Guanidine from the body. To allow itself more time to perform its tasks, the pH Sensor also activates the Attachment process, making the capsule attach itself to the small intestine. After a pre-selected amount of time has passed (controlled by the time regulating oscillators), the capsule detaches itself from the small intestine and exits the body.:::2008
