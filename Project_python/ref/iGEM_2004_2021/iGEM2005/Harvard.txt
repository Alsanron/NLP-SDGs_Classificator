Harvard:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biowire + Biosketch:::The goal of this project was to create a biological circuit that would propagate a chemical signal down the length of a “wire.” The chemical signal was formed by quorum sensing molecules, while the “wire” was formed by living e.coli cells stamped onto a device in the shape of a circuit wire using photolithography. Create designs using an erasable “pen” on a living canvas made from e.coli cells. The “pen” used was UV light, and its changes could be erased using heat. Input from the pen would affect the switch state of Lac operon proteins, causing visible changes.:::2005
