Bangalore:::Asia:::India::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Regulation of Bacterial Chemotaxis + Synchronization of bacterial cell cycles + Monitoring long-term effects of UV exposure:::Use two attractants whose receptors are inducible (serine with Tar, aspartate with Tsr). These define two orthogonal axes. Use a default attractant along a diagonal to establish '-' movement. Synchronization of bacterial cell cycles. Use a cell cycle-dependent promoter to drive a LuxI-LuxR based cell-cell signal. Use regulation of replication initiator DnaA to modulate cell cycle in receiver cells. Analysis of stress responses in biofilms. Connect stress response system to a lac based bistable GFP reporter. This allows transient expression at a stress-response promoter to trigger persistent expression of GFP.:::2006
