Imperial:::Europe:::United Kingdom::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The I.coli Reporter:::We have used the traditional engineering approach to build a stable and flexible molecular oscillator. Our original design relies on population dynamics and was inspired by the Lotka-Volterra predation model. Every step of the development cycle (Specifications, Design, Modelling, Implementation, Testing/Validation) has been fully documented on our OWW site:::2006
