UCSF:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted::: :::Mimicking remote controlled cars, we have developed a strain of bacteria that can switch the direction in which it swims based on an external signal. The genetic program required to perform this function involves reengineered sensors (the nose) and a genetic switch that is linked to the external input. This project showcases a technology for the creation of multiple independent sensing/signaling pathways that can operate simultaneously in the cell. The ability to design signaling pathways de novo will have an impact on biotechnological applications, including biosensing, environmental niche detection, and cell-based therapeutics.:::2006
