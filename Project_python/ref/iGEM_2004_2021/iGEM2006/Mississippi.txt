Mississippi:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::H2 Reporter:::Syngas is a renewable source of energy that has the potential to improve and relieve the energy crisis in the world today. Syngas has the capability to yield products such as ethanol, bio-diesel, and bio-oil, which could replace gasoline and diesel as the major energy sources in the future. The problem, however, lies in the process of producing a high-quality syngas. In general, a high-quality syngas consists of low tar content and high levels of H2 and CO. The high levels of H2 and CO increase the combustibility and heating value of the syngas, making it more efficient and effective.:::2006
