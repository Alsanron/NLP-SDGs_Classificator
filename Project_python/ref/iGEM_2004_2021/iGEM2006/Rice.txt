Rice:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Rice Taxi Drivers:::Quorumtaxis -- The integration of quorum-sensing and chemotaxis pathways, to produce an E. coli strain which is capable of detection and movement towards concentrations of the B. subtilis quorum phermone, ComX. Upon successful quorumtaxis towards the target, the E. coli will produce a signaling response (e.g., GFP production) or a kill response (e.g., the expression of gram-positive lethal proteins). A detailed proposal outline is provided in the link below.:::2006
