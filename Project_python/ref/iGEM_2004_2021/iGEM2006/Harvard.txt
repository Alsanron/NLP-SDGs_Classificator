Harvard:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::DNA Nanobox: A Nanoscale Device for Stealth Drug Delivery:::Traditional drug delivery is fairly low-tech. Tablets containing a mixture of active small molecules and binders are ingested, and the small molecules circulate non-specifically throughout the body. Even when a specific cell or tissue type is targeted (e.g. cancerous cells or bacterial infections), many other tissues are exposed to the drugs, often with serious side effects. We envision a future in which medicines will be delivered in a highly specific manner to targeted tissues and cell types, and set out to make initial steps toward realizing this vision. Our goal for the summer was to design and implement nanoscale molecular containers, which could be dynamically opened and closed by an external stimulus. This is the first step to making more sophisticated drug-delivery vehicles.:::2006
