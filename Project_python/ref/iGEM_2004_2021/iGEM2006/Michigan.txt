Michigan:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Plasmene:::Plasmene is the first integrated development environment designed specifically for synthetic biology.  Plasmene is designed to be a central component in the development process of synthetic genetic networks.  Plasmene hopes to integrate the three major components of synthetic genetic network development, typology design, modeling results, and fabrication information, into a common environment.  Plasmene will also provide connections to major databases in order to make it easier for users to pull information from the Internet into their projects. The Plasmene project's goal is to increase the productivity of synthetic biologists by freeing the user from the hassle of simple, time-consuming tasks and allowing the researcher to spend more time performing useful research.:::2006
