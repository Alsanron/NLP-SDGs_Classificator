MIT:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted::: :::This summer, MIT's iGEM 2006 team engineered Escherichia coli to produce a wintergreen scent during exponential phase and a banana scent during stationary phase using only endogenous metabolites (Figure 2). Thus, our project demonstrates that: It is indeed possible to design, build and test a synthetic biological system over the course of a summer, Biosynthetic devices that produce scented compounds can be successfully engineered in E. coli, Biosynthetic devices can be purposefully regulated via transcription-based control devices.:::2006
