Toronto:::North America:::Canada::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Blue Water team:::The functionality of the Cell-See-Us thermometer is based on the dimerization of a temperature sensitive LacI protein (BBa_J06501). This protein is produced in dimer form, which exists in equilibrium with its tetramer form. Modifying the environmental temperature (ie. of the cellular host) will cause a noticeable shift in this equilibrium. At low temperatures, there is a high ratio of LacI ts tetramers to dimers. In the thermometer construct, the tetrameric form of the LacI binds to and represses the pLac promoter (which is actually a pL promoter with LacI sites, forming an effective pLac-like repressor). This prevents the transcription of the tetR gene. In turn, the lack of tetR protein production will allow the pTet promoter immediately downstream to upregulate the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). At the same time, the second pLac in the construct will also be repressed, and since it drives monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) production, there will be a decrease in intracellular levels of mRFP. The amount of GFP produced relative to the amount of mRFP will result in net green fluorescence.:::2006
