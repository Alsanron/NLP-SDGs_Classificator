Brown:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacterial Freeze Tag + Tri-Stable toggle switch:::This project involves programming bacteria to be able to play a game of freeze tag. Bacteria will be engineered to swim around a microfluidics device until they reach a certain proximity to the 'IT' cell and then they will lose their ability to move. This loss of motility will be combined with a change in color from Green to Blue. When another bacterium, which is moving (not the 'IT' cell), reaches a certain proximity to the 'frozen' bacteria it will again regain its ability to move and turn from Blue to Yellow. Pursuant to the the 1999 paper "Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli," by Timothy S. Gardner, Charles R. Cantor and James J. Collins, we wondered if the bi-stable toggle switch could be generalized to an n-stable switch. To that end, we conceived and began construction of the tri-stable toggle switch. The general idea is that when a selected promoter is activated, it represses the other two. As such each of the three states of our network are self-stabilizing.:::2006
