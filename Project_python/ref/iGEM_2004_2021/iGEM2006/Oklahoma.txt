Oklahoma:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted::: :::Each bacterial cell acts as a node in the network. Once a cell is activated by the appropriate signal, it generates a signal sent to the rest of the network. Each node that recieves the activation signal amplifies the signal to the rest of the network. Depending on the signal recieved (arabinose or HSL) the bacterial cell will fluoresce a different color.:::2006
