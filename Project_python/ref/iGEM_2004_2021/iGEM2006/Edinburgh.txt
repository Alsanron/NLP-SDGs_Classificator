Edinburgh:::Europe:::United Kingdom::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Arsenic biosensor project:::Our team have designed and modelled an biosensor that can detect detect several different concentrations of arsenic and emit a pH signal in response. The device can detect the WHO guideline level of 10 ppb and the Bangladeshi standard of 50 ppb for arsenic in drinking water. A proof of concept Biobrick construct has shown a pH response to a concentration of arsenic of 5 ppb.:::2006
