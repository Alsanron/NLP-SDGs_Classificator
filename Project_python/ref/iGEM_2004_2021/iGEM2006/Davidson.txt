Davidson:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Solving the Pancake Problem with an E. coli Computer:::Our goal is to genetically engineer a biological system that can compute solutions to a puzzle called the burnt pancake problem. The E.HOP computer is a proof of concept for computing in vivo, with implications for future data storage devices and transgenic systems. Our work was done in collaboration with the Missouri Western iGEM Team and an undergraduate research fellow from Hampton University.:::2006
