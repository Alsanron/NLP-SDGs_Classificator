BU:::North America:::United States::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Lux Operon:::So the main task, as I understand it, is this (and I might have some of the specifics a bit wrong, so take this with a grain of salt): we want to make a new Part that contains the Lux operon (for clarity I am going to capitalize "Part" when I use it in the sense of a genetic part from the Registry). The physical manifestation of a Part is a special DNA sequence called a "BioBrick standard biological part". There are variety of BioBrick plasmids that contain one or more Parts, but all have fundamentally the same design: all contain an antibiotic resistance gene (a selector), an origin of replication, perhaps some other things, and the actual Part that has "BioBrick ends." The BioBrick ends consist of specific patterns of restriction sites which bracket the Part in a standard way, so that this section of the plasmid is always organized in the following manner: EcoRI - XbaI - INSERT - SpeI - PstI, where INSERT designates the actual functional Part (e.g., the Lux operon). It is essential that these four particular restriction sites occur only once -- and in the given order -- in the plasmid because their standard organization and single occurrence in each BioBrick enables the modularity and composability of the Parts. Hence the INSERT - the Part - must not contain any of the four restriction sites. I haven't checked to see if the Lux operon contains any of them, but it's pretty big, so chances are it does, and thus our primary challenge will be to re-engineer the operon to remove these sites (via the introduction of silent point mutations).:::2006
