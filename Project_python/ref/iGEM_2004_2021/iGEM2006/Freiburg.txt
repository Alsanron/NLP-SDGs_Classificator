Freiburg:::Europe:::Germany::: :::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Barbie Nanoatelier: Open Source DNA-nanotechnology:::Once the process of DNA folding into 3D structures is understood, shapes can be chosen arbitrarily. The idea of the Barbie Nanoatelier is that the DNA should wrap into a 3D T-Shirt, 3D Pants, etc. "sea of parts" We need a library of molecular primitives that could be interchanged in the desirable way for a bottom-up design on the nanometer scale. Registry of DNA molecular parts and standardization is an actual question of bionanotechnology. We just put first examples of a new class of BioBricks - ORIGAMI BioBriks into depository and publish basic ideas [4], [5], [6]. We try to merge a ‘dead DNA’ with an ‘alive DNA’.:::2006
