Arizona:::North America:::United States::::::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Water Color:::The "Water Color" system is the project that we have chosen to build. As of now, we will be focusing our attention on building this design. We want to start with a system that is not as complex and that is somewhat straightforward to build. So that way, we can learn while we build. We wish to add complexity later, time and resources permitting, after we have made what we preliminarily designed.:::2006
