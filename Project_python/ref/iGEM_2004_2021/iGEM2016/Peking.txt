Peking:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Uranium Reaper:::Uranium, a well-known radioactive metal, exhibits both chemical toxicity and radioactive hazards to environment and humans. Nowadays, several common methods are adopted to cope with uranium pollution, such as solidification of poluted soil and phytoremediation. Nevertheless, these methods are flawed owing to high cost, lengthy procedures as well as potential secondary contamination. To overcome the drawbacks of traditional methods, Peking iGEM team focus on constructing a novel multi-functional biological material which is able to absorb uranyl ion fleetly with high specificity and affinity. This uranyl-absorbing material can be synthesized and secreted continuously by bacteria, self-assembled in extracellular environment, and harvested in a cost-effective manner. It also has a great potential to be modified and expanded due to its modular design. With this material, we demonstrate how the increasingly serious uranium pollution can be treated in a more efficient and sustainable way in the near future.:::2016
