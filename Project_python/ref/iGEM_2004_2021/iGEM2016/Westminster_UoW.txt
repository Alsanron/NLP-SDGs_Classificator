Westminster_UoW:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Metabolic engineering of aminolevulinic acid biosynthesis in E. coli:::Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is an endogenous non-protein amino acid that is as an intermediate in many pathways including Heme, Vitamin B12, chlorophyll and others. ALA has a range of applications including: Medical - tumour-localiser, cancer photodynamic therapy and drug delivery Agricultural - bioherbicide, plant growth regulator and insecticide. Current ALA production uses a chemical synthesis method which is highly energy demanding producing a low yield at a high cost. The aim of our project is to biosynthesise ALA by up-regulating and down-regulating certain enzymes in the heme biosynthesis (C5) pathway, this will not only increase the yield of ALA but to also decrease the energy required during the synthesis of the product. By metabolic engineering of E. coli we hope to optimise the production of ALA increasing the sustainability and the economical gain when synthesising the product.:::2016
