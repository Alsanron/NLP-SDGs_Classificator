Hannover:::Europe:::Germany:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::TALebots – a multifunctional toolbox for the lab:::TALE (Transcription Activator Like Effector) proteins are a new approach for genome editing. Due to a special changeable sequence of amino acids, TAL-effectors can easily bind to any DNA sequence and perform various functions. However, the proteins show a high instability outside living organisms and the function could only be proven in vivo. To date, the purification of TAL-effectors as well as the in-vitro application in the lab is difficult to perform. Our aim is to develop a circular TAL-effector in order to stabilize the protein. We are trying to design “TALebots”, a new type of recombinant proteins, which could be utilized in vitro and enable new techniques of genetic engineering in the lab.:::2016
