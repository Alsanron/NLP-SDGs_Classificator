McMasterU:::North America:::Canada:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genetically engineering lactic acid bacteria for treatment of gastrointestinal tract cancers:::Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers have the highest cancer mortality rate in Canada due to difficulties in tumour diagnosis and treatment. Common anti-cancer therapies used today can lack specificity and have off-target effects, damaging the body in the process. Our focus is to engineer commensal Lactobacillus bacteria to bind and aggregate towards Her2+ GI tumours. Membrane-anchored binding proteins specific to Her2 will be engineered into Lactobacillus to redirect bateria for aggregation at the tumour site. With sufficient bacterial density, a quorum sensing mechanism triggers production of a vital T cell activating cytokine, interleukin-2 (IL-2), to recruit tumour-specific T cells for an anti-cancer response. Simulations of the bacteria in a possible tumour environment will help drive quorum-sensing design (e.g. promoter sensitivity). Ethical concerns were addressed through research into the feasibility of such a treatment, particularly into methods to minimize health risks, make the treatment financially accessible, and abide relevant legislation.:::2016
