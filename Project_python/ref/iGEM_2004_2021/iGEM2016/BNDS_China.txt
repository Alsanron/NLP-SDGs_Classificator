BNDS_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Absorption of Calcium in water by expression Calcium channel protein in Escherichia Coli:::BNDS_China is going to enable Escherichia Coli (E. coli) bacteria to absorb calcium cations (Ca++) from hard water. By the definition of hard water, the exceeded concentration of calcium ions causes extra soap consumption and galvanic corrosion. Though there are already methods of softening hard water, they are either too expensive or inefficient. Therefore, our team came up with this idea of making E. coli attracts calcium cations from hard water that serves as an affordable and functional form of hard water softener. E. coli with highly expressed Calcium channel proteins absorb those calcium ions from the water into cytoplasm to decrease the concentration of calcium in water.:::2016
