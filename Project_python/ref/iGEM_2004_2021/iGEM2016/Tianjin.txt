Tianjin:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Plasterminator:::The accumulation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has caused serious environmental problems worldwide. In recent years, biodegradation of PET has gained much popularity among scientists. Two enzymes, PETase and MHETase, were found this March and have much higher activity in degrading PET than any enzyme found before. We aim at improving the yield of these two enzymes by expressing them in fast-growing and well-researched model organisms like Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and we hope to obtain enzymes with higher activity by directed evolution. We build a report and self-regulated system to ensure the stability of our organisms and the production efficiency and activity of enzymes. Furthermore, we construct a co-culture system, in which different enzymes are expressed by separate organisms. We also extend the metabolic pathway in order to utilize the degradation product, TPA , to produce new environmental-friendly substances such as PHA.:::2016
