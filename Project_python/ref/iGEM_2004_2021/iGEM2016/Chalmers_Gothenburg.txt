Chalmers_Gothenburg:::Europe:::Sweden:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Turning pollution into a solution:::Current methods of chemical synthesis from petroleum have led to great environmental disruption and continue to be a strong contributor to the emission of carbon dioxide. To overcome this problem, biosynthesis is the most viable alternative. The main drawback of biosynthesis is the high price of raw material, comprising over 60% of the production cost. Our solution for this complex problem is to create a self-sustaining co-culture of microorganisms that produces its own raw material, using light and carbon dioxide. Cyanobacteria provide the carbon source for the production organism, which in exchange produces an essential amino acid for the cyanobacteria while creating the desired product. By making several species compatible with this synthetic symbiosis, the platform will allow efficient conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide into products in an environmentally friendly and sustainable way.:::2016
