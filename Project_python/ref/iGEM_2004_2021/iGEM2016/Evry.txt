Evry:::Europe:::France:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Let's Play: Bioproduction of Poly-Lactic Acid:::Plastic waste is one of the most significant causes of environmental pollution. Traditional plastics can take up to 1000 years to degrade, whereas alternative bioplastics can be decomposed in 80 days. The aim of our project is to produce Poly-Lactic Acid (PLA), a biodegradable polymer and a thermoplastic, by engineering Pseudomonas putida. PLA bioproduction presents several benefits compared to chemical synthesis: it uses simple carbon sources and it is inexpensive. On the other hand, P. putida is a safe organism reported to be efficient for polymerization, which gives advantages over other possible chassis. By modification of its metabolic pathways, we aim to improve PLA biosynthesis yields in a sustainable manner and determine the usability of our bioplastic by manufacturing a vesicle for drug delivery.:::2016
