WLC-Milwaukee:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::TolC Under the Sea: Coral Rehabilitation via Bacteriophage Therapy:::In recent decades the issue of coral reef decline has become a global issue. Some of this decline is due to Serratia marcescens, a gram-negative bacterium that contributes to the loss of Acropora palmata (Caribbean Elkhorn coral). Bacteriophage therapy, the focus of WLC-Milwaukee, is not a recent innovation but it could be the key to stopping the decline of coral reefs from this pathogen. Building on methods and research conducted by the 2015 WLC-Milwaukee iGEM team, we conducted screens to find bacteriophages that destroy or incapacitate this and other waterborne pathogens using a specific bacterial protein, TolC. Using Escherichia coli as a surrogate to express Serratia proteins, we can isolate Serratia-specific phages using a simple lab strain of E. coli. Looking ahead, we would like to increase phage specificity for S. marcescens as well as improve phage enrichment techniques that were previously developed.:::2016
