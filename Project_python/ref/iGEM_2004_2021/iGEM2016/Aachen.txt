Aachen:::Europe:::Germany:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::LIPs - Light Inducible Proteases:::Photocaging is a remarkable method of compound inhibition that can be reversed by exposure to light. Previously, it had been used for intracellular studies. We wish to apply this method to industrially needed proteins as well and call attention to its usefulness there. As an example we would like to render the use of high quantities of the chemical enzyme inhibitor boric acid unnecessary, which is classified as a substance of very high concern by the European Chemicals Agency. At the moment, boric acid is used for protease inhibition in washing detergents and dilution in the washing machine activates it again. Thus, tons of it are being processed every year. Photocaging could help circumvent this. A photocaged amino acid will be incorporated at a crucial position in the enzyme by genetic codon reassignment. Prior to the washing procedure the enzyme can be easily activated by exposure to a light source.:::2016
