SUSTech_Shenzhen:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cearll's Secret:::Audiogenetics is a useful tool for high-efficiency cell regulation. Compared to chemical genetics, it stimulates cells with better precision and less toxicity. Furthermore, signals are conveyed to target cells with little delay, leading to a shorter response time. To achieve our goal, membrane mechanosensitive channels (TRPC5 and Piezo) are chosen as receptors. Fluorescent calcium indicator (R-GECO) is employed to indicate cytoplasmic calcium level. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and YFP are used as downstream indicators to quantify the regulatory abilities. Microfluidic channels are also utilized in the pre-study in which shear stress, similar to sound waves, is applied on the cell surface as signal input to explore the basic parameters. A sound generator is constructed to test whether sound can trigger the channels as expected. Additionally, we use directed evolution to improve channels' selectivity for specific sound frequency and their sensitivity to sound of lower intensity.:::2016
