LN-Shiyan-China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::OP Pesticides Residue Killer:::The purpose of this year's project is based on the result of last year's, that is to eliminate organophosphorous pesticides residue on the vegetables and fruit since in China and other places organophosphorous pesticides residue exist and can be harmful to human beings. Differently, we change the way to achieve the goal better. This year, we can extract the protein with specific function directly to use on vegetables. Since we use a different way, ccdB suicide gene we used in last year can be better treated. As a high school team, we can make more accurate achievement partly based on last year's project and using new method of constructing plasmid.:::2016
