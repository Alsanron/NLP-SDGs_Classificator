Danci-K8:::Europe:::Israel:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Analyzing and changing people's abilities to taste food ingredients:::The aim of our project is to generate a SNPs gene panel which can determine people's preference of food tastes using Taqman assay on the Fluidigm nano-fluidic gene dynamic array chips. Endpoint fluorescent image data is acquired on the BioMarkâ„¢ System for genetic analysis and data is analyzed using the Fluidigm SNP Genotyping Analysis software, to obtain genotype calls. In addition to saliva collection from students volunteering to participate, after completing their phenotypes forms of response to food tastes, we will generate a synthetic DNA harboring the wildtype and mutant alleles (SNP) for the ability to sense taste which will be used as control for the Taqman assays and for preforming CRISPER on the mutant SNP allele, to convert it to the wildtype allele, as a feasibility test to be able to change people's taste sense for several important targets.:::2016
