Edinburgh_OG:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ExpandED: Tools For Rapid Prototyping in Non-Model Hosts:::Industrial biotechnology is greatly dependent on the use of model organisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The minimal cell is a future ambition of synthetic biology however there remains a vast untapped reservoir of non-model organisms, each with diverse and unique traits for exploitation. It is a lack of tools designed for native producer organisms that often limits use as effective bio-factories. Today, advance genetic engineering techniques such as CRISPR/Cas editing and MoClo assembly methods allow rapid strain prototyping at unprecedented ease and cost. Our team aim to demonstrate the potential, speed and power of these techniques in developing three diverse platform strains and respective parts libraries for use by research groups, iGEM teams, commercial organisations and citizen scientists.:::2016
