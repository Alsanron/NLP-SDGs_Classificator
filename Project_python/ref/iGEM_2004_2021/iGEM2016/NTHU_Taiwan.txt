NTHU_Taiwan:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PFC OUT!:::“PFCs” is the abbreviation of perfluorinated chemicals. These compounds are produced or used in water-proof clothing in and semiconductor industry, which are harmful to our environment and potential carcinogen to human. In recent years, the PFCs pollution issue has gotten more and more attention to people. Because of the strong binding energy of carbon-fluorine bond, these perfluorinated compounds are chemical inertness, which makes these compounds very difficult to be degraded in nature. To solve this problem, we decide to use a special enzyme to break the C-F bond, which will make it easier to be decomposed naturally. Most PFCs pollution happens in waters, so we also design a bioreactor system to deal with the PFCs dissolved in water.:::2016
