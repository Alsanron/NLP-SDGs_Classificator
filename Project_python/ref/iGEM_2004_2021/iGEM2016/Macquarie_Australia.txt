Our overall goal is to engineer photosynthesis into E.coli to producing hydrogen from sunlight. Our first goal is to engineer the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway into E.coli. Production of chlorophyll in non-photosynthetic organisms has not yet been successful. Secondly we will synthetically construct 17 genes of Photosystem II into E.coli to generate oxygen and electrons via the oxidation of water molecules. Lastly, the electrons generated from Photosystem II will be converted to hydrogen gas using hydrogenase. This will enable the production of hydrogen gas in a clean and sustainable way which could be used as a future energy source. Our modelling and human practice approaches will allow an assessment on the viability of the production of hydrogen on an industrial scale.:::2016
