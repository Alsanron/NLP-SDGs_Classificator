Technion_Israel:::Asia:::Israel:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::FlashLab – Chemotaxis based microchip for rapid detection:::Chemotaxis is the movement of bacteria in response to chemical stimuli. This process is mediated by chemoreceptors – membrane proteins that bind to substances with high specificity depending on their ligand binding domain (LBD). FlashLab offers a set of tools for harnessing the bacterial chemotaxis system. By replacing the LBD of the E. coli Tar-chemoreceptor with various LBDs, or by inserting a switchable lock and key mechanism into the receptor, chemotaxis can be programmed to respond to a substance of our choice. As an implementation of our system we introduce a novel method for detecting an array of materials, such as pollutants, hormones and allergens. The engineered bacteria are confined to a microfluidics chip; the user simply inserts a sample into the chip and if the matching substance exists, the cells will either move towards or away from the sample forming a visible cluster.:::2016
