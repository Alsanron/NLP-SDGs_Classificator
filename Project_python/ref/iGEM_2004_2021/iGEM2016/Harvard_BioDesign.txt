Harvard_BioDesign:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Plastiback:::As a Boston-based team with international roots, we view plastic pollution as both a global and local problem. Thus, we developed a sustainable, circular plastic degradation system that generates energy. We build upon work done by researchers at Kyoto Institute of Technology (Yoshida, 2016), and have engineered E. coli to break down polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which makes up one sixth of plastic products. Terephthalic acid, a byproduct of PET degradation, is then processed in a microbial fuel cell by Delftia tsuruhatensis to generate electricity. UV light, powered by the fuel cell, further contributes to PET degradation. Looking ahead, we hope our work on Plastiback will empower and inspire future sustainable technologies.:::2016
