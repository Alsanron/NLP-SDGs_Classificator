UNebraska-Lincoln:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Nitrogen "Breaking" Bacteria:::High nitrate levels caused by Nitrogen-rich fertilizers lead to numerous health and environmental consequences. By designing a bacteria that can thrive in this contaminated water and reduce the nitrates to other molecules, we can minimize the impact caused by high nitrate levels. Our approach is to engineer an E. coli that has these capabilities and will not be harmful to the environment. A portion of the nap operon found naturally in E. coli will be over-expressed to produce Nitrate Reductase that can reduce nitrate ions to nitrite ions. This design could be further built upon to eventually reduce nitrate ions completely to nitrogen gas. We also designed a kill switch that only allows the bacteria to grow in areas with high nitrate levels. A Î”serA strain of E. coli is used as the chassis and is complemented with a plasmid containing the serA gene with the nitrate-sensitive PyeaR promoter.:::2016
