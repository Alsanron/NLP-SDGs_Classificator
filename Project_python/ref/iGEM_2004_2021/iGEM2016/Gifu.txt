Gifu:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Dropping Cleanerase:::In Japan, environmental pollution caused by excrement of birds is a problem that should be solved. It causes dieback of trees and spoiling of the cityscape which definitely is not a good sign as long as a healthy environment is concerned. Birds’ dropping consists mainly of uric acid which is really insoluble. But uric acid can be degraded to soluble material, urea. So, our goal is to single out something that can catalyze the degradation of uric acid to urea and make it possible to wash away by rainwater. We’d like to lead our project to the solution of the pollution. In this regard, we are considering the purine metabolism pathway concerning three enzymes, urate oxidase, allantoinase, allantoicase, to be synthesized to degrade uric acid.:::2016
