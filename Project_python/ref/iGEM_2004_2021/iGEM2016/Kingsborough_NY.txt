Kingsborough_NY:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Kings of the Sewage::: Modern waste management facilities are designed to remove human waste products such as ammonia and urea. Biological and chemical concepts are still being used but there is still a significant amount of concentrated nitrogen source is being released into water basins all over the world. Ammonia and urea can be toxic to local marine life and even during its metabolism by microorganisms they deprive water of oxygen which is life-threatening to marine species. We are working on creating a full metabolic pathway in one species to metabolize ammonia and urea into N2 gas which is 70% of our atmosphere. Developing a synthetic pathway in most adaptable bacteria in waste water would allow us to use only one bacterium which is most successful in those conditions as well as adding this pathway into another bacterium which is more suited for waste water treatments throughout the world.:::2016
