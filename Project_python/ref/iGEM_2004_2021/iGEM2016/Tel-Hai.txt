Tel-Hai:::Asia:::Israel:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::GENE THERAPY OF EPITHELIAL BASED ON THE TARGETED DELIVERY OF CRISPR/CAS9 BY A BACTERIAL TOXIN:::Our team develops a system for the targeted delivery of CRISPR/CAS9 in order to fix Cystic Fibrosis (CF) mutations in the epithelium tissue. A comprised of a CRISPR/CAS9 plasmid linked to the B-subunit protein of the cholera toxin. The pentamer B-subunit is used here as a homing device, since it can bind with high affinity to the various ganglioside molecules present on the cell membrane of all epithelial cells. It has been found that regenerating respiratory epithelial cells of CF patients carry the asialo-GM1 ganglioside. The binding of the B-subunit to its receptor molecules results in the internalization, probably by endocytosis, of the protein, together with its linked cargo plasmid. Once inside the cells, the labile link can be cleaved. The released plasmid is then set free to reach the nucleus where it can be transcribed to his CRISPR/CAS9 components and fix the CF mutation by homologous recombination in vivo.:::2016
