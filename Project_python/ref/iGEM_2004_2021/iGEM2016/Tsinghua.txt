Tsinghua:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::An in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-based gene mutation surveillance system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae:::iGEM 2016 team Tsinghua designed and developed an in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-based gene mutation surveillance system in yeast, which can monitor the occurrence of mutations within specific coding sequences and respond by triggering suicide of the monitored cell. It has been reported that with the assistance of PAM-presenting oligodeoxynucleotide (PAMmer) and specifically designed single guide RNA (sgRNA), dCas9 protein can bind to the mRNA of the target sequence while not recognizing the DNA template. Our system has two subsystems, the RNA monitoring system including dCas9, sgRNA and in vivo PAMmer-generating device, and the suicidal gene expression system, which are coupled by a modified dCas9 protein. The dCas9 is equipped with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence, and a transcription activation domain. dCas9 would remain bound to its target mRNA and thus trapped in cytoplasm under normal circumstances, and translocate into the nucleus to initiate suicidal gene expression once a mutation occurred.:::2016
