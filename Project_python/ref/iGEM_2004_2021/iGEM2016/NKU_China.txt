NKU_China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AI-2 Controller: Collective Behavior Regulator:::Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is a signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in Quorum Sensing (QS), a process that mediates inter- and intra-species bacterial communication resulting in coordinated multicellular behavior. Drawing inspiration from the effect of AI-2 QS system on collective behavior and cellular decision-making, our team aims to engineer bacteria via synthetic biology approaches to control AI-2 level in natural and artificial environment. We have mainly designed two cell machines: ‘AI-2 Supplier’ is a cell machine which can directly supply high level of AI-2 molecules in the bacteria community while ‘AI-2 Consumer’ is a cell machine which can sense, absorb and degrade the AI-2 molecules in the environment. By taking advantage of the special characteristics of ‘AI-2 Controllers’, we hope to directly control the inter- and intra-species collective behaviors of bacteria in group level.:::2016
