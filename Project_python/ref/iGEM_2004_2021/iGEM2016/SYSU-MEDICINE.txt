SYSU-MEDICINE:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MSCavalry: MSCs of Next Generation:::With great power to suppress adaptive immune system as well as innate immune system, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising candidates for cell-based therapy to treat inflammatory diseases, such as IBD, encephalitis, etc. However, clinical trials of MSCs have demonstrated that only a few MSCs can indeed arrive at the inflamed tissue after systematic administration and exert their immunomodulatory function due to the inefficient homing ability of MSCs. This year, MSCs of next generation are coming. In our project, we will 1) Empower MSCs with a series of chemokine receptors in order to ensure its effective homing. 2) Introduce several kinds of positioning system, such as luciferase to locate in vivo MSC and assure their arrival at the inflamed tissue. 3) Design a switch to kill MSCs when they differentiate into other types of cells. Finally, we will confirm our engineered MSCs in animal models, such as IBD and DTH.:::2016
