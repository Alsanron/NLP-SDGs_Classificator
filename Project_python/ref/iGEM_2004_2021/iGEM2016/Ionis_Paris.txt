Ionis_Paris:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Quantifly:::Nowadays, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are commonly found pollutants that have been proved present in a wide variety of everyday life situations. Though they are dangerous and present almost everywhere, VOCs are not efficiently detected. Usual detection devices are very unprecise or requires a very long exposure time. We tried to address this problem by building a biosensor, perfectly adapted to on-field measurements that would allow us to easily and rapidly quantify the amount of VOCs in the air. This biosensor relies on bioluminescence, a biochemical phenomenon that is commonly used in cell imaging. We are trying to develop a new application for bioluminescence that should allow us to create a biosensor of a new kind, entirely different from the existing devices. We are also working with aeronautical engineers in order to develop a drone able to safely contain our bacteria,that will later be used as a mobile detection platform.:::2016
