Duke:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biosynthesis of Taxol in E.coli:::Taxol, generically known as paclitaxel, is a chemotherapy drug highly efficient in combating multiple forms of cancer via interference with the normal breakdown of microtubules during cell division. Deriving taxol from nature is environmentally unsustainable because the bark of the tree it is harvested from, the Pacific yew, grows too slowly to meet demands for taxol. Chemically synthesis is economically unsustainable because the intricate stereoisomerism and multistep pathway of taxol production result in low yield rates and high production costs. Manufacturing taxol via biosynthesis remedies the shortcomings of both aforementioned production methods; the need for the yew tree is circumvented and production cost is exponentially lower compared to the cost of chemical synthesis. Duke iGEM is optimizing the biosynthesis of taxol in E.coli by individually characterizing and then consolidating enzymes of the taxol biosynthesis pathway into a single strain for fermentation of taxol.:::2016
