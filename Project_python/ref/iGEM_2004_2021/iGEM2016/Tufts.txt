Tufts:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Toxin Delivery of Cas9 to Mammalian Cells:::This project aims to develop a delivery platform for the Cas9 genome-editing tool. Cas9 is an RNA guided endonuclease that is revolutionizing the field of molecular biology and is now being applied to therapeutics for the site-specific modification of the genome. One of the major challenges facing CRISPR-Cas9 technology is efficient intracellular delivery and nuclear localization. To this end, we are producing a fusion protein of the NLS-tagged Cas9 endonuclease and an atoxic variant of the Clostridium difficile toxin B (aTcdB). The TcdB protein mediates cell penetration by binding extracellular epitopes, entering via endocytosis, and delivering the active toxin component through the endosome membrane. By expressing the Cas9 protein at the N-terminus, and knocking out the toxinâ€™s active site residues, the pore-forming component of the aTcdB protein should facilitate intracellular delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing platform.:::2016
