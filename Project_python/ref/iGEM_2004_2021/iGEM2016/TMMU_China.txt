TMMU_China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Establishment and application of a novel blue-white markerless integration selection system for Lactococcus lactis:::Probiotics are widely applied in food industry, agriculture and biotechnology. Lactococcus lactis is a food grade probiotic and generally regarded as safe. It is widely used in synthetic biology. Genes introduced by plasmids usually accompanied by antibiotic resistance genes and are unstable when selection pressure is absent. Genes can also be integrated into the genome but this process is extrmely time-consuming. The blue-white screening system is widely used in molecular cloning. We apply this system to select marker free gene integrated strains. DNA of interest replaced the chromosome integrated lacZ gene, which yield white colonies in the presence of X-gal. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we will integrate some ORFs and devices in different length, including salmon calcitonin for the treatment of osteoporosis, Lux operon from Vibrio harveyi for L. lactis in vivo detection , and Vi antigen of Salmonella typhi to make typhoid vaccine.:::2016
