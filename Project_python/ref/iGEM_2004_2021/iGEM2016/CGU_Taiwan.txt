Immunologic adjuvants are required in inactivated vaccines to stimulate an effective immune response. Leishmania is a parasite that lives within the antigen presenting cells (APC). As a potential adjuvant, Leishmania possess many advantages, including APCs recruitment, pattern recognition receptors (PRR) activation and activation of MHC-presenting pathway. Genetically-engineered Leishmania that can be inactivated by light exposure acts as a safe carrier to deliver specific antigens to the APCs for T cells and humoral response. Based on this concept, we established a new model system to generate antigen-specific Leishmania adjuvant--Leijuvant. We further designed a user-friendly MHC peptide prediction software to integrate key protein information and optimize the presentation of antigen peptides by MHC molecules. Our ultimate goal is to introduce Leijuvant as an effective, safe and antigen-specific adjuvant to the vaccine industry and the general public.:::2016
