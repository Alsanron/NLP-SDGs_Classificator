Do you even know that every 7 SECONDS, diabetes caused disease take one life away? We designed a non-invasive, convenient and electronic device with a reusable sensor for monitoring real-time glucose in urine daily instead of traditional pricking detection. U-KNOW is a two-feature system, which can diagnose glucose level and auto-resetting. E. coli senses the urine for the glucose level, on the other hand, enterokinase degrades E. coli to configure the initial status for the next user. After detection, the collected data is converted into digital signals and sent to the App. This biosensor technique does not only empower diabetic patients to manage diabetes, but also alarm for non-diabetes to take care of their health simply. Prevention is better than cure!:::2016
