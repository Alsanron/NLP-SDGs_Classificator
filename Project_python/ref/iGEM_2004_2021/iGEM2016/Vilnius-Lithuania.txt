Vilnius-Lithuania:::Europe:::Lithuania:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A probiotic therapy for phenylketonuria:::Phenylketonuria is a genetically inherited condition which is defined by the inability of a patient to break down an essential amino acid phenylalanine. Due to that, phenylalanine derivatives accumulate in the brain of a patient causing severe mental retardation. The aim of our team is to construct a bacterial probiotic with an enhanced rate of phenylalanine uptake and two independent systems for discharging phenylalanine. The first system will metabolize phenylalanine directly in the intestinal tract with phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) whilst the second system will incorporate excess phenylalanine into inclusion bodies made of synthetic phenylalnine-rich proteins. The production of these proteins is controlled by a postranscriptional regulator - a riboswitch, which is sensitive to phenylalanine. The final stage of the project will include verification of the system in a bacterial probiotic strain.:::2016
