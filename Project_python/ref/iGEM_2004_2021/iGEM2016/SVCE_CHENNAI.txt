SVCE_CHENNAI:::Asia:::India:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::LACTOSHIELD:::Milk, a rich source of nutrition has over 6 billion consumers worldwide, but still doesn't have a method for preventing it's spoilage in unpacked state at ambient temperature. The current method of extending the shelf life of unpacked milk includes refrigeration which relies on supply of electricity. Here in, we propose to use short cationic antimicrobial peptides (scAMPs) containing alternating repeats of arginine and tryptophan as a preservative. We aim to genetically engineer Bacillus subtilis to produce scAMPs and safely deliver them using a novel sachet system regulated by temperature of the milk. The positive charge of arginine and the lipophilic nature of tryptophan in scAMPs will ensure disruption of the microbial cell wall and prevents milk spoilage. The outcome of the project will have a high impact in developing and under developed nations where electricity is scarce.:::2016
