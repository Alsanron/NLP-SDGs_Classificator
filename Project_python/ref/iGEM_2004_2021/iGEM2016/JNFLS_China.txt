JNFLS_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Micro RNA, macro application::: Alzheimer is a disease prevailed in olds around the world and currently there hasn't had any effective treatment and the early diagnosis is hard to accomplish. Current research has already found that the fold change of specific kinds of microRNA has correlations with Alzheimer's development. To improve the diagnosis method, we are developing a rapid and simple diagnosis for Alzheimerâ€™s disease using the different expression of microRNA between patients and healthy controls. A reporter carrier containing a repressed promoter is hoped to be constructed, which opening is controlled by microRNA degrading or inhibiting mRNA. The accuracy of the system will be increased by the synergistic effect of repressor proteins. Combined with reporter gene, a couple of microRNAs will also be used to construct different plasmids to get efficient system which may offer prototype for massive detection accurately and fast in a massive scale.:::2016
