Istanbul_Tech:::Europe:::Turkey:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Detection of methamphetamine based drugs using a whole cell biosensor, E.cops:::Illegal usage of narcotics is one of the worst enemies of society. Throughout the world, many people are suffering from the short and long term effects of these drugs, and the incidence of drug abuse is growing year by year. Among these drugs, methamphetamine (METH) has an increasing role, as also stated in United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports. As iGEMers from Istanbul Technical University, we believe that solving this world-wide problem is strongly related with the design and production of fast, precise and cheap detection technologies. With that in mind, we are in the process of constructing a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) based whole-cell biosensor for the detection of METH-based drugs using anti-METH single-chain variable-fragment (ScFv) and fluorescent proteins. We also conducted molecular dynamic simulations with different molecules to verify our designs and planning to use simulation data to complete our biosensor.:::2016
