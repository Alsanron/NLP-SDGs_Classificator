Michigan:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Aptamer-based Protein Detection:::We have developed and begun testing a system for protein sensing which we believe has promise in rapid disease diagnostics, including cost-effective tuberculosis detection. Our system uses a combination of synthetic aptamers and proximity dependent ligation to detect protein targets, producing a colorimetric output visible to the naked eye. This conditional, cell-free expression system could be freeze dried onto paper to create a simple test strip which can detect disease biomarkers in a sample in under two hours. If mass produced, a freeze-dried paper system could prove far more cost effective than current detection methods, 25 cents or less per use.:::2016
