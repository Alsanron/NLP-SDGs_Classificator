SDSZ_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Penitector－Detecting Penicillin through Enzymatic Activity of PBP5::: Our project aims at speeding up while lowering the cost of antibiotic detecting methods for milk. We take β-lactams as the target, and implement a penicillin binding protein, which recognizes all β-lactams, in our testing device. First, we improve the ELISA method with a competitive binding reaction, in which the penicillin (or other β-lactams) on the plate and in the testing sample compete to bind with GFP-PBP5(penicillin binding protein 5). We can then measure the concentration of penicillin by measuring the fluorescence intensity on the plate. To even further reduce the cost and strengthen the sensitivity of the test, we create a test paper by binding our fusion protein CBD (cellulose binding domain)-PBP5 to filter paper. When the paper is dipped in milk, the presence of β-lactams alters PBP5’s enzymatic activity, and we measure it by electric conductivity test, which indicates the concentration of β-lactams in this sample.:::2016
