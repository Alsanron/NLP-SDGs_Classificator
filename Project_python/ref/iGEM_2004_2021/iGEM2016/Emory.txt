Today, the bacterium Escherichia coli remains the model organism in molecular biology. Due to the need for expensive equipment, work is limited to well-funded laboratories. To address this issue and extend research to modestly-funded settings, we propose Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 as an alternative vehicle that harnesses E. coliâ€™s transformative powers while obviating the need for costly apparatus. A reporter gene, E. coli gusA was ligated into each of our shuttle vectors; the ligation mixtures were used to transform A. baylyi. Transformed cells formed blue colonies on media containing histochemical substrate X-gluc, indicating that A. baylyi can be used instead of E. coli particularly when refrigerated centrifuges and ultra-cold freezers are unavailable. We hope our findings can enable genetic engineering in modestly-funded laboratories and bring more diversity to the field of synthetic biology.:::2016
