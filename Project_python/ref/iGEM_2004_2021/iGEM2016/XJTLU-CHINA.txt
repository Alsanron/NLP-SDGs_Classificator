XJTLU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::MUTA INVIVO:::XJTLU-CHINA aims to develop a novel in vivo method to construct DNA mutagenesis library. Unlike the conventional method that uses in vitro synthesized oligo-pools, we utilize a pathway constructed in bacterium Escherichia coli to guide the cells to mutate the DNA that has been preset as target. The mutagenesis guiding pathway that XJTLU-CHINA developed involves two major sections, the error-prone replication of RNA by QÎ² replicase and the reverse transcription accompanied by retrohoming of group II intron. The ultimate product upon the ending of the pathway will be a mutagenesis library of DNA target of interest that ready for in situ characterization or harvesting for the future use. The new method will be inexpensive to use and supposed be more robust in performance.:::2016
