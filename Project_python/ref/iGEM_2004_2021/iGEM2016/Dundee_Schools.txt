Dundee_Schools:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::F.B.I - Fighting Bacterial Infections starring spiRNA!:::Welcome to Scotland’s first ever high school iGEM team! For our project we plan to assign our agent spiRNA on a mission to target Vibrio Cholerae and Shigella Flexneri: two pathogens that cause fatal diarrhoeal diseases in developing countries. To achieve this, we’ve created a fusion protein which will allow our spiRNA to hitch a ride out of E. coli. Then the agent will sneak its way into the target pathogen and complete its mission by preventing the pathogen from causing an infection. We’re targeting Cholera and Shigella specifically because they are both a major cause of death in developing countries, this is because treatments are not readily available and are often expensive. Therefore, we hope our spiRNA is a cheaper alternative to current treatments that will hopefully be readily available to a larger number of infected people and in other words FIGHT BACTERIAL INFECTIONS.:::2016
