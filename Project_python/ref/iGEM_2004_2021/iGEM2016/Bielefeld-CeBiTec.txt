Bielefeld-CeBiTec:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Evobodies - Molecular Speed Dating:::We are developing a novel system for generating binding proteins in E. coli via directed evolution. Such proteins could be utilized for target-mediated drug delivery and in diagnostics, especially for the detection of quickly evolving pathogens such as viruses. Moreover, many applications for basic research are also feasible. As the starting point of our system, we design a library of sequences encoding binding proteins in E. coli. Afterwards, we use a special DNA-Polymerase, for increasing diversity through error-prone replication of the desired sequence. Finally, binding proteins with high affinity to the target protein are selected. This selection is mediated by protein-protein interaction, granting a selective advantage to cells in which tight binding proteins are expressed by an increase in fitness under selective pressure. Therefore, the desired clones are enriched in the fermentation broth and can be identified easily.:::2016
