Pittsburgh:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hot Metal Switch: Synthetic in vitro gene circuit for the detection of metal ions:::Thallium is a metal byproduct of ore extraction that pollutes waterways. Like other metals, thallium is toxic to humans. Current detection devices for thallium are sophisticated laboratory instruments that are inappropriate for use by the general public. Thus, we are developing a paper-based sensor for use at home to determine if drinking water needs further analysis for thallium levels. Our sensor detects thallium using a specific DNAzyme, which activates an oligonucleotide input for a genetically encoded toehold switch. Activating the switch leads to the expression of a reporter gene, which is easily detected. The DNAzyme sensor makes the circuit adaptable to other metals. The coupled genetic circuit is inexpensive to produce and also holds promise for signal amplification to improve the detection limit of the system. Finally, embedding the device on a paper substrate will provide the general population with a simple way to test the safety of drinking water.:::2016
