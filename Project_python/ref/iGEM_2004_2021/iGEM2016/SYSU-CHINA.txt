SYSU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cyclebow:::A lack of techniques to figure out cells undergoing different number of cell-cycle in their lineage has limited our ability to evaluate the efficiency of stem cell therapy and investigate the mechanism behind it.   Here we describe Cyclebow, a system for labeling cells undergoing different number of cell-cycles after a specific state in the lineage based on cyclic promoters combined with recombinases and fluorescent proteins.   We intend to demonstrate imaging of up to three cell-cycles in a specific lineage, which can help tracking the proliferation, differentiation and migration of stem cells in vivo.:::2016
