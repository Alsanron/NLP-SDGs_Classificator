BostonU_HW:::North America:::United States:::Hardware:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Neptune: An integrated specify, design, and build hardware environment for Synthetic Biology microfluidics::: Microfluidic devices can greatly facilitate many biological experiments. However, they are not widely used due to high manufacturing costs and expertise required to use them. Our project improves accessibility to microfluidic hardware development within the synbio community through an intuitive platform to design and build simple continuous-flow systems. Neptune’s user interface allows researchers to easily specify high-level designs. It then validates, optimizes, and produces customized parametric blueprints of the setup. It guides users through manufacturing microfluidic chips and hardware at a cost orders of magnitude less than conventional methods. Users can then control and automate experiments through Neptune’s framework. Neptune is available as an open source project to the entire iGEM community as well via the Nona Research Foundation, laying the groundwork for capturing the advantages of microfluidics in essential experiments and applications in the synbio community.:::2016
