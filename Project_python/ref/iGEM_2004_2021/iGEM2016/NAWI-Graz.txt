NAWI-Graz:::Europe:::Austria:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Last Colinator:::Antibiotic resistances are booming everywhere. In industry this could be a high risk because antibiotics are used as selection markers. If they donÂ´t work anymore new ones have to be developed. A good alternative system for selection is the toxin/ antitoxin system. The goal of this project is to construct 4 different strains containing one toxin/ antitoxin, a chromoprotein for visualization and a DAM methylase for a higher mutation rate. the different strains then fight against each other. the strongest survives and within this strain a new reproducible selection marker is born.:::2016
