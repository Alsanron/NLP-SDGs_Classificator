UMaryland:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biosequestration and Subsequent Degradation of Methane to Combat Greenhouse Gas Emissions:::Global climate change is the most profound threat facing society. Greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide and methane are major contributors, with methane being 29 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Sources of methane include landfills and animal farms. Current methods to control methane emissions include combustion into carbon dioxide, which depletes methane but at the levels present naturally is inefficient for generating energy. We plan to create strains of E. coli that break down methane using methane monooxygenase from methanotrophs, organisms that use methane as an energy source. Methane will be oxidized into methanol, which could be extracted for industrial use, but we plan instead to introduce other metabolic pathways (perhaps in co-cultured bacteria) that convert methanol into cellular metabolites (biomass) or else carbon dioxide. Our biological removal of methane could be implemented into the piping of landfills as an environmentally friendly strategy for ameliorating global climate change.:::2016
