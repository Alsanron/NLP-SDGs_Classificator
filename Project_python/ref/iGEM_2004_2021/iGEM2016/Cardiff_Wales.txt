Cardiff_Wales:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Split Luciferase Complementation Assay for Point of Care Diagnosis:::We will assess the viability of a novel bioluminescence detection system for point-of-care diagnostic testing. In our proposed system, a Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9 isoform codon optimised for Escherichia coli is fused to the N-or C- terminal fragments of a thermostable pH-tolerant Pyrophorus plagiopthalamus luciferase (LUC). We aim to coexpress guideRNAs to target these chimeric dCas9-LUC proteins to adjacent DNA sequences. This will enable the reconstitution of luciferase activity and subsequent bioluminescence in the presence of luciferin. This light output constitutes a signal for detection of any targeted DNA sequence, dependent on access to the target sequence. We plan to undertake a proof of concept study of this system using gRNAs targeted to the E.coli 16S rRNA locus, to describe both the effective output of this system in vitro, and the optimum distance between gRNA targets. Finally we will investigate the feasibility of this diagnostic system as a clinical test.:::2016
