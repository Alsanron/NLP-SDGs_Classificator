Because of these alarming facts we decided to work on this topic as every contribution counts in fight against cancer. Cancer treatment is done in many ways yet mostly lethal for healthy cells that lead us to find an alternative solution. Butyrate, endogenous and short chain fatty acid, can prevent colorectal cancer. Literature searches courage us about prevention effect of butyrate by promoting differentiation, cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of transformed colonycte. Our modified bacteria will cause a formation of a microenvironment through a specific cancer binding peptide again produced by Esherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain that will be attached on surface of CaCo-2 cancer cell with already mutated and induced type1 pili structureType I P.1 structure and produce Butyrate and concentrate it around the cancer cells to drive them into apoptosis.:::2016
