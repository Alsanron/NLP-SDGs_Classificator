Northwestern:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CRIPSR Capsules: Engineering pathways for incorporating functional Cas9 protein into outer membrane vesicles:::Antibiotic resistance is a growing predicament in the battle against infectious diseases. Researchers have found promising methods to combat antibiotic resistance by directing Cas9 to cleave resistance genes; however, delivering Cas9 in vivo remains difficult. Current methods of delivering Cas9 plasmids in vivo are limited by expression regulation in recipient cells, and by pathological complications associated with toxic contaminants or harsh administration requirements. Our team aims to deliver Cas9 protein via bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), whose delivery selectivity and immunological toxicity can be modified. Unlike other systems delivering Cas9-encoding DNA, this technology will enable the delivery of functional Cas9 protein and will serve as a model whole-protein delivery system for a wide array of applications.:::2016
