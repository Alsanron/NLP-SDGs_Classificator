SCSU-New_Haven:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::One Breath One Result : Detecting Tuberculosis using Volatile Organic Compounds:::An active Tuberculosis infection causes various volatile organic compounds (VOC) to be produced. One VOC is 1-Methylnapthlene which can be broken down and used to activate the Naphthalene Regulator transcription factor (NahR) native to Pseudomonas putida. Using two mutants of NahR we can produce a sensitive switch with a positive feedback loop ensuring small traces of VOC found in the breath can be detected. Our device consists of four parts. The Degrader, an operon which breaks 1-Methylnapthelene into 3-Methlysalicylate. The Detector, which contains NahR and Psal, a promoter requiring NahR and 3-Methylsalicylate for activation. The Degrader and Detector work in conjunction to turn on the production of the next two parts. The Feedback loop codes for a mutant of NahR that can activate Psal alone. Lastly, the Reporter produces tyrptophanase which in the presence of enzymes from the Degrader will produce indigo, an insoluble dye compound.:::2016
