Queens_Canada:::North America:::Canada:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Pharming The Blues:::With the majority of pharmaceuticals originating from biosynthetic products, the demand for understanding these compounds for their production in industry is increasing. Many of these natural products are produce by Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthatases (NRPSs), which are megaenzymes found in certain fungi and bacteria. These products are great lead compounds but often possess poor pharmacokinetics or high toxicity. NRPS can incorporate non-standard amino acids, and have the ability to append unique substituents onto their product. These factors make optimizing lead compounds extremely difficult through synthetic chemistry. Using nature as our guide along with the tools of synthetic biology we will be modifying NRPS at the DNA-level to improve the properties of lead compounds. We will be introducing tools to capture large NRPS gene clusters, append chemical modifications onto products, and screen NRPS production in a high throughput fashion. Synthesizing lead compounds will be as easy as “Pharming the Blues”.:::2016
