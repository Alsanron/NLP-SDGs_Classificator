Tokyo_Tech:::Asia:::Japan:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Snow White:::“Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?” This is the famous line from “Snow White." You have probably heard this one before. As of today, there are many versions of Snow White. Here in Japan, it has the happy ending where Snow White is kissed by her Prince and they live happily ever after. Meanwhile at the end of the common plot, the wicked queen is punished fatally for trying to kill Snow White. Our project recreates some Snow White versions with quorum sensing. We plan to think our project from diversified standpoints which we named 3E: Education,Econmy and Ethics. We try to build a more complicated circuit and make a substantial contribution to the advancement of Synthetic Biology.:::2016
