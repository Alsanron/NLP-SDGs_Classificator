BNU-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Taxolight:::It’s widely known that taxol has noticeable effect to promote the inhibition of tubulin depolymerization and therefore stabilizing microtubules. Based on this, our team designed a new way to test the existence of taxol, which may have higher resolution than current chemical approaches. Firefly luciferase complementation (FLC) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay is the core part of our experiments. We expressed one specific tubulin connected with N-luciferase and C-luciferase respectively. When α-tubulin and β-tubulin tend to form dimers, the normal microtubules are being assembled and are likely to be depolymerized. However, the extremely stable microtubules would be established if taxol exists in the system. By detecting the fluorescent signal, we are able to tell the existence of taxol.:::2016
