OUC-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cistrons Concerto:::Generally, stem-loops forming polynucleotides are more stable than the single-stranded ones. Particularly, mRNA with a stem-loop at its 3'- or 5'-end often has a longer half-life than their linear counterpart owing to the stem loops' resistance to exoribonucleases. Our team designed a polycistron gene expression construct, in which each gene followed by a stem-loop and an endoribonuclease cleavage site. When it is transcribed, digested by the endoribonuclease, and cleaved into independent mRNAs with different stem-loops, different mRNA shows different stability, determined by the designed Gibbs free energy (âˆ†G) of their stem-loops, resulting in different expression level of their encoded proteins. In this way, we decouple the gene expression level of the same operon simply by designing different stem-loops. In addition, by quantitatively adjusting the free energy of the stem-loops, we can even achieve a stoichiometry expression of the target proteins precisely, like playing a beautiful concerto of cistrons.:::2016
