SDU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bacto-Aid:::WHO estimates that antimicrobial resistance will cause 10 million premature deaths by the year 2050, exceeding cancer related deaths. The amount of antibiotics used worldwide creates a selective pressure on bacteria to evolve and share counter measures towards antibiotics, eventually rendering us defenseless even against simple infections. Our solution focuses on infections that occur in wounds which today are treated with band-aids and antibiotic therapy. We are working on a preventive band-aid consisting of recombinant spider silk with integrated antimicrobial peptides, thereby reducing the need for conventional antibiotics. We use spider silk due to its angiogenetic properties and proliferative effect on keratinocytes. The silk with the antimicrobial peptides will be attached to the plastic polymer, poly-Î²-hydroxy butyrate (PHB), with which our entire construct becomes biodegradable and immune-neutral. Our project, Bacto-Aid, faces the growing problems of plastic pollution and evolution of resistant bacteria.:::2016
