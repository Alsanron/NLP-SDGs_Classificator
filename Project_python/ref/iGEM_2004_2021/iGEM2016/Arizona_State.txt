Arizona_State:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Ringtones: Diverse homoserine lactone systems for cellular communication:::Many bacteria use quorum sensing (QS) to regulate group behaviors, such as bioluminescence and virulence, by sending and receiving small molecules called homoserine lactones (HSLs). Bioengineers have incorporated QS networks into genetic circuits, using HSLs to connect logical operations. However, higher-order genetic circuitry is inhibited by “crosstalk,” in which one QS network responds to HSLs produced by another network. In addition to making it challenging to engineer with multiple QS networks, crosstalk has the dangerous potential to activate virulence pathways in pathogenic bacteria. Using a system that decouples “Senders” from “Receivers,” we are exploring how QS networks from different species behave and which networks have crosstalk. Our project adds 21 new plasmids for QS-based communication, including 12 novel QS proteins, to the iGEM Registry, helps to deepen the knowledge of bacterial communication, explores biosafety implications of engineering with HSLs, and empowers bioengineers to build more complex genetic circuits.:::2016
