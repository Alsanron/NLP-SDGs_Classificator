Nanjing_NFLS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Gas vesicle gene modification. A possible strategy for water bloom control:::The seasonal mass outbreak of green-blue algae poses serious threat to water environment. Gas vesicle protein, widely existing in all forms of planktonic cyanobacteria, provides the cyanobacteria with buoyancy and regulates their vertical distributions. GvpA protein acts as the main structural protein of gas vesicle. Therefore, we plan to mutate GvpA1 gene in microcysis (main type of cyanobacteria causing algae boom) to limit the level of GvpA1 expression and change the conformation of gas vesicle protein---- a possible strategy to disrupt the distribution of microcysis in water and control algae bloom. The recombinant shuttle plasmid containing modified GvpA1 gene is transformed back into microcysis and western blot identification proves that the expression of GvpA1 after modification reduces significantly. The modified segment of GvpA1 and the shuttle plasmid we specially constructed to both replicate in E.coli and microcysis have been submitted as parts to be reused and analyzed by other teams.:::2016
