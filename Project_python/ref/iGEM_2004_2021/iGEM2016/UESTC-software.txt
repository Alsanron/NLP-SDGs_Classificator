UESTC-software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bio101: DNA Information Storage System:::Synthetic DNA holds a great promise for high-density, long-term and massive information storage. As the cost of DNA synthesis and sequencing decreases at an accelerated pace, practical application of DNA as information storage medium is on the horizon. However, there lacks a bridge to connect the current electronic-based information technology (IT) world with the future DNA-based biotechnology (BT) information world. To address this need, we develop a web-based software tool, Bio101, to encode conventional electronic computer files into nucleotide (nt) sequences and to decode the latter into original data format reversely. Through a five-step process, compression, encryption, bit-to-nt conversion, indexing and validation, Bio101 can convert any computer file into a set of short, non-bioactive DNA sequences which are ready to be delivered to a DNA synthesis company for the physical writing-in. A user-friendly webpage makes the technique available at everyoneâ€™s fingertip.:::2016
