IISc_Bangalore:::Asia:::India:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cellfiefuge::: Bio-manufacturing commonly involves the culturing of genetically engineered microbes that produce product(s) of interest, which is followed by separation of the microbes from the growth media and finally, isolation and purification of the product(s). The infrastructure and running costs for the downstream processing are significant obstacles to the large scale adoption of bio-manufacturing, especially for small-scale start-ups that drive innovation. We have therefore developed a modular set of tools by designing BioBricksTM for E. coli that firstly cause programmed induction of product synthesis upon reaching a certain tuneable population of cells, and secondly, autoaggregate the cells upon utilization of most of the nutrients available; these eliminate external induction and centrifugation, thereby minimizing costs. This is of special importance in India, where financial constraints often bottleneck entrepreneurial efforts in biotechnology, which is still a field in the early stages of its development.:::2016
