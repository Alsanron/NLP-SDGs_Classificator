Minnesota:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Shifting Gene Drives Into Reverse:::Gene drives induce biased inheritance of specific genes and are currently being considered as a method to regulate mosquito populations. However, the ability of gene drives to spread quickly through entire populations raises serious ethical concerns, especially when the genetic change affects reproduction. To address this issue, we constructed both a gene drive and an inducible recovery drive and modeled the combined system using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our gene drive results in deletion of both copies of the ADE2 gene from S. cerevisiae using the CRISPR/Cas system, causing the yeast to turn red. As a safety mechanism, we constructed a tetracycline-inducible recovery drive to counteract the function of our gene drive. The recovery drive restores the ADE2 gene allowing S. cerevisiae to return to its original color. Our gene/recovery drive system advances foundational work towards controlling global pests and invasive species, protecting information stored in DNA, and various other important applications.:::2016
