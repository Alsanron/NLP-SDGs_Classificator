BMCs have numerous potential applications, including increasing flux of desired reactions or as targeted drug delivery vehicles. We have re-engineered the ethanolamine utilization BMC with a light inducible open/close switch by introducing the non-canonical amino acid azobenzene into the coat protein of the compartment, enabling the BMC to switch conformation upon light induction. Structural modeling combined with site-directed mutagenesis enabled predictive placement of azobenzene within the structure to induce large-scale rearrangements of the protein shell that allows the compartment to break apart and re-form in response to a “light switch”. This work expands the synthetic biology toolkit by presenting an outline for the engineering of synthetic BMCs that respond to external stimuli, enabling future biologists to utilize these compartments for controlled synthetic reactions.:::2016
