UGA-Georgia:::North America:::United States:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Building the genetic tools to make Methanococcus maripaludis the next-generation model chassis for biochemical production:::Current bacterial chassis use expensive sugars as feedstocks, which limits profitability. Using the archaeal model Methanococcus, we are developing an archaeal chassis that feeds on inexpensive CO2 and H2 or formate instead of sugars, for next-generation biochemical productions. Our team is developing tools and methods for modulating protein expression in M. maripaludis, an archaeal model. Our focus is engineering the Ribosomal Binding Site (RBS). We use a mCherry reporter developed by our team previously to measure protein expression levels in a library of RBS mutants. We are now working to (1) determine the effects of mutations in the spacer region and the role of mRNA secondary structure, (2) expand our Archaeal Interlab study to encourage more iGEM teams to collaborate with us and standardize our fluorescence measurement protocol, and (3) continue metabolic modeling to evaluate the effect of alternate carbon sources on cell growth and geraniol production in M. maripaludis.:::2016
