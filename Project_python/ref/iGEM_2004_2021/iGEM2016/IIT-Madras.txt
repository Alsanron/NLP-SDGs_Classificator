IIT-Madras:::Asia:::India:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Improving measurement studies using dual-fluorescent reporter system:::We have made an efficient measurement device to help iGEMers characterize their protein production modules, promoter and RBS parts, precisely. This device has enabled us to screen noisy dual protein production modules. In order to understand the modularity of RBS parts, we have validated an empirical model to predict protein expression levels using available expression data in literature. Also, we have designed RNA Inducible Boolean Output Switch (RIBOS) devices to turn on/off the translation of protein coding mRNA, downstream of switch RNA, via trigger RNA molecules. Modelling results have shown RIBOS to be highly orthogonal. As an application, we are making a non-invasive gene containment device with the help of RIBOS and CRISPR/Cas9 technology.:::2016
