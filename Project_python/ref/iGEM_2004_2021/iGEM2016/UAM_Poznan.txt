UAM_Poznan:::Europe:::Poland:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Escherichia coli expression systems, promoter and gene optimization.:::Our group aims to generate sugar-induced expression system for Escherichia coli, which consists of promoters induced by arabinose, rhamnose, xylose and melibiose. The system is tightly regulated, provides independent induction of at least two different promoters and can be efficiently blocked by glucose. We have introduced various modifications of promoter sequences to obtain minimal, fully functional promoters, possibly stronger than original versions copied from E. coli genome. The modifications include changes in 5'UTR regions, likely ribosome binding sites and secondary structures to evaluate how those features affect translational machinery. We have also focused on open reading frame (ORF) optimization. Using bioinformatic analysis we have created sfGFP and mRFP variants composed exclusively of the most frequent or the rarest codons. We have also designed ORFs to control codon context effects and GC content for evaluation of their influence on translational effectiveness.:::2016
