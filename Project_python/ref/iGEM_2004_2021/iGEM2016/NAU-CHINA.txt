NAU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SpringHealer:::In 1962 a book named Silent Spring revealing the Harm of chemical pesticides stirred the public. Months ago, substance called Permethrin and the intermediate product, 3-phenoxybenzoate, alerted the youth from NAU-China. To degradate the Permethrin and 3-phenoxybenzoate expeditiously we created SpringHealer. In the laboratory we separated degrading genes from the original strain and regulated the gene expression through changing the expression order and varying different RBS. To know the toxic hazards of 3-phenoxybenzoate deeply we do the drosophila toxicological experiment. Out of the laboratory, we looked around the surroundings hoping to make our Healer more meaningful. SpringHealer can not be put into the nature so we designed a mould to make it better.:::2016
