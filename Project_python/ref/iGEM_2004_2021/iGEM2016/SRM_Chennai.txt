SRM_Chennai:::Asia:::India:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::OncoTracers:::The worldwide Cancer death in the year 2012 was around 8.2 million and,by 2030,13 million deaths are predicted. As per existing records 60% of the rural people in India think that Cancer detection and cure, costs an arm and a leg and is time consuming. MALAT1 (Metastasis Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript1) is associated with around 15 different types of Cancer. The elevated expression of this gene is correlated with the poor overall survival of the patients. In our project, we strived to develop a minimally invasive Cancer diagnostic chip to enable cost and time efficient detection. The MALAT1 was amplified using E.Coli Plasmids. The chip is equipped with markers to produce fluorescence when encountered with the sample containing MALAT1. Based on its intensity range, particular stage of Cancer can be detected and suitable treatment can be provided. The developed diagnostic chip will revolutionize the so followed Cancer detection techniques.:::2016
