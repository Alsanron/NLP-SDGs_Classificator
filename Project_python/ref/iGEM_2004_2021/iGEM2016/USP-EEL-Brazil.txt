USP-EEL-Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Production of alkanes by an E. coli resistant to fatty acids:::This project focuses on the production of alkanes with an E. coli resistant to fatty acid. Alkanes are key components of petroleum diesel, however, biodiesel molecules produced by transesterification are oxygen-rich and combustion of these esters cause malfunction and corrosion in regular engines. The development of a biodiesel free of oxygen chemically similar to the petroleum based fuel is essential to expand the lifetime of engines using the concept of drop-in. A membrane resistant to fatty acids is important for using vegetal oils as the source material and this resistance will be provided by tocopherol. The USP-EEL-BRAZIL team is composed of undergraduate and graduate students. In the long run term, the USP-EEL-BRAZIL team expects to develop a genetic circuit for Industrial biodiesel production.:::2016
