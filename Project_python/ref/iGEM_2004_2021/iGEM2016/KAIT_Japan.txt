KAIT_Japan:::Asia:::Japan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Soil conservation by Bacteria Cellulose:::In the world, a desertification is one of serious environment problem. A desertification is caused by the loss of a plants that cover the ground and of the water-holding capacity of a soil. To prevent this problem, our team use Bacteria Cellulose (BC) that is produced by Gluconacetobacter (Komagataeibacter). This cellulose produced by microorganism is known as a raw materials of nata de coco and as having high water-holding capacity. We will utilize this high water-holding capacity for prevention of soil erosion. Our object is to improve producing ability of Guluconacetobacter by antisense method. We would like to prevent a soil erosion by increasing of water-holding capacity of soil with use of the improved microorganism.:::2016
