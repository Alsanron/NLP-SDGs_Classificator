CCA_SanDiego:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Detoxification: Utilizing a Two-Plasmid System for Enhanced Bioremediation of Toxic Compounds:::Substances such as groundwater and runoff have sustained much damage to both their quality and purity. Common pollutants include alcohols, esters, and other organic substances. We aim to solve this issue by engineering a two-plasmid system to be implanted in E. Coli bacteria for detoxification of contaminated groundwater. Our plasmid will achieve three main aims: 1. The first plasmid will be a bicistronic CYP2e1/NPR plasmid for expression of the Cytochrome P450 detoxification protein, as well as the reductase gene that allows for its expression. 2. The second plasmid will be the aldB gene, which serves as a serve to breakdown aldehydes. 3. The plasmid will be purified and isolated for possible implantation into a variety of biological systems. We aim to utilize the two plasmids in conjunction in order to safely break down toxic compounds.:::2016
