Meanwhile, the activities of bax and bcl-2 can change OMMP，releasing cytc from mitochondria to cytoplasm. Cyt c leakage supports the formation of apoptosome, in turn leading to cell apoptosis. Therefore our project proposes to induce targeted apoptosis of lung cancer cells through regulating bax and bcl2 expression by tumor specific CRISPRi/a system.:::2016
