Lubbock_TTU:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Enhanced Wound Healing Using a Protein Infused Collagen Scaffold:::In 2010 it was estimated that 6.5 million people in the United States suffered from chronic wounds, accruing an annual cost of approximately $2.5 billion. Furthermore, experts predict that the burden of chronic wounds will increase rapidly in the near future. Chronic wounds are unable to heal in an orderly set of stages or within a time period of about three months. The etiology of chronic wounds is very diverse, but patients frequently suffer from persisting chronic wounds due to their bodies overproducing wound site proteases. In turn, these proteases decrease wound healing rates by degrading host growth factors and the extracellular matrix of the wound site. Our team is using a bioreactor and synthetic biology principles to purify and infuse platelet derived growth factor and a protease inhibitor into a synthetic collagen scaffold. We envision our technology will introduce a novel synthetic-biology-based process for the development of wound dressings.:::2016
