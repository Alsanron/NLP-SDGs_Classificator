Ryerson_Toronto:::North America:::Canada:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cyanobacteria as a Platform for Dye Production:::Cyanobacteria inhabit a range of environments and exhibit an array of biogeochemical specific processes as they capture light and concentrate CO2 into biomass. They can be installed in a variety of location and can actually thrive in wastewater and assist in bioremediation. Like many molecules explored in materials applications, dye-stuffs are challenging to synthesize because of low yields over several expensive synthetic steps. Interestingly, dye motifs are produced in cyanobacteria in the form of tetrapyrollic dyes motifs including; heme, chlorophyll and phycocyanobilin (PCB), where PCB proteins have also been utilized in immunoassay kits. In fact, the biosynthesis of PCB is an attractive pathway to manipulate owing to the potential to prepare a myriad of tetrapyrrollic derivatives. These derivatives, have been studied extensively for light-based applications and the ability to genetically direct the bacterial synthetic machinery would be significantly beneficial towards CO2 sequestration, and the production of low-cost dyes.:::2016
