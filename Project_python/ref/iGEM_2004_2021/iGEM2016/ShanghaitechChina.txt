ShanghaitechChina:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Solar Hunter:::The biofilm bacteria live in is often a nasty element in many areas such as bio-fermentation industry and waste treatment, since the tangled biofilm usually coheres to surfaces rather firmly. However, its tight cohesion can be exploited as an immobilization platform for biological interactions. Our project chooses CsgA, the self-assembling monomer of the curli fiber in E. Coli biofilm to immobilize quantum dots and hydrogenase. Quantum dots transform photons into electrons, which is consumed by hydrogenase to produce hydrogen. To realize the platform, we add tags, Spy-catcher and His-tag to the CsgA subunit, and Spy-tag to hydrogenase. The Spy system creates binding between the biofilm and the enzyme, while the His-tag on the biofilm binds quantum dots. The tangled biofilm builds the proximity that the two parts need to interact. Furthermore, in terms of efficiency, we established different variations of the system to find the most suitable enzyme-semiconductor hybrid network.:::2016
