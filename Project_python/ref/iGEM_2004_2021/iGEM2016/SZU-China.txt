SZU-China:::Asia:::China:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Light Hygician:::Hydrogen energy, is of great potential in the future with its zero-emission and high-efficiency. However, the fact that few efficient and environment-friendly methods for hydrogen production constrains its application. Therefore, our team develope a biological production way, using the green algae - Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Since the hydrogenase activity will be inhibited in absence of oxygen and the algae canâ€™t stop photosynthesis forever, we design a switch altering between 2 states in which light wavelength serves as extraneous inducible factor. In specific alternation, we utilize miRNA targeting the expression of key protein in photosynthesis, so we can select the hydrogen-production switch by regulating miRNA. In our design, we utilize Yeast-Two-Hybrid system and light-mediated fusion protein constructing a gene circuit where microRNA can regulate the specific downstream protein expression, and finally keep algae producing H2. In this way, the blue light switch regulate chlamydomonas producing intemittent hydrogen efficienctly, acting as blue-flame bubbling.:::2016
