HUST-China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Signal Filter:::Stable gene expression within a threshold of novel system is very important to syn-biology creations. To achieve the goal, we tried to build a set of positive feedback fundamental tool kits in bi-stable or even multi-stable systems. The systems we have designed will not only be adaptable to some certain input or output signals, but also can change their threshold to meet different project purposes. Most significantly, the positive feedback regulation system can transform an input pulse into stable output. So it can be applied in circuits as signal filter, which is very useful to many applications, such as treatment to lactose intolerance. We even further provided both prokaryotic version (engineered from cI/cro in bacteria phage Î³ system) and eukaryotic version (adopted from abscisic acid related kinase system) to make it competent tool kits for synthetic biology engineers to compare and select for further application.:::2016
