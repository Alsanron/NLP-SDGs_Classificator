CLSB-UK:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Biophotovoltaics:::At the heart of any iGEM team is the project - the central idea that connects all the work they do. Our project aims to build the foundations for what has the potential to tackle to world energy crisis. By taking a step forward in providing a sustainable energy source with a negative Carbon Footprint we are helping to change the world. At heart our project is simple: modern solar panels leave a lot to be desired due to their low efficiency, their bulkiness and their high price. Biological Photovoltaics have the potential to provide a far cheaper, simpler energy source that can take up Carbon Dioxide from the air instead of pump more into it. If only scientists would modify some organism so that it can be used efficiently inside one.:::2016
