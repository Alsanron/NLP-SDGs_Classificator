Cambridge-JIC:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::InstaChlam - a toolkit for chloroplast transformation:::As the factory floor of the plant cell, the chloroplast can be engineered to produce many important compounds, such as biofuels and vaccine antigens, with yields approximately 50X greater than the rest of the cell. However, little of this potential has been exploited, in the absence of a time-efficient chloroplast transformation protocol. Using the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as our chassis, our transformation toolbox aims to shift the focus of plant engineering, by reducing the time needed for a homoplasmic chloroplast transformation from months to 1-2 weeks. We have created a library of Chlamydomonas-optimised parts in the Phytobrick standard, with a view to expressing Cas9 in the Chlamydomonas chloroplast for the first time. We hope to use it to propagate genetic modifications among all copies of the chloroplast genome, within a single generation. We will also develop a low-cost, open source Chlamydomonas growth facility and gene gun to complement our protocol.:::2016
