SJTU-BioX-Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Real-time Yeast Biosensor for Early Diagnosis:::Although our medicine filed has witnessed great progress in the past few decades, most people are still less motivated to attend a physical examination, which is critically important for the early diagnosis of various disease. Privacy, convenience and expense are the leading considerations in deciding to set off for a test. So it’s extremely promising to establish an easy-to-use and real-time device which renders carrying out physical examinations domestically possible. Yeast is ideal as a candidate biosensor for it can serve as a chassis for higher-eukaryotic sensing modalities (e.g. G-protein-coupled receptors, GPCRs) which means it can be engineered to monitor diverse disease biomarkers, more importantly, it can be made in ‘active dry’ form cheaply and stored for long periods of time so that people can store it in a refrigerator at home. Our team engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae to detect the level of disease biomarkers and made diagnostic suggestions.:::2016
