XMU-China:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Genetically engineering the E.coli soldiers to detect and kill the drug-resistant bacteria::: For many years, overusing of antibiotics results in antibiotic resistance of many bacteria. Focusing on this, our team uses the way of synthetic biology to detect and kill the drug-resistant bacteria. In the project one,we designed a self-regulated gene circuit, which can detect and kill both the Gram-positive and the Gram-negative. It can express different fluorescent proteins when the engineering bacteria encounter differnet types of pathogenic bacteria.Then toxins are released out of the cell to kill the targets. We found that the pre-loading of the drug and the systemic inflammatory response are the barriers in most drug delivery strategies. So in the project two,we designed a pulsatile delivery cycles called "SSLC"( Synthetically Synchronized Lysis Circuit) ,based on the "SLC" (Synchronized Lysis Circuit) systems designed by M.Omar.Din in 2016. this system can become a therapeutic strategy for antibiotic resistance E.coli.:::2016
