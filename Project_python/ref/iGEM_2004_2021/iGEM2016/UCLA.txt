UCLA:::North America:::United States:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Deliver-E Coli:::Conventional nonspecific drug delivery lacks specificity and efficiency, leading to undesirable side-effects. To remedy these issues, we have taken both a synthetic and cellular approach to targeted drug therapy via protein cages and recombinant bacteria. We aim to create self­-assembling protein cages capable of cleavage by thrombin proteases at blood clot sites. These cages, characterized through dynamic light scattering and PAGE, would be pre-loaded with anticoagulant drugs to reduce the risk of systemic hemorrhage and treat thrombosis. Additionally, we propose an alternative to broad spectrum antibiotics using contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) systems that mediate intercellular competition between gram­-negative strains. Through Gibson assembly and Lambda-­red recombineering, we will engineer bacteria capable of inhibiting selected strains by exporting foreign CDI systems into DH5-­alpha. Furthermore, we intend to identify the target receptor recognized by Enterobacter aerogenes’ CDI system through transposon mutagenesis. These approaches aim to meet the need for targeted treatments to reduce adverse nonspecific interactions.:::2016
