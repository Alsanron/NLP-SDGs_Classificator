FAFU-CHINA:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cry For Mosquito:::In 2016, FAFU-CHINA will attach the effective protoxin gene, which isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis contained the characteristic of high efficient mosquito control, to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as the chassis organism for cloning. However, there are many problems in the practical application by using Bacillus thuringiensis, such as the bacterial pollution of waters, or the poor timeliness which Bt. strains cannot colonize in the water. Our team use the pertinent literature as the basis for selecting the appropriate biological chassis, combinating the toxic protein, which in order to increase the effect of killing mosquito larvae and reduce the Bt. toxin tolerance. on the basis of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii expression system to optimize gene,enhance expression of results, and reconstruct the engineered bacteria in natural environment, we can settle the problems mentioned above.:::2016
