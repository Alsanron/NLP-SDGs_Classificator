MSU-Michigan:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering Cyanobacteria for Improved Tolerance to a Freeze/Thaw Cycle:::Currently, the biotechnologically relevant model strain of cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, lacks resilience to cold temperature perturbations. If large-scale operations for photosynthetic production of industrial compounds are to be realized, robustness to unpredictable weather conditions must be considered. Two complementary approaches are being proposed to increase cold adaptation and resistance to freezing in S. elongatus. Previously, it was shown the expression of lipid desaturase desA increases the cold-growth tolerance of S. elongatus. We now aim to improve this range by fine-tuning the expression of a riboswitch-controlled desA. We also hypothesize that introduction of SFR2 from Arabidopsis thaliana—responsible for remodeling the outer chloroplast membrane for increased freezing tolerance—will increase cellular viability to freezing events. Through this two-pronged approach, we aspire to engineer a cyanobacterial strain that ultimately could be used for the production of industrially-relevant products in unreliable environment conditions.:::2016
