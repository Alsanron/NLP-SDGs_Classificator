Hamburg:::Europe:::Germany:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Finding Chlamydory:::This year the iGEM Team Hamburg is determined to construct a biosensor against Chlamydia trachomatis, a pathogenic bacterium that is transmitted sexually. Rather than treating chlamydial infections, which can be easily done by broadband antibiotics, the problem is the diagnostic identification of the exact bacterial strain. Current diagnostic methods are costly, since they mostly rely on immunologic methods like antibody staining, ranging between 30 to 150 Dollars. This is fine in industrial nations, but for many people in developing countries living close to the poverty line (earning 1.25$ per day) the cost is far from affordable. To combat this, the iGEM Team Hamburg is constructing a fusion protein with a signaling pathway to function as a biosensor in prokaryotes, to subsequently offer an inexpensive alternative to present diagnostic methods for medical doctors in developing countries.:::2016
