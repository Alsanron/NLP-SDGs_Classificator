Austin_UTexas:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Bucha Bunch:::Kombucha is a fermented tea drink composed of a community of several types of bacteria and yeast. This study’s aim is to understand and manipulate this community to imbue kombucha with favorable properties for producers and consumers. One common problem producers face is ethanol overproduction by Lachancea fermentati, making the kombucha alcoholic. This study screens L. fermentati using YPD agar plates with bromothymol blue, which changes color with changes in acidity. The color change allows for low-ethanol producing colonies to be selected for and recapitulated into the microbial community. Another issue for some would-be consumers is the taste of kombucha. By codon-optimizing an Arabadopsis gene for bacteria, Gluconobacter and Gluconoacetobacter can be transformed to produce brazzein, a sweet-tasting protein, thus sweetening the kombucha. Furthermore, these chassis organisms will be transformed with a GFP gene and pH-activated promoter to create a time-lapse of the changes that kombucha’s microbial community undergoes.:::2016
