CIEI-BJ:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Biosynthesis of a key enzyme (SmCPS1) in tanshinone production::: Tanshinone is an important pharmacologic chemical extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza, a famous Chinese medicinal herb. It was reported that tanshinone can effectively cure Cardiovascular diseases. However, content of tanshinone in Salvia miltiorrhiza and its extraction efficiency are very low. Therefore, synthetic biology becomes the ideal way to produce tanshinone artificially. However, until now, the biosynthesis pathway of tanshinone is not clear. In this research, we aimed to produce one of the key enzymes copalyl diphosphate synthase 1 (SmCPS1) which initiate biosynthesis of tanshinone by building up a gene circuit in plasmid of E.coli. Our gene circuit contains a GST for purification of SmCPS1, a thrombin protease site, our target gene SmCPS1 and the reporter gene GFP. Successful biosynthesis of SmCPS1 will lead the way of biological synthesis of all the enzymes in synthesis of tanshinone, accelerate tanshinone production by fermentation, increase its yield and lower the cost effectively.:::2016
