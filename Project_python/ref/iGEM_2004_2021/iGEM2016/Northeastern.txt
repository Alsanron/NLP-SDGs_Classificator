Northeastern:::North America:::United States:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Syn Bio Approaches to Improving Wastewater Treatment:::The 2016 Northeastern University team focused on two key problems with modern wastewater treatment: the waste of energy and information. Wastewater treatment consumes an enormous amount of energy, yet the water contains a wealth of reduced molecules that go unharvested. Wastewater is also a reservoir of information about the bacterial communities surrounding treatment centers, currently this information is only accessed through metagenomics. To address the waste of potential energy, we designed and investigated multiple plasmids to resolve issues that plague microbial electrolysis cells. We also designed a conjugative Crispr/Cas plasmid with a built in CFP reporter that can be used to monitor wastewater bacteria in a new way. This allows for the real-time detection of specific bacteria of interest as well as the elimination of pathogenic traits.:::2016
