NTNU_Trondheim:::Europe:::Norway:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Implementing biological XOR gates using DNA ribozymes:::Implementing logic gates in living cells poses an interesting challenge in synthetic biology. Logic gates are the building blocks of digital electrical circuits, allowing rational, modular design of complex functions. Successful implementations of equivalent systems in living cells would open up new possibilities for regulation and manipulation of cell metabolism. This project will implement a biological XOR gate by exploiting a naturally occurring type of DNA called DNA ribozymes. These single stranded DNA sequences are able to bind to and cut sequence specific RNA sequences, almost like restriction enzymes for RNA. Combining DNA ribozymes with silencing of reporter gene expression will allow us to design a system which responds to inducer signals in an XOR-gate like fashion inside living cells. The XOR gate is perhaps the most challenging logic gate to recreate biologically, and a successful proof of concept would pave the way for similar implementations of other logic gates.:::2016
