USTC:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A Prion's Life::: USTC team focuses on a kind of yeast prion called Sup35. It shares some properties with normal prion, but it’s harmless. We know that Sup35 aggregates between 37℃ and 42℃, and Guanidine Hydrochloride (GDNHCL) induces aggregated Sup35 to separate. We decide to take advantage of three characters of Sup35: assembling, thermal control and reversibility. The first circuit is based on Yeast Two-hybrid System. The aggregation of Sup35 results in the binding of AD and BD, then downstream gene GFP expresses. In the second circuit, we split sfGFP, a variant of GFP, into two fragments: sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11. sfGFP11 is linked to Sup35. sfGFP1-10 spontaneously binds to sfGFP11 to show green fluorescence, however, aggregation of Sup35 inhibits the binding, thus the fluorescence disappears. Being regulated by temperature and GDNHCL, our circuits can be used as biological temperature control kill switch, as biological temperature indicator and in scientific research.:::2016
