Baltimore_BioCrew:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Genetically-engineering E. coli to Degrade Plastic using PETase and MHETase:::Plastics are a waste product that pollutes the environment we live in, and many solutions have been implemented with little long term success, such as Mr. Trashwheel and laws prohibiting the act of littering. Researchers, in 2014, have found a bacterium, known as Ideonella Sakaiensis, that is able degrade poly ethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics entirely using two enzymes. The Baltimore BioCrew wanted to design a bacteria that is able to degrade the plastics in our marine ecosystems at a rapid rate without harming the creatures within it. In order to investigate if this is possible, we obtained the two enzymes used in Ideonella Sakaiensis, PETase and MHETase, and inserted the enzymes into E. coli plasmids. We hope the E. coli bacteria degrades PET plastic within 1-3 weeks and produces a by-product that is benign to organisms and a possible energy source.:::2016
