BIT:::Asia:::China:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Alarm of Breast Cancer Based on Detection of MicroRNA-21 and MicroRNA-155::: In recent years, breast cancer has become one of the highest incidental cancer. If we can get early diagnosis and effective treatment measures,it will largely reduce the mortality of breast cancer. Studies have shown that when have breast cancer, the expression degree of microRNA-21 and microRNA-155 in the serum will be significantly higher than the normal one. Based on it,this project applies the artificial designed biological system to realize the detection of expression levels of microRNA in the serum environment and produce green fluorescent protein,then detect fluorescence by miniaturized signal hardware,through the mathematical modeling of the model to calculate microRNA expression level. Finally the data presented to the user directly by the hardware device or to their phones. This project is a real-time inspection system for breast cancer detection,convenient and quickly.It can provide patients with reference significance testing data, reduce the testing costs drastically,alleviate the contradiction of medical treatment system.:::2016
