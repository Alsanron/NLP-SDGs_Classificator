SYSU-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CRAFT – Community-based Retro-synthetic Analysis Functional plaTform:::Genetic circuit design based on targets and chassis choosing are two obstacles concerned in complex synthetic system design, which are time-consuming and convoluted with repetitive experiment and trial to determine the appropriate circuit. To address these problems, we developed Community-based Retro-synthetic Analysis Functional Platform (CRAFT), an open and self-acting software for user to customize their own circuit from base sequence level. CRAFT mainly consist of two closely interconnected modules, the automatic selection system, excogitating and choosing the most appropriate circuits and chassis species conform to user’s demand based on flux balance analysis (FBA), and the experimental scheme auto-generation system, providing standard protocol and unique data frame for previously selected pathways and chassis species, modifying FBA model with experiment data. In conclusion, our software have developed a more precise and self-revise system, integrating software design and experiment realization more closely, making complex synthetic system design accessible and practical.:::2016
