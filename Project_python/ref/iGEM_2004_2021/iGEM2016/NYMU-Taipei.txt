NYMU-Taipei:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::IOS-i-GEM:::Oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis) is a major invasive pest that causes billion-dollar worth of crop damage each year. Many methods are applied to control its population, however, each comes with its own set of disadvantages. That is why we looked to Metarhizium anisopliae to solve the problem. While its efficacy is limited by environmental factors like UV, temperature, and humidity, scientists have improved its virulence through genetic engineering at the cost of its survivability due to concerns over GMOs. This year, we aim to design a biosafety switch to avoid compromising its survivability, the in-out-suicide-in-genetically-engineered-Metarhizium (IOS-i-GEM). Comprised of hemolymph and blue light sensing mechanisms, the system allows the fungus to kill its host before inducing the CRISPR/Cas9 kill switch to cause genome-wide mutations. With the IOS-i-GEM system in hand, scientists could create different genetically modified M. anisopliae strains for different pests without worrying about their biosafety.:::2016
