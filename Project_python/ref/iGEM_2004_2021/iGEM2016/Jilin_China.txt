Jilin_China:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Development of a novel cancer therapy with genetic engineered Bifidobacterium:::Considering solid tumor cells as harmful mutants in the ecosystems in vivo, we propose a novel approach to eliminate tumor cells. Bifidobacterium has been proved to be non-immunogenic to normal cells, and has the ability to preferentially settle in hypoxic regions, including solid tumors. We plan to construct a recombinant plasmid, which consists of DNA replication origins and related genes from pMB-1 and pUC18. In addition, we will clone HU, a Bifidobacterium promoter, and TAT-apoptin gene with a N-terminal secretion signal peptide into this plasmid. As a result, the plasmid can be amplified in both E. coli and Bifidobacterium, and apoptin can be expressed in Bifidobacterium. The Bifidobacterium transformed with this plasmid can settle in the tumor regions, and secret the apoptin protein, which is specifically toxic to tumor cells. With the TAT-mediated membrane crossing, apoptin should be able to enter into solid tumor cells and kill tumor cells.:::2016
