TecCEM_HS:::Latin America:::Mexico:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Rapid test for HPV diagnosis via riboswitch technolgy:::Early detection of sexually transmitted diseases is of major importance given the broad range of consequences they have on public health. Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) has raised concern throughout Mexico because of its incidence. The virus has been characterised and documented at the genetic and proteomic levels, but given its pathophysiology during infection, diagnosis at early stages is somewhat complicated and unusual, particularly because of the absence of symptoms. Moreover, it is of crucial importance as some HPV strains have been shown to correlate with oncogenic outcomes. TecCEM_HS 2016 is developing a rapid test method by using the novelties of riboswitch technology. With careful and appropriate design, bacteria could serve as a signal provider that may give insight into the viral presence by means of fluorescence. The device would thereby provide a money-wise, quick, and reliable way of concluding upon Papilloma's infection, serving as an alert for further physician assessment.:::2016
