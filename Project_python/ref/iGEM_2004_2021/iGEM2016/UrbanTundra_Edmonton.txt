This project was inspired by the movie, “The Martian” and by the work of Davila et al (2013- Intl. J. Astrobiol) who proposed that toxic concentrations of perchlorate (ClO4) in Martian soil was a resource that could be exploited as a source of oxygen (O2), while remediating the soil in the process. Here we build on this work and others by: 1) testing the idea that that ClO4 can be highly enriched and concentrated inexpensively by selective ion exchange chromatography, 2) Converting ClO4 to O2 and Cl- using a strain of E. coli that has been engineered to express perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase (two enzymes derived from the soil bacterium Ideonella dechloratans) and, 3) developing a method for the conversion of colony bio-waste into a highly enriched media for bacterial growth.:::2016
