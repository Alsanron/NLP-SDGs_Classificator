Tongji_Shanghai:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::UCNP/C-dot/shRNA complex serving for lysosome escaping and cell-targeted apoptosis:::The up-conversion nano particle(UCNP) is a luminescent material which converts 980 nm light into 670 nm light. The carbon dot serves as photosensitizer intakes 670 nm light and brings heat effect, helps lysosome escaping. We joined two materials with SO2 and transport the complex into the breast tumor cell, start apoptosis by ROS from sodium copper chlorophyllin on C-dot. To solve the anti-apoptosis regulation, we designed gene-targeted shRNA attached onto C-dot. When it enters the cell, the shRNA silences SIRT1 mRNA to accelerate apoptosis. The UCNP complex provides solution of lysosome escaping and has higher efficiency than traditional photodynamic therapy.Further more,it shows high stability and low cell toxicity without light exposition ,to be considered a more advanced solution of breast cancer.:::2016
