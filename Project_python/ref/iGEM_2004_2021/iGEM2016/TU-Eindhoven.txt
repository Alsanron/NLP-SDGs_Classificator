TU-Eindhoven:::Europe:::Netherlands:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Novel small molecule mediated heterodimer and tetramer scaffolds based on T14-3-3 scaffold protein:::iGEM TU Eindhoven has developed new scaffold proteins that can control protein-protein interactions based on the 14-3-3 protein from the Tobacco plant (T14-3-3). In nature T14-3-3 proteins interact with the last 52 amino acids from the plant plasma H(+)-ATPase membrane protein (CT52). This binding is stabilized by the small molecule Fusicoccin, allowing chemically inducible assembly of CT52 on T14-3-3. In addition, CT52 has a free N-terminal end, enabling the attachment of proteins. In order to design new chemically controllable heterodimeric and tetrameric variants of T14-3-3, the Rosetta software package was utilized. These variants were used to bring CT52-fused proteins together on the scaffolds under influence of Fusicoccin, inducing the desired protein-protein interaction. Thus offering a way to chemically control protein-protein interactions. The heterodimeric scaffolds were used to test the viability of a chemically inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system and tetrameric scaffolds to test the viability of a Caspase 9 kill switch.:::2016
