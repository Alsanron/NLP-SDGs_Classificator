Saint_Rose_School_B:::Latin America:::Chile:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Bio-Lignin, a solution for the paper industry:::Currently it has been detected that the bleaching process in the paper industry generates most of the pollution and environmental issues that we know today, the main goal in the bleaching process is the elimination of the lignin out of the paper, having chromophore groups, responsible of a brown coloration on the unbleached paper pulps; it has been created different process decreasing the polluting factor, but has not been totally eliminated. In this investigation we propose the genetic modification of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a lignin degradative organism at contact with the cellulose which we can accomplish with a gene called Lignin Peroxidase, an enzyme that oxidizes substructures not phenolic of the lignin, removing an electron from this and generating cationic radicals which are attacked enzymatically, in this way in order to produce a biological bleaching method that allows reducing contaminants residues from the paper industry.:::2016
