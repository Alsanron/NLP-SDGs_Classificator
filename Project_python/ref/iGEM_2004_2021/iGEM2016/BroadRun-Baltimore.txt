BroadRun-Baltimore:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::The Butyric Acid Problem:::The Broad Run iGEM team is in its second year researching a synthetic biology solution to the aforementioned ceiling tile manufacturing problem. In collaboration with world industry leader, Armstrong World Industries, the goal of this year’s research was to draw closer towards an implementable solution with industry wide applications: through a deeper understanding of the problem’s source, the interconnected processes in the ceiling tile manufacturing operations where the problems manifests itself, and the design and experimental testing of the proposed solution. From information garnered through communications with Armstrong and USG, we postulate that excess starch is the source of the problem. The proposed solution is to degrade the excess starch, thus controlling anaerobic butyric acid production, through engineering yeast to produce amylase enzymes; an implementable solution that could reside in any part of the manufacturing plant, from the board mill to the primary or secondary water treatment plant.:::2016
