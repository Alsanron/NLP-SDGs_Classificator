Our project aims to reduce the amount of time and effort needed to maintain cultures through the creation of an affordable image analysis system that autonomously reads visual data to measure the current state of a culture and then determines whether to release inducer chemicals based on user input. Our project utilizes the violacein pathway to simulate other metabolic pathways with colored signals. By regulating gene expression in this gene set with two different inducible promoters, we are able to yield up to four different color outputs. These outputs are then measured by an open-sourced Raspberry Pi setup, which captures visual data via camera, measures the culture’s RGB value, and then directs the gradual release of inducer chemicals to maintain or change the culture’s color over time.:::2016
