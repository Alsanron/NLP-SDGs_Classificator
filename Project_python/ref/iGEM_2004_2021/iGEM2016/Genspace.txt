This process is mediated by a class of intrinsically disordered proteins called the Late Embryonic Abundant (LEA) proteins that become ordered when desiccated, thereby stabilizing DNA and protein cell components. Our team expressed tardigrade proteins in E. coli to investigate their utility as stabilizing agents for biological products, including live cells and purified proteins. Additionally, tardigrades have several properties like small size, transparent bodies, and constant cell number that make them a promising model for the study of developmental processes. To test their genetic tractability for use in such a model, we generated a CRISPR protocol for both knocking out tardigrade genes and heterologously expressing non-tardigrade genes within the tardigrade genome. Overall, our results show promise for the study of tardigrades for their resilience and developmental processes.:::2016
