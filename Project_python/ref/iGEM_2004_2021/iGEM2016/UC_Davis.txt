UC_Davis:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cyantific - A Pigmented Protein Alternative to Synthetic Food Dyes.:::Color is innate in food perception and consumers expect vivid colors -- beyond those already present in food. Due to backlash against artificial colorants, some large food companies have pledged to exclusively use natural food colorings, which may result in the disappearance of some brightly colored food. This is a complex transition as there are limited natural options for food pigment and the regulatory framework is evolving. In this project we show that cyanobacteriochrome (CBCR) proteins are a viable and natural alternative to artificial food dyes. Mined metagenomic data was used as a source of novel proteins to produce CBCR colors in an effort to expand the color spectrum of natural food dyes. In order to find the optimal genetic circuit for maximizing protein production, different operon structures were also explored in E. coli. Lastly, we worked towards expressing CBCRâ€™s in a GRAS organism, B.subtilis, to address human consumption concerns.:::2016
