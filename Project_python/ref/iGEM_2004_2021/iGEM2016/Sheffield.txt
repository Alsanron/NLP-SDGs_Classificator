Sheffield:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Iron & Blood: Using synthetic biology to develop a tool to diagnose bacterial infections:::Antibiotic resistance has been declared by the World Health Organisation as “one of the biggest threats to global health”. Over-prescription of antibiotics is a major issue promoting antibiotic resistance. We have designed a device that aims to rapidly distinguish bacterial infections, thereby preventing mis-prescription of antibiotics. In the war for iron, bacteria produce siderophores that scavenge Fe3+ from blood. In response, the immune system produces lipocalin-2 which sequesters siderophores. Lipocalin-2 levels can increase 5-fold during a bacterial infection. Our device detects this difference by utilising Fur, an iron-dependant repressor regulating levels of RyhB which acts as an inverter repressing GFP, our reporter protein. Therefore, bacterial infection results in a weak GFP signal in contrast to a strong signal in patients without bacterial infection. With our device, we potentially have the capability of rapidly determining the presence of any bacterial infection, enabling us to combat the mis-prescription of antibiotics.:::2016
