Ain_Shams-Egypt:::Africa:::Egypt:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CircRNA deregulation and HCC:::Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. Egypt has a one of the highest incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the world. Treatment options for HCC are limited and often inefficient. Circular RNAs(CircRNA) belongs to the family of noncoding RNAs. They play a role in gene expression regulation and act as miRNA sponge. Recently, it was found that their levels are deregulated in various types of cancer. Using bioinformatics analysis, we have identified certain circular RNAs that are down regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. So, we are aiming to design a system that can sense CircRNA deregulation in the HCC and respond in a way to restore the balance and equilibrium in the CircRNA environment of the cancer cells. Also, we are evaluating the therapeutic effect of CircRNA as a potential novel target for the treatment of HCC.:::2016
