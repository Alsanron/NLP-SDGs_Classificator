UT-Tokyo:::Asia:::Japan:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::changing gene expression of E. coli after each cell division takes place:::Like begets like. It is said that all living things inherit gene from their ancestors thus they resemble their ancestor. In some cases, however, this point of view is not appropriate to describe lives. DNA sequences are not the sole factor which decides how an organism lives. Other factors are also able to control phenotype beyond generations. The purpose of our project is creating a genetic circuit functional in E. coli which allows E. coli to switch or loop back its gene expression and phenotype when each cell division takes place. This will be achieved by the use of the nrd promoter to sense to cell division, three types of sets of sigma factor/anti-sigma factor/sigma promoter control transcription orthogonally to make 3 states of gene expression, and a toehold switch to create an AND gate required in the circuit.:::2016
