Leiden:::Europe:::Netherlands:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::E. colinizer: starting a garden on Mars:::Perchlorate (ClO4-) contamination of groundwater, surface water and food supplies is a widely spread hazard for the environment and our health on earth. However, it also poses a large challenge when colonizing our neighbour planet Mars. Martian soil contains 0.5 - 1% perchlorate, which therefore needs to be remediated in order to cultivate edible crops. The Leiden iGEM team will equip the bacterium Escherichia coli with the tools to convert the toxic perchlorate into chloride and oxygen by introducing a set of codon-optimized genes from Dechloromonas aromatica, encoding for the perchlorate reductase complex and chlorite dismutase. Besides this, we will study E. coliâ€™s gene expression under simulated Martian gravity (0.38g) using a Random Positioning Machine, to make sure that our system will function in a bioreactor on Mars. Altogether, our system is widely applicable to remove perchlorate from contaminated soils on earth, while also being useful for future Mars expeditions.:::2016
