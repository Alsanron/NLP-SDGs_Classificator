KoreaSonyeodul:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Able the PET Disintegration of Meal-worms:::Due to the increasing amount of plastic trashed, scientists are keeping their eyes on several ways to confront this environmental issue. One rising solution is the "Meal-worm". They can maintain their lives through consuming Styrofoam due to the microorganism in their guts that degrade the Styrofoam. A PS-degrading bacterial strain is called the Exiguobacterium sp. strain YT2. However,the big problem of the meal-worms is that they are not able to dissolve PET. Thus, we will insert the gene of this bacteria into E.coli by using the gene synthesis. Then, we will test the PET disintegration ability of meal-worms after feeding them the modified E.coli. Our hypothesis is that meal-worms will actively disintegrate PET after consuming the altered E.coli.:::2016
