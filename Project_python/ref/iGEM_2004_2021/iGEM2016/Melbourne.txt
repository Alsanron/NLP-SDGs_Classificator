Melbourne:::Asia:::Australia:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::StarScaffold - Creating better multi-protein structures:::Our project, StarScaffold, builds on the work of the 2014 Melbourne iGEM team on star-like peptides, a special type of protein backbone with 4 arms. Star-like peptides are an existing concept and have been demonstrated experimentally to have potential uses in augmenting enzyme reaction kinetics and improving performance of antimicrobial peptides. We aim to improve and optimise the design, primarily with the addition of split inteins. These are a special type of protein sequence which allow each arm of the peptide to be ligated to another protein of choice, which could be an enzyme or even other StarScaffold units. We are focusing primarily on two main applications for the StarScaffold; as a hydrogel with uniquely customisable physical and biochemical properties, and as a method of improving enzyme reaction kinetics. These technologies are currently growing in popularity and we hope our project can help improve the current state of the science.:::2016
