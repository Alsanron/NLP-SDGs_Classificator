Pumas_Mexico:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Synerg-G:::The problematic of fossil fuels has been widely known for many years, it is not only difficult to sustain the needed production, but there is a considerable amount of waste and gases freed to the environment during its use and fabrication. In many countries, the biofuels are being developed as an alternative to the conventional fuels, which brings many benefits like diminishing the Greenhouse Effect Gases, that keep affecting the earth atmosphere. In Pumas Synbio, this problematic is addressed by the genetic modification of the seaweed Chlorella vulgaris, with the objective to optimize the lipid production and facilitate collecting them without needing to sacrifice the biomass. The advantages are multiple, some examples might include that the production costs and time inversion is lower, the seaweeds can adapt and reproduce in any available space and scale, which makes it an efficient and cheap option to normal fuels.:::2016
