USTC-Software:::Asia:::China:::Software:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioHub:::Our project aims at designing a powerful and convenient tool for synthetic biologists to assist their research. It is web based and has a plugin system. As a web based software, it can be used on any platform and operating systems. Besides, since it's a plugin system, all of its functions are implemented as plugins, which makes it easy to be expanded. Any developer can design his or her own plugins and insert them into our software. This year, we will accomplish the whole framework and achieve the following features. 1. Provide guidance for experiments from simulation. 2. Automatically seek for pathways. 3. In-time edit of genetic circuits. 4. Data visualization. 5. A key to retrieve the major databases. 6. Cooperating and sharing based on account system. 7. Automatically search for relationship between genes from papers.:::2016
