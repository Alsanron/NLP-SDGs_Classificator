DTU-Denmark:::Europe:::Denmark:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::YEASTILIZATION - From Waste to Value:::We are currently consuming resources faster than our planet can replenish them, thus it is obvious that we need to rethink resource efficiency in the future. In order to achieve high resource efficiency in biotechnology, the employment of sustainable substrates in industrial processes is imperative. Due to recent developments in biotechnology, it is now both possible and desirable to use non-conventional chassis, rather than relying on traditional organisms. We propose using the yeast Yarrowia Lipolytica as an alternative chassis, as it has an unusually broad substrate range as well as great potential for the production of both proteins and metabolic products. Due to the limited tools available, thus far the use of Y. lipolytica has been limited to research. Our project aims to develop both molecular and bioinformatic tools for Y. lipolytica, in order to introduce the organism as an advantageous chassis for future bio-refineries.:::2016
