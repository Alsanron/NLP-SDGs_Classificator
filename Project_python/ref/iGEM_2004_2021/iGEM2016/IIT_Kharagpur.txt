IIT_Kharagpur:::Asia:::India:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Silkotron: A genetically engineered machine for efficient production and export of spider silk:::Spider silk is a very versatile material having applications in medical, engineering, clothing, biomedical and other such industries. Spider silk cultivation being a very slow and cumbersome process, we came up with an idea aiming at synthesizing recombinant spider silk protein (MaSp2) and producing it extracellularly in our model bacteria E. coli. Ensuring that the protein is secreted, we can change the nature of the production process from batch to continuous by reusing immobilised cells, and even use it for mass production. We aim at making two constructs for expressing silk outside the cell. We also aim at developing a novel detection system using FRET dye pairs. This system will primarily be used in monitoring and modelling the cleavage activity of the HIV protease used for selective cleavage and controlled release of the silk protein. CFP and YFP will be used as FRET dye pairs.:::2016
