UCLouvain:::Europe:::Belgium:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Gatekeeper : a new secreting method of recombinant proteins for E. coli:::E. coli still remains the first host used for recombinant proteins production, for research and bioindustrial purposes. The mode of production of these proteins is predominantly periplasmic. A cell lysis step is necessary to the recombinant protein extraction, limiting the yield and the purity of the extracted proteins and hindering continuous production. Our solution is the insertion of a phage porin in the outer membrane. We aim to condition the porin’s opening system to create a gateway between the intra- and extra-cellular environment by getting rid of the cumbersome lysis step. We will use a directed evolution approach to mutate specific regions linked to the gate opening and subject the resulting mutants to strong specific selection pressure. Through this method we will attempt to create a regulating system for our gate’s opening/closure. Thanks to the Gatekeeper, E. coli will be used in continuous reactors to produce recombinant proteins.:::2016
