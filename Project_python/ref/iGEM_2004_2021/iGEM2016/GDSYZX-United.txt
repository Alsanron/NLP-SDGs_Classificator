In this project, we built several genetic circles with the chloroplast protein HYPERSENSITIVE TO HIGH LIGHT1 (HHL1) which response to high light and functions in protecting PSII against photodamage. We further measured the expression efficiency of HHL1 promoted by various photosensitive promoters with high-light exposure, and named the most effective one as Super-HHL1. Moreover, we studied the potential application for Super-HHL1 agriculture and economic. Taken together, we suggest that Super-HHL1 might effectively help various plants repairing PSII under high light.:::2016
