UPO-Sevilla:::Europe:::Spain:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Transforming waste glycerol from biodiesel production using bacterial biofilms:::Pseudomonas putida is a soil bacterium capable of surface attachment and aggregation to form biofilms. Biofilms are excellent catalysts of biotechnological processes, as they are more efficient, robust and resistant than bacteria in suspension. Glycerol is a byproduct from the biodiesel industry that has become a preferred substrate for industrial fermentations. The purpose of this project is to generate a platform P. putida strain to catalyze biofilm-based conversion of glycerol to interesting end-products. To this end, we intend to genetically manipulate P. putida to incorporate a synthetic genetic switch that will allow us to reprogram bacteria either to induce robust biofilm formation appropriate for biocatalysis, or biofilm dispersal to allow easy recycling of the substrate materials of the reactor. On the other hand, we will use in silico predictions to rationally modify carbon assimilation and metabolism to obtain conversion of glycerol into products of potential biotechnological use.:::2016
