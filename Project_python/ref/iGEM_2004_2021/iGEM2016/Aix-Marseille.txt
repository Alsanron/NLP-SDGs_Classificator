Aix-Marseille:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Highway To Platinum:::Platinum is one of the rarest and most valuable metals in the world. Thanks to its physical and chemical properties, it has become pervasive in modern society. One of the main uses of platinum is in cars' catalytic converters, hence important concentrations have been accumulated over time in soils next to roads. Our goal is to recover this platinum as much as possible and obtain nanoparticles, in two steps. The first stage relies on the affinity of Desferrioxamine B, a siderophore, to bind platinum and so favor the further solubilisation of more platinum compounds. Secondly, a modified FliC protein complex will be cloned into E. coli and enable the biosorption of platinum on the flagella of the bacterium.:::2016
