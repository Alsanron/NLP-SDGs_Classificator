Toronto:::North America:::Canada:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cell-Free Synthetic Based Bioactive Paper for Detection of Gold:::We propose to develop a portable synthetic biological sensor for gold. A biosensor is a device that utilizes genetic circuits to detect and report the presence of specific compounds. Certain naturally occurring bacteria have the ability to sense metals such as iron, zinc, copper, silver, gold and cadmium. By using existing biological pathways, we will develop a cell-free paper-based biosensor that is easy to use, scalable and affordable for detecting gold. Our team will use of the transcriptional activator, GolS, which induces protein expression in the presence of gold ions. Downstream reporter genes will act as visual indicators. Using state of the art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, our team will engineer a colorimetric analytic tool for interpreting the visual indicators and reporting the presence of gold.:::2016
