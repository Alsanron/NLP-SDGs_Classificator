Bordeaux:::Europe:::France:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Sleep with EpiC elegans:::Sleep disorders such as insomnia and narcolepsy affect many people in their daily life. Today, there is no effective medication against these disorders. Actually, they only treat the symptoms, not the source. This year, iGEM Bordeaux 2016 aims to study DSIP, a sleep-inducing peptide which seems to be promising for helping to sleep. In order to understand in which mechanisms this peptide is involved, it will be produced by the bacteria E. coli and then given to the nematode C. elegans. The sleeping process of this nematode will be studied by using both a photo-inductible system and a CRISPR-methylase system called EpiCrispr, which is a modified CRISPR/CAS9 with the purpose of methylating genes participating in this process. The third project consist on study of the issue of plasmid propagation in bacterial populations by developping a computational model.:::2016
