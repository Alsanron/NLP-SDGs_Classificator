ColumbiaU_NYC:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mos(QUIT)o:::Every year 2.6 million people die from mosquito borne illnesses (MBI). Since there are no vaccines for many MBIs, the best option for avoidance is preventing bites. The project aims to engineer a repellent in which the bacterial species Pseudomonas putida (P.P.) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S.E.) synthesize rhamnolipids, a compound known to repel mosquitos. The following objectives were established: clone rhamnolipid-producing strains, test the safety/efficacy of bacteria producing rhamnolipids, and develop the product. The operon (RhlAB and RhlC) that produces enzymes in the rhamnolipid synthesis pathway from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cloned into P.P. and S.E. Mosquito experiments will confirm the quantity of rhamnolipids needed for full protection. Safety will be assessed using human skin cells and mouse models. The product will be maintained in a bottle with freeze-dried strains, rehydration media, and lotion suitable for human skin.:::2016
