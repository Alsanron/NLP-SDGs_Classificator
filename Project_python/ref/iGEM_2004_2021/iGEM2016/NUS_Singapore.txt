NUS_Singapore:::Asia:::Singapore:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: RIOT; Regulated Invasive Organism Targeting system for delivery of biomolecules in vivo:::Biomolecule delivery systems are often plagued by problems such as non-specific targeting and low bioavailability. Engineered systems that have the ability to sense and respond to specific stimuli present in the microenvironment of pathogenic cells are able to overcome these issues. We propose to engineer a dual-sensor bacterium that can sense increased metabolite levels in its microenvironment and then respond by delivering biomolecules into target cells. As a proof-of-concept, Escherichia coli was engineered to detect increased level of lactate, then respond by attaching itself to a cancer cell marker, and subsequently release biomolecules into the cell. A kill switch will be activated when there is insufficient lactate present, thus minimising non-specific targeting. In addition, our delivery system also has the flexibility to detect other environmental metabolites, together with the ability to engineer the bacterium to bind to other cell receptors for their detection and thus deliver biomolecules.:::2016
