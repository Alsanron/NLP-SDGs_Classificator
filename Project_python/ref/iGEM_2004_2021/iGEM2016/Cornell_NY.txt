Cornell_NY:::North America:::United States:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A novel bacteriocin treatment for bovine mastitis:::We developed our project through the eyes of dairy farmers, with whom we share the endeavor to cure bovine mastitis. By modifying the mastitis treatment and cow milking processes, we can help eradicate a disease that has evolved and resisted drugs throughout the ages. Through our three pronged approach, we believe that weâ€™ve done just that. Time for mastitis to moo-ve over and out. We target the most common bovine mastitis-causing pathogens with a panel of specific bacteriocin-derived treatments. Our system minimizes bacterial infection through our customizable preventative milking shell. Our system enables early detection with a mobile cow-side somatic cell counter microscope and data-logging smartphone app for farmer. We genetically engineered E. coli to produce 13 different bacteriocins to target common and historically significant mastitis-causing pathogens with greater specificity than traditional antibiotics.We created a novel, modular, customizable milking machine shell to prevent bacteria from infecting the cow. With automatic post-dip, UV sterilization, temperature detection, and cold shock functionalities to choose from, the options are limitless when it comes to preventing bovine mastitis.:::2016
