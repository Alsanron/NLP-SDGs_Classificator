Warwick:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Application of CRISPR/Cas9 as a novel modular biosensor:::By providing fast and cheap diagnosis, the socio-economic impacts of disease can be reduced on a global scale. We aim to build an RNA based detection system utilising CRISPR/Cas9 technology, specifically targeting infectious agents. Using a dCas9 protein and an RNA-binding protein (RBP) fused to an effector, transcription of a fluorescent reporter gene can be regulated, with a significant colour change indicating the presence of targeted RNA. This is due to the conformational change that occurs within the gRNA strand when the targeted foreign RNA is recognised and binds. As a proof of principle, the sensor will be modified to detect two bacterial diseases: Lyme disease and Leptospirosis, and potentially two heavy metal pollutants: mercury and lead. The modularity of the system should allow simple modification to change sensor-specificity. Bacterial lysates will be detected by reconstituting the detection machinery in a low-cost in vitro transcription kit, including a paper-based support.:::2016
