HZAU-China:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioPaFiAR: Bio-Pattern Formation in Augmented Reality:::Bio-pattern formation is the establishment of spatial patterns in morphogenesis. When guided by computer, the spatial pattern of a group of cells can be altered in an augmented reality space created by superposing a computer simulated virtual space on a real culture apparatus. In our project, light-switchable synthetic gene circuits are adopted to control the mobility of E. coli cells by light-mediated real-time communication between the real bio-pattern in culture media and its virtual counterpart in computer simulation to implement a synchronized growth. Eventually, the shape of the colony matches the preset pattern we want and thus a “what you see is what you get” platform for the study of bio-pattern formation is obtained. Our system can also be extended to eukaryotic cell community to modulate cell fates in the future which will be particularly useful in aiding the development of biological tissues and the regeneration of organs.:::2016
