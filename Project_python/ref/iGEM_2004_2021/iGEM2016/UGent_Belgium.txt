UGent_Belgium:::Europe:::Belgium:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biocatalyzed atmospheric condensation:::The access to water is a fundamental human right. This right has been referred to in a number of international documents over past decades and was specifically included in the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989. The U.N. predicts that by 2025, more than half of the countries in the world will be experiencing water stress or outright shortages. The former Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, states the 'Lack of access to water for drinking, hygiene, and food security inflicts enormous hardship on more than one billion members of the human family'. Our project consists of an optimized modular shape/surface for condensation and subsequent freshwater collection by gravity. Our modules will be 3D printed in an innovative desiccant filament that allows us to bind ice-nucleating proteins. The project primary focus it to enable bioprecipitation and recover freshwater by passive atmospheric condensation. Functionized 3D-printed shapes has a plethora of applications.:::2016
