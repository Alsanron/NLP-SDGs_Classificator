Manchester:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AlcoPatch â€“ Rethink your drink:::Controlling alcohol consumption can be difficult, especially amongst students in the United Kingdom. A non-invasive sweat patch that provides real-time monitoring of blood ethanol levels would revolutionise how we control alcohol consumption. Our proposed prototype, AlcoPatch, is based on studies that demonstrate the correlation between sweat and blood ethanol concentrations. Our AlcoPatch utilizes Escherichia coli as a chassis to engineer two different devices which would generate visible colour changes according to sweat ethanol concentrations. The first is a cell-free mechanism that uses alcohol oxidase, derived from Pichia pastoris, to initiate redox chain reactions required for the colour conversion of indicator dyes. The second manipulates an ethanol-inducible gene-switch system, derived from Aspergillus nidulans, to regulate the expression of chromoproteins. To guide our experiments, we use an innovative ensemble modelling approach to account for the uncertainty in our parameters. This enables us to predict the most cost-effective design options for prototyping.:::2016
