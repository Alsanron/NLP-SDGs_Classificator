By bridging the two opposite approaches together we have devised a method to create a modular nanowires. With DNA Origami, self assembling properties organize the DNA strand into patterns by using the local forces to find the lowest energy configuration, which is an Bottom-Up approach. To fold the DNA strand into a well defined structure using DNA staples is an example of Top-Down approach. DNA has many advantages over traditional materials such as biological compatibility, low manufacturing cost and the information regarding shape and size is carried over upon replication. Individual modules are 30-40 nm long 3D Structures with hollow cavity that acts as scaffold for the Gold nanowires. They self assemble into long nanowires and we attached photosystem II protein from the Synechocystis 6803 at one end of the wire to create a high efficiency machinery to harvest solar energy.:::2016
