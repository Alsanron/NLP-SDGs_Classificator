Hong_Kong_HKUST:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Tri-stable Switch:::Our team aims at engineering a biological tri-stable switch which shows high orthogonality as bistable switch in Escherichia coli. Building on the Brown 2006 and 2007 iGEM teamsâ€™ design, the tri-stable switch which consists of three alternating steady states that can be toggled by three different chemical inducers is improved. The construct was constructed with three promoters, lacp, phlFp and an ameliorated version of tetp together with their corresponding repressors. This combination enables the switch acting more stably by preventing it from reverting back to its natural states. Mathematical analysis was performed to ensure a stable and robust behaviour of the switch. Being orthogonal and more stable, the tri-stable switch could be applied in different fields, like biosensing and biocomputing. If the system is further studied and developed, it is foreseeable that it could contribute to the mature integration of different circuits in the future.:::2016
