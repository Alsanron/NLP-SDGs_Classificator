UChicago:::North America:::United States:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::It's About Time: Expressing the KaiABC Oscillator System in Yeast:::Disrupted circadian timing plays a role in many human diseases, yet designing interventions that specifically target circadian malfunction remains a challenge. It may be possible to restore circadian timing in animals transgenically using an oscillator network based on the KaiABC system, which consists of three core proteins that generate a 24-hour circadian clock endogenous to the cyanobacterium Synechocococcus elongatus. The Kai oscillator can be reconstituted in vitro with purified proteins, motivating a previous study to transplant it into E. coli (Chen et al, 2014). Successfully transplanting this dynamic system from prokaryotes to eukaryotes would represent an important step towards potential therapeutic treatment. Therefore, as a proof of concept, we aim to establish the KaiABC system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We will attempt to drive cyclic expression of GFP and RFP on alternating 12-hour cycles, thus inducing circadian expression of two temporally separated protein products in a non-circadian eukaryotic organism.:::2016
