Vanderbilt:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The CounterEvolutionaries:::The time has come for synthetic biology to free itself from the constraints of evolution. As an engineering discipline, synthetic biology depends on its genetically-encoded parts operating in consistent and predictable ways. Yet mutation and evolution break that predictability, altering the system’s behavior in disruptive or even dangerous ways, and selecting against intended transgene function. As long as evolution and mutation are allowed to proceed unchecked, the long-term stability, effectiveness, and safety of any genetic technology are at risk. Our solution began by characterizing a set of mutation-prone “hotspot” nucleotide sequences, which we then applied to create new algorithmic tools for modulating any gene’s susceptibility to mutation without affecting its function. With these tools we have achieved precise and predictable control over the frequency of mutation. Through rational design principles, our works shows that it is possible to counteract even the seemingly inescapable forces of evolution. Score one for engineering.:::2016
