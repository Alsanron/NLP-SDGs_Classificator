TEC-Costa_Rica:::Latin America:::Costa Rica:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Prostal: Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer by Fluorescent Protein:::In Costa Rica, a man dies of prostate cancer every 27 hours in average, mainly because of late diagnostic. This compelled us to design a new diagnostic method using molecular techniques. For this, we use dCas9, inactive variant of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, to bind to an RNA biomarker found in the urine of men with prostate cancer. This dCas9 is engineered with a protease, which is released when the Cas9 binds to the biomarker RNA, due to a conformational change. The released protease cleaves a fluorescent protein-quencher dimer, thus allowing the FP to fluoresce and generating a measurable signal.:::2016
