Korea_U_Seoul:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Geletricell : Agar Utilizing Dualcore EMFC:::EFCs and MFCs have been studied for many years using variety of biological fuels. Many obstacle of these fuel cells is that they often use food sources for humans. Also they only produce a small amount of electricity. The goal of our project is to improve both of these problems. We used agar as the fuel, which is very abundant in the ocean but is not a primary food source for humans. We also combined traditional EFC and MFC to create EMFC which uses shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and diaphorase simultaneously to generate electricity. First, E.coli that displays agar degrading enzymes degrade agar to produce galactose and NADH. Galactose is then used by E.coli to produce lactate and formate which shewanella oneidensis can use to generate electricity. NADH is used by diaphorase to generate electricity as well.:::2016
