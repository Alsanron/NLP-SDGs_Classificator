NRP-UEA-Norwich:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Assessing the potential of reductive pathways in Shewanella oneidensis to convert electricity to diatomic hydrogen:::Given a wide range of global challenges to traditional energy sources, including from climate change, renewable energy production must proliferate. However, intermittency limits economic viability of these systems; issues like 'peaking' of energy production are costly to mitigate. To overcome this, we are experimenting with Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, which possesses the MtrCAB 'molecular nanowire' complex. Using this system, electrons can channel into the cell and to hydrogenase enzymes that reduce protons to diatomic hydrogen, storing electrical energy as chemical energy within H2. The natural process yields low amounts of H2 and is not currently economically scalable. BioWire intends to increase H2 yields using a single vector that will express recombinant hydrogenase genes. Western blotting and gas chromatography will quantify protein expression levels and H2 yields, respectively. Thus, we hope to demonstrate the viability of S. oneidensis MR-1 to generate economically viable forms of energy as diatomic hydrogen.:::2016
