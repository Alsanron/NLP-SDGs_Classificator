Duesseldorf:::Europe:::Germany:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Optogenetic Induction of Apoptosis in Cancer Cells:::Our approach aims at achieving high spatiotemporal control of apoptosis in tumor cells by applying an optogenetic double-killswitch. This system combines clean removal of cancer cells through apoptosis with the precision of light-controlled optogenetics. We utilize two optogenetic proteins, namely Phytochrome B and LOV2. The red light switch based on Phytochrome B controls expression, while the blue light switch LOV2 controls localization of apoptotic proteins to their target site.:::2016
