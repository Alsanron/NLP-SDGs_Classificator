UCL:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BioSynthAge: Synthetic biology for increased healthspan.:::Ageing imposes permanent damage to cells in response to various forms of biological stress. The effect of free radicals has emerged as a major factor in molecular ageing of mammalian cells. We are developing a bacterial oxidative stress sensitive probiotic that releases lycopene antioxidant in the presence of oxidative stress in the gut. We are also taking forward a gene therapy approach to boost expression of the enzyme Superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the presence of oxidative stress signals. SOD therapy has the potential to act as a treatment against lung disease and has been proven in some studies to extend healthy lifespan. Hypertension increases rapidly with ageing and we have explored the potential of a antihypertensive dental device consisting of oral bacteria designed to produce nitric oxide precursors in saliva. Nitrite is swallowed and processed to produce Nitric Oxide which causes vascular relaxation, reducing blood pressure.:::2016
