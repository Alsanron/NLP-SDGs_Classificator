USNA-Annapolis:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Editing the Human Microbiome: Proactively Preventing Aerosolized Conotoxin Attack:::Conotoxins are small neurotoxins that bind to and affect the opening and closing of ion channels, thus altering membrane potential and disrupting neurological signaling pathways. Due to their small size, conotoxins could be easily aerosolized and could be used as biological weapons of mass destruction. Our goal of this project has two components. The first is to create a program to mathematically model both normal and conotoxin-affected intracellular ion concentrations. The second is to develop a signaling and responding pathway to detect changes in membrane potential and eliminate the conotoxins.:::2016
