TecCEM:::Latin America:::Mexico:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Fractos: Endolysin-powered antimicrobial system for selective lysis of Acinetobacter baumannii:::Acinetobacter baumannii is a pathogenic, opportunistic bacterium responsible for infections in hospital environments, mainly amongst patients at ICUs. Nowadays, it has drawn major attention given its ability to acquire resistance to commonly used antimicrobial agents. Due to the widely-spread resistant mechanisms among microorganisms, antibiotics have lost their efficiency at eliminating pathogens up to the point of being non-efficient at all in the treatment of certain infections. TecCEM 2016 team is developing a novel, specific method to avoid Acinetobacter baumannii proliferation onto nonliving surfaces through cell wall lysis, as an alternative to current antimicrobials that promote antimicrobial resistance development. The use of endolysins ensures the elimination of the pathogen of interest, as specificity for Acinetobacter baumannii increases its efficiency. The purpose of formulating a disinfectant driven by endolysins is the sanitization of surgery and nursery equipment as well as furnishing, and other objects that are potential transmission vectors for Acinetobacter baumannii.:::2016
