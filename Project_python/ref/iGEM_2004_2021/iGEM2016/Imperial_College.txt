Imperial_College:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Ecolibrium - developing a framework for engineering co-cultures:::In nature, microorganisms live together and cooperate to accomplish complex tasks. As synthetic biology advances, we transition from unicellular systems to engineering at the multicellular level. A major obstacle, however, is ensuring stable coexistence of different cell types in co-culture. This year we are developing a Genetically Engineered Artificial Ratio (GEAR) system to control population ratios in microbial consortia. GEAR will employ a bi-directional communication system and novel RNA control that can be implemented across different bacterial strains. We are also developing a software to facilitate the design and optimisation of co-cultures. In the future, we envision our GEAR system being used for distributed multicellular biocomputing and bioprocessing, as well as for microbiome engineering.:::2016
