NWPU:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Blue Leaf::: In many scientific fiction about interstellar travel, the device of carbon recycle is the most essential part. We propose to transform carbon dioxide to formaldehyde via electricity devices, and then engineer microorganisms to utilize formaldehyde to produce carbonhydrates .We expect to obtain a new kind of engineered E. coli that could fix inorganic carbon into carbonhydrates. We call this microbial device “Blue leaf”. The device consists of three parts, first we use electrical energy to convert carbon dioxide to formaldehyde, then use benzoylformate decarboxylase to catalyze formaldehyde into two and three-carbon intermediates, finally use fructose 6-phosphate aldolase to condense two and three-carbon units to form the five-carbon molecule-xylose. To some degree, this device could mimic the function of plant to biosynthesize xylose directly from carbon dioxide. We think the "Blue leaf" will be an indispensable device for astronauts, and human beings to explore new habitats on other planet like Mars.:::2016
