UPMC-Paris:::Europe:::France:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bee subtilis:::Bees are an important part of our daily life. Recently, they became endangered due to the Colony Collapse disorder (CCD) which itself has multiple causes including pesticides, pathogens and pests. Our goal is to modify Bacillus subtilis so it can detect some factors indicating beehives' health. This would allow beekeepers to take early measures to keep beehives healthy, and bee researchers to have an easy way to study CCD with the possibility of studying correlations between multiple factors. We plan to detect a bee pathogen, Paenibacillus larvae, sugar and heavy metals levels in bees through a color detection system. Once we obtain our proof of concept, this detection system could be used to detect additional factors indicating bees’ health by simply interchanging one biobrick to detect a new factor. Eventually, a “reverse API gallery” system could be set up with multiple factors detection using our “Bee subtilis”.:::2016
