Concordia:::North America:::Canada:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Combat Cells: League of Enhanced MicroGladiators:::Concordia University’s 2016 iGEM team has developed Combat Cells: League of Enhanced MicroGladiators, a novel project highlighting the entertaining side of synthetic biology. Our project consists of equipping microbes with nanoparticles and engaging them into battle. Nanoparticles were synthesized in different sizes, shapes, and compositions, using plant, chemical, and microbial based synthesis methods. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli were equipped with these nanoparticles on their cell surfaces using multiple bioconjugation methods to generate battle armours. The effectiveness of the armours were investigated under a gauntlet of environmental conditions. For the grand finale, equipped cells were introduced into a microfluidic chip called the Battledome, within which individual cells collide to fight until an ultimate MicroGladiator is determined. An entertaining and academic web-series was produced as a portion of our human practices work. It showcases cell battles alongside the research, serving as a tool to enhance the public’s discussion of synthetic biology.:::2016
