UNSW_Australia:::Asia:::Australia:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Bleb:::Some bacteria naturally bleb: a process whereby their outer membrane pinches in and buds off. The result of this is an outer membrane vesicle (OMV), a nanoscale lipid bubble, released into the environment. These OMVs can be decorated on the outside with outer membrane proteins, and can encapsulate periplasmic proteins within. Given this, OMVs have the potential to be tailored to a variety of functions, by targeting proteins either to the periplasm or outer membrane. This customisable nature means that OMVs could become a new platform technology for the application of future synthetic biology projects. Currently, however, there is no standardised system for inducing hypervesiculation in bacteria, and thus our project compares the effect of different genetic factors on OMV formation. With this data we will produce the ultimate strain of blebbing bacteria which can be utilised for the production of OMVs adapted for environmental, medical, or industry purposes.:::2016
