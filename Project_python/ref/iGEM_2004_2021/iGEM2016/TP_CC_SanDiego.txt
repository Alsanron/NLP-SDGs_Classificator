TP_CC_SanDiego:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Engineering Escherichia coli Capable of Extracellular Secretion of Chitin Degradation Enzymes LbCHI31 and LbCHI32:::Fungi producing harmful mycotoxins flourish on a variety of widely consumed crops, notably bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, and grains. Such fungal infections significantly reduce sustainability and food production in developing countries, where mycotoxin exposure from lack of advanced food storage are responsible for severe economic losses and 40% of diseases. As such, our team developed regulatable plasmids encoding secretable chitinases that hydrolyse the glycosidic bonds of chitin, a key structural polysaccharide in fungal cellular walls. By fusing LbCHI31 and LbCHI32 chitinase genes with a signal sequence from the alkaline phosphatase phoA gene, we successfully generated an Escherichia coli line that secretes chitinase specific to Fusarium oxysporum, a major pathogenic fungi. LbCHI31 and LbCHI32 expression and extracellular secretion were further quantified through characterization and analysis. This project will provide easily accessible, cost-effective methods for producing effective chitinases to combat fungal infections, thereby increasing crop yield, stabilizing financial growth, and reducing famine globally.:::2016
