Kyoto:::Asia:::Japan:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::'Norocatcher' combats against norovirus infections with surface expressing norovirus antibodies:::Even though Norovirus (NoV) remains a major cause of food poisoning in the world, we have not yet discovered an anti-NoV vaccine, or a curative medicine against NoV infections. To overcome this global issue, iGEMKyoto aims to develop an intestinal bioelimination system that can physically remove NoV from the body. In detail, we are creating recombinant E. coli expressing two types of surface-displayed proteins that each specifically bind to NoV and cellulose. By orally administrating this E. coli and cellulose to the patient intestine, this E. coli will bind to NoV, and would swiftly be taken out of the digestive system through its affinity to cellulose, as cellulose passes human intestine undigested. We have already produced the abovementioned E. coli, and confirmed its binding to Norovirus virus-like particles from images of a scanning electron microscopy. We will show further examination of characteristics of this device, such as its binding capability.:::2016
