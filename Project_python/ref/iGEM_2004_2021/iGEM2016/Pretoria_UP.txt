Pretoria_UP:::Africa:::South Africa:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::WattsAptamer: Synthetic DNA aptamers for thylakoid tethering in photo-bioelectrochemical cells:::The world population consumes approximately 3500 kWh/y/capita, increasing the demand for clean alternative energy. Recent improvements of photo-bioelectrochemical cells (PBEC), which harness electrons from photosynthesis to generate electricity, include synthetic attachment of chloroplast thylakoids to graphene electrodes. However, current attachment techniques require costly chemically synthesized linkers and PBECs are not yet efficient enough for industrial energy generation. In this project, DNA aptamers were designed and evaluated as low-cost biological linkers to tether plant photosystem II (PSII) complexes to graphene foam electrodes. Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX), together with software developed by team Heidelberg 2015 (MAWS and JAWS) were used to develop PSII- and graphene-binding DNA aptamer candidates. This project aims to improve the attachment and orientation of the PSII complex to the graphene electrode for higher electron transfer efficiency, and serves as a prototype for the in planta expression of RNA aptamers for self-assembling thylakoid attachment.:::2016
