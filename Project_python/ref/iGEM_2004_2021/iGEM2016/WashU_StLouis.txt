WashU_StLouis:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Super Cells: Overproducing ATP and Electron Donors in E. coli:::The Nitrogen Project, of which this iGEM team is a part, seeks to drastically reduce the quantity of nitrogen-based fertilizers used in agriculture. Soluble nitrates can “runoff” into water systems with environmental consequences such as algal blooms and human illnesses like methemoglobinemia. If nitrogenase, the enzyme in soil bacteria that “fixes” nitrogen gas into usable nitrates, can be inserted into plants, it would eliminate the need for artificial fertilization. Before this can be done, nitrogenase must first be expressed non-diazotrophic bacteria like E. coli. For proper expression, however, E. coli must have an excess of intracellular ATP and reduced electron donors. We worked to overexpress glycolytic kinases to increase ATP production and overexpress native and foreign electron donors to produce more reduced electron donors. Besides nitrogenase, however, the intracellular environment of our “super cells” may help produce other recombinant proteins.:::2016
