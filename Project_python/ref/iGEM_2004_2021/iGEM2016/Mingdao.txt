Mingdao:::Asia:::Taiwan:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Blood Alcohol Meter:::The testing method used these days seems to contain a few problems and wasnâ€™t that reliable to the public. Therefore, we started to aim at finding a better way to conduct the alcohol test. We did lots of research about how alcohol tests work and tried to find out the way alcohol reacts with the proteins and chemicals in our bodies or other organisms. We came up with the idea of imitating the mechanism that blood glucose meters equipped. We decided to oxidize alcohol and produce hydrogen peroxide to cause exchanging of electrons then detect it by blood glucose meters. Our bacteria will produce alcohol oxidase and display it on the cell surface, and we will remove the glucose oxidase in a blood glucose meter and replace it with alcohol oxidase. Voila! A portable and accurate blood alcohol meter was created.:::2016
