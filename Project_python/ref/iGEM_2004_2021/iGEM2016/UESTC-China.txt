UESTC-China:::Asia:::China:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Degrade plastic and produce isobutanol:::In view of increasingly serious issues on plastic pollution, greenhouse effect and energy shortage, various attempts were made to figure out approaches to settle these problems but we have not got the perfect answer yet. Inspired by the effort of Kyoto Institute of Technology, we come up with an idea to try solving these three problems by using synthetic biology methods. Plastic-degrading enzymes PETase and MHETase were produced by modified bacteria in order to hydrolyze plastics into TPA and EG, followed by a series of metabolism which transforms TPA into pyruvate, and finally, isobutanol was synthesized through pyruvate, catalyzed by two enzymes KDC and ADH. In a word, we use genetically modified bacteria to degrade plastic and produce isobutanol as clean energy.:::2016
