Stony_Brook:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Engineering Yeast to Develop a Novel Detection Method for the Pancreatic Cancer Biomarker Glypican-1:::Pancreatic cancer continues to have high mortality rates due the inefficiency of currently existing screening methods and treatments. Recent discoveries have demonstrated the heparan sulfate proteoglycan Glypican-1 (GPC1) as a more predictive biomarker for pancreatic cancer than the previously studied marker CA19-9. Additionally, GPC1 has been found to be present on exosomes in human blood serum before tumorigenesis. This project aims to use a biological system in S. cerevisiae to detect this biomarker via expression of the human Cripto-1(CR-1) transmembrane protein, a known binding partner of GPC1, as well as c-Src, a mitogen activated kinase. Binding of GPC1 to CR-1 leads to subcellular phosphorylation and activation of human c-Src kinase, resulting in downstream induction of the MAPK pathway. Through validated expression of CR-1 and increased phosphorylation of c-Src, this project aims to expand the potential for development of a non invasive biological sensor for early pancreatic cancer detection.:::2016
