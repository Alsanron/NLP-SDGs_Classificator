Bilkent-UNAMBG:::Europe:::Turkey:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Smelling Cancer - A VOC-Based Biosensor for Cancer Diagnosis:::Cancer is a complex disease related with uncontrolled proliferation of body cells. Having different types, each type of cancer has its own characteristics on molecular level. Different molecules are produced by cancer cells such as proteins, and secondary metabolites. Because of their specificity, they have been used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis over past decades. Recently, volatile organic compounds have been identified as biomarker to discriminate the types of cancer. In this project, we plan to construct bacterial whole-cell biosensors for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose cancer. Different VOCs will be sensed by different promoter/transcription factor couples, and they will be incorporated into circuits and logic gates operated by CRISPRi system in order to differentiate cancer types effectively based on existence of specific VOCs.:::2016
