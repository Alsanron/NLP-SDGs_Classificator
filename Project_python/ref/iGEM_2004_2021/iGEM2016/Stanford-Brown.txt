Stanford-Brown:::North America:::United States:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Towards a Synthetic Bioballoon::: Atmospheric exploration, both on Earth and beyond, requires putting instrumentation into those atmospheres. Traditionally balloons have been ideal tools for atmospheric research: to track weather patterns, wind patterns, and to monitor atmospheric composition. Our team is working to create a completely biological balloon that is light, that is potentially biodegradable, and that can be both continuously and sustainably produced. To make the balloon itself, we are engineering bacteria to produce membrane polymers with different properties. To inflate the balloon, we are using algae to produce biological hydrogen to fill the balloon. To increase balloon durability, we are looking for biological ways to make our materials radiation resistant. Finally, to functionalize our balloon we are creating biological temperature and small molecule sensors. When combined to form a biological balloon these projects could create a completely novel category of scientific instrument: cheap, light, durable, and useful.:::2016
