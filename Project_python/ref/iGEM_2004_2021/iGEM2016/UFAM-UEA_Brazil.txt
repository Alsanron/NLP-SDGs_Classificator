UFAM-UEA_Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Hydrargyrum - a revolutionary method to mercury bioremediation in E. coli:::Mercury is a highly toxic metal which is present in our everyday-life. In Amazon, mercury is widely used in industries and mining. Due to the absence of a strict regulation, itâ€™s estimated that there are about 3000 tons of mercury in Amazon, contaminating Amazon' biodiversity and native populations. Our main goal is to develop revolutionary bioremediation methods, structured as: Design and Characterization of a Library of new promoters regulated by mercury; Mer operon expression improvement; Build a unique Synthetic Phytochelatin and it's expression in the outer membrane; Scale-up and develop a bioreactor; Genome sequencing of wild bacteria present in Amazon. Alongside with a never done before approach, the project has a huge social work in: awareness of SynBio to communities; improving the regulation of disposal of Mercury at Federal Public Ministry; a step-by-step to develop SynBio and to participate in IGEM in Brazil and Latin America!
