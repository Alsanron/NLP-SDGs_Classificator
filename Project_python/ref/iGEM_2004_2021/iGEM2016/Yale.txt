Yale:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Optimizing multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) in the non-model rhizobia, Rhizobium tropici and Sinorhizobium meliloti.:::Multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) is a genetic engineering technique that increases genetic diversity by introducing synthetic oligonucleotides. Two strains of rhizobia were chosen to provide a framework for implementing MAGE in non-model organisms. To optimize MAGE in Rhizobium tropici and Sinorhizobium meliloti, several experiments were conducted, including characterizing the activity of pORTMAGE-3 in rhizobia. Current data indicates the successful transformation and stability of pORTMAGE-3 in rhizobia. To improve how oligonucleotides are stabilized during MAGE, a second experiment consisted of characterizing a library of beta-homologous recombinases to find a beta protein optimized for rhizobia. Synthetic entry vectors carrying each of the rhizobium-specific recombinases are currently being constructed. A third experiment is to characterize a library of inducible promoters hypothesized to be compatible with rhizobia and a set of Anderson promoters. These promoters are being characterized using a citrine fluorescent assay to determine the most suitable promoter strength when performing MAGE.:::2016
