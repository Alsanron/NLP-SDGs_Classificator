NCTU_Formosa:::Asia:::Taiwan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PANTIDE- A new agricultural system that eliminates targeted pests::: Spider venoms are disulfide-rich insecticidal peptides that target a wide range of ion channels in the insect nervous system. The spider-venom peptides have toxicity against insect species including Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), Diptera (flies and mosquitoes), and Coleoptera (beetles). In our project, engineered Escherichia coli expresses “PANTIDE family” including ω-hexatoxin-hv1a, μ2-segestritoxin-sf1a, and Orally Active Insecticidal Peptide (OAIP). To improve the oral activity, we fuse spider-venom peptides with snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis L.) lectin. The fusion peptides can be sprayed on crops and eliminate targeted pests by oral administration. The PANTIDE family is eco-friendly, bio-degradable and safe to mammals compared with conventional pesticide. Besides, a new agricultural system based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been designed using three parts: detector, sprinkler, and client. With the automatic system, farm owners can monitor the status in farmland and safeguard the ecological equilibrium remotely from the application in smartphones.:::2016
