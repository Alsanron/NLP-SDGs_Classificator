Leicester:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CHEESE (Calcitonin Hyper Expression using E.Coli in Space Exploration):::Within the next decade, we are set to see the launch of a vast number of human missions to Mars. However, a major issue associated with space travel is Osteoporosis, a condition where there is a decrease in bone density. Osteoporosis is treatable with calcitonin pills and nasal sprays but these treatments are ineffective. Therefore we propose to use CRISPR/Cas9 to create a model to stimulate upregulation of calcitonin secretion within E.coli as a new treatment. We will be constructing plasmids that contain the calcitonin promoter region and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. These plasmids will be transformed into E.coli where we will test for the upregulation of calcitonin secretion using GFP and calcitonin assays. If the project is successful, it would provide a stepping-stone towards further gene-targeted therapies to treat health conditions that are acquired from space travel and could be used to treat osteoporosis in the elderly.:::2016
