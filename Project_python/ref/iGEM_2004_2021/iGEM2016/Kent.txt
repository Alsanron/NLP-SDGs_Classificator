Kent:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Mag-nano-tite: Creating magnetite nanoparticles in E.coli:::Bacteria such as Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense grow magnetite nano-crystals that they use for orientation. These magnetic nanoparticles are grown from iron inside of organelle-like structures called magnetosomes. In this project, we will produce magnetite nanoparticles using a synthetic biology approach utilising enzymes involved in magnetosome formation. We will utilise proteins MamP, MamT and MamX, which were chosen due to their proposed involvement in promoting magnetite crystal maturation in M. gryphiswaldense. Each of the genes will be incorporated both separately and as a set into E. coli with the aim of producing magnetite crystals in vivo in the cells. The proteins will also be purified and tested in vitro. Our results will further our understanding of how bacteria cells are able to form and organise magnetite nanoparticles in magnetosomes, and demonstrate how synthetic biology approach can be used to make nano-materials.:::2016
