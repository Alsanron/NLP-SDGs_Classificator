BGIC_China:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Programmable and open-source test paper based on cell-free system:::We endeavor to create a test paper which is programmable, open-source and cell-free. The test papers contain genetic circuits which could measure the concentration of various target molecules in clinical and laboratory samples with visual and semi-quantitative results shown by reporter proteins. With a genetic device which acts as a signal amplifier, the system resembles the binary system of computer with enhanced sensitivity. The bionic and open-source nature of the test paper results in a high range of detection as well as high programability, while the cell-free nature removes interference between biological reactions inside the cells and allows its preservation under frozen condition for almost a year. The system can also be reprogrammed with the aid of our protocol, another proof of its potential.:::2016
