USP_UNIFESP-Brazil:::Latin America:::Brazil:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AlgAranha:::The objective of this project is to produce a biomaterial for immobilizing proteins initially directed to application on burns, using immobilized enzibiotics. The term "enzibiotics" refers to the junction of the words "enzyme" and "antibiotic," this is enzymes exhibiting antimicrobian activity. For immobilizing these biomolecules will be used gene recombination techniques, adding the polymerization domains in the enzibiotic molecule, compatible with the spider silk proteins. Both will be produced in recombinant microalgae by nuclear transformation of model microorganism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The project will be executed by group of undergraduates and graduate students in the context of iGEM. It is expected to achieve spider silk fiber production and its initial characterization for antimicrobial activity and mechanical properties, as well as the productivity evaluation in the proposed system. From these results, we can evaluate the application of this immobilizer in other biotechnological applications such as biotransformation, biosensors, biomaterials and textile industry.:::2016
