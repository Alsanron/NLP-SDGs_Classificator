It is able to degrade PET - a common consumer plastic - into terephthalic acid, which poses no threat to our environment. We aim to isolate the two enzymes within Ideonella sakaiensis that undertake this reaction, PETase and MHETase, and express them in Escherichia coli. PETase first breaks down PET into methyl-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate or MHET. MHETase then converts MHET into terephthalic acid. The two enzymes will be assayed for activity, after which we shall analyse them using Cryo Electron Microscopy to produce a 3D structure with a point resolution of 0.27 nm. We then aim to secrete these enzymes into the periplasm of the bacterium using the OmpA secretion system within E. coli. This will be achieved by fusing a leader sequence to the two enzymes from the OmpA gene.:::2016
