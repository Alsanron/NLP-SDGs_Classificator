Peshawar:::Asia:::Pakistan:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biosensor for detecting levels of CO and NOx in vehicle emissions:::Air pollution is a major global problem, a significant amount of which is caused by vehicular emissions. This problem is particularly prevalent in developing nations, where regulations regarding vehicle emissions are either not present or not properly implemented. Carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen are two dangerous constituents of exhaust fumes. Our aim is to produce a portable, quick and easy to use Biosensor device for environmental law enforcement agencies and even consumers that can detect for levels of carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen in vehicle exhausts and express corresponding chromoproteins as a result. The system is based on two separate gas-sensing mechanisms that work together to give a range of results. The mechanism sensing for carbon monoxide uses the CooA transcription factor and two CooA dependent promoters: CooF and CooM. The NOx sensing mechanism uses the NsrR repressed promoters, YeaR and NirK, as well as the NorV promoter.:::2016
