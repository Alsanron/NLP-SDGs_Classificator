Uppsala:::Europe:::Sweden:::Hardware:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Chipgineering - Microfluidics, now for everyone:::Microfluidics already allows us to scale down a wide range of experiments, streamlining and lowering their cost. Creating microfluidic chips can however be very expensive, since certain expertise and special equipment are required. Our goal was to develop a method of making microfluidics more available to iGEM teams and researchers, while also creating tools that could be combined with these chips. By 3D-printing the molds for the chips we were able to produce cheap, high resolution devices capable of transforming E.coli more efficiently than standard protocols for transformation. We also characterised and added to the registry the recently discovered CRISPR associated protein CPF1 as well as the fluorescent protein UnaG. As CPF1 has been shown to be more effective than CAS9 in certain aspects, and UnaG being half the size of GFP, we thought these proteins would greatly assist future iGEM teams, especially in combination with microfluidics!:::2016
