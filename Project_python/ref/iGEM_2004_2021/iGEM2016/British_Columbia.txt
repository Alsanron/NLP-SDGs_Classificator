British_Columbia:::North America:::Canada:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Crescentium:::Petroleum-derived chemicals are used as building blocks for a variety of products used in daily life, and while critical, their overuse has had significant negative environmental and societal impacts on the world. Finding alternatives to petro-chemicals is highly desired as we transition to renewable sources. Lignocellulosic biomass represents a sustainable feedstock for energy, chemical, and material production. However, efficient deconstruction and valorization of biomass remains a hindrance to its utilization in next generation biorefineries. To harvest the fermentable sugars and aromatics in plant biomass, a consolidated bioprocessing approach is currently needed to provide a cost effective and efficient scheme for funneling lignocellulose into high-value biochemicals. Here, we have constructed a microbial community of E.coli and Caulobacter crescentus, both synergizing in the degradation of biomass through the display of biomass transforming enzymes on the S-layer of C.crescentus; and the funneling of fermentable sugars and transformed aromatics into high-value biochemicals through E.coli.:::2016
