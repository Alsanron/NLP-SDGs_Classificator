Gaston_Day:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Escape and Die: Preventing the Lateral Transfer of Antibiotic Resistances.:::Laboratories around the world use antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Resistance can spread from non-harmful strains of bacteria to potentially dangerous ones if these bacteria escape the laboratory. This year our team continued work on a passive killswitch for E. coli K12. The goal is to prevent environmental contamination by programming a death response in the absence of arabinose. After researching toxins for E. coli K12, we selected colicin E7, which E.coli produce to eliminate competition between species. Colicin E7 is FDA approved as harmless to Eukaryotic cells. The tetracyclin repressor protein is produced using an arabinose inducible promoter and the colicin gene is behind a tetracyclin repressible promoter. If the level of arabinose falls, as would happen in an accidental release, the Tet repressor will not prevent colicin production and consequently destroy the bacteria.:::2016
