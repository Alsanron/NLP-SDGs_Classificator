Missouri_Rolla:::North America:::United States:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Defending North American Bats Against White Nose Syndrome (WNS):::North American bats are suffering from an emerging fungal disease called White Nose Syndrome. Affected hibernacula often face mortality rates in excess of 80%, an unsustainable loss in animals that only have one offspring per year. As it spreads, the disease impacts many bat species with roles in pest control and pollination. Last year, we looked into modifying E. coli so that it would produce the volatile organic compound ocimene, which has been shown to slow fungal growth. This year we are continuing this work and are also investigating ways to sense WNS to attempt to impact the cave environment as little as possible and target the fungus directly. We aim to analyze the use of leupeptin A and B found in S. roseus to possibly inhibit the fungus’s ability to degrade collagen, one of the many affects from the fungus’ metabolism of the bats’ skin and wings.:::2016
