Oxford:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Cure for Cu: Probiotic copper-chelating bacteria as a treatment for Wilson’s disease:::Wilson’s disease is a genetic disorder in which the body is unable to fully metabolise copper. This results in copper accumulation, causing liver and brain damage if untreated. Patients describe current treatments as unsatisfactory due to their costliness, side effects, and dosage frequency. We hope to show that E. coli engineered to express copper chelators originating from M. trichosporium and Mycobacterium spp. reduces copper ion concentration in vitro. This has applications as a potential probiotic treatment for Wilson’s disease, without the limitations of current treatments. We propose an encapsulation system that protects bacteria from simulated stomach conditions and may serve as a mechanism to deliver the probiotic to the small intestine, the site of copper absorption.:::2016
