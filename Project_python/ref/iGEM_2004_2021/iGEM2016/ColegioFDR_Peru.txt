ColegioFDR_Peru:::Latin America:::Peru:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Fós (φως): Engineering a 3D-Printed Bioluminescent Reading Lamp:::Access to electricity and energy infrastructure is a significant issue. In Peru, nine percent of the population, roughly 2.7 million people, do not have access to reliable power and have no way to light their homes. Young students are not able to adequately carry out their education without access to this fundamental resource. We set out to tackle this issue through the development of an open source 3D printed bioluminescent reading lamp. By optimizing and cloning the bioluminescent pathway into E. coli with the use of lux genes and an Anderson Promoter, we were able to create dependable bacteria as a source of illumination for these aspiring scholars.:::2016
