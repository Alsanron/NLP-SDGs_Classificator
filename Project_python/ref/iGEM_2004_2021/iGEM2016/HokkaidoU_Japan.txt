HokkaidoU_Japan:::Asia:::Japan:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Self-assembRing:::Circularization of a protein is one of the ways to enhance its stability against various temperatures and pH levels. This year, HokkaidoU_Japan challenged ourselves to circularize proteins using self-assembling peptides and linkers. Self-assembling peptide (SAP) is an amphiphilic peptide which self-assembles under physicochemical conditions. We made SAPs fused to link ends of the protein. We also inserted cysteine residues in the linker which is essential for the circularization so that they form a disulfide bond. This linker put on the both ends of a protein would make some strong bonds. Our linkers are expected to be applicable to most proteins. These two elements - the self-assembling peptide and the linker - enable the protein to be circularized.:::2016
