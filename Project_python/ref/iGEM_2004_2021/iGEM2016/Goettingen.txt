Goettingen:::Europe:::Germany:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::B12 Synporter: Another Brick in the Wall:::Vitamin B12 is involved in metabolic functions in all organisms and is an essential nutrient. It is for example a compound in vitamin pills and needed for production of various organic substances. Since the chemical production of Vitamin B12 requires 70 synthesis steps, the production technically challenging and expensive. B12 production is facilitated by engineered bacterial production strains, which achieve a high product quality. However, the produced Vitamin B12 is not exported by the production organism and is harvested by cell lysis. This prevents a cost efficient production. To date, a natural cellular Vitamin B12 exporter is unknown. We intend to design, construct and introduce a synthetic Vitamin B12 exporter into a production organism. By establishing a Vitamin B12 exporter, we aim for higher yields in the industrial Vitamin B12 production without lysing the cells. Furthermore, the production efficiency of Vitamin B12 production strains should be increased.:::2016
