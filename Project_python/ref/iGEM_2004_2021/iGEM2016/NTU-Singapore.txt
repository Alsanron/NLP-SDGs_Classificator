NTU-Singapore:::Asia:::Singapore:::Measurement:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Improving the CRISPR/Cas9 Tool Kit: Editing and Regulating:::Our project this summer aims to improve the CRISPR/Cas9 Tool Box for genome engineering and regulation. The Cas9/Cpf1 protein is widely adopted for it’s easy programmability to generate a targeted double strand break. The cell’s repair machinery would then mend the breaks which allows us to make edits to the DNA. To date, several question regarding this technology have been left unanswered. Firstly, despite the variety of Cas9/Cpf1 protein discovered, we still do not know the efficiency of each protein when compared to each other. Furthermore, the cutting efficiency for different cut sites varies. The populaity of this technology come from it's ability to enhance the rate of knock-ins. However, it's efficiency still remains to be improved as efficiencies varied between target sites. The goal for our team is to make a thorough comparison among different Cas9 proteins and improve it's efficiency in genomic editing.:::2016
