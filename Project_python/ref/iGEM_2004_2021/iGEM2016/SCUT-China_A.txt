SCUT-China_A:::Asia:::China:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Sulfur killer —— An Engineering Bacteria Strain for Highly Effective Biodesulfurization:::As we know, the consumption of oil——one of the most important fuels in the world, has caused many serious environmental issues including acid rain, which has caused serious damage to the buildings, plants, and animals and so on, mainly due to the sulfur element contained in the oil. To reduce the destruction of sulfur, many traditional desulfurization methods have been studied and applied on industrial desulfurization, such as Oxidative desulfurization and hydrodesulfurization. But these methods have many shortcomings such as the poisonous gas products and high cost at energy. To compensate for weakness in the traditional desulfurization, we decide to adopt the biodesulfurization method, which is far more environmental and energy-saving. In order to meet our expectation, we are devoting to highly effective biodesulfurization through 4s-pathway by using engineering bacteria.:::2016
