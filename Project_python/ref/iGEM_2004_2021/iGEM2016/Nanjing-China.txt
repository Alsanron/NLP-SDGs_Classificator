Nanjing-China:::Asia:::China:::Energy:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::HydroMagic:::The current world is undergoing a global energy change. Among all possible substitutes for fossil fuels, hydrogen serves as a praising future energy form. In this yearâ€™s iGEM competition, our team intended to harness solar energy to drive whole-cell hydrogen production in air conditions. We constructed a recombinant strain of Escherichia coli over expressing the indigenous [Ni-Fe] hydrogenase Hyd1 and relevant maturases. Energy of photons are transformed to excited electrons by semiconductors such as TiO2, and methyl vionlogen transports the electron to the biocatalyst. Noting that hydrogenases are commonly sensitive to oxygen, we constructed special silica encapsulation forming an anaerobic environment within bacteria cell clusters to avoid oxidative damage. The combination of biocatalyst, semiconductors and silica then leads to in air light-driven hydrogen production. This project sparks new light onto chemical-biological hybrid methods in the development of new energy forms.:::2016
