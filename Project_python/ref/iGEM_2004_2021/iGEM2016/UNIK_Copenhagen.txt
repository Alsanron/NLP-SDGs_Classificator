UNIK_Copenhagen:::Europe:::Denmark:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::CosmoCrops: A modular platform for sustainable bioproduction in space:::Space missions face the problems that transporting mass is expensive and the needs of long expeditions are unknown in advance. It would be revolutionary to have the capacity to manufacture various resources needed without prior knowledge of exact mission requirements. We have designed a modular co-culture system to accomplish this: containing the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus to use CO2 and light, which are plentiful on Mars, to produce sucrose. This is used as a common feedstock by Bacillus subtilis to generate essential end-products. We used polylactic acid as a proof-of-concept, since 3D printers can use it for tools and machine parts. To examine the co-culture’s practicality in extraterrestrial environments, the cutting-edge Jens Martin Mars Chamber was used to test stresses including UV exposure and pressure extremes. We propose that Bacillus’s sporulation ability will enable missions to maintain libraries of strains for constructing a versatile array of materials for future space exploration.:::2016
