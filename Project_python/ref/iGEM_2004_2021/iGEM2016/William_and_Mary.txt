William_and_Mary:::North America:::United States:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::The Circuit Control Toolbox:::We present a toolbox of BioBrick parts which can orthogonally modify the input-output response of arbitrary genetic circuits. By applying our decoy binding arrays, RBS library, and synthetic enhancers to their circuits, biologists will be able to tune their circuitsâ€™ sensitivity to input, magnitude of response, and number of distinct output states. We thoroughly characterize the behavior of each toolbox part and incorporate this information into a comprehensive mathematical model called the Circuit Control Calculator, which guides users on how best to use our toolbox to achieve a desired response in their circuit.:::2016
