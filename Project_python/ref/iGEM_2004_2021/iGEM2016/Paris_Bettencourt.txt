Paris_Bettencourt:::Europe:::France:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Frank&Stain: Enzymetic alternatives to perchloroethylene for stain removal from fabrics:::Dry cleaning is the removal of stains from delicate fabrics using solvents other than water. The most widely used solvent in dry cleaning is perchloroethylene (PERC), a volatile carcinogen that is increasingly banned and restricted for environmental and safety reasons. Our team is using synthetic biology to replace PERC with a biological alternative. To do so we are screening samples from all around the world to look for stain-digesting microbes, we are characterising candidate enzymes with putative stain digesting activity, and we are searching for fabric binding domains to enhance their stain fighting power! With some microbiology, synthetic biology, metabolic engineering and a lot of creativity we will find a green technology to make dry cleaners forget all about PERC.:::2016
