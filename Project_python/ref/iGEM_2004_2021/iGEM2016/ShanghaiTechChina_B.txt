ShanghaiTechChina_B:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted::: Gut Adventure of Agent Gutrio:::Currently, treating bowel disease is like an impossible mission. Hereby, we intend to create a magic agent Gutrio （a combination of GUT and the adventurer MARIO) which will lock on targets, adjust its weapon type and even call reinforcements in order to accomplish its mission. Be specific, we take inflammatory bowel disease as an example, and create an biological agent that is capable of a series of manipulated action, including detection, quorum sensing, healing and terminating themselves after the mission. Then we will send Agent Gutrio to start a remedial journey in fighting human bowel disease. We may shield this agent with designed ‘warship’ if necessary. The molecular bullet in our demo is epidermal growth factor as well as a combination of these molecules and biofilms. We hope this novel approach will be efficient for treating IBD and can be applied as a platform for treating other diseases as well.:::2016
