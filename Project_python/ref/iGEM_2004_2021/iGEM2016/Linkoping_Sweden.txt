Linkoping_Sweden:::Europe:::Sweden:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::A CRSIPR case for biofuel:::This year LiU iGEM will be a part of the search for alternative energy sources, this as a result of global warming due to excessive use of fossil fuels. For this we will use CRISPR/Cas9 in unicellular model algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which has shown great potential for production of biofuels. Previous research has attempted to modify algae to promote the lipid synthesis thereby optimizing them for biofuel production. In this project we want to create new Biobricks consisting of inducible promoters to couple with a CRISPR/Cas9-system in C. reinhardtii. The reason for the inducible promoters is to avoid complications such as toxicity of a constitutively active Cas9. By causing cultures of algae to undergo genetic modification in response to high intensity light we believe we can solve this problem. With this method genes can be targeted in the model algae in order to regulate the lipid synthesis.:::2016
