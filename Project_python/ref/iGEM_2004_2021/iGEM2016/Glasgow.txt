Glasgow:::Europe:::United Kingdom:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::GlasYo: Combating Vitamin A deficiency with engineered yogurt bacteria::: Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable blindness in children and can increase the risk of severe infections by weakening the immune system. To combat this deficiency, our project aims to create a yogurt enriched with β-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. We will insert the required genes to produce β-carotene (four crt genes with a promoter) into S. thermophilus, a lactic acid bacteria used in natural yogurt. We also aim to better characterise S. thermophilus to facilitate its use in synthetic biology. Our conversations with different stakeholders have led us to design a self-inactivating mechanism to ensure the modified bacteria do not survive in the human GI tract. These interactions also encouraged us to create a piece of accessible hardware to enable people in countries most affected by vitamin A deficiency to manufacture their own yogurt from a starter culture.:::2016
