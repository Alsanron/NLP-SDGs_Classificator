Current methods including physical-chemical remediation, phytoremediation and others are limited to deal with heavy metal pollution. We proposed a new approach named gut remediation to reduce bioaccumulated heavy metals in fish by gut microbiota. We designed a polypeptide which can bind to heavy metals including mercury and copper. Then a novel gene Metal Catcher was designed based on the polypeptide with GFP and N-terminal region of INP. Subsequent display of Metal Catcher on the E. coli surface showed highly sensitivity and selectivity of copper, mercury and cadmium, and permitted selective adsorption of copper, mercury. Then, we fed cyprinoid fish with the transformant strains. Result showed that experiment group have lower accumulation of heavy metals compared to the control. Therefore, gut remediation is an ideal approach to control heavy metal contaminations in fish.:::2016
