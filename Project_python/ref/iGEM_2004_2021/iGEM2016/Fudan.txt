Fudan:::Asia:::China:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::AdVENTURE: Replicative-deficient Adenovirus Targeting at Cancer Energy Pathways:::Abnormally active energy pathways like glycolysis or glutamine metabolism character cancer malignant proliferation and metastasis. Researchers have managed to use chemical or biological methods to block these ways individually in vitro and achieve remarkable effect on cancer cell, but these could never be turned into practical use. We adopt safe replicative-deficient adenovirus to deliver tandem shRNAs targeted at several metabolic pathways simultaneously, which are driven by cancer-specific promoter. To test efficiency of different ways to assemble shRNAs in series, we also design a switch to control their expression in vitro. This engineered adenovirus, which we called ‘AdVENTURE’ would be a powerful and precise tool among various cancer therapies.:::2016
