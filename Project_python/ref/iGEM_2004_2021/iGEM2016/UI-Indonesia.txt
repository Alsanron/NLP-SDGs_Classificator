UI-Indonesia:::Asia:::Indonesia:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Project HI,Vax!:::Although antiretroviral therapy has allowed for the management of HIV infection, being a lifelong therapy, it has significant economic burden, side effects, and risk of resistance. A therapeutic DNA vaccine is the best candidate for a cure for HIV infection, but DNA vaccine trials have so far been unsuccessful due to silencing of the antigen-coding gene and/or insufficient innate immune activation. To address this problem, we designed a vector with a synthetic promoter (based mainly on the ckm and itgax genes) designed to facilitate strong expression in muscle and myeloid cells, blocks of CpG DNA motif designed to stimulate innate immunity through toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), and a dsRNA-coding Pol III-dependent gene designed to stimulate innate immunity through retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) receptor. This vector will allow for the development of a new generation of highly potent DNA vaccines against HIV, hence the project designation HI,Vax!:::2016
