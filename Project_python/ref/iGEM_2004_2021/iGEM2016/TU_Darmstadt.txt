TU_Darmstadt:::Europe:::Germany:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Colicide Squad - glow before you go:::As the field of synthetic biology increases and becomes more present in the everyday live the topic of bio safety becomes more important likewise. However, there are no functional safety approaches available from previous years that the teams could easily choose and apply on their current projects. To this end, we want to generate a safety approach to enable all iGEM Teams to work safely with E.coli. A genetic circuit is integrated into the E.coli genome ensuring that genetically modified E.coli cannot survive outside of the required conditions. This genetic circuit is based on the availability of an unnatural amino acid (UAA) which continuously has to be added to the medium. A reporter protein is expressed as the level of UAA in the medium decreases, signalizing the low UAA concentration. If the level decreases further, the expression of colicin is induced, resulting in the death of the bacteria.:::2016
