BIT-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Plasmid-Sensing Logically and Adjustably Cell Killer (P-SLACKiller):::Genetic engineering bacteria have revolutionized human society and one of the most commonly used vectors are plasmids. However, the plasmid as a powerful tool has some natural limits like the segregational instability which may cause the change of population structure. This year our project aims to prove a new concept of plasmid quorum sensing which can be applied to control the plasmid numbers quantitatively and preventing the losing of recombinant plasmids in the same time. Compared with the traditional methods like using antibiotics or auxotrophic bacteria, our project can be more intelligent and controllable. In response to the inhibitor protein which is used as the signal indicating the plasmid numbers, the killer system will be turned on or off. According to our design, E.coli containing less plasmids than the threshold that has been set theoretically will be defined as slackers, and they be killed to optimize the population structure.:::2016
