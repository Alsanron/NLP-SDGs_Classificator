BGU_ISRAEL:::Europe:::Israel:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::PlastiCure: Offering an effective and energetically favorable biodegradation solution for PET:::The plastic waste problem has taken its toll on the environment and affects diverse eco systems. Many solutions are available, but their side effects are damaging the environment due to plastics toxicity. As plastic was only recently introduced to nature, native biodegradation solutions are not sufficient to overcome the massive amounts of plastic debris in oceans and land. Our goal is to improve biodegradation solutions using synthetic biology tools, from force evolution of a polyethylene degrading bacterium, through protein engineering of PET degrading enzyme, to genetically engineering a metabolic pathway that will enable our selected bacteria to consume PET as a sole carbon source. Moreover, utilizing the high energy stored in PET, electrons released from PET oxidation will be immediately harnessed at an anode of a biofuel cell for electricity production. Thus, our project will provide a clean, productive and energy efficient process for plastic biodegradation.:::2016
