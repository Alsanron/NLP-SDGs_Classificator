IIT_Delhi:::Asia:::India:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::HOT-FM – A novel Highly Optogenetically Tunable Frequency Modulator:::We aim to construct an oscillator which is a modification of a regular two component oscillator as given by Danino et al. Our project involves modifying this oscillator to make it optogenetically tunable. Once this system is shined upon by green light of wavelength 550nm, it causes a change in the frequency of the oscillations of this Danino oscillator. This de novo oscillator is more robust, and it’s oscillations sychronise spatially over a shorter period of time, and has the advantage of being highly specificly tunable, due to it’s non invasive and non – chemical based induction via light. This is also the first optogenetically controlled oscillator, apart from being a great new tool in the arsenal of synthetic biology, can have a wide range of applications ranging from time based drug delivery, to study correlation of genes, and to create analogues of memory storage in the two different states.:::2016
