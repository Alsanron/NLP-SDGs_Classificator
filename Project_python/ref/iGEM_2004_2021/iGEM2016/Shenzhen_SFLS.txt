Shenzhen_SFLS:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::HCV Hunter: A Paper-based HCV Detection Method:::Hepatitis C is an infectious disease found worldwide caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. The need for effective early-stage detection methods is urgent. However, due to defects such as complexity and high cost, the promotion of current methods is hindered. Thus, we come up with a new type of low-cost and high-sensitivity testing method. Freeze dried on paper with cell-free expression system, each plasmid consists of a strong promoter, a toehold switch and a downstream reporter gene, functioning as a biosensor. The reporter gene is activated only when a specific sequence of HCV RNA binds the toehold switch, and therefore enabling qualitative and quantitative assay of HCV. Our method has great advantage in sensitivity and the range of application, providing accurate information for subsequent treatment.:::2016
