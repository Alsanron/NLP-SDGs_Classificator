Alverno_CA:::North America:::United States:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::Strategies for blocking propagation of supercoiling generated during transcription:::Construction of complex circuits is still hampered by ignorance of fundamental principles of genetic circuit design. One key challenge is the isolation of independent genetic components -- genes expressed on the same plasmid (or other DNA molecule) will often unexpectedly interfere with or enhance each others' expression in an orientation-dependent fashion, even if they are nominally isolated by terminators and other motifs. This form of cross-talk may be caused by supercoiling generated during transcription, which has been shown to enhance or repress gene expression depending on the form of supercoiling. To test this hypothesis, we will test whether base pair spacing, terminators, or DNA "clamps" (made from DNA-binding proteins) placed between genes on a plasmid can eliminate their cross-talk. If DNA clamps do isolate nearby transcriptional units, then those clamps may advance the field of synthetic biology by allowing bioengineers to build more predictable genetic circuitry.:::2016
