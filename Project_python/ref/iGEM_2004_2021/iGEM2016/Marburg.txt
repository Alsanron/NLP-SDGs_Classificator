Marburg:::Europe:::Germany:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::SYNDUSTRY - fuse. produce. use.:::Globalization radically changed the world we live in; the way we communicate and travel has become much easier. On the downside, our need for resources has dramatically increased causing ecological and social problems like land-grabbing and fracking. The emergence of Synthetic Biology is initiating another bio-based industrial revolution. It is time to take the next step towards a sustainable bio-industry. In 'Syndustry', we follow nature’s own design principles by combining the strengths of individual microorganisms for the production of valuable biochemicals. We introduce a novel ‘plug-and-play’ production platform based on artificial endosymbiosis. This system goes beyond co-culturing microbes and overcomes current production limitations in fermentation. By employing cyanobacteria, capable of photosynthetic growth, we achieve a self-sustainable and versatile production platform for biochemicals from carbon dioxide. 'Syndustry – fuse. produce. use.' is the next industrial revolution and will change the face of the world as we know it today!:::2016
