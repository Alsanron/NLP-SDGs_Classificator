Paris_Saclay:::Europe:::France:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::iJ'aime - Get DNA Closer:::The regulation of gene expression is known to be controlled by transcriptional regulators in prokaryote. However, recent observations suggest that the expression of genes can also be affected by their spatial localization due to chromatin conformation. Our project aims at testing this hypothesis and determining if the expression of genes under the control of promoters of different strengths can be affected by their spatial proximity. We thus designed a new adaptable tool composed of two different dCas9s fused with the FRB / FKBP12 dimerization system (induced by rapamycin) to increase the spatial proximity of two different DNA regions. We also designed a tool composed of two dCas9s and a tripartite split-GFP to visualize the spatial proximity of these two DNA regions. Altogether, these tools offer new perspectives for gene expression control and visualization of the spatial proximity of chromosomal regions.:::2016
