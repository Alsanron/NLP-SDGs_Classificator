So we create iMAP(iGEMers’ Management and Alliance Platform). Python is used to construct the framework. CSS and JS are used to developed it with complement of HTML. iMAP supports chatting, Cloud hosting, activity releasing, assignment distributing, experiments managing and database searching. This platform enables the official to release information, PIs and group leaders to allocate assignments and check the progress, team members to deliver HP messages, share relevant literature on Cloud, and find teams nearby or work on the same research direction and communicate with other teams through instant chatting feature, which can make it more efficient to manage the progress and easier to contact others. With improvements of this platform, the intelligent map and the accumulation of the cloud, iMAP will be a practical platform to assist iGEM for all iGEMers.:::2016
