AHUT_China:::Asia:::China:::Information Processing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BIO-COMPASS 2.0:::A new updated version of bio–navigational system that enables a faster acquisition of optimal pathway will be built by the BIO-COMPASS 2.0 to break the limitations of computational capacity in the big data era. DNA will be used to encode the information of points and pathways on the map, and log into the bio-navigation database. In this way, each feasible solution can be obtained by the corresponding biochemical operation. Because of the high parallelism of the DNA calculation, the solution is rapid. Then by selecting the feasible solutions, finally determine the optimal solution. Compared with AHUT_China 2014's project, BIO-COMPASS 2.0 has added identification site, path length, and adjacent site number information into the DNA sequence used for path expressing. Besides, Quaternary has been applied in our calculation to optimize the data extraction methods. These improvements have boosted our system’s practicability and suitability when it is applied into more complex navigation.:::2016
