SCU-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Look What They've Done To My Shoes!:::Foot odor and athlete's foot are close "friends" of human beings and lead to daily problems. This year, we designed an innovative insole called "Comfootable" to prevent them with two strains of engineered E.coli, whose names are "Rihanna" and "Drake" respectively. VHb gene is involved in both strains to enhance their growth ability in tough environment and some genes in two strains are knocked out to keep the strains themselves odorless. In strain "Rihanna", antimicrobial peptide CecropinXJ is supposed to be released and attack pathogens after foot temperature inducement. In strain "Drake", liv operon/polyleucine peptide/aminocyl-tRNA and aarC are expected to remove the malodor in shoes. This insole has specialized structure and proper material to make sure the successful diffusion of substrate, the availability of microorganism growth and the biosafety. Furthermore, we did a lot of modeling works, and we hope our product will be available on the market some day.:::2016
