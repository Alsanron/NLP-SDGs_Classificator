UST_Beijing:::Asia:::China:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::iGUT: For notoginseng::: Chinese medicine have been used for thousands of years. We focus our project on one of common Chinese medicinal herbs: Notoginseng. In the literature, oral uptake of notoginseng usually results in poor absorption of ginsenosides, one important group of bioactive ingredients of notoginseng, notably due to its chemical modification of glycosylations. We plan to use recombinant beta-glucosidase to modify ginsenosides to improve oral bioavailability. We will take two separate approaches: in vitro enzymatic reaction and solid fermentation to test our beta-glucosidase activity toward ginsenosides modification. We name our project iGUT for the purpose of emphasizing the importance of microorganisms of our gut in helping our nutrition and medicinal need, and would like to consider our recombinant beta-glucosidase containing E.coli as a model to develop new “probiotics-in-a-test-tube” for the modification of ginsenosides.:::2016
