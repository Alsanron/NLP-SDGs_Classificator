Bulgaria:::Europe:::Bulgaria:::Food & Nutrition:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Yogurt I'd Like to Freeze:::Production and exportation of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus as a lyophilized substance is a major activity in the Bulgarian economy. In our project we are developing a novel strain of L. bulgaricus, which is capable of withstanding desiccation and freezing. To achieve that we are introducing exogenous proteins responsible for survival of harsh conditions under the control of inducible promotors. For example, we will utilize IDPâ€™s and LEA proteins from tardigrade responsible for the notorious capacity of that organism to sustain dryness. As another option, we envision to test trehalose production as a method to increase survival rate during lyophilization. Additionally, we will also apply expression of spider silk genes, known for their capacity to improve the capacity of organisms to withstand extreme conditions. For better control and reduction of expression loading of the chassis, we shall utilize inducible promotor such as PLux or PBAD.:::2016
