NEFU_China:::Asia:::China:::Foundational Advance:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Magnetosome: a new efficient and handy tool for protein purification:::Protein purification is commonly used in Biochemical research, but can become a very tedious and inefficient procedure. We developed a system that can be used to conveniently and efficiently purify recombinant proteins with help of magnetosome. The system consists of two parts. First, we used Escherichia coli to express an interest protein tagged by a Spytag. Second, we generated a Spycatcher-fused Mms13 protein and expressed it in the magetotactic bacteria AMB-1 (Magnetospirillum magneticum). These bacteria synthesize magnetosomes covered by phospholipid bilayer membrane, in which Mms13 is tightly anchored. Spycatcher binds Spytag with high affinity, and thus Spycatcher-Mms13 anchored in magnetosomes can strongly bind Spytag-conjugated protein and specifically bring it down with help of magnetic field. Our system is applicable to efficiently purifying any interest protein for different research purposes.:::2016
