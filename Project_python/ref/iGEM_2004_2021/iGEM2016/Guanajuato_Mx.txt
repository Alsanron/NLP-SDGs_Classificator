Guanajuato_Mx:::Latin America:::Mexico:::Manufacturing:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Biosense: Development of biosensors and patches to kill pathogenic bacteria that produce skin infections:::Skin infections are major health problem Guanajuato Mexico, mainly provoked by Pseudomona aeruginosa. Here, we will develop two biosensors using as chassis nonpathogenic bacteria. Escherichia coli K12 will be transformed with the genes required to detect P. aeruginosa and also with the alginate lyase gene (ALYG), in tandem with a bacteriocin. The ALYG will have a signal peptide from Bacillus thuringiensis, which allow protein translocation in E. coli. These molecules will destroy the biofilm and the bacterium. Also, a Nisin producer bacterium (L. lactis) will be transformed with the genes required to detect P. aeruginosa and with an additional copy of Nisin. Our objetive is to overexpress the bacteriocin to kill the pathogenic bacterium. Additionally, we will model the conditions to build a patch made of Poly(vinyl alcohol) and nitrocellulose containing the biosensors that will allow the molecule to diffuse through the membrane in order to kill the pathogenic bacteria.:::2016
