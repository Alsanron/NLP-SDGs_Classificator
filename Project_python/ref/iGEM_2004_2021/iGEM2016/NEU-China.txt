NEU-China:::Asia:::China:::New Application:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::ITS COLOUR: A Light-inducible CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene expression activation system in E. Coli and Yeast:::The CRIPSR/Cas9 system has now opened a new era for gene editing and manipulation. In this work, we aim to develop a light inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system in prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic cells, to precisely manipulate target gene activation upon the light induction. We fused two light-activated plant proteins, CRY2 or CIB1, to a transcriptional activator VP64 or the  catalytic domain deleted tCas9, generating CRY2-VP64 or CIB1-tCas9 chimeric constructs. In the presence of a specific gRNA guide, the tCas9 domain from CIB1-tCas9 binds to the promoter of a reporter gene. Once exposing to blue light, the CRY2 domain from CRY2-VP64 can form a protein complex with CIB1-tCas9, which in turn brings the VP64 domain to the chromatin and activates the reporter gene. We also plan to examine multiple light-sensitive elements, including LOV(light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domain) and Phy(phytochromoes), in order to provide various gene manipulation systems and to compare their efficiencies for gene activation.:::2016
