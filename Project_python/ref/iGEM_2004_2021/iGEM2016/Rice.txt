Rice:::North America:::United States:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Detection of Inflammation and Cancer Biomarkers Using Photoacoustic Imaging:::Our goal is to report inflammation and cancer in the gut through photoacoustic imaging of engineered E. coli that express the bacterial pigment violacein, as well as the near-infrared fluorescent proteins iRFP670 and iRFP713. To achieve this goal, we established a reference for reporter expression by constructing and assaying plasmids with an arabinose-inducible promoter and genes for the reporters. Then, we constructed plasmids with the same reporters, but with promoters responsive to nitric oxide and hypoxia, the two conditions indicative of gut inflammation in both mice and humans. Future studies include co-culturing and testing the engineered bacteria with colon cancer cells, and developing new constructs to enable bacteria to report in the presence of malignant tumors. Photoacoustic imaging provides a non-invasive alternative for the detection of cancer and internal inflammation; success in this investigation would create new opportunities for infectious disease research.:::2016
