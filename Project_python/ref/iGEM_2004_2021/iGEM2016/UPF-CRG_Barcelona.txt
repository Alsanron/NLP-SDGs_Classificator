UPF-CRG_Barcelona:::Europe:::Spain:::Therapeutics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Polybiome Project: Colorectal cancer preventive treatment and tumor risk marker:::Our aim is to develop a supplementary probiotic that, used in a regular and preventive way, can reduce the amount of polyamines that our body absorbs (which are the main cause of carcinogenicity in red and processed meat), so as to maintain their concentrations within a healthy level. This probiotic will consist on polyamine auxotrophic bacteria, extracted from the intestinal human microflora, that will contain specific enzymes also found in our body. Additionally, we have planned to develop a cancer risk detector by engineering a bacterial cell and developing a reactive strip that, in contact with urine, can test the risk of having a growing tumor. The principle behind this idea is that an acetylated version of polyamines are exported to the blood and later to urine. This molecules have been targeted in previous studies with a high success in both sensibility and specificity of cancer risk detection.:::2016
