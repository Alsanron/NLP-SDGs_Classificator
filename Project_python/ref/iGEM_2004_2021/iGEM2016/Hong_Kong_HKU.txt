Hong_Kong_HKU:::Asia:::Hong Kong:::Diagnostics:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::In vivo synthesis of DNA nanostructures for disease diagnosis through miRNA-induced structural transformation:::DNA has emerged as a promising material for the creation of novel functional nanostructures. Here we present DNA nanostructures capable of simultaneous detection of multiple microRNA (miRNA) targets which are identified as promising disease biomarkers. Logic gates can be easily incorporated into our designs to test various combinations of miRNA targets. G-quadruplexes form when the specified target hybridize with the probe, generating fluorescence in the presence of substrate. We endeavour to demonstrate intracellular synthesis, self-assembly and functioning of our nanostructures inside E. coli. Our constructs open up new possibilities in future research on DNA nanotechnologies as diagnostic tools, and promote the applications of miRNA testing in clinical conditions.:::2016
