SMS_Shenzhen:::Asia:::China:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::iWound: Your personal health care taker:::Our personal health care taker E.coli expresses two proteins SDF-ELP and LL37 which can significantly promote chronic skin wound healing. Chronic skin wounds are characterized by poor re-epithelialization, angiogenesis and granulation. SDF (topical stromal cell-derived growth factor-1), though found effective to re-epithelialization, is rapidly degraded by high levels of protease around wounds. To solve this issue, we fuse SDF1 to ELP(elastin-like peptides) that can aggregate to form nanoparticles so to prevent against proteolysis and promote neovascularization, resulting in much faster re-epithelialization of chronic skin wounds. We also add an antimicrobial peptide LL-37 to avoid infection by preventing a wide range of bacteria growth. To enable our health care taker to be used by everyone, we devise a super-convenient product which only needs 4 simple steps “AAPH”( Add. Add. Press. Heat.”) for people to get the final curing proteins.:::2016
