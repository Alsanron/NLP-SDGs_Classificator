Saint_Rose_School_A:::Latin America:::Chile:::High School:::High School:::Accepted:::The CoTracker:::Many people die every year due to Carbon monoxide poisoning, because it is present in different sources such as fires, businesses, and houses with heating systems. Currently there are only electrochemical detectors that sense the presence of this gas, however, we propose a biological detector that is easy to use, it has sensors based on promoters that detect levels of CO, features from the R.rubrum proteobacteria, which makes use of carbon monoxide as its main energy source. Through synthetic biology is possible to transfer these characteristics to other organisms such as E. coli, which in nature has no connection and the transfer of its genetic information is incompatible with this, allowing for innovative advances in scientific applications such as the generation of a biological CO detector to later incorporate this system into an accessory.:::2016
