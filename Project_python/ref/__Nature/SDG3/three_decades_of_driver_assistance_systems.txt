AbstractThis contribution provides a review of fundamental goals,
development and future perspectives of driver assistance systems.
Mobility is a fundamental desire of mankind. Virtually any society
strives for safe and efficient mobility at low ecological and economic
costs. Nevertheless, its technical implementation significantly differs among societies, depending on their culture and their degree
of industrialization. A potential evolutionary roadmap for driver
assistance systems is discussed. Emerging from systems based on
proprioceptive sensors, such as ABS or ESC, we review the progress
incented by the use of exteroceptive sensors such as radar, video, or
lidar. While the ultimate goal of automated and cooperative traffic
still remains a vision of the future, intermediate steps towards that
aim can be realized through systems that mitigate or avoid collisions
in selected driving situations. Research extends the state-of-the-art
in automated driving in urban traffic and in cooperative driving, the
latter addressing communication and collaboration between different vehicles, as well as cooperative vehicle operation by its driver
and its machine intelligence. These steps are considered important
for the interim period, until reliable unsupervised automated driving for all conceivable traffic situations becomes available. The prospective evolution of driver assistance systems will be stimulated by
several technological, societal and market trends. The paper closes
with a view on current research fields.

1. Objectives of Mobility and Driver Assistance

M

obility is highly correlated with societal and individual well-being and greatly contributes to quality of life. It is the backbone of commercial trading
and services and, therefore, the basis for economic
success. Through mass automobile production and strategic, long-term paved road creation, industrialized countries
have reached a high degree of individual mobility.
Its advantages, however, come at a price. In addition to
obvious monetary costs of vehicles, fuel, and the provision
and maintenance of automobile infrastructure, mass mobilization entails further economic, ecological, and social
costs: resource consumption, noise and exhaust pollution,
loss of productive time due to traffic congestion and harmful or fatal traffic incidents as a personal safety risk are
merely a select few examples of adverse effects (Verhoef
1994, Schrank et al. 2012, Holden 2012).
While the focus of the mobility industry is partly shifting towards emerging markets where the need for individual mobility is not yet as saturated, automobile markets in
highly industrialized countries like Germany mainly aim
to raise the quality of todays mobility. This goal includes
a reduction of traffic related accidents (keyword: vision
zero: Vision zero is the image of a future in which no one
will be killed or seriously injured by traffic accidents)
(Vgverket, 2014) and environmental pollution, as well as
an increase of mobile efficiency in terms of energy, time,
and resources (European Union 2010).
Measures to reduce the costs of mobility per distance
driven have been taken since the 1970s, e.g. the development of passive passenger safety concepts, low-emission
vehicles, and safer traffic routes. In order to further
diminish the negative impact of mass mobilization on
economy, environment, and society, new strategies have
to be devised.
A frequently discussed concept is the electrification of
automobiles with the aim of reducing ecological costs and
countering the increasing scarcity of resources. Despite the
solutions electric cars offer in response to the disadvantages
of ordinary automobiles, the reasonability of mass electrification is still open to dispute (Ogden et al. 2004). For the
purposes of this article, electro-mobility will be considered

a possible long-term approach, but not a dominant choice for
the near future.
A different approach to increase the efficiency of mobility is the concept of driver assistance. Driver assistance
systems (DAS) offer a means to enhance, among other
things, active and integrated safety. However, in order to
maximize their contribution to overall traffic safety, an
increased market penetration is required (Lu 2006). This
can be achieved by raising awareness for DAS and their
benefits throughout the population, or by regulating their
implementation by law. A good example for the latter is, e.g.
electronic stability control systems (ESC), which are mandatorily included in newly produced vehicles throughout
the traditional markets (e.g. from November 2014 on in the
EU, (European Union 2008)).
In order to tap the full potential of DAS, increased emphasis should be put on special needs of driver groups, such
as first time drivers or elderly drivers. By adapting to the
specific needs of such drivers, DAS can probably better help
reduce traffic related fatalities, which amount to 1.2 million
people worldwide (Volvo 2013). While the majority of these
fatalities occur within the vehicle, safety vulnerable traffic
participants, i.e. pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists,
must not be neglected. The potential contribution of passive
safety, such as bluff vehicle bodies, is very limited. Active
collision protection systems with emergency braking and
collision mitigation capabilities, despite the technical challenge they represent, can be considered indispensable in
order to truly decrease traffic-related fatalities.
When forming future concepts, it is necessary to maintain an integral and systematic perspective. PROMETHEUS
(19871995), a European research project dedicated to the
improvement of mobility quality, showed that success is
not merely dependent on technological feasibility (Nagel
2008). The California PATH program established in 1986
was a multi-disciplinary US initiative with a similar integral perspective including automated Highways (PATH
2014). Other projects for future concepts include SARTRE
and DRIVE, both of which were funded by the European
Commission. SARTRE aimed to encourage a change in personal transport by platooning. The unique element of the
program was the interaction between the lead vehicle and

predicted to achieve environmental as well as safety benefits and a reduction of congestions (SARTRE).

2. Current State of Technology, Research, and the Market
Evolution of Driver Assistance Functions
from a Market Perspective
The past and a potential future evolution of DAS is sketched
in Fig. 1 from a technological point of view1.
Early DAS were based on proprioceptive sensors, i.e.
sensors measuring the internal status of the vehicle, such
as wheel velocity, acceleration, or rotational velocity. These
enable the control of vehicle dynamics with the goal of following the trajectory requested by the driver in the best
possible way.
One of the first active assistance systems based on proprioceptive sensors was the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS),
with serial production from 1978 (Bosch). A Traction Control System (TCS) later augmented the system. Years later
in 1995, the introduction of additional dynamic driving controls, such as Electronic Stability Control (ESC), marked a
further milestone in assistance development (van Zanten
1
The figure sketches the dates of market introduction for selected DAS
functions to the best knowledge and understanding of the authors. Nevertheless, the selection of the first market introduction for a specific DAS
function depends on the detailed definition of several factors, like functional specifications, serial size, and market acceptance and retention.

& Kost 2012). With ESC, an electronic gyroscope found its
way into the automobile. This equipment did not only lay
the foundation for the ESC, but revealed an entire range of
additional usage possibilities. Overall component price was
reduced twofold by emphasizing cost efficiency in the production process. In terms of road safety, studies have shown
that dynamic driving controls are the second most efficient
safety system for passengers, outmatched only by the seatbelt (Aga et al. 2003, Sferco et al. 2001). This was strikingly
demonstrated in the Mercedes A-Class Moose Test, which
caught the attention of the media, see e.g. (Andrews 1997,
Strassmann 1988). With the public recognition of the safety
potential of dynamic driving control systems, the frequency
of implementation for such systems increased significantly,
and they have, in consequence, saved several thousands of
lives. Starting November 2014, ESC (in addition to braking
assistance systems developed at the same time) will even be
a legal requirement in each new car in the EU.
Exteroceptive sensors acquire information from outside the vehicle, including ultrasonic, radar, lidar or video
sensors and to some extent Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)2 receivers. These sensors provide information
about the road ahead and the presence as well as the driving status of other traffic participants or the vehicles position in the world. The international evolution in the area

of navigation systems in relation to progress in positioning
technology is described in (Akamatsu et al. 2013)
The second generation of driver assistance functions
first introduced around 1990 based on exteroceptive sensors focuses on providing information and warnings to the
driver, and on enhancing driving comfort. Substantially
driven by the cost reduction of mobile devices navigation
technology using GNSS has become prevalent in presentday vehicles. Due to the phenomenon of the non-local
risk, constituting that non-locals are involved in accidents
more frequently than locals (Engels & Dellen 1989), navigation systems have safety implications. By aiding a driver
in orientation, navigation systems hold the potential to
reduce the drivers workload, allowing a greater amount
of mental resources to be dedicated to the primary driving
task, thereby reducing the risk of accidents due to inattention (TNO 2007). Additionally, several studies indicate the
advantages in saving gas/fuel by anticipatory driving and
travelling to a destination via the optimal route (e.g. Zlocki
et al. 2010, Br et al. 2011, Boriboonsomsin et al. 2012, Dornieden et al. 2012, Popiv et al. 2010). With increasingly accurate navigation technology in the future, further beneficial
effects are conceivable through the provision of localization
data to support systems, enabling their functions to be better
adapted to local driving conditions.
Parking assistance systems entered the market in the
mid-1990s, e.g. (Katzwinkel et al. 2012). Ultrasonic sensors
are used to detect obstacles in the surrounding environment. Initially, these systems had merely a warning function to help prevent collisions while backing into and out
of parking spaces; later, they were complemented by rearview cameras to better assist the driver with more detailed
information. After electronically controllable steering
became available, parking assistants became capable of
entirely relieving the driver of lateral vehicle control during the parking maneuver, requiring him only to accelerate
and brake. Over the years, this systems capability expanded
from parallel to perpendicular parking. Additionally, video
data of the vehicles surroundings were upgraded from a
simple rear view to one that spans an entire 360 (Nissan
2007). The market did not respond as fast to parking assistance systems as to ESC and navigation systems. However,
considering that parking assistance systems are typically
considered an optional feature and associated with additional costs, such systems have nonetheless been successful
in their own right. So far, state-of-the-art of these systems
is limited to automatic steering (Valeo 2013) into a parking
space designated by the driver (and recognized by the vehicle), whereas a type of valet parking (where the driver is
completely removed from the procedure of finding a parking space) may soon be technologically possible.
The development of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
(Winner et al. 2009, Winner 2012) set another milestone in
driving assistance history. Through the implementation of

electronic brake and drive control, and the use of previously
very expensive radar technology, which in turn became
significantly more affordable, partially automated driving was made possible. When ACC was introduced in 1999,
these features were initially only usable at speeds greater
than 30km/h (Jones 2001). Current systems with automatic
transmission, however, have the ability to employ these features at lower speeds and, for example, to automatically follow other vehicles within traffic jam (TC204 2009).
Forward collision prevention systems using inexpensive low-range and low-resolution versions of lidar sensors
are currently being used for low speed applications, marketed under the names: City Safety (Volvo 2014) and City
Stop (Ford 2014). Both systems introduced around 2010
help to prevent car body damages, an economically very
useful application. For advanced applications (e.g. higher
speeds), the small detection range of inexpensive lidar systems is, however, a strongly limiting factor. Interestingly,
long range collision mitigation systems based on the radar
technology originally introduced with ACC had been introduced before in 20032006 (Kodaka et al. 2003). By means
of escalating warning levels, the driver is made aware of
an impending collision. If the driver does not react, the
vehicle actively brakes to mitigate accident severity once
a collision is no longer avoidable (Maurer 2012). Such systems have been investigated in the European PREVENT
project (20042008), and can prove especially effective for
larger vehicles such as trucks, due to their limited driving
dynamics requiring earlier-onset braking in comparison to
smaller vehicles. Consequently, these collision mitigation
systems will be mandatory in new trucks in the EU by law,
starting November 2013 (EC No 661/2009).
The same obligation exists for Lane Departure Warning
(LDW) systems. These and the active lane keeping assistance systems derived from them, spawned the market
entry of machine vision in the mobility sector and thereby
constitute another milestone in DAS history (Ishida &
Gayko 2004).
The latest class of DAS selects and controls trajectories
beyond the current request of the driver. The high certainty
level required for such decisions can only be achieved with
an interconnected set of sensors. Radar and camera technologies currently dominate the DAS sector. Having complementary capabilities, an omission of one technology in
favor of the other is not to be expected. Rather, data fusion
strategies (Stiller et al. 2011) and joint sensor self-calibration (Dang et al. 2009) will combine the strengths of both
technologies. The short-term goal is to automate driving in
selected situations. As an example, traffic jam assistance
systems have recently been introduced based on radar
and stereo cameras. Merging longitudinal and lateral control, these systems are designed for Automated Low Speed
Driving on congested highways assuming full lateral and
longitudinal vehicle control at low speeds (Daimler 2013).

Maximum hands-off speed is still low (30 km/h), restricted
to stop-and-go situations, but this function may eventually
emerge towards automated highway driving.
Other extensions of current DAS are soon to come. Examples include an assistant for collision avoidance by evasive
steering (Dang et al. 2012), assistants for the detection of
oncoming traffic and pedestrians (Enzweiler & Gavrilla
2009) under adverse vision (weather) conditions (Roser &
Geiger 2009), or assistants for improved intersection safety
(Hopstock & Klanner 2007). Some of these systems require
data exchange between traffic participants or with the road
infrastructure, which is currently being investigated and
demonstrated in field tests such as SIM-TD (20082013)
(SIM-TD 2013), Ko-FAS (20092013) (Ko-FAS 2013), Koline
(Saust et al. 2012), DriveC2X (20112013) (DRIVEC2X 2013).
This approach promises an extension of a systems boundaries with respect to the availability of information and the
expansion of its function to an entire collective of road users
allowing for assisted or automated cooperative maneuvering (Stiller et al. 2007, Shladover 2009).

Research Towards Automated Driving
The ultimate DAS of the future should be capable of automated driving in all conceivable situations at a safety level
significantly superior to that of a human driver and in cooperation with other traffic participants. This is considered
especially important, as the compensation for human error,
accounting for 90% of all accidents (Volvo 2013, Treat et
al. 1979) is a prerequisite for accident-free traffic. In order
to develop such cooperative automated vehicles, the driving tasks need to be broken up into basic functional components that can be technically implemented at a certified
level of maturity.
Automated driving has already been a research topic
since the late 1980s leading to e.g. the California PATH
project (1986-ongoing), the NAVLAB project (1986-ongoing), (Thorpe 1990), the PROMETHEUS project (19871995)
and the U.S. DOT National Automated Highway System
Research Program (NAHS) (19941997). These projects
have significantly advanced research in sensor hardware
and software. In particular, e.g., lane recognition based
on video capturing and processing technology has been
demonstrated (Dickmanns & Mysliwetz 1992). In 1994 two
demonstrator vehicles drove in normal traffic on Autoroute 1 near Paris demonstrating lane keeping up to 130
km/h, convoy and lane change maneuvers. The latter still
required a manual confirmation by a safety driver. About 50
transputers processed images from four cameras extracting lane geometry and the pose of other vehicles. (Franke
et al. 1994, Dickmanns et al. 1994). In 1995 an automated
vehicle travelled from Munich, Germany, to Odense, Denmark, at velocities up to 175 km/h with about 95% in automated mode (Maurer et al. 1996, Maurer 2000). At about the
same time another group demonstrated vision-based auto-

mated urban driving in the city of Karlsruhe at speeds of ca.
30 km/h. (Siegle et al. 1992, Nagel et al. 1995).
In the No hands across America tour a vehicle drove
from Washington DC to San Diego with 98% automated
steering yet manual longitudinal control (Pomerleau 1995,
Pomerleau & Jochem1996). The NAHS Demo97 on I15 in
San Diego showed the capabilities of cars, busses and trucks
in various automated highway scenarios. Various lane keeping technologies were presented using computer vision and
based on augmented infrastructure like roadway embedded
magnets and roadway laid radar-reflective stripes. Vehicle
following was demonstrated using laser or radar sensors.
Platooning with narrow headways was accomplished using
inter-vehicle communication (Thorpe et al. 1997, Ozguner
et al. 1997, Rajamani et al 2000). Likewise early contributions in Japan included public demonstrations of automated
vehicles including Demo 2000 organized by the National
Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.
Cooperative platoon driving of five vehicles was demonstrated including advanced maneuvers such as stop-andgo, merging, and obstacle avoidance (Tsugawa & Sadayuki
1994, Kutami et al. 1995, Kato et al.2002).
Another long-distance mostly hands-free drive through
Italy has been reported by (Broggi et al.1999). Multisensory
automated driving without need for a safety driver onboard
the vehicle has been realized on proving grounds (Stiller et al.
2001). Joint lateral an longitudinal control has been one of the
main campaigns of the research programs INVENT (2001
2005) (Invent 2005) and AKTIV (20062010) (Aktiv 2012).
In the ongoing century several public challenges catalyzed international research on automated vehicles.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
organized a first Grand Challenge for autonomous off-road
ground vehicles in March 2004. The vehicles had to navigate
a course of 175 miles through the desert defined by a dense
series of some 2000 waypoints avoiding static obstacles. The
furthest distance traveled was about 7 miles.
The second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005 had a similar setup with a course defined by some 3000 waypoints over
150 miles through the desert. All finalists based their work
on high-end laser scanners coupled with high-precision
GPS/INS systems and radars for long range sensing. Again
vehicles had to avoid static obstacles only on the closed-tothe-public course. Five teams led by the Stanford Racing
Team finished the course (Darpa 2005, Thrun et al. 2006,
zgner et al. 2007).
The third DARPA Challenge held in 2007, named Urban
Challenge, took place in a mock up urban environment in
California. A Road Net Description File was available that
included a map of the terrain and the local traffic rules.
Vehicles had to negotiate their way through traffic build
by other participants and stunt drivers following regular
traffic rules. The main sensors used by the finalists were
a high-end, roof-mounted lidar scanner (Velodyne 2007),

high-precision GPS/INS and radars were used for long range
sensing, while computer vision played at most a secondary
role. The team of Carnegie Mellon University won before
Stanford and Virginia Tech (Urmson et al. 2008).
The Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge 2011 (GCDC)
was the first international competition of vehicles connected
with communication devices. Participating teams from
about 10 countries had to come up with strategies that were
able to drive without knowing the algorithms and technical
equipment of other vehicles in their platoon. Teams were
shuffled to a random starting position in a random platoon
over 15 runs on a highway near Helmond, the Netherlands.
Criteria for performance evaluation included damping to
strong oscillating braking/acceleration maneuvers of the
common platoon leader, overall traveling time and platoon
length of the team. The team of KIT won before Chalmers
University (Geiger et al. 2012).
Inspired by the challenges, numerous research groups
from industry including and academia continue research
and automated driving demonstrations in increasingly complex scenarios can be expected in the near future.
In 2010 a team of Braunschweig University extended their
work of the Urban Challenge by automated driving in public
traffic on a piece of the Braunschweig city ring road within
the Stadtpilot Project (Wille et al. 2010, Saust et al. 2011).
Among the publicly most noticed activities is the impressive work by Google that extends experience gained in the
Urban Challenge. A roof-mounted high-end laser scanner
and a detailed map, recorded in a prior manual drive, provide the main information about the driving environment. A
color camera is used for traffic light recognition. The overwhelming amount of more than 500.000 km of automated
driving has been reported in 2013 (Markoff 2013).
In July 2013 a car drove autonomously in public traffic
near Parma, Italy, remarkably at times even with nobody on
the drivers seat. The 13 km long route included two-way
rural roads, freeways with junctions, and urban areas with
pedestrian crossings, tunnels, artificial bumps, tight roundabouts, and traffic lights (PROUD 2013).
In August 2013, a collaboration of Daimler AG and KIT/
FZI automated a Mercedes Benz S-Class demonstrating the
maturity of mono- and binocular video sensors augmented
only by serial or close-to-production radar and GPS sensors and a digital map. The vehicle successfully drove the
100 km long Bertha Benz Memorial Route from Mannheim
to Pforzheim, Germany, in presence of crossing pedestrians,
bicyclists, vehicles and trucks in narrow urban and rural
roads and complied with traffic rules including traffic signs
and lights (Franke et al. 2013, Lategahn et al. 2013, ITS Podcast 2013, Ziegler et al. 2014).
As outlined above, highway and freeway automation and
low speed automated driving are currently being introduced
in first products. Urban driving, however, poses a particular
challenge because it involves many different situations and

complex scenarios, that state-of-the-art technology is not yet
able to handle and is therefore a focus of ongoing research
activities. The project UR:BAN (20122016) (UR:BAN 2014)
gathers various stakeholders for these applications to prepare a new generation of driver assistance functions (Manstetten et al. 2013).

Related Research Directions
Beyond all enthusiasm concerning technological progress,
however, it must be acknowledged that automated driving in
all conceivable traffic situations requires considerably more
cognitive capabilities than available at the current state-ofthe-art. Furthermore, clear definitions for liability, licensing, and registration of automated cars are yet to be devised.
Therefore, as an interim stage, some research projects focus
on so-called semi-automation or high automatization.
Human factors play an important role in such systems that
share tasks and responsibility between the human driver
and the semi-automated vehicle. There are approaches
favoring a human-machine cooperation in general (Hakuli
et al. 2009, Kienle et al. 2009) or in dangerous situations, see,
e.g. the research project HAVEit (20072010) (HAVEit 2010).
In other approaches, the machine takes control whenever
the driver is unable to, and automatically halts the vehicle or
pilots it to a safe position, as demonstrated in the SmartSenior project (20092012) (Kmpchen et al. 2010).
Until full automation is feasible, support of the driver
by DAS is sought. They can intervene in case of deficient
driving abilities, when, for example, the driver becomes
drowsy. Drowsiness detection and warning systems are
already on the market. Based, for example, on drivers steering behavior and response times, length of the trip, use of
turn signals, and time of day (Bosch 2012), the system alerts
its users of possible drowsiness. Effects and consequences
of drowsiness detection, especially in terms of acceptance
by the driver, are, however, not yet profoundly researched.
Aside from drowsiness, inattention can also occur when the
driver neglects his primary driving task due to distraction
by an auxiliary task. Interior cameras can recognize this
state and adapt the parameters of warning and intervention
systems (Trivedi et al. 2007).
Distraction aside, it is possible that the driver is unable
to handle all incoming information and act upon it correctly, even when allocating full attention to the primary
driving task. As this especially pertains to night driving
situations, systems to enhance night vision have been
developed. One such technology uses intelligent headlights (Thom et al. 2011). This technology allows illumination of specific solid angles to maximize the illumination of the road without dazzling other traffic participants.
Furthermore, areas of high relevance can be illuminated
for a short time to attract the drivers attention. Other night
vision systems are based on close-range and long-range
infrared technology, providing an on-screen display of the

versal ambition to save costs, such systems were, however,
even less frequently acquired in this sector. Unlike in the
private sector, regulations (EC No 661/2009) were put into
place, making it a legal requirement for certain commercial
vehicles to come equipped with, for example, emergency
braking and lane keeping systems as a serial standard.
Other than traffic jam prevention, through ACC (van
Arem et al. 2006), assistance systems have not yet been able
to contribute much to traffic efficiency. To achieve a noticeable improvement, assistance systems need to extend their
capabilities towards cooperative driving. Though previous
research has shown that cooperative systems can improve
efficiency (e.g. convoy driving (Schulze 1997)), an underlying functional concept of cooperation has not yet been
established. In terms of energy efficiency, existing possibilities to increase efficiency are not yet being broadly applied.
To date, cooperative driving exercises of different vehicle
groups, for example, were only rudimentarily examined
(Frese et al. 2007).
In an intermediate conclusion, one may summarize that
automotive research and engineering offers a broad inventory of DAS with a potential to improve the quality of mobility. In the long term, cooperative automated vehicles can
be expected from this technical evolution. Todays market
situation of DAS, however, suffers from the following yet
unresolved weaknesses:
 Even when available in the class of compact cars, DAS
are ordered only by a minority of customers (Karmasin
2008, Krger 2008).
 Overall, DAS acceptance is increasing but are often
poorly understood by users (Zwerschke, 2006).
 
DASs are unattainable for relevant social groups and cannot be
upgraded or retrofitted.
 
DASs communicate with the carrier vehicle only, and remain isolated from other road users and
traffic infrastructure. They have
not yet found their way into intermodal traffic (Saust et al. 2012).
This non-exhaustive list discloses
the foci of future developments. DAS
need to be embedded into transportation systems on a larger scale.
They need to be interlinked with one
another, between different users, and
to other technical systems.

drivers surroundings. Recognized objects, such as pedestrians, can be highlighted, or trigger an active warning
(Horter et al. 2009, Li et al. 2012).
Mental over- or underload due to the varying complexity
of traffic situations can be another source of erroneous driver
behavior. Though researchers have presented assistance
concepts based on mental load (e.g. Smiley 1989), no proper
implementation of such a concept into the human-machineinteraction has yet been realized. At best, simple attempts to
avoid mental overload from complex traffic routing have been
made with assistants indicating the number of lanes and the
traffic situation on the upcoming road. Mental underload from
monotony, with the potential to induce inattention (e.g. Young
& Stanton 2002), is an entirely unresolved issue. An attention
deficit may manifest far before the driver enters a state of
drowsiness that could be picked up on by drowsiness detection systems. Solutions for the problems posed by mental overand underload could contribute greatly to the improvement
of DAS.
Apart from a general lack of market penetration, it is
known that DASs are not well distributed in accordance
with the needs of specific user groups. As can be seen from
Fig. 2, the groups with the highest probability of being the
main perpetrator of an accident are young and old drivers
(Destatis 2013). The prevalence of DAS as of today, however,
appears limited to a small user group of mostly middle-aged
persons (Langwieder et al. 2012). Use of these systems is
often impeded by the inability to be retrofitted in ones current vehicle (Trbswetter & Bengler 2013).
Soon after DAS became available for passenger cars, they
were also offered in commercial vehicles. Due to the uni-

becoming increasingly complete and more detailed, especially with innovations such as new image processing
approaches with 6-D (e.g. Mller et al. 2011, Rabe et al. 2010,
Rabe et al. 2007), imaging radar systems (Khler et al. 2013),
and improved positioning systems. Through advancements
in hardware and software, a relatively high level of artificial intelligence is likely to be established. Machine cognition will continually improve, ultimately paving the way
for fully autonomous driving. As a long term development,
an increase in efficient and smooth traffic flow with few
accidents is to be expected. However, before this vision can
become a reality, a number of issues have to be resolved.

Car2Car and Car2X Communication
The internet, has, so far, played an only marginal role
in vehicles. Up until now, the use of data links has been
restricted mainly to infotainment and navigation support.
In the future, along with developments in the infotainment
area, new driving assistance capabilities can be expected.
The driving office is certainly an interesting concept for
managers and businessmen. It may be assumed that, in the
future, the mobile office and autonomous driving package
will be subject to intense request in regard to company cars.
Other potential use cases for data communication include
the allocation of parking spaces before the actual arrival
of the vehicle at the parking lot, or the communication in
intermodal traffic.
Communication-based DAS for guidance or stabilization
support on the other hand require an independent network
concept. In field operational tests, like SIM-TD (www.simtd.
org) and research projects like Ko-FAS (www.kofas.de) and
Koline (Saust et al. 2012), the foundations for a comprehensive implementation of such technology are being laid
down. Integrating all traffic participants of a certain area
into a common network, a new stage of driving assistance
can be realized, based on the vastly improved quality and
quantity of information about the local traffic situation. This
would, for example, impact traffic infrastructure considerably (Tank & Linnartz 1997, Tischler & Hummel 2005, Nagel
et al. 2007, Dietl et al. 2001, Eichler 2007, Kosch 2004). A
traffic light, for example, could be replaced by a wireless
access point that directs the vehicles through the junction.
While this approach would be more efficient and effective
with automated vehicles than with human operators, it
should yield positive results irrespective of who is driving
the vehicle. Vehicles equipped with sensors and v2v communication devices could expand their horizon via cooperative sensing. Given sufficient bandwidth and integrity of the
data sources and the communication network, information
from all the vehicles and the infrastructure, if available,
could then be fused into a detailed dynamic map, as demonstrated in the EU project DRIVE C2X (www.drive-c2x.eu). In
analogy to the IT-cloud concept, shared sensor data could be
described as cloud-sensors.

As depicted in the traffic scenario in Fig. 3, vehicles
may communicate slowdowns to their rear or inform forward traffic about the presence of vehicles in their blind
spot. Furthermore, connected vehicles may negotiate driving trajectories to their mutual benefit and to the benefit of
overall traffic flow and safety (Stiller et al. 2007, Goldhammer et al. 2012).
Seeing the enormous potential to increase driving safety
and efficiency with respect to energy, time and traffic infrastructure, such networks will hopefully soon become a reality for the benefit of all traffic participants (European Union
2010). The high initial costs associated with the provision of
a sensor-cloud concept can be expected to be redeemed during long term usage. A necessary precondition, however, is a
reliable network with a high quality of service and integrity,
which is yet to be developed.

Electro-Mobility
Electro-mobility, too, presents new challenges for driver
assistance. Primary requisites are an adequately tight network of charging stations and guaranteeing a sufficient
amount of energy to complete the desired journey. For example in March 2014, Tesla has 66 stations in the US, which can
only be seen as a starting point (Tesla 2014). In the course
of these issues being resolved, the usage of e-mobility can
be expected to change. This will mainly affect variables of
energy efficiency, forcing a series of decisions on the means
and the objectives of mobility in general, as well as on
business models to be implemented in light of the respective technological state-of-the-art. Accordingly, assistance
functions will have to adapt to altered basic conditions of
transportation usage and provide additional functions for
intermodal mobile assistants and range extension.
One approach towards improved energy efficiency, discussed particularly often in the e-mobility sector, is the

applied to the mobility sector in large scale. Currently, there
is only a small number of successful mobility platforms like
organized ridesharing or used car portals. Smartphone
based approaches, such as the App taxi.eu (www.taxi.
eu) , demonstrate how the product mobility can turn into
a brokered good. Such services can prove to be an obstacle
or a catalyst for the further development of DAS. In vehicles
optimized for cost reduction, requirements are likely to
be fulfilled with minimal effort in the least expensive way
possible, which could prove fatal for the budget for innovations. On the flip side, certain automation technologies, for
example driving to a parking lot, the next customer, or even
a mobile ordering office for an online retailing corporation,
can serve as the technical basis for future business models
(Blser et al. 2012, Terporten et al. 2012).

The Role of Culture and Media

Other stimuli for future developments can come from the
adaptation of traditions or new developments from other

cultures. Increased globalization accelerates the rate of
such transfer. Regarding market and technology, German
and Japanese companies currently dominate the driving
assistance scene; this is primarily due to the customers and
automobile companies being sufficiently willing and financially strong to invest in vehicle technology. As time passes,
older, more saturated markets may be overtaken by newer,
emerging ones. This results in a change of numbers, customer needs, and usage conditions, as well as the initial difficulty to appraise willingness to pay and foresee possible
regulative interventions.
Finally the role of media should not be underestimated.
It is obvious that the presentation of Googles self-driving
car in the media has both changed the attitudes of users and
the effort of established car manufacturers with respect to
this technology.

4. Challenges and Effects
For future transportation technology, simple roadmaps
showing different developmental steps can be derived. Usually, these plans culminate in an interconnected autonomous vehicle, able to drive unsupervised in any possible
environment. Along the paths towards such a vehicle,
many arduous issues of homologation and liability have to
be addressed. Todays testing and approval methods are
unsuitable for the evaluation of intelligent machines, and
new metrics assessing the performance of driving robots
are required. Some experts consider this an even greater
challenge, than the development of artificial intelligence
for autonomous driving itself. The U.S. National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for example, though
explicitly encouraging the development and testing of selfdriving vehicles, has recently published the specific recommendation for state governments to not even attempt to
establish safety standards for such technologies at this point
in time (NHTSA 2013).
Another aspect impeding advancements are their costs.
Technological development requires large investments that
can only be redeemed by an appropriate market demand. If
the market does not accept the developed product, financing
further developmental steps may prove difficult. This risk
is increased by several mediating influences on a products
way from its development to its end user. So-called specialist
magazines often prefer to rave over the sound and power of
a combustion engine instead of covering meaningful technological innovations in an appropriate manner. Even trade
chains and car salesmen often fail to promote the technology properly. It is worth pointing out, however, that development of DAS has not always been user-oriented and is
therefore, in part, co-responsible for low user acceptance
(Maurer 2012). In order to maximize the success of humanmachine-interaction, the increasing number of assistance
functions requires the development of integrated display
and control concepts, providing a consistent user interface.

Technological development is also impacted, as has
been discussed, by social changes. Market response to
changed conditions can result in a product line shift or
entirely new business models, creating new markets and
suppressing old ones. Such revolutionary market changes
may prove especially challenging for the well-established
German automotive industry. The example of the IT sector (dominated by companies like IBM/DEC/Nixdorf, then
Microsoft/Intel/Nokia, then Google/Apple/Facebook) demonstrates that decades of success are transient if circumstances and business models change.
DAS appearing at the right time and along with a fitting
business model can be a key element to revolutionize individual mobility. As long as cars are used the way they are
today, the market is not expected to change remarkably. But
the development of DAS, especially towards autonomous
vehicles, opens up different usage options. This progress
cannot be held back and potentially threatens todays dominant car companies, if they fail to pro-actively be part of it.
In order to help co-create the future, extensive scientific
research is required to prevent misdevelopments, find optimal terms of implementation, and observe the market.
While future DAS are expected to contribute greatly to
traffic safety and efficiency, they are also likely to entail
side-effects. Depending on the pace at which new assistance systems are implemented, a segregation of high-tech
assisted automobiles and still operable older vehicle models
may occur to an extent surpassing the already given situation. While such conditions could act as an incentive to buy
a new model, they could as well exacerbate discrimination
and envy between vehicle holders. Since any market change
will produce winners and losers, an impact assessment of
technological innovations should be conducted beforehand,
to ensure that technological progress does not get stifled
and that its advantages are made visible.
Since they are a vision of the distant future, the effects
of interconnected autonomous vehicles cannot yet be fully
estimated. Traffic flow and traffic safety will increase,
while old vehicles could be considered a traffic obstacle or safety risk. Here, a legal obligation to new technology may be worth discussing. On the plus side, the need
for parking space close to a destination would become less
relevant, as vehicles could drive to and from any external
parking space by themselves; this would additionally benefit the environment, reducing the amount of land required
to build parking lots. Transportation centrals could work
as bookable resources managed within a network, which
would create new opportunities for the industry as well as
public authorities.
Even though it is difficult to transfer from one technology
to another, the new quality of mobility gained by autonomous
vehicles could change our lives in the next 20 years as it was
the case with mobile communication. The preconditions
from a research point of view are presented in chapter 5.

5. Future Research Foci
Despite all previous successes of driving assistance research
and development, much can still be achieved. Four focus
areas have been established from the technical perspective.

Individualization
One important focal point emerging from the status quo is
the need for individualization of DAS functional parameters
and HMI, the need to adapt to individual preferences and
requirements. On the one hand, this implies paying special
attention to and developing DAS specifically for particular
user groups. This need becomes apparent in regard to elderly
drivers who need to preserve their individual mobility for as
long as possible, but is equally applicable to young drivers
who are disproportionally frequently involved in accidents,
motor bike drivers as users of a vehicle-class inherently different from four-wheelers, and commercial bus and truck
conductors with their unusually high driving frequencies
and heavy vehicles. Regarding the latter, traffic safety should

be re-evaluated after the introduction of the new emergency
braking and lane keeping systems, in order to determine
what additional support is required.
On the other hand, the need for individualization and
adapting to user preferences and requirements also implies
optimizing the human-machine-interaction. By reducing
deficits of existing functions in this context, quality of experience and transparency of the system for the user could
improve user acceptance and promote market penetration.
Especially the increase of different DAS functionalities
that clearly exceed classical ACC and lane keeping support
makes integrative interaction concepts necessary. Integration of the presentation of information of e.g. all longitudinal support systems or lateral support systems is thinkable.
Free programmable displays plus head up displays and haptical feedback are promising enabling technologies for this.
Additionally integration is reasonable in the area of driver
input as an increasing number of buttons and controls
needs to be located in the interieur for different functionalities. Function development focused on individual usage
and optimal parameterization become particularly vital for
future assistance functions, especially in highly-automated
vehicles (Kienle et al. 2009). It is important that new interface technologies for displays and controls provide high
immersion of the driver into the driver-vehicle-system to
ensure the system isfigurativelycontrolled by the drivers intentions, and that task sharing between driver and
automated functions is intuitive and reliable (see. Fig 5 for a
contact-analogue head up display). All stages towards a fully
automated vehicle require fail-safe interaction concepts for
a handover of responsibility between driver and vehicle.
Since such progress can be achieved only via commercial
success, the systems require a high hedonic quality regarding all aspects of the interfaces design (Krger 2008). For
both, market success as well as traffic safety, individualization is imperative and should be tackled internationally in
order to meet requirements for different societies, economic
zones, and jurisdictions.

Machine Perception and Cognition



Todays sensors are capable of collecting detailed data of a
cars surrounding environment, but machine cognition and
situational awareness are still in their infancy. To improve
them, significant progress is required in symbolic scene classification, e.g. object recognition under dynamic conditions,
as well as in contextual scene understanding, e.g. inference of
the relationship between different dynamic objects and with
traffic infrastructure elements (Fig. 6). Last but not least,
the uncertainty and vagueness of the information from and
interpretation of the traffic scene needs to be made explicit.
Managing the above is crucial for the realization of
appropriate driving functions and corrective actions in
complex traffic situations. The acquisition of information
should be based on more sources than are available in
todays cars. High precision ego-localization in rich 3D digital maps will play a special role (Nothdurft et al. 2011). New
hardware concepts and algorithms for sensor data acquisition and interpretation could pave the way for performance
improvements at reduced costs. Machine vision techniques
for image sequence analysis as well as microwave and active
optical sensor technologies, still exhibit large potentials to
enhance spatio-temporal resolution and situational awareness of the perceived traffic scene. Methods for scene representation, including measures for quality, need to be further
elaborated as a basis for situational awareness.
Another future focus will be on a probabilistic prediction
of likely future behavior of the ego-vehicle and other traffic
participants, based on comprehensive intention inference
and behavior modeling (Liebner et al. 2013). Figure 7 shows
an example for ego-vehicle path prediction including based
on machine learning algorithms (Wiest et al. 2012).

Methods of Assessment
In the past, driving assistance research focused on technological breakthroughs. The emphasis is now shifting, as
methods of assessment (e.g. Fecher et al. 2008, Schner et
al. 2011, Aparicio et al. 2012, Brahmi et al. 2013) become
increasingly important. Without suitable and generally
accepted methods of assessment, potentially distracting or
unsafe functions cannot be introduced to the market.
Conventional testing procedures are insufficient to
ensure the safety of increasingly complex future assistance
functions involving machine perception and cognition. For
this reason, only apparently harmless assistance functions, like ACC or systems with short intervention periods
like emergency braking assistance, are currently available. However, the number of DAS and their functional
range are expected to grow considerably in the near term.
If testing and assessment methods cannot keep pace with
this functional growth, they will become the bottleneck of
the introduction of advanced DAS to the market (Maurer &
Winner 2013).
Currently, all stages of DAS development lack economically feasible concepts for assessment (Winner & Wolf 2009).
These include the evaluation of machine perception (Brahmi
et al. 2013), the assessment of desired as well as faulty function behavior, and last not least, user acceptance tests. A
particular challenge is posed by functions that delegate decisions from the human operator to the machine in unexpected
scenarios. In these cases, market introduction requires prior
proof that the risk taken on by handing vehicle control over
to the machine is at most equal to the risk taken on when
the human driver is in control (Frber & Maurer 2005, Bock

present sensor signals like steering angle and yaw rate.

et al. 2007). Two yet unresolved issues arise: how to measure
performance of the machine and that of the human operator
(Dambck et al. 2012a). Valid assessment methodologies exist
for neither, not even to mention the case of shared or cooperative control by human operator and machine (Bengler et al.
2012). To allow comparison between different control modes,
a suitable metric has to be devised.
Since a solution to these challenges is not to be expected
in near term, research on suitable assessment methods constitutes a part of the critical path to be taken in order to avoid
DAS development being held up for decades.

Cooperative Driving
The fourth focal point concerns the interconnection of and
the cooperation between individual vehicles in order to
establish a traffic network. Existing communication networks and in particular near-future vehicle2x networks
open up a wide spectrum of improvements to the holistic
performance of transportation systems. Hence, existing
approaches should be further developed towards a level
of maturity that allows market introduction and increases
the safety of all traffic participants through the benefits of
shared information (Fig. 8).
Initially, driver assistance functions based on vehicle2x
communication will have to provide benefits even with
low market penetration rates. In the long term, high penetration can be expected, requiring additional concepts to
be established in order to further optimize traffic, including minimizing resource consumption and maximizing
safety. These concepts should furthermore not focus merely
on individual rides, but also provide interfaces to currently
inactive or intermodal traffic in order to interlink alternative transportation systems. When DAS are modified to promote cooperative traffic, appealing visions such as deterministic traffic can come true. This would mean that a trip

Social Foci of Research
The foci addressed so far concentrated on research areas
from a technological point of view. They are based on the
expertise of the authors of this technical report. However,
not all relevant topics have been exhaustively addressed.
DAS not only reflect the progress of technology, but are
developed for humans who purchase and use them; they
make a difference for individual and collective safety as well
as for the mobility of groups and individuals.
Development of advanced DAS may be stimulated by market acceptance or stunted by societal reservations (Krger
2008, Karmasin 2008). On the other hand DAS - particularly those with a high degree of vehicle automation - may
induce changes in traffic behavior (Freyer 2007 et al., Freyer
2008). Furthermore, advanced DAS may stimulate new
business models and have a drastic impact on the nature of
future mobility. An early pro-active assessment of the consequences of technology may reduce potential conflicts.
Here, political and social discussions can begin prior to
market introduction, thus reducing the risk of investments
loss (Homann 2005). A crucial input for this discussion will
be reliable and valid methods to assess the controllability
of DAS. This assessment has not only to focus single functions as addressed in the RESPONSE Code of Practice (Donner et al. 2007) but moreover the combination of functions
in increasingly complex scenarios. The BASt taxonomy of
automation levels (Gasser, 2012, Gasser et al. 2012) gives
important orientation for these methodological activities
that will also have to cope with higher levels of automation
and effects of automation under behavioral aspects (Lee &
See 2004). Finally, further interdisciplinary research should
be dedicated to determine the social impact of DAS and fully
automated driving to pave the way towards its introduction.

6. Summary and Conclusion

Fig 8 Information sharing using Car2x communication circumvents
dangerous situations.

Since the 1980s, we have seen a long-term evolution of
research in advanced DAS with different foci. Due to several reasons, it took a long time for these systems to find
their way from research into production. Only for the last
few years we could observe an increasing, significant market penetration of DAS. In the course of the next several

IEEE Intelligent transportation systems magazine 

18

years, this will be further boosted by the new regulations of
the Euro NCAP (NCAP 2014), where the maximum score of
five stars will only be awarded to cars equipped with basic
DAS. But users themselves are also beginning to see the
advantages of such systems and are becoming increasingly
willing to pay their price.
Currently, we are observing the trend that previously
isolated driver assistant functions are merged together,
in order to realize more complex assistance with respect
to both, longitudinal and lateral, driving support. Partly
autonomous driving is expected to become a reality within
the next few innovation cycles of high-end cars, and even
highly automated driving no longer appears completely out
of reach.
Before such progress can be achieved, however, not
only a suitable regulatory framework must be adopted,
but significant research is required. The main topics,
of course, are technological, such as improved machine
vision and situational assessment. This includes the mapping of learned driving experience of human operators to
machine cognition. On the other hand, soft factors, e.g.
the acceptance of such systems by its end users, should
not be neglected. This obviously requires functional
transparency and reliability with respect to autonomous
behavior, along with adequate HMI concepts. These interdisciplinary challenges can only be overcome by a close
collaboration between engineers and psychologists. All of
these aspects demand a significant amount of fundamental research for at least the next decade.
