Abstract
This paper presents the results of attempt to perform modeling of SO2 concentration in urban area
in vicinity of copper smelter in Bor (Serbia), using ANFIS methodological approach. The aim of
obtained model was to develop a prediction tool that will be used to calculate potential SO2
concentration, above prescribed limitation, based on input parameters. As predictors, both
technogenic and meteorological input parameters were considered. Accordingly, the dependence of
SO2 concentration was modeled as the function of wind speed, wind direction, air temperature,
humidity and amount sulfur emitted from the pyrometallurgical process of sulfidic copper
concentration treatment.

In order to curb the growing harmful
effects of air quality, urgent risk assessment
and appropriate risk management tools are
essential in order to ensure flexible control of
high levels of pollution. For this purpose,
mathematical models have become essential
in the design of business decisions and
engineering management of technological
processes (Yetilmezsoy et al., 2011). Linear
statistical models generally do not produce
satisfactory results, which led to the
development of nonlinear models of artificial
neural networks ANNs (Yilmaz & Kaynar,
2011), and more recently several adaptive
neuro-fuzzy techniques - Adaptive NeuralFuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are
developed, which have been applied
successfully to control air pollution
(Morabito & Versaci, 2003; Yildrim &
Bayramogly, 2006; Ashish & Rashami,
2011). In order to combine the advantages of
fuzzy logic methodology and architecture of
the neural network, Jang (1993) has
proposed a brand new hybrid, adaptive
neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).
ANFIS has the advantages of neural
networks and fuzzy logic, where the ANN
has a better ability to learn, parallel
processing, adaptation, fault tolerance, while
the strategy of fuzzy logic can deal with
higher-level reasoning (Lei & Wan, 2012).
The main objective of this study is to
define the appropriate mathematical model
for predicting the SO2 content (imission) at
the measuring stations around the copper
smelter in Bor, which currently emits the
greatest amount of sulfur in the SO2 in the
urban environment smelter. Defined model

should allow defining the content of SO2 in
urban areas, with acceptable statistical
significance, from the amount of concentrate
processed and meteorological parameters,
which should enable better management of
SO2 immission in the urban environment
around the copper smelter.
1.1. Study area and measuring points
The study area is located in southeastern
Serbia, Figure l. City of Bor has about
40,000 inhabitants and is situated at a
distance of 30 km from the border with
Bulgaria, and about 100 km with Romania.
The rivers in this region belong to the basin
of the Danube River. The whole region has
about 200,000 inhabitants. Near to the
Romanian border is a national park Djerdap,
representative tourist center of the region.
Locations of measuring stations shown in
Figure 1, are representing the system of
monitoring of emissions in the city of Bor.
Distances between the measuring stations
and furnace chimney - the source of pollutant
emissions is as follows: measuring station 1
- Jugopetrol, in the south - southeast, is about
2.990 m from the emission source;
measuring station 2  Faculty, in the north northwest, away from the furnace chimney
about 880 m; measuring station 3 - City Park,
in the west, from the copper smelter at a
distance of about 480 m from the furnace
chimney, in the center of the urban part of the
city (local government, primary school,
hospital, town market, the main shopping
areas, promenade); measuring station 4 Instituit, in the south - southwest of the
smelter, in the new town center at a distance
of about 2,600 m from the furnace chimney,
where there are nearly half of the city's
population; measuring station 5 - Brezonik,

2. EXPERIMEnTAL
In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI)
based methods have been proposed as
alternatives to traditional linear statistical
ones in many scientific disciplines. The
literature demonstrates that AI models such
as ANN and neuro-fuzzy techniques are
successfully used for air pollution modeling
(Nunnari et al., 2004; Perez-Roa et al., 2006)
and forecasting (Perez et al., 2000; Gautam
et al., 2008; Mihajlovi et al., 2011).
If observing the measurement series for
variables presented in Table 1, it can be
concluded that almost all have wide range of
relative change (ratio of variance compared
to range). This way nonlinear statistic
analysis method, based on only one rule
describing the behaviour of input variable,
such are ANNs, most certainly wouldnt
present accurate enough results. From that
reason, further modeling approach was based
on
Adaptive-Network-Based
Fuzzy
Inference System (ANFIS).
The ANFIS system serve as a basis for
constructing a set of fuzzy if-then rules with
appropriate membership functions to
generate the stipulate input-output pairs. The
ANFIS structure is obtained by embedding
the fuzzy interference system into the
framework of adaptive networks (Jang,
1993). An adaptive network is a network
structure consisting of a number of nodes
connected through directional links. The
outputs of these adaptive nodes depend on
modifiable parameters pertaining to these
nodes (Guneri et al., 2011). The learning rule
specifies how these parameters should be
varied through iterations to minimize the
final error. On the other hand, according to
Takagi and Sugeno (1985) the fuzzy
inference system (FIS) is a framework based
on fuzzy set theory and fuzzy if-then rules.

29

Three main components of a FIS structure
are: a rule base, a database, and a reasoning
mechanism. The rule base has adequate
number of if-then rules for levels of ranges
of input variables. For example, one rule
might be if wind speed is low, than
registered SO2 concentration in the air is
high, where low and high are linguistic
variables. The database defines the
membership functions applied in fuzzy rules
and the reasoning mechanism performs the
inference procedure (Jang et al., 1997).
This way, for example that there are two
input variables (X1 and X2), and assuming
that their ranges can be divided in two levels,
there would be the rule base with two rules
for modeling the value of output variable Y:
Rule 1: If X1 is in the range A1 and X2 is
in the range B1, then f1 = p1x1 + q1x2 + r1
Rule 2: If X1 is in the range A2 and X2 is
in the range B2, then f2 = p2x1 + q2x2 + r2
In the case f(x1, x2) is a first-order
polynomial, then the model is called a firstorder Sugeno fuzzy model.
The graphical presentation of general
ANFIS network is presented in Figure 2. As
can be seen in Figure 2, ANFIS architecture
can be presented with five layers. Where X1
and X2 are inputs to nodes in layer 1, Ai and
Bi are the linguistic label of the ranges of
input variables (small, large, etc), associated
with the node function. Membership
functions of nodes located in layer 1 (Oi1 =
Ai(Xi) or Oi2 = Bi(Xi)) specifies the
degree to which the given Xi satisfies the
quantifier Ai, Bi, etc. Usually, membership
functions are either bell-shaped with

30

M.Savi / SJM 8 (1) (2013) 25 - 38

maximum equal to 1 and minimum equal to
0, or Gaussian function.
Nodes located in the layer 2 are
multipliers, which are multiplying the
signals exiting the layer 1 nodes. For
example Oi2 = Wi = Ai(Xi) x Bi(Xi), i =
1, 2, etc. Output of each node is representing
the firing strength of a rule. The i-th node of
layer 3 calculates the ratio of i-th rules firing
strength to sum of all rules firing strengths.
This way Oi3 = Wi = Wi /(W1 + W2 +
), i = 1, 2,  Every node i in the layer 4
has a node function of following type: Oi4 =

This way, for modeling the dependence of
SO2 concentration, on different predictors,
the data obtained from the automated
measuring stations were used in combination
with the data obtained from the smelting
process. The data were collected during the
year 2011, in the period of two months
(October and November). Measurement of

Defining
the
linear
correlation
dependence between the output and the input
parameters, with significant value of
coefficient of correlation (R2), provides the
possibility of predicting potential excess of
SO2 concentration in the air, in the
investigated area, using linear statistical
analysis methods such is multiple linear
regression analysis (MLRA). MLRA is one
of the most widely used methodologies for
expressing the dependence of a response
variable on several independent variables
(Al-Alawi et al., 2008). For defining the
linear correlation dependence in the form:
output of the model (Y) = f input of the
model (X1  X5), a bivariate correlation
analysis was performed. As the result of this
analysis,
Pearson
correlation
(PC)
coefficients with responding statistical
significance were calculated (Table 2).
According to values presented in Table 2,
it could be concluded that there isnt high
linear
dependence
between
SO2
concentration in the air (Y) and input
variables, although statistical significance is
recorded for most of correlated pairs.
According to these values, it was decided
that using MLRA for obtaining the
dependence between SO2 concentration and
investigated predictors, wouldnt result with
high accuracy.
On the other hand, if the value of
correlation between two variables is not
high, this doesnt automatically mean that
behaviour of one variable do not influence
the behaviour of other. This is indicator that
their inter correlation cannot be described
with linear model, however modeling based
on dynamic behaviour of the variables can be

used to present their inter dependences
(orevic et al., 2010). In such cases,
modeling could be facilitated using nonlinear
statistic approach such are Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs) - in case that input
variables do not have vide range during
whole time interval of observation (AbdulWahab & Al-Alawi, 2002; Ozdemir et al,
2008; Al-Alawi et al., 2008), or AdaptiveNetwork-Based Fuzzy Inference System for
variables with vide range of change (Noori et
al., 2010; Johanyak & Kovacs, 2011).
According to the number of input
variables, their ranges and the variations,
presented in Table 1, it was decided that two
rules ANFIS network should be applied.
Selected membership function was Gaussian
one. Number of input variables was five (X1
to X5), with one output variable (Y).
To apply the ANFIS methodology the
assembly of 1,800 input and output samples
was divided into two groups. The first group
consisted of 1,292 (70 %) at random
selected samples, and it was used for training
of the model, whereas the second group
consisted of 508 (30 %) remaining samples
from the starting data set, and it was used for
testing the model. The selection of the
variables for these two stages was performed
by using random number generator. In the
gathering data process for the training and
the testing stage, the values for each input
variable are normalized by the maximum
values. This was done because of different
nature and measuring units of input
variables.
During the training phase the correction
of the weighted parameters (pi, qi, ri, etc) of
the connections is achieved through the
necessary number of iterations, until the
mean squared error between the calculated
and measured outputs of the ANFIS network,

is minimal. During the second phase, the
remaining 30% of the data is used for testing
the trained network. In this phase, the
network uses the weighted parameters
determined during the first phase. These new
data, excluded during the network training
stage, are now incorporated as the new input
values (Xi) which are then transformed into
the new outputs (Y). For calculation
presented in this paper MATLAB ANFIS
editor was used (MathWorks, R2012b).
In the phase of the network training, the
necessary number of iterations was
performed until the error between the
measured output of the SO2 concentration in
the air - Y and the calculated values wasnt
minimized and remained constant. In the
case of the investigation presented in this
paper, optimal number of iterations (epochs)
was 10. The obtained results from the
training stage can be evaluated by
comparison of the calculated values Y with
the measured ones (Figure 3). The
dependance of the output value (Y) on
different predictors is presented in Figure 4.

The ANFIS modeling approach, in the
training stage, predicted the SO2
concentration in the air with a determination
coefficient R2 = 0.526 (Figure 3), which
doesnt represent very large significance.
The reason for such behaviour of the model
is in large dispersion of the starting sample,
ranging with SO2 values from 0 to 4,624.
