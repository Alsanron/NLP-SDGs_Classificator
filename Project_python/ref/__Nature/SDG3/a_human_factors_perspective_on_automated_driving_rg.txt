Automated driving can fundamentally change road transportation and improve

27

quality of life. However, at present, the role of humans in automated vehicles

28

(AVs) is not clearly established. Interviews were conducted in April and May

29

2015 with twelve expert researchers in the field of Human Factors (HF) of

30

automated driving to identify commonalities and distinctive perspectives

31

regarding HF challenges in the development of AVs. The experts indicated that

32

an AV up to SAE Level 4 should inform its driver about the AVs capabilities and

33

operational status, and ensure safety while changing between automated and

34

manual modes. HF research should particularly address interactions between

35

AVs, human drivers, and vulnerable road users. Additionally, driver training

36

programs may have to be modified to ensure that humans are capable of using

37

AVs. Finally, a reflection on the interviews is provided, showing discordance

38

between the interviewees statementswhich appear to be in line with a long

39

history of work on human factors research, and the rapid development of

40

automation technology. We expect our perspective to be instrumental for

41

stakeholders involved in AV development and instructive to other parties.

48

was revealed among the researchers regarding the HF challenges that need to be resolved

prior to the deployment of AVs on public roads. Such challenges include the synergy between

50

and the type of information that the human drivers shall be receiving from the automated

concerns regarding the AVs development and deployment and the AVs technological

Introduction

1
2
3

Automated driving technology has the potential to fundamentally change road

4

transportation and improve quality of life. Automated vehicles (AVs) are anticipated to

5

reduce the number of accidents caused by human errors, increase traffic flow efficiency,

6

increase comfort by allowing the driver to perform alternative tasks, and ensure mobility for

7

all, including old and impaired individuals (Fagnant and Kockelman 2015; Mui and Carroll

8

2013).

9

AVs can be classified according to their technological capabilities and human

10

engagement, ranging from manual driving, where the human driver executes all of the

11

driving tasks, to fully automated driving where no human interaction occurs. In this paper,

12

we adopt the SAE levels of automation (SAE International 2014; 2016) shown in Table 1,

13

which is arguably the most well known and broadly used taxonomy in the field of automated

14

driving research (International Transport Forum 2015; NHTSA 2016).

There are suggestions that Levels 3 and 4 automation could be deployed by 2020

3

(ERTRAC Task Force and Connectivity and Automated Driving 2015), while Tesla announced

4

the introduction of an automated feature that will allow individuals to summon their

5

vehicles from a distance by 2018 (Blum 2016; Korosec 2015). Moreover, a recent study

6

suggests that the public expects Level 5 (full) automation in more than 50% of vehicles by

7

around 2030 (Kyriakidis, Happee, and De Winter 2015).

8

Along this accelerating evolution of road vehicle automation, Human Factors (HF)

9

research scientists have warned for a long time that the mere fact that you can automate

10

does not mean that you should (Fitts 1951; Hancock 2014). As early as 1983, Bainbridge

11

(1983) presented several ironies of automation and explained that the more advanced a

12

control system is, so the more crucial may be the contribution of the human operator.

13

Similarly, Parasuraman and Riley (1997) explained the importance of studying how humans

14

may misuse, disuse, and abuse automation technology, and also argued that humans tend to

15

be poor supervisors of automation. With respect to AVs in particular, up to Level 4

16

automation, human drivers will be a key component, because they should operate the

17

vehicle in conditions not supported by the automation, and will be expected (Level 4), even

18

if not liable (Ref for Volvo), or even required (Levels 2 and 3) to resume manual control

19

when needed.

20

Studies indicate that many challenges pertaining to the interaction between human

21

drivers and automated systems are yet to be resolved. Such challenges include the impact of

22

automated systems on drivers mental workload and situation awareness (Brookhuis et al.

23

2008; De Winter et al. 2014; Kaber and Endsley 2004; Merat et al. 2012; Salmon, Stanton,

24

and Young 2012; Stanton and Young 2005; Whitmore and Reed 2015), as well as the human

25

drivers levels of acceptance (Brookhuis et al. 2008), trust, and reliance on the automated

26

systems (Coelingh 2013; De Waard et al. 1999; Fisher, Reed, and Savirimuthu 2015;

27

Verberne, Ham, and Midden 2012).

28

Further challenges are associated with potential changes in human drivers behaviour

29

due to automation (Gouy et al. 2014), the necessary skills that the humans should retain to

4

1

perform the driving task manually (Vlakveld 2015), and the role of the humans in the case of

2

an emergency such as when automation fails or exceeds its functional limits (Levitan,

3

Golembiewski, and Bloomfield 1998). In addition, research has yet to clarify the required

4

level of supervisory control and cooperation (who is performing what part of the driving

5

task) between human drivers and automated systems (Banks and Stanton 2016; Coelingh

6

2013; Hoc, Young and Blosseville 2009; Lu et al. 2016; Marinik et al. 2014).

7

Research challenges also comprise the estimation of the minimum time required by

8

human drivers to resume manual control when instructed by the automated system (Gold et

9

al. 2013, 2016; Merat et al. 2014; Mok et al. 2015; Radlmayr et al. 2014; Schieben et al.

10

2008; Zeeb, Buchner, and Schrauf 2015), and the interaction between AVs and other

11

vehicles and road users (Martens and Van den Beukel 2013, Merat and Lee 2012; Merat et

12

al., submitted; Madigan et al., 2016). Finally, as argued by Hancock (2015, p. 139), one

13

empirical question that necessitates vital research at this present time is the establishment

14

of appropriate epidemiological baselines for the dimensions of current, manually operated

15

vehicle performance such as transit time efficiency, system downtime, injury and fatality.

16

Therefore, HF research can critically contribute to the development and deployment of

17

AVs, by working towards a synergy between the human driver, vehicle, and environment.

18

This paper presents the findings of an interview study with twelve researchers in the field of

19

HF and automated driving. The aim of the study was twofold: first, to define the most critical

20

HF challenges related to AVs, and second, to indicate similarities and distinctive perspectives

21

among the researchers.

22

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. First, we will describe the methods of

23

the study, with subsequent sections providing a summary of the researchers opinions in

24

the form of twelve narratives. Finally, we discuss parallels and idiosyncrasies regarding the

25

opinions of the interviewees, and provide concluding remarks and suggestions for policy

26

makers and other stakeholders.

27
28

Methods

29
30

Using a 35 item questionnaire interview (provided in the Appendix), the twelve

31

researchers articulated their expectations, concerns, and vision about AVs. The

5

1

questionnaire was designed to reflect the researchers experience and expertise, and it

2

addressed four main areas of interest associated with the development of AVs: (1)

3

challenges from a HF perspective, (2) potential strengths and benefits, (3) deployment

4

scenarios and likely changes in the status of road transportation, and (4) public acceptance

5

and expectations. The background and expertise of the participants is provided in the

6

Section About the authors and helps the readers to interpret the twelve narratives. The

7

questionnaire was built on past research that explored the public and subject matter

8

experts opinion on automated driving (Begg 2014; Casley, Jardim, and Quartulli 2013; KPMG

9

2014; Kyriakidis, Happee, and De Winter 2015; Payre, Cestac, and Delhomme 2014;

10

Schoettle and Sivak 2014a, 2014b; Sommer 2013; Underwood 2014).

11

The twelve researchers are currently involved in research activities associated with HF

12

and AVs, and they all have more than 10 years of experience in the field (mean = 19 years).

13

Nine of the researchers participate in the EU project Human Factors of Automated Driving

14

(2014d). To increase diversity, three additional researchers contributed to the study. One of

15

them is involved in the EU projects AdaptiVe (2014a) and CityMobil2, the second in the UK

16

project GATEway (2014c), and the third coordinates the EU support action Vehicle and Road

17

Automation (VRA) (2013).

18

The interviews were carried out individually in April and May 2015, with their duration

19

varying between 45 and 90 minutes. Based on transcripts from audio recordings of each

20

interview, an initial narrative was generated to describe the researchers main insights

21

regarding the four addressed areas of interest. Building upon these narratives, the

22

researchers then recomposed and finalized their statements, as presented in the next

23

section.

Researchers opinions

Neville Stanton

28

Decades of research have shown that humans are not particularly good at tasks that

29

require vigilance and sustained attention over long periods of time (Warm, Parasuraman,

30

and Matthews 2008). Today, one of the major challenges in the design of AVs is the

31

expectation that drivers will monitor the system constantly and appropriately intervene

32

when required (Stanton, Young, and McCaulder 1997). Experience from other industries,
6

1

such as aviation, has shown that automation may actually cause as many problems as it

2

solves. For example, the disconnection of the autopilot on Air France Flight 447 from Rio de

3

Janeiro to Paris (which crashed on 1 June 2009, BEA 2012) failed to communicate the nature

4

of the situation (the blocking of pitot tubes with ice crystals) effectively to the human pilots.

5

The resultant inputs from the pilots led the aircraft into an aerodynamic stall, from which it

6

did not recover. The black box voice recorder makes for chilling reading, as the pilots

7

struggled to regain control of the aircraft.

8

There is concern that AVs could cause similar confusion in drivers, where the drivers

9

understanding of the situation is at odds with reality (Stanton, Dunoyer, and Leatherland

10

2011). Whilst in aviation, people are beginning to wise up to the fact that automation is

11

causing confusion in pilots (which has been called a mode error in the technical literature

12

(Sarter and Woods 1995), there is still an assumption that the driver will be the last line of

13

defence in AVs. Despite two decades of research on AVs, there is still much to be learnt. HF

14

research can play a substantial role in the development of our understanding of driving AVs

15

by reproducing a range of situations in simulators. Here we can observe how drivers are

16

likely to behave as well as get feedback on their experience.

17

Research should be focusing on maintaining the communication and interaction between

18

AVs and the driver. Unless a system can be designed that requires no human input at all (and

19

has no controls within the vehicle) we need to design automation that supports, rather than

20

replaces, human drivers. To some extent, supportive automation is already with us, such as

21

Antilock Braking Systems, Lane Keeping Systems, and Electronic Stability Control (Stanton

22

and Young 2005). These systems can be thought of as a background automation rather than

23

foreground automation (where the latter takes over the driving tasks). Background

24

automation allows the driver to drive the vehicle, but watches over them in case of trouble

25

(Young, Stanton, and Harris 2007). If the driver brakes too hard, strays out of the lane, or

26

steers too hard, the automation will intervene in an attempt to save them. Automated

27

Emergency Braking Systems are an extension of this philosophy, and will brake if the sensors

28

detect an impending accident without any intervention from the driver.

29

As a cautionary note, with creeping automation taking a more active role in driving, there

30

are some very salient lessons to be learnt from aviation. This can be illustrated using the

31

difference between the automation philosophies in Boeing and Airbus. In Boeing the pilot is

32

king. Although there is a protective layer of automation, this can be overridden by the pilots.

33

By way of contrast, in the Airbus the computer is king, and the pilots cannot override this
7

1

protective layer of automation in normal law mode. Whilst it is acknowledged that the

2

automation does protect pilots, it can also cause problems as shown with the AF447. In this

3

incident, the aircraft entered alternate law mode (although the pilots did not realize this

4

mode change) (BEA 2012). In addition, the flight controls in the Airbus do not have any

5

feedback (they do in the Boeing), so do not move at all when the autopilot is in control

6

(whereas they do in the Boeing). Each pilot did not realize that the other was making control

7

inputs. This would be equivalent to the steering wheel not moving in a car that is being

8

driven automatically, certainly not something I would advise to vehicle manufacturers.

9

Overall, automated vehicles are meaningful only if drivers are freed from the driving

10

tasks, are not anticipated to supervise the system, and are not liable for it. We are, however,

11

rather far from reaching this point (Walker, Stanton, and Salmon 2015). Accordingly, it might

12

be more beneficial for the society if research focuses on background automation, until

13

foreground automation has matured sufficiently.

14
15

Thierry Bellet

16

Almost twenty five years ago, the US Automated Highway System (AHS) program was

17

launched to conduct long range research on the design of future Intelligent Transportation

18

Systems aimed at aiding driving, enhancing the capacity and efficiency of the highway

19

system, and assisting transportation agencies in managing their facilities and controlling

20

traffic (Bement et al. 1998).

21

One of the programs main findings was the unclear extent to which human drivers

22

would accept reduced manual control of their vehicles or be willing to travel in automated

23

vehicles at close following distances, on narrower lanes, and at higher speeds (Bement et al.

24

1998). The program also showed that improving road safety and increasing road capacity

25

might not be mutually compatible unless society accepts the idea of automation

26

responsibility in the case of accidents (Bellet et al. 2003). If not, the human drivers may be

27

required to remain alert and take back the control of their vehicles in the case of critical

28

situations. Subsequently, increased safety margins and a reduction of vehicle speeds are

29

required to allow drivers to rebuild their situation awareness and adequately resume control

30

of the driving task. However, this would mean that AVs, compared to manual driving, would

31

actually reduce road capacity. Therefore, the program concluded that although there are no

32

technical showstoppers for the overall success of an automated highway system, legal and
8

1

societal challenges may be more difficult to resolve, including rejecting the founding

2

paradigm of the driving task, where responsibility lies with the human driver (Lay, McHale,

3

and Stevens 1996). Recent developments in AVs have changed the situation. AVs, although

4

in limited numbers, now exist. It is not a question of whether it is possible to have AVs on

5

the public roads. It is a question of how, when, and under which conditions they should be

6

introduced. Of course, the famous Bainbridges (1983) ironies of automation remain

7

exactly the same, but now the time has come to propose solutions to these ironies. Today

8

the main challenge is not to consider the future, but to think about the present. Facing this

9

challenge, HF research has to clearly define the role of humans in AVs (is the human still

10

technically a driver), and to support accordingly the design of a human centred automation.

11

Synthetically, three main options seem promising: (1) developing co piloting systems

12

supporting the driver rather than replacing them, (2) designing solutions to keep humans in

13

the loop of control during automation, in order to support situation awareness, (3) defining

14

dedicated areas for full automation without any responsibility of the driver (e.g., dedicated

15

lane on highways, or platooning for long tunnels).

16

However, to support such human centred design of automation, new simulation tools

17

are required, from realistic AV simulators allowing full scale immersive tests, to traffic flow

18

simulations including realistic human driver models that are able to predict the road safety

19

effects of AVs (Bellet et al. 2012). Such simulation tools could allow us to test different types

20

of AVs, support decision making regarding policy and legislation, and finally permit the

21

introduction of AVs on public roads and their potential deployment during the next 20 years.

22
23

Bart van Arem

24

The deployment of automated vehicles will eventually change road transportation as it

25

stands today. However, AVs that are able to drive in all situations and at all conditions,

26

without requiring any human supervision or intervention, will not be introduced into the

27

market any time soon.

28

Nevertheless, I believe that within the next 10 years AVs could be deployed on public

29

roads for specific scenarios (e.g., highway driving). The human drivers in those vehicles will

30

then be supervising the system and intervene if required.

31

Research, therefore, should aim at ensuring that the human drivers remain alert and

32

situational aware, even when they are not actively controlling the steering wheel and
9

1

pedals. This level of automation, however, will not allow the drivers to be engaged in a large

2

variety of non driving tasks. This means that the benefits for the consumers as well as their

3

acceptance and willingness to buy such AVs are limited.

4

Thus, our resources should be focusing on highly automated driving, which will enable a

5

driver to engage in non driving tasks, and which is equipped with fail safe strategies,

6

including a feature that brings the car to a minimal risk condition (cf. SAE, 2016).

7
8

Karel Brookhuis

9

Human beings notoriously get bad marks in (low frequency) vigilance tasks, that is,

10

detecting occasional mishaps. The poor human ability to monitor and supervise represents a

11

major weakness of automated vehicles in general, and specifically at the SAE Level 2, since it

12

will be mandatory for human drivers to keep monitoring the system and the environment.

13

Since human drivers should primarily be supervising the system, rather than engaging in any

14

other activities, the benefits of AVs and in turn their acceptance and the public willingness to

15

use them, let alone buy them, are debatable, whilst driver training and licensing will change

16

dramatically. In order to maintain driving skills, human drivers should keep having the

17

opportunity to drive manually, probably requiring AVs to stay fully equipped.

18

As system failures cannot be excluded, additional research should focus on four topics:

19

(1) to define the way in which human drivers should be informed in case of a system failure,

20

(2) depending on the type of failure, what the human driver is able and allowed to do, (3) to

21

optimize the safe interaction of the new technology with human drivers, and (4) to ensure

22

public acceptance and trust in automated vehicles.

23

The deployment of SAE Level 5, operating without any human intervention in all

24

situations and at all conditions, might even never happen, as people are reluctant to accept

25

any potential harm caused by a machine operating independently. A realistic and fast way to

26

deploy AVs is by employing segregated lanes, which will be controlled and maintained by a

27

separately managed infrastructure. In these lanes only authorized AVs operating at SAE

28

Level 4/5 will be allowed.

29

In conclusion, I am expecting AVs within the next 10 years, but only in a segregated

30

manner such as low speed vehicles on designated tracks for the transportation of goods. For

31

this to happen, the safety levels should be clearly demonstrated, while any potential side
10

1

effects that may arise from their deployment are adequately communicated to the people

2

involved and to society in general.

5

Automated vehicles in the next couple of years will have operational limitations, being

6

able to operate only under the specific conditions they can cope with. Once we can prove

7

that AVs are always able to cope with situations in an acceptable, safe, and comfortable

8

manner, the AVs may take over control, and the human drivers will become passengers.

9

Subsequently, liability issues could also be resolved, with the drivers remaining liable for as

10

long as they are in control of their vehicle, and the original equipment manufacturers

11

(OEMs) becoming liable once automation accepts the control of the vehicle.

12

However, if AVs cannot cope with a situation, they will either hand over the control to

13

the human driver or they will come to an alternative solution such as a transition to a

14

minimal risk condition. This may include AV coming to a standstill (e.g., safe stop), which

15

may be dangerous if the AV does not explicitly communicate its intention to other road

16

users or does not come to safe stop in a predictable manner or at a predictable location.

17

HF research should specifically focus on the transitions from automation to manual

18

driving, in order to ensure that the human driver will appropriately respond to the request

19

of their vehicle to take over control. Additionally, HF research should identify the behaviour

20

of AVs vehicles when automation is in control, in order for the passengers to understand the

21

vehicles actions and to feel comfortable (i.e., no motion sickness; cf. Diels and Bos 2016),

22

and for other road users to understand and predict the AVs intentions. This will ensure the

23

maximal benefits in terms of safety, efficiency, comfort and acceptance.

24

By elaborating current technology, the deployment of SAE Level 3 or AVs operating on

25

highways will be feasible within the next 5 years. I do not believe in SAE Level 2 (driver

26

monitoring the environment), since drivers are not able to pay attention to the road and

27

automation status across long periods. SAE Level 2 is suitable for testing and research

28

purposes, with expert drivers or technicians assessing the reliability of the automation, in

29

order to verify readiness for SAE Level 3. Yet, a lot of testing is required to confirm the safe

30

operation of AVs in different types of conditions, and to understand the operational

31

envelope of automation. SAE Level 2 systems as we currently see introduced on the market

32

will only work well if their reliability is actually Level 3 ready.
11

1

The deployment of SAE Level 5 in mixed traffic conditions may never happen at

2

acceptable levels. AVs may have to operate at very low speeds in order to meet appropriate

3

safety requirements, making these vehicles particularly slow in city environments. However,

4

such AVs could be introduced for specific scenarios and types of operation, such as public

5

transportation.

Automated driving should not become a hype topic; its presentation nowadays

9

sometimes may be too visionary and confusing/distorting for the public. It is rather

10

unrealistic, for example, to expect SAE Level 5 automated vehicles soon on public roads.

11

However, it could indeed be possible to introduce fully automated driving vehicles operating

12

at low speeds in segregated lanes supported by infrastructure for specific scenarios.

13

Examples of such applications can be found in public transport or the transportation of

14

goods.

15

It is important, therefore, to clearly define the functionalities and the range of

16

applicability of automated vehicles. Based on the current technological and infrastructural

17

capabilities, automated driving could only be a fraction of individuals daily mobility. At

18

present, SAE Levels 4 or 5 AVs can only be applied in very specific scenarios, such as low

19

speeds and specific areas.

20

In the future, AVs may be able to operate at higher SAE automation levels. In such

21

vehicles, the mode of driving can be selected based on the situation and conditions at each

22

particular time of the operation. In other words, the human drivers could remain drivers,

23

supervisors of automation, or passengers, depending on the mode of automation. In those

24

vehicles, new families of input elements can be introduced, yet steering wheels have many

25

advantages, such as clear visual feedback regarding direction.

26

AVs will be designed to obey the traffic rules in all cases, and therefore the fluency of

27

their interaction with other vehicles and road users, as well as their acceptance by the

28

public, is a big topic.

29

Within this context, HF research has four main tasks. First, to define the acceptance

30

criteria of human drivers regarding the automated driving functionalities. Second, to

31

determine the individual capabilities of human drivers when using AVs (e.g., situation
12

1

awareness, reaction times), and in turn to ensure safety while changing driving modes.

2

Today, for instance, humans driving manually are able to look outside their windows or to

3

the dashboard for a small period of time without a problem. It is unrealistic to expect that

4

human drivers will constantly monitor the automation system. Rather it could make sense,

5

to define a period that the drivers could divert their view away from the automated system.

6

Third, to provide design solutions regarding the interfaces installed in AVs and their

7

interaction with the human drivers. Finally, to investigate the interaction and

8

communication between AVs and conventional cars and other road users. AVs will be

9

deployed on the market only if they are proven to be safe, and all the relevant liability issues

10

are resolved.

13

Automated vehicles can eventually change the status of road transportation, including

14

the use and ownership of vehicles. From a safety, mobility, and traffic perspective the focus

15

on developing and directly deploying SAE Level 5 AVs would be the most beneficial, as the

16

majority of the human factors and legal challenges associated with the SAE Levels 2, 3 and 4

17

AVs would be avoided. Yet, it is more realistic to expect a gradual deployment of SAE Levels

18

2, 3 and 4 AVs, which will introduce different levels of functionalities and applicability.

19

The main weaknesses of these automation levels, however, are the expectation that

20

human drivers intervene upon a request by the automation, in addition to the liability

21

uncertainties. Who would like to use automation if they remain liable at all times for a

22

system that they partially cannot control?

23

HF researchers need, therefore, to understand how people will be using the automated

24

functionalities, in order to ensure a smooth process for the human drivers to regain control

25

of the vehicle. Research has proven that people are poor in monitoring a technological

26

system (e.g., Endsley 1996), or staying alert when not being engaged to the driving task, and

27

we should be aware of this when the liability criteria are determined by legislators. It is

28

crucial, therefore, to define the minimum time requirements for human drivers to return

29

back in the control loop, for several different driving scenarios. For this, research would first

30

have to define the human drivers mind set, and whether bringing them into the loop is a

31

cognitive or a decision making aspect. Furthermore, it is important to define the type and

13

1

frequency of information that human drivers should be receiving in order to facilitate and

2

maintain their situation awareness, primarily when they are not engaged to the driving task.

3

In addition, HF research must determine how people using other transport modes or

4

conventional vehicles, and vulnerable road users will be interacting with AVs, and to confirm

5

that the human drivers and all road users are aware of the automated systems capabilities

6

and limitations.

7

Natasha Merat

9

The main concerns and worries towards deployment of automated vehicles are currently

10

associated with automation SAE Levels 2 and 3. All relevant stakeholders agree that it is very

11

difficult to establish and ensure whether or not a human driver is aware of the automated

12

system performance, and research suggests that humans may generally be poor supervisors

13

of automation in such circumstances (Parasuraman 1987). Subsequently, it is hard to define

14

the appropriate time that humans need to regain control of a vehicle during a specific

15

situation, and to confirm that upon regaining control they respond in a safe and appropriate

16

manner (Merat et al. 2014). As long as the design of AVs allows human intervention, the

17

impact on safety of road transportation is debatable.

18

The general public should also be aware that we are far from ready to deploy AVs

19

capable of operating in all environments and scenarios without any human intervention. It is

20

therefore more likely that the first AVs will only be operating in dedicated lanes, for specific

21

driving scenarios.

22

One of todays biggest challenges is to verify that the human drivers are aware of the

23

AVs limitations, in order to resume control when required, whilst also remaining free to

24

engage in other activities, beyond driving. Otherwise, if drivers' main task in an AV is to

25

observe and monitor the vehicle and its operation, the benefits of automation to consumers

26

are minimal.

27

Therefore, for the next 5 to 10 years, research is likely to focus more on providing

28

solutions for maintaining human drivers situation awareness, mainly when they are not

29

engaged in the driving task. In addition to ensuring that AVs (including their computers and

30

sensors) are functioning reliably, improvements in the design and performance of HMIs are

14

1

required to establish the type and amount of information that drivers should receive in

2

order to cope with any unexpected situation (Merat and Lee 2012).

3

The long term potential benefits of AVs on safety, time and traffic efficiency, mobility,

4

and pollution can be enormous. Yet, all relevant stakeholders have to be modest and avoid

5

confusing the public by raising unrealistic expectations. Indeed, it might be possible to have

6

vehicles with automated functionalities on public roads within the next 10 to 15 years.

7

However, it is rather likely that the cost and maintenance of such vehicles will be quite high,

8

which will be a major barrier towards their deployment and acceptance by the majority of

9

the public.

10
11

Nick Reed

12

Today, challenges towards the introduction of automated vehicles are associated with

13

levels of automation that rely on the human drivers. Although it is feasible to deploy

14

conditional automated driving vehicles (SAE Level 3), the expectation that a human driver

15

can remain alert and rapidly regain situational awareness following a request by the system

16

is unrealistic. However, if AVs become capable of safely dealing with a human driver failing

17

to respond to a request to intervene, then fully automated vehicles cannot be far behind.

18

Research has first to determine a safe and effective process for re engaging the driver back

19

in the loop. Second, to educate human drivers on system capabilities and expected actions;

20

and thirdly, to explore tendencies for drivers to use automation and adapt their driving

21

behaviour to particular circumstances of a journey.

22

Current technology suggests that deployment of low speed automated vehicles operating

23

without human intervention on dedicated routes for specific purposes, such as public

24

transport, may be possible within three years. Once the technology is mature enough to

25

support fully automated vehicles, car ownership and vehicle usage patterns will change.

26

Today, a car is often the second biggest investment a person makes yet will typically be

27

parked the majority of the time. There is also a trend for younger people to reject car

28

ownership or license acquisition, probably associated with high insurance costs for driving.

29

SAE Level 4 and (eventually) Level 5 AVs make mass car sharing models much more viable.

30

As an on demand service, people could choose a vehicle that is appropriate for each

31

individual, specific journey rather than owning an individual vehicle that is compromised

32

across an owners various mobility needs. These shared AVs present additional HF
15

1

challenges such as how to design AVs that provide an enjoyable, personalized travel

2

experience for diverse customers and how vehicle interiors should be redesigned to make

3

journeys comfortable and pleasant without compromising occupant safety.

4

Maxime Flament

6

The automation levels have been formulated as a common language. As technology is

7

advancing, we need to keep a critical eye and avoid getting stuck at an intermediate level of

8

automation. Indeed, todays HF research raises serious doubt as for the handing over of the

9

driving task associated with SAE Level 3. It is human nature that a driver, who is relieved

10

even briefly from their driving task, will engage to other distracting tasks. From a liability

11

standpoint, the industry will not introduce such a distracting system unless the automation

12

can bring the vehicle to a minimal risk condition if no driver response is detected. For this

13

reason, the SAE Level 3 AVs may just never come to the market.

14

Adding confusion to the definitions, the same vehicle, depending on its environment and

15

its access to reliable information, could allow more than one level of automation. The HF

16

challenge in this case will be to clearly inform the driver about the possible levels of

17

automation at any given time and place, and why this is so. This will lead to trust and

18

acceptance of automation, but, too much trust may cause over reliance together with

19

unintended use, misuse, and even abuse. In fact, the difficulty may come from other road

20

users: manual drivers, cyclists and pedestrians; knowing the AVs capabilities, they may take

21

advantage of AVs in mixed traffic. The challenge for AVs will then be to keep their place in

22

traffic while guaranteeing reasonable safety. This should lead to innovative ways to indicate

23

the driving intentions to other road users.

24

AVs should firstly address critical situations caused by boredom and drowsiness, as well

25

as construction sites, intersections and other stressful areas. AVs could be on the market

26

within less than ten years, first on highways then gradually on other main roads,

27

supplemented with valet parking.

28

Marjan Hagenzieker

30

The role of human drivers is one of the main challenges when discussing automated

31

driving vehicles. In vehicles where human drivers are expected to intervene, the human has
16

1

to be both a driver and a supervisor. However, these two roles require different training and

2

skills, while they are not in tune. For instance, the less human drivers are manually

3

controlling their vehicles, the more their driving skills will deteriorate (e.g., Dragutinovic et

4

al. 2005), which can be critical especially in the case of an emergency.

5

Therefore, HF research should determine the required skills of humans in order to

6

operate AVs, and to identify any changes in their driving behaviour. Moreover, research has

7

to define the necessary (re)action times for the types of situations and interventions that

8

drivers will be asked to perform.

9

In addition, research should assist in redesigning the current driver training programs. On

10

the one hand, the new programs have to ensure that human drivers are always capable of

11

performing the driving task. On the other hand, they must instruct human drivers how to

12

supervise automation, and to maintain their supervisory skills.

13

HF researchers also have to determine ways of communication between AVs with human

14

drivers, other vehicles, and vulnerable road users. In addition, research has to determine the

15

consequences of behaviour of AVs, which is potentially very different compared to the

16

manual driven vehicles. Such large differences in the behaviour of AVs may impose

17

additional demands on people who do not drive or use AVs. This could raise questions on

18

whether we should allow AVs to induce such demands to those who do not own, drive, or

19

use this technology.

20

For fully automated vehicles that do not require any human intervention, research

21

should focus on proving them safe and reliable. However, it is too optimistic to believe that

22

such vehicles will be able to operate in large scale mixed traffic in the foreseeable future.

23

Nevertheless, the deployment of AVs of SAE Levels 3 and 4 on specific stretches, dedicated

24

areas, and driving scenarios, such as highways, is feasible and could in the mid and long term

25

improve the safety of road transportation.

26
27

Riender Happee

28

Are we ready to deploy automated vehicles on public roads? Certainly not, as we still

29

have to prove them safe. On the one hand, the role of the human driver in AVs has not been

30

clearly defined. On the other hand, neither vehicle technology nor the infrastructure is

17

1

proven to be ready to support the deployment of automated vehicles safely operating in real

2

world traffic conditions.

3

Proving safety requires on road and virtual testing to rigorously assess not only the

4

technology but also the human interaction with automation. The critical aspects of HF to

5

date have almost exclusively been tested in driving simulators (De Winter et al. 2014).

6

Undoubtedly, driving simulators are valuable for gaining insight in human behaviour,

7

especially in safety critical scenarios that cannot be easily tested on the public roads. Yet,

8

the results derived from simulator experiments do not necessarily reflect reality. It is

9

essential, therefore, to compare the behaviour of drivers in simulators with equivalent

10

studies on the public roads, in order to eventually build evaluation methods combining

11

simulator and on road studies.

12

Testing procedures are required for sensing and control systems in order to determine

13

whether they operate reliably in complex real world driving conditions. HF research should

14

focus on establishing procedures to test and determine the safe interaction between human

15

drivers and automation, not only during transitions of control, but also regarding the

16

interaction of automated vehicles with other road users.

17

Hands free driving is already commercially available with restrictions, and eyes off road

18

driving may be possible and legal in the near future, in particular for highway conditions. AVs

19

can provide transitions to minimal risk condition (e.g., safe stop) if human drivers do not

20

take over when this is requested by the AV. Such minimal risk strategies can prevent

21

mishaps in the hopefully rare case that drivers are unfit to resume control. However, as long

22

as such take over requests exists, and as long as drivers have options to resume manual

23

driving, we need to incorporate human factors analysis in the safety assessment of

24

automated driving.

25
Discussion

26
27

Comparison of the interviewees statements

28
29

The interviews revealed a consensus regarding HF challenges that need to be resolved

30

prior to a wide scale deployment of AVs on public roads, with a number of distinctive

31

remarks.
18

1

In line with recent position papers (Casner, Hutchins, and Norman 2016; Norman 2015;

2

Poulin et al. 2015; Trimble et al. 2014), the experts highlighted a complex interaction

3

between human drivers and SAE Level 2 and 3 automated vehicles. The interviewees

4

stressed that any automated system that removes the human from the driving task, yet

5

requires the human to monitor and supervise the system and regain control when

6

necessary, could be unsafe. In other words, one should not expect that human drivers will

7

always be able to regain control of their vehicles in a safe and appropriate manner.

8

Moreover, SAE Level 2 and 3 systems may not be welcomed by drivers because the range of

9

the permitted secondary tasks will be limited (e.g., NHTSA 2012). Thus, drivers may not be

10

able to benefit from automation to a significant extent (cf. Naujoks, Purucker, and Neukum

11

2016).

12

The researchers underpinned the importance of additional research on public acceptance

13

and trust in automation, the interaction of the AVs with other vehicles and road users, and

14

the amount and type of information that the human drivers shall be receiving by the

15

automated system. Finally, they referred to the need for additional experiments to study

16

human driver behaviour while operating in automated mode and during transitions from

17

manual to automated mode and vice versa, and to validate findings from simulator

18

experiments with equivalent studies on public roads.

19

Besides areas of wide agreement, the twelve researchers expressed distinctive

20

statements on different aspect of AVs, including legislation, cost of AVs, and type approval

21

challenges. The role of human drivers in AVs was discussed, and it was suggested by several

22

of the researchers that unless AVs (permanently) take over all functions of the driving task,

23

drivers should remain in the loop. The issue of driving skill degradation due to automation

24

was raised, stating that training programs will have to be modified, teaching human drivers

25

about the automations capabilities and expected actions.

26

The issue of responsibility in the cases of accidents is a critical factor in AV deployment,

27

yielding a conflict between roadway capacity and roadway safety. Specifically, it was

28

stressed that when human drivers are expected to regain control of their vehicles, large

29

safety margins (i.e., separation between vehicles) will have to be adopted, while engineers

30

are developing platooning systems that operate with short inter vehicle headways.

31

Nevertheless, it was stated that AVs could be broadly deployed within the next 10 years with

32

an operational design domain confined to highways and similar roads, with the expectation

33

that human drivers will resume manual control when leaving the operational design domain.
19

1

It was stated that automation levels were formulated as a common language, but that in

2

reality the same AV (depending on its environment and access to reliable information) may

3

allow more than one level of automation. Finally, it was pointed out that there is a need for

4

testing procedures regarding sensing and control systems, in order to determine whether

5

AVs operate reliably in complex real world driving conditions. To this end, the Dutch Type

6

Approval Authority has introduced an amendment to the Exceptional Transport

7

(Exemptions) Decree to facilitate testing and development of autonomous vehicles on public

8

roads (RDW 2014).

9
10

Comparison of the interviewees statements with the current state of AVs deployment

11
12

In the interviews conducted in April and May 2015, the twelve researchers commented

13

extensively on HF related safety implications of Level 2 and 3 AVs, and some specifically

14

expressed that AVs should not be introduced on public roads unless proven safe. However,

15

reality shows that SAE Level 2 automation systems, and even systems that are close to SAE

16

Level 3 automation, have now been deployed. For example, in October 2015 Tesla

17

introduced an Autopilot feature that allows for minutes of hands free driving, whereas as of

18

October 2016, new cars are equipped with full self driving hardware (Tesla, 2016). These

19

observations illustrate that industry marches forward and that there is a disconnect

20

between academic research and industrial research and development. Furthermore, it

21

shows that even experts who work in the field of AVs may underestimate the pace of

22

development in some industries, regarding the introduction of AVs on the market.

23

The interviewees agreed that we are far from ready to deploy fully (SAE Level 5)

24

automated vehicles on public roads, with several researchers claiming that fully AVs may

25

never operate at acceptable levels (Shladover 2016). Instead, SAE Level 4 vehicles could be

26

introduced on specific routes, under certain conditions, and for distinct applications, such as

27

segregated areas, low speeds or high speeds on highways only, transport of goods, or public

28

transport. In agreement with the reviewers expectations, the projects CityMobil2 (2014b),

29

GATEway (2014c), and WEpods (2014e) are currently demonstrating the integration of

30

autonomous transport systems into complex real world urban environments. Such

31

integration, however, may pose questions concerning the interaction of vulnerable road

20

1

users with AVs (Lundgren et al. 2017; Nez Velasco et al. 2016; Rothenbcher et al. 2016;

2

Merat et al., submitted).

3
Concluding remarks

4
5
6

AVs have the potential to substantially reform road transportation by increasing safety

7

and traffic flow efficiency (SAE Levels 3 to 5), and ensuring mobility for all (SAE Level 5). It is

8

no longer a question of whether it will be possible to have AVs on public roads, but rather a

9

question of how, when, and under which conditions. This paper presents the perspective of

10

twelve researchers in the field of HFs and AVs.

11

Findings indicate that, currently, the main challenge for the deployment of AVs is the

12

expectation of the human driver to intervene, after a period of not controlling the steering

13

wheel and pedals. Thus, research should focus on (a) designing AVs that can inform their

14

occupants about the vehicles capabilities and operational status, as well as about upcoming

15

situations that the vehicles cannot solve. In addition, research should (b) concentrate on

16

defining the automation functionalities that the human drivers would accept and use, and

17

(c) determine the interaction between the human driver and automation during transitions

18

of control. Furthermore, research needs to (d) establish procedures to test, determine, and

19

ensure safety while changing from automated to manual mode, and (e) investigate the

20

interaction between AVs and human drivers, conventional cars, and other road users such as

21

cyclists and pedestrians. Finally, research should (f) explore the modification of the current

22

driver training programs so that drivers are instructed how to use automation in a safe and

23

acceptable manner. We expect that these findings can be instrumental for stakeholders

24

involved in the development of automated driving technology and instructive to other

25

parties.

26

For long term successful deployment of the AVs all the relevant stakeholders including

27

the automotive industry, research institutes, policy makers, and governmental bodies should

28

work together to facilitate a safe deployment of AVs, not only taking technology into

29

account but also the human factors and the end users perspective. As Cummings (2016)

30

stressed, the relevant policy makers and governmental bodies shall provide leadership to

31

overcome todays inadequate testing and evaluation programs of the robotic self driving

32

cars. Cummings suggested that the automated driving community could learn and follow
21

1

practices from other domains, such as aviation. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),

2

for example, has explicit certification processes for certifying aircraft software, and they

3

would never allow commercial aircrafts to execute automatic landings without verifiable

4

test evidence. Similarly, road transport governmental bodies worldwide may have to deny

5

certification to self driving cars, until the industry provides greater transparency and reveals

6

how they are conducting the testing of their cars. Such an action, may hinder short term

7

deployment and innovation, but could be essential for the long term deployment and

8

subsequently for the overall safety improvement on public roads.

9

It may be argued that our concerns and recommendations hardly differ from early HF

10

lessons learned from aviation and other automation domains (e.g., Bainbridge, 1983; Fitts,

11

1951; Parasuraman, 1987; Wickens et al., 1998). For example, an early report on HF for

12

future air traffic control stated: men, on the whole, are poor monitors. We suggest that

13

great caution be exercised in assuming that men can successfully monitor complex

14

automatic machines and take over if the machine breaks down (Fitts, 1951, p. 11, see also

15

De Winter and Dodou, 2014), a statement that closely mirrors the interviewees statements.

16

Why HF researchers seem to convey the same message for decades is a question that

17

deserves further consideration. Does it mean that HF is making little fundamental progress

18

while technology advances apace, or does it mean that HF scientists have a consistent yet

19

crucial role in warning and advising prior to the introduction of disruptive automation

20

technology?

Questions
The first set of questions relates to SAE levels 3 5 of automation (strengths, weaknesses,
threats)
(1) In automated vehicles where drivers are expected to respond appropriately to a request
to intervene, what would you consider as the main strengths and weaknesses (threats)?
(2) In automated vehicles where drivers are not expected to respond appropriately to a
request to intervene, what would you consider as the main strengths and weaknesses
(threats)?
(3) What are your safety expectations of automated driving? How do you vision public
acceptance concerning safety expectations of automation induced accidents?
(4) What are your expectations in law changes regarding automated vehicles? When do you
think that such changes will take place?
(5) How much would you expect that an automated vehicle would cost, on top of the price of
an average vehicle?
(6) If we assume that all legal issues about automated driving are resolved tomorrow, are we
ready to deploy automated vehicles? Which Level?
The second group of questions relates to all levels of automation (vision on automated driving
technology)
(1) When are you expecting highly automated driving vehicles to be deployed on public
roads?
(2) When are you expecting most of the cars to be driven fully automated on public roads?
(3) In which driving scenario are you expecting the first automated vehicles to be introduced
(e.g. highways, parking, maybe asking about passenger cars or trucks)
(4) When are you expecting highly (and fully) automated vehicles to be operating in cities?
(5) How do you vision the role of drivers in the future? Supervisor, driver, passenger?
(6) Do you think that the highly levels of automation are needed? Why not jumping directly
to FAD?
(7) What do you think on Google's decision to directly introduce FAD vehicles?
(8) The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic requires that every moving vehicle or
combination of vehicles shall have a driver and that every driver shall at all times, be
able to control his vehicle. The Convention is currently in the process of being amended
to allow a car to drive itself so long as the system can be overridden or switched off by the
driver. Do you think that this amendment is sufficient? Do we need the Vienna
Convention? Do you think that we could abolish it (after all the US or the UK have never
ratified it).
(9) AVs have the potential to reduce crashes and improve roadway efficiency significantly.
Yet, AVs will occasionally be crashing and being involved into accidents. Subsequently, a
number of ethical dilemmas arise, e.g. what decision a FAD will take when detecting an
imminent, unavoidable accident? How should such dilemmas be addressed? For instance,
should a HAD or FAD vehicle stop before hitting a cat, even if this could be dangerous for
its passengers?

(10) Do you consider the Human Factors research important for the development and
deployment of automated driving vehicles? Why do you consider it important? Why dont
you consider it important?
(11) What would you consider the most important Human Factors issues for the different
levels of automation? Why?
(12) How could HFs science contribute to overcome the legal barriers towards the deployment
of AVs?
(13) Towards the deployment of AVs, which are the most critical challenges, the technological
or the HFs? An example?
(14) In automated (non fully) vehicles should drivers be allowed not to supervise their vehicle
for more than a defined period of time? Could you define this period?
(15) How should a driver be informed about a failure in the system of an automated? Should
the car directly come to a stop?
(16) Today, simulation studies investigate the behaviour of drivers for the different levels of
automation. Do you think that results from those studies replicate the behaviour of
drivers on real life traffic conditions? How could we overcome this problem?
(17) How the HFs science should tackle the issues about driver's workload in CAD and HAD
modes? How to deal with high workload to boredom and complacency?
(18) How HFs scientist can define the sufficient time that a driver needs to safely take over
control at any situation? Do we need to precisely define this time before deploying AVs on
the public roads?
(19) Once fully automated vehicles are introduced would we need HFs scientists any longer?
Why? Why not?
(20) In fully automated vehicles would steering wheels be necessary? If yes, how do you vision
wheels design, e.g. round or F1 type wheels? Should the wheels be moving or staying
still? If not, what could replace the steering wheels?
(21) In highly automated vehicles what kind of secondary tasks could drivers be engaged in?
What kind of secondary tasks should not be allowed?
(22) In fully automated vehicles what kind of secondary tasks could drivers be engaged in?
What kind of secondary tasks should not be allowed?
(23) While driving in a fully automated vehicle could we be sleeping? Or being drunk? Or
should people under 18 or over 90 be allowed to drive them?
(24) Would you send your fully automated vehicle to pick your kid up from school?
(25) Should a fully automated vehicle have any marks to indicate its level of automation?
(26) Do we need complex dashboards in fully automated driving vehicles? Could a "Function" /
"Non function" indicator be just sufficient? Any other suggestions?
(27) How would you expect the status quo of the current car ownership to change in the short
/ medium / long term? Will people continue buying vehicles when fully automated
vehicles are deployed or will sharing?
(28) Do you think that people will ever be ready to completely relinquish the control over
their vehicles to a computer?
(29) What do you think of the current description of automated driving in the media?
