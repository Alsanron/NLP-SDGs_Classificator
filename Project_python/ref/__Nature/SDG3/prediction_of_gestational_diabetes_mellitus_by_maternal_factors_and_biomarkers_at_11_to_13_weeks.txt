Objective To develop a model for the prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) from maternal
characteristics and biochemical markers at 11 to 13 weeks gestation.
Methods A prospective screening study on early prediction of pregnancy complications (n = 11, 464),
including 297 (2.6%) cases of GDM was used to create the predictive model of GDM based on maternal
characteristics. Maternal serum concentrations of adiponectin, follistatin-like-3 (FSTL3) and sex hormonebinding globulin (SHBG) were measured in a case-control study of 80 women who developed GDM and 300
controls.
Results In the screening study, maternal age, body mass index, racial origin, previous history of GDM and
macrosomic neonate were significant independent predictors of future GDM. In the GDM group, compared to
controls, the median multiple of the normal median adiponectin (0.66; IQR: 0.50.9 vs 1.02; IQR: 0.71.29)
and SHBG (0.81; IQR: 0.61.04 vs 1.02; IQR: 0.81.2) was lower (p <0.05), but FSTL3 was not significantly
different. In screening for GDM by maternal characteristics, the detection rate was 61.6% at a false-positive
rate of 20% and the detection increased to 74.1% by the addition of adiponectin and SHBG.
Conclusion First-trimester screening for GDM can be provided by a combination of maternal characteristics
and biomarkers. Copyright  2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with
increased risk of maternal and perinatal short-term and
long-term complications (Casey et al., 1997; Crowther
et al., 2005; Clausen et al., 2008; Feig et al., 2008; Metzger et al., 2008; Bellamy et al., 2009). The frequency
of adverse pregnancy outcomes can be reduced by the
appropriate treatment of GDM (Crowther et al., 2005;
Horvath et al., 2010). However, there is no internationally accepted method of screening. In the UK, it is recommended that an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT),
which is the diagnostic test for GDM, should be offered
to women with any one of the following risk factors:
body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2 , previous history
of GDM or macrosomic baby (>4.5 kg), family history
of diabetes or racial origin with a high prevalence of
diabetes such as South Asian, African-Caribbean and
Middle Eastern (NICE, 2008). The performance of such
screening is poor with a detection rate of about 60% at
a false-positive rate of 30 to 40% (Scott et al., 2002;
Waugh et al., 2007).

Previous studies investigating the potential value of
first-trimester maternal biomarkers for early prediction
of GDM reported promising results for adiponectin,
follistatin-like-3 (FSTL3) and sex hormone-binding
globulin (SHBG) (Thadhani et al., 2003, 2010; Williams
et al., 2004; Worda et al., 2004; Spencer et al., 2005;
Smirnakis et al., 2007; Georgiou et al., 2008; Lain et al.,
2008; Paradisi et al., 2010).
The aims of this study are (1) to develop a model for
the prediction of GDM based on multivariate analysis of
factors from maternal history and characteristics; (2) to
investigate further the maternal serum concentrations
of adiponectin, FSTL3 and SHBG at 11 to 13 weeks
in pregnancies that subsequently develop GDM and
(3) to estimate the performance of early screening for
GDM by a combination of maternal factors and serum
biochemistry.

METHODS

Screening study population
The study population for the development of the model
for prediction of GDM based on factors from maternal
history and characteristics was derived from a prospective screening study on early prediction of pregnancy
complications. In women attending for their routine first
hospital visit in pregnancy at Kings College Hospital, London, at 11+0 to 13+6 weeks of gestation, we

record maternal characteristics and medical history and
perform an ultrasound scan to (1) confirm gestational
age from the measurement of the fetal crown-rump
length (CRL), (2) diagnose any major fetal abnormalities and (3) measure fetal nuchal translucency (NT)
thickness as part of screening for chromosomal abnormalities. In addition, the maternal serum pregnancyassociated plasma protein-A and free -human chorionic
gonadotrophin are determined and the results are combined with the fetal NT to calculate the patient-specific
risk for trisomy 21 (Snijders et al., 1998; Kagan et al.,
2008). Additional blood is obtained from the women
and samples of serum and plasma are stored at 80  C
for subsequent biochemical analysis. Written informed
consent was obtained from the women agreeing to participate in the study, which was approved by Kings
College Hospital Ethics Committee.
The inclusion criteria for this study on screening for
GDM were singleton pregnancy delivering a phenotypically normal neonate at or after 30 weeks of gestation.
We excluded pregnancies with pre-pregnancy diabetes
mellitus type 1 or 2, those ending in termination, miscarriage or delivery before 30 weeks because they may
not have had screening and diagnosis of GDM.

Maternal history and characteristics
Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire on
maternal age, racial origin (Caucasian, African, South
Asian, East Asian and mixed), cigarette smoking during
pregnancy (yes or no), method of conception (spontaneous or assisted conception requiring the use of ovulation drugs), medical history including pre-pregnancy
diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2, family history of diabetes
mellitus (first- or second-degree relative with diabetes
mellitus type 1 or 2) and obstetric history including outcome of each pregnancy. The questionnaire was then
reviewed by a doctor together with the patient and for the
purpose of this study women were classified as parous or
nulliparous with no previous pregnancies at or beyond
24 weeks and if parous we recorded whether any of the
previous pregnancies were complicated by GDM (yes or
no) or the delivery of a macrosomic neonate with birth
weight above the 90th centile for gestational age (yes or
no) (Poon et al., 2010). The maternal weight and height
were measured and the BMI was calculated in kg/m2 .

Screening and diagnosis of gestational
diabetes mellitus
Screening for GDM in our hospital is based on a
two-step approach. In all women a random plasma
glucose is measured at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation
and if the concentration is more than 6.7 mmol/L an
OGTT is carried out within the subsequent 2 weeks.
The diagnosis of GDM is made if the fasting plasma
glucose level is at least 6 mmol/L or the plasma glucose
level 2 h after the oral administration of 75 g glucose
is 7.8 mmol/L or more (WHO). In women with normal
random blood sugar an OGTT is performed if they have

persistent glucosuria, develop polyhydramnios or the
fetus becomes macrosomic. Women with the diagnosis
of GDM are given dietary and exercise advise and are
encouraged to test capillary blood glucose before and
1 h after each meal. If during a period of 1 to 2 weeks
the pre-meal or 1 h post-meal blood glucose level is
higher than 5.5 and 7 mmol/L, respectively, the women
are treated with insulin.
Details of maternal characteristics and the findings of
the 11 to 13 weeks assessment were recorded in our
database. Data on pregnancy outcome were obtained
from the maternity computerized records or the general
medical practitioners of the women and were also
recorded in our database.

Casecontrol study for biochemical
markers
The casecontrol study involved the measurement of
maternal serum concentration of adiponectin, FSTL3
and SHBG at 11 to 13 weeks gestation in singleton
pregnancies that subsequently developed GDM and nondiabetic controls. The cases and controls were drawn
from the screening study for pregnancy complications.
We searched our database to identify pregnancies that
developed GDM with available stored serum. We then
selected at random 80 cases of GDM and 300 controls
which were matched to the cases for storage time. In all
cases and controls, the pregnancies resulted in live birth
of phenotypically normal neonates.
None of the samples were previously thawed and
refrozen. Maternal serum adiponectin concentration
was measured by a quantitative sandwich enzymelinked immunoassay (ELISA) technique using Quantikine Human Total Adiponectin Immunoassay
(DRP300, R&D Systems Europe Ltd, Abingdon, UK).
The intra-assay CV varied from 2.5 to 4.7% and the
inter-assay CV varied from 6.8 to 6.9%. Maternal
serum SHBG was measured by DELFIA (DissociationEnhanced Lanthanide Fluorescent Immunoassay) technique using AutoDELFIA SHBG (product no. B070101)
kit. The intra-assay CV ranged from 3.3 to 4.9% and
inter-assay CV ranged from 2.3 to 3.0%. The FSTL3
assay was developed for the AutoDELFIA platform for
this study using antibodies and antigens from R&D Systems Inc. (MAB1288, AF1288 and 1288-F3; R&D Systems Europe Ltd). The intra-assay CV varied from 0.5 to
2.1% and the inter-assay CV varied from 3.4 to 12.6%.

Statistical analysis
Comparisons between the GDM and non-GDM groups
were by  2 test or Fishers exact test for categorical
variables and by MannWhitney U -test for continuous
variables. In the screened population logistic regression
analysis with backward stepwise elimination was used
to determine which of the factors among the maternal
characteristics and obstetric history had a significant
contribution in predicting GDM. The patient-specific a
priori risk for GDM was calculated from the following

DOI: 10.1002/pd

EARLY PREDICTION OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES

formula: odds/(1 + odds), where odds = eY and Y was
derived from the logistic regression analysis of maternal
characteristics and history.
In the casecontrol study we used the following steps.
First, the distributions of serum adiponectin, FSTL3 and
SHBG were made Gaussian after square root (sqrt) transformation. Second, in the unaffected controls multiple
regression analysis was used to determine which of the
factors among the maternal characteristics and gestation
were significant predictors of sqrt adiponectin, FSTL3
and SHBG. The measurements in each case and control
were then expressed as a multiple of the normal median
(MoM) derived from the regression analysis. Third,
MannWhitney U-test was used to compare median values of each serum analyte between the outcome groups.
Fourth, for the analytes found to be significantly different in cases of GDM, compared to the non-diabetic
controls, regression analysis was used to determine the
significance of association between the analytes in cases
and controls. Fifth, in the GDM group compared to the
non-diabetic controls the median adiponectin and SHBG
values were significantly reduced and there were no
significant associations between the values of the two
analytes in either the GDM or the control groups (see
Section on Results). Because we measured adiponectin
and SHBG only in the casecontrol study and not the
whole population, the means and standard deviations of
the Gaussian distributions of sqrt adiponectin and SHBG
in the GDM and control groups were used to simulate
the values for these markers in the screened population of 11,464 pregnancies. Sixth, likelihood ratios for
GDM were calculated from the fitted bivariate Gaussian distributions for each analyte. In each patient in the
screened population the a priori odds based on maternal
history and characteristics were multiplied by the likelihood ratio for sqrt adiponectin and SHBG to derive their
a posteriori odds. The a posteriori risks were used to
calculate the detection rates of GDM and false-positive
rates and the performance of screening was determined
by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis. The performance of different methods of screening was compared by the areas under the ROC curves
(AUROC) (Zweig and Campbell, 1993).
The statistical software package SPSS 16.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for data analyses.

RESULTS

Screening study
We prospectively examined 12,283 singleton pregnancies between March 2006 and August 2009. We
excluded 819 (6.7%) because they had pre-pregnancy
diabetes mellitus, the pregnancies ended in termination, miscarriage or delivery before 30 weeks, there was
no pregnancy outcome or they resulted in the birth of
neonates with major defects. In the 11,464 included
cases there were 297 (2.6%) that developed GDM and
11,167 that were unaffected by diabetes. The maternal and pregnancy characteristics of the GDM and

non-diabetic pregnancies are compared in Table 1. In the
GDM group women were older, they had a higher BMI,
a higher proportion was of African and South Asian
racial origin, had a first-degree relative with diabetes,
developed GDM or delivered a macrosomic neonate in
a previous pregnancy.
Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that in the
prediction of GDM there were significant contributions
from maternal age, BMI, racial origin, previous history
of GDM and delivery of macrosomic neonates (Table 2).
In the screened population there were 107 with a
history of GDM in a previous pregnancy and 63 (58.8%)
of these developed GDM in the current pregnancy. In
order to investigate the effect of maternal characteristics
in the group without previous GDM, we performed a
separate logistic regression analysis (Table 2).

Casecontrol study
The maternal and pregnancy characteristics of the GDM
and non-diabetic controls are compared in Table 3. In the
GDM group women were older, they had a higher BMI,
a higher proportion was of South Asian racial origin,
had a first-degree relative with diabetes, developed
GDM or delivered a macrosomic neonate in a previous
pregnancy.
In the non-diabetic controls multiple regression analysis demonstrated that serum adiponectin, FSTL3 and
SHBG were affected by significant contributions from
maternal characteristics:
Sqrt adiponectin expected = 130.19 + 0.74  maternal age in years + (18.24 if the racial origin was
African, 31.89 if South Asian, 0 if Caucasian, East
Asian or Mixed)  0.53  maternal weight in kg 
10.38 if cigarette smoker; R 2 = 0.223, p < 0.0001.
Sqrt SHBG expected = 14.85  0.04  maternal
weight in kg + 0.08  CRL in mm; R 2 = 0.060,
p < 0.0001.
Sqrt FSTL3 expected = 3.50  0.01  maternal
weight in kg  0.16 if African racial origin; R 2 = 0.068,
p < 0.0001.
In the pregnancies that subsequently developed GDM,
compared to the non-diabetic controls, the median
adiponectin MoM and SHBG MoM were lower but
the median FSTL3 MoM was not significantly different
(Table 4). In the group of GDM there were no significant differences between those with and without a
previous history of GDM in adiponectin (p = 0.470),
FSTL3 (p = 0.962) or SHBG (p = 0.156).
In both the GDM and non-diabetic groups, there
was no significant association between sqrt adiponectin
MoM and sqrt SHBG MoM (p = 0.054 and 0.133,
respectively).

Estimated performance of early screening
for gestational diabetes mellitus
In the simulated screened population, the a posteriori
odds for GDM were derived by multiplying the a priori
odds by the likelihood ratio of adiponectin and SHBG.

had a previous history of GDM. The estimated detection
of GDM by maternal factors in the women with no

carried out only in those with no previous history of
GDM, the estimated detection rate of GDM would be
74.1% (220 of 297, including all 63 from first-stage
screening and 66.2% of the 234 or 157 from secondstage screening) at a false-positive rate of 20.4%.
DISCUSSION
The findings of this study on early screening for
GDM demonstrate that (1) well-recognized maternal
risk factors can be combined into a model in which each
factor is attributed its appropriate weight and (2) the
performance of screening is improved by combining
maternal characteristics with biochemical testing.
The study confirms that risk factors for the development of GDM include increased maternal age and
BMI, African and South Asian racial origin, family history of diabetes and previous pregnancies complicated
by GDM and delivery of macrosomic neonates (Waugh
et al., 2007). The performance of screening by a regression model based on maternal factors, with an estimated
detection rate of about 60% for a false-positive rate of
20%, is superior to that achieved by using each maternal
factor as an independent screening test (NICE, 2008).
Our results are similar to those reported in a recent
study which also used regression analysis to develop
a prediction model and reported that the AUROC was
0.77 (Van Leeuwen et al., 2010). Ultimately, such models will require prospective validation studies.

have been reported prior to the development and in overt
GDM and type 2 diabetes (Bartha et al., 2000; Weyer
et al., 2001; Thadhani et al., 2003; Tsai et al., 2004;
Williams et al., 2004; Worda et al., 2004; Retnakaran
et al., 2005, 2007; Mazaki-Tovi et al., 2009; Paradisi
et al., 2010).
Our finding that in the GDM group maternal serum
adiponectin and SHBG levels at 11 to 13 weeks
were reduced by about 30 and 20%, respectively, are
consistent with the results of previous smaller studies

(Thadhani et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2004; Spencer
et al., 2005; Smirnakis et al., 2007; Georgiou et al.,
2008; Lain et al., 2008; Paradisi et al., 2010). In our
GDM group serum FSTL3, which may be involved
in up-regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis (Mukherjee et al., 2007), was not significantly different than in
the non-diabetic controls. In contrast, a recent study of
37 cases and 127 controls at 11 to 13 weeks reported
that in the GDM group the levels were reduced by 65%
(Thadhani et al., 2010).
This study has shown that screening for GDM can be
provided by a combination of maternal characteristics
and maternal serum adiponectin and SHBG at 11 to
13 weeks. Because the risk of recurrence of GDM, both
in this and in previous studies is very high (Kim et al.,
2007), any screening policy would automatically classify
such women as screen positive with a marginal increase
in the false-positive rate. In nulliparous women and in
those without a previous history of GDM screening by a
combination of maternal factors and serum adiponectin
and SHBG could identify about 65% of pregnancies
that subsequently develop GDM, at a false-positive rate
of 20%. Such two-stage screening policy could identify
about 75% of affected pregnancies at 11 to 13 weeks
gestation.
The extent to which the performance of early screening for GDM can be improved further by additional
biomarkers is currently under investigation. Similarly,
the extent to which early identification of the high-risk
group and early diagnosis of the condition by adjusting
the traditional criteria of the OGTT (Plasencia et al.,
2011) can lead to a reduction in the maternal and perinatal complications associated with GDM remains to be
determined.
