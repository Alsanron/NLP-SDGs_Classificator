STUDY OBJECTIVE To identify subgroups of premature infants who may benefit from palivizumab prophylaxis during nosocomial outbreaks of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.
DESIGN Retrospective analysis using an artificial intelligence model.
SETTING Level IIIB, 35-bed, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at a tertiary care hospital in the United Arab Emirates.
PATIENTS One hundred seventy six premature infants, born at a gestational age of 2234 weeks, and
hospitalized during four RSV outbreaks that occurred between April 2005 and July 2007.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We collected demographic and clinical data for each patient by using a
standardized form. Input data consisted of seven categoric and continuous variables each. We trained,
tested, and validated artificial neural networks for three outcomes of interest: mortality, days of supplemental oxygen, and length of NICU stay after the index case was identified. We compared variable
impacts and performed reassignments with live predictions to evaluate the effect of palivizumab. Of
the 176 infants, 31 (17.6%) received palivizumab during the outbreaks. All neural network configurations converged within 4 seconds in less than 400 training cycles. Infants who received palivizumab
required supplemental oxygen for a shorter duration compared with controls (105.2  7.2 days vs
113.2  10.4 days, p=0.003). This benefit was statistically significant in male infants whose birth
weight was less than 0.7 kg and who had hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. Length
of NICU stay after identification of the index case and mortality were independent of palivizumab use.
CONCLUSION Palivizumab may be an effective intervention during nosocomial outbreaks of RSV in a
subgroup of extremely low-birth-weight male infants with hemodynamically significant congenital
heart disease.

outpatient pediatric populations.1 The American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends
monthly prophylactic palivizumab injections during RSV season in premature infants and children
with chronic lung or congenital heart diseases
who meet certain criteria.2 Data published by the
National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS)3, 4 demonstrates a biannual variation in virulence and different activity
patterns of RSV between and within different
regions of the United States. Our climate in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) resembles that of
Florida in the NREVSS. Despite the lack of
reported UAE-specific RSV activity databases, epidemiologic data from neighboring countries
indicate that RSV is common from October
through May.5 Several reports have demonstrated
differences in RSV activity (i.e., virulence, onset,
and
duration)
during
nosocomial
RSV
outbreaks.611 In those studies, although palivizumab combined with infection control measures was successful in arresting outbreaks in the
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), there was
little evidence to support its routine use in all
patients in this setting.
Artificial neural networks (ANN) were
employed to predict mortality risk on admission
to a NICU in a previous report.12 This software
analyzes the relationships between clinical variables of interest from real cases by using simple
user interfaces. Based on this analysis, one can
develop models that will predict, with reasonable accuracy, outcomes such as mortality risk
associated with specific clinical decisions. The
ANN configurations can be broadly classified
based on the outcome variable into two main
types. Probabilistic networks (Figure 1), used
for categoric outcomes, are partially connected
and generate probabilities that reflect a level of
confidence that the network has in each prediction it makes. For instance, the network may be
96% confident in predicting mortality. On the
other hand, generalized regression networks
(Figure 2), used for continuous outcomes, make
predictions that can be plotted against actual
outcomes. Ideal networks will, therefore, yield
an identity curve for the entire dataset. The first
hidden layer in both designs (one neuron/training case) ensures accurate performance. The second hidden layer reduces dimensionality to
drive ANN toward fast convergence (i.e., an
optimal solution that can be reliably used to predict outcomes).

may guide clinicians to select the high-risk
group of NICU patients who may benefit from
receiving palivizumab prophylaxis in an inpatient setting. Moreover, neural network models
may help health care teams predict the effects of
palivizumab on important outcomes such as
days of supplemental oxygen (DOSO) and length
of NICU stay after the index case was identified
(LOSA). In this study, we report the findings
from three ANN trained to predict outcomes
regarding the use of palivizumab during four
RSV outbreaks in a NICU. Our primary objective was to identify subgroups, if any, who may
benefit from palivizumab in this setting.

Methods
Study Design, Setting, and Patient Population
We retrospectively collected and analyzed data
of patients born at a gestational age of
2234 weeks during four outbreaks of RSV in a
35-bed, level IIIB NICU at a tertiary care hospital in the United Arab Emirates. These four outbreaks occurred over a period of about 2 years
and 4 months (April 2005July 2007). Total
annual admissions to the NICU are approximately 500 neonates, with about 10% transferred
from other hospitals.
We used a standardized data collection sheet
and definitions (Table 1). In addition to the
information summarized in Table 1, we gathered

dates of birth, admission to the NICU, RSV tests,
and death. Infection control personnel and
microbiology staff flagged RSV-positive cases,
whereas pharmacists and neonatologists collected the data. We conducted this research in
accordance with the local institutional regulations and policies.
Definitions
For the purposes of this study, we will use the
term pattern to mean an individual patient case
with its distinct clinical input variables. Outbreak
was defined as more than one confirmed RSV
infection by antigen testing for a duration of time
from identification of first RSV antigenpositive
case until the last test case was negative for two
consecutive weeks. The four outbreaks that were
investigated occurred from AprilJune 2005,
December 2005January 2006, JanuaryMarch
2007, and AprilJuly 2007. Chronic lung disease
was defined as the need for supplemental oxygen
at 36 weeks postconception or at discharge,
whichever came first, in babies who were born
less than 32 weeks gestation or as who needed
supplemental oxygen at discharge or age 28 days,
whichever came first, in babies who were born at
32 weeks gestation or after. Hemodynamically
significant congenital heart disease (HSCHD)
included both cyanotic and noncyanotic heart
defects that compromise neonatal circulation. An
example of HSCHD is moderate or severe patent
ductus arteriosus. Patients age was defined as the
number of days from birth to the first day in the
NICU during the RSV outbreak. Patients in the
palivizumab treatment Group (Table 1)
received the drug at the beginning of or during
the outbreak while still RSV negative. Patients
designated as yes for the variable Palivizumab
prophylaxis (Table 1) received palivizumab
within 1 month before or during the outbreak
while RSV negative.
Artificial Neural Network Models
We constructed our ANN model by using
Microsoft Excel add-in (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA), NeuralTools, version 1.0.1 (Palisade
Corp., Ithaca, NY). Input nodes consisted of seven
categoric and continuous features each (Table 1).
We replaced missing input values (< 1%) with
medians and the most common classes for continuous and categoric variables, respectively. The
ANN model incorporated three outcomes: mortality, DOSO, and LOSA. We excluded patterns with

4

missing outcomes from training or testing.
We used probabilistic networks for mortality
(Figure 1) and generalized regression networks
for DOSO and LOSA (Figure 2).
We expected, a priori, that three groups of
patterns would need to be excluded from the
training of the DOSO and LOSA ANN. First, patterns where infants died underestimate DOSO
and LOSA. Second, patients who were extubated
to room air on the first day of life give little
information for the training and validation of
the DOSO ANN. Third, patients whose length of
stay before an outbreak starts (LOSB) that is
more than 3 weeks may add noise to LOSA
ANN. We used each pattern once for each outbreak in all trained ANN. We selected 57 patterns for external validation of ANN while
NeuralTools version 1.0.1 automatically used
80% of the remaining cases for training and 20%
for internal validation to prevent overtraining.
We enabled all possible stop conditions: 2 hours
of training, 1,000,000 trials, and error change of
less than 0.01% within 60 minutes. NeuralTools
version 1.0.1 generated variable impact (VI) for
each input used in the training and validation of
a given ANN. VI is a percentage that represents
overall contribution of a given variable to the
predicted outcome in the model. Furthermore,
we reassigned inputs to study the effect of these
modified values on outcomes by live predictions.
Therefore, we were able to completely describe
the ANN and role of palivizumab in our model.
Individualization of Palivizumab during an RSV
Outbreak in the NICU
We present seven cases to briefly demonstrate
how our established ANN model may assist clinicians in making decisions on palivizumab
administration in individual patients in this setting. We randomly selected these cases as follows. First, we sorted our data for the variables
group and outbreak with interest in the categories P and 4 (Table 1), respectively. Next,
we generated random numbers for patients in
each row, excluding missing DOSO and LOSA
cases. Finally, we sorted the patterns for the random numbers and selected patterns at predetermined locations.
Statistical Analysis
We studied multivariates for a given outcome
in one of two ways: reassignment of inputs and
subgroup analyses. We used all univariate statis-

tical tests. We used v2 or Fisher exact tests, as
indicated, to evaluate statistical significance in
case of unpaired categoric data. We opted to use
McNemars test for paired categoric data. We
used unpaired and paired, 2-tailed, Student
t tests as indicated to evaluate significance for
continuous variables. Nonparametric tests were
employed when normality assumptions failed. A
p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical tests were performed by using SPSS, version 15.0.1, for
Windows (IBM, Somers, NY).
Results
Model Description
We had a total of 176 cases: 135 were assigned
to training, 34 to testing, and 7 were used for validation in the mortality network. Twenty patients
(11.4%) died and therefore they were excluded
from both DOSO and LOSA networks. Forty-six
patients had DOSO of less than 1 day. As
expected, adding these patterns to the DOSO
ANN did not significantly change predictions,
and therefore, they were excluded from the final
DOSO network. The DOSO value was missing for
one patient. Furthermore, 28 patients had LOSB
more than 3 weeks. Adding these cases to the
LOSA ANN did not change the results of the
study, but it did worsen the performance of the
LOSA network. As a result, these patterns were
not used in the final LOSA network. We had 35
missing values in the LOSA for outbreak category
3. In this case, we replaced the variable outbreak with a dichotomous variable outbreak
LOSA with 1 for AprilJuly 2007 and 0 for all
other classes (Table 1). We summarize training,
testing, and validation sets for each outcome
(Figure 3). All networks converged within 400
trials and in less than 4 seconds.
Mortality
Among seven new cases that we assigned for
external validation, 4 died and 3 survived. The
ANN model predicted 50% of deaths and all survivals successfully. Overall, it performed well,
with a sensitivity of approximately 82% and a
specificity of 100%. All tested ANN had consistent performance and made similar predictions
for new cases with associated probabilities of
higher than 98%. Figure 4 presents VI associated
with each input node in this model. We noted
that patients who received palivizumab for

prophylaxis, in accordance with AAP recommendations, before the outbreak were more likely to
survive compared with those who received palivizumab only after the index case was identified
(VI 3.2% and < 0.0001%, respectively). Palivizumab, given during the outbreak, was equivalent to control (ANN predicted the same 18
deaths in both groups after reassignments). Prophylactic palivizumab in the model resulted in
three more survivals but was not statistically significant (15 vs 18 patients, p=0.25). These findings
were true in all outbreaks analyzed in this study.

Among 110 patients in this analysis, 19 (17.3%)
would require less DOSO (range 17 to 0 days) if
they received palivizumab after an outbreak
started. In contrast, if palivizumab was used prophylactically before an outbreak starts, 55
patients (50%) would require less DOSO (range
64 to 0 days, p<0.001). After an outbreak starts,
a greater percentage of patients who benefit from
palivizumab had chronic lung disease (31.6% vs
13.2%, p=0.081) and HSCHD (36.8% vs 15.4%, p
value = 0.049). On the other hand, patients who
received palivizumab before the start of an outbreak will have similar distribution of chronic
lung disease (5.5% vs 20%, p=0.44) and HSCHD
(16.4% vs 21.8%, p=0.63) in the DOSO subgroups
(i.e., those who benefit and those who do not).
All other variables were distributed comparably in
both scenarios. On further analysis, on average
and after reassignment, newly admitted extremely
low-birth-weight (< 0.7 kg) male infants with
HSCHD who received palivizumab were extubated to room air a week earlier (105.2  7.2 days
vs 113.2  10.4 days, p=0.003).

greater impact on LOSA than the outbreak itself
(VI 0.36% vs 0.08%). However, the role of palivizumab was less important once an outbreak
starts (VI 3.1% vs 0.36%). Among 128 patients in
this analysis, 62 (48.4%) had shorter LOSA
(range 1.5 to 0 days) if they received palivizumab after an outbreak started. In contrast, if
palivizumab was given prophylactically before an
outbreak starts, 79 patients (61.7%) would have
a shorter hospitalization (range 4.7 to 0 days,
p<0.001). Patients who benefit from prophylactic
palivizumab are more likely to have chronic lung
disease (16.3% vs 2.5%, p=0.004) and, although
nonsignificant, HSCHD (16.3% vs 6.3%, p=0.06).
However, after reassignments for the variable
group (Table 1), we failed to identify any subgroups with statistically significant reductions in
LOSA after palivizumab.
Individualization of Palivizumab during an RSV
Outbreak in the NICU
Table 2 summarizes information about seven
patients who were randomly selected from our
dataset. Patient 4 witnessed the third and fourth
outbreaks, and thus both patterns are presented

as patients 4 (3) and 4 (4). Based on mortality
ANN predictions, we can exclude patient 7 from
the list of candidates for palivizumab. Patients 4
(3) and 6 seem to benefit from palivizumab,
with reductions in DOSO of 17 and 10 days,
respectively. Patient 6 was discharged 1 day earlier based on the LOSA ANN as a result of
receiving palivizumab.
Discussion
The cost of palivizumab use during RSV season is a major concern that shapes health care
system performance around the peak of RSV season in winter. A number of previous studies
have tried to identify the optimal and cost-effective criteria for selection of candidates for palivizumab.1317 However, during nosocomial RSV
outbreak, economic considerations for clinical
pharmacists and neonatologists who wish to
help their patients may become more difficult to
evaluate.18 This study presents the first quasiexperimental research applying ANN to predict
effect of palivizumab on mortality, DOSO, and
LOSA during an RSV outbreak in the NICU.
Therefore, we believe that our findings have

significant clinical and economic implications in
this setting.
We observed that our ANN models consistently converged to optimal solutions that favor
prophylactic use of palivizumab before the start
of an RSV outbreak. Our current understanding
of palivizumabs mechanism of action supports
this finding.19 Palivizumab binds to an epitope
in the A antigenic site of the F protein on the
surface of RSV. As a result, it neutralizes RSV,
halts its replication, and prevents it from infecting human cells. However, an infected patient is
expected to have already produced a large number of viral copies that make neutralization of all
particles difficult to achieve. Consistent with
this, other investigations have confirmed that
palivizumab offers limited, if any, benefit in halting progression from upper to lower respiratory
tract infection with RSV.20
We also noted that use of palivizumab during
an outbreak has consistently greater impact on
DOSO and LOSA than the variable outbreak.
Previous reports about palivizumab use in nosocomial outbreaks fail to study this proposition.611
Our observation is important for two main reasons. First, we may expect that regardless of the
severity of an RSV outbreak, a group of patients
who are at high risk for RSV infections may benefit from palivizumab use. Second, our database
combines cases from four different outbreaks at
different times over a period of 2 years and
4 months. Consequently, palivizumab use in this
setting may be independent of the biannual variation in RSV severity in the community or even
the geographic location of the NICU. However,
we need more evaluations before we can reach
definitive conclusions.
We agree that closing the NICU during RSV
outbreaks, heightened attention to infection control measures, and prophylactic palivizumab all
may have a role in the control of RSV outbreaks
in the NICU.8, 21 In our NICU, we implement
all infection control measures according to international standards. Strict hand washing for
2 minutes with antiseptic soap is mandatory for
all health care providers and visitors. In addition, we apply hand washing or hand sanitizer
before and after each patient contact. However,
closing the NICU and compliance with effective
infection control measures may prove to be a
difficult undertaking in many busy nurseries.22
Moreover, it is quite impossible to measure and
compare infection control variables during different RSV outbreaks in the NICU and for individual patients. In our model, we had four

7

outbreaks that may have been associated with
RSV strains of different virulence as well as different overall compliance with infection control
measures. Nevertheless, despite inclusion of outbreak categories as a variable, the ANN converged to optimal solutions that consistently
generated greater variable impacts for palivizumab use before and during outbreaks than
those generated for this variable. Therefore, the
value of using palivizumab in this setting may
prove to be more important than we think.
Use of palivizumab before or during an outbreak in the NICU does not improve survival in
our model, which is consistent with results from
the Impact RSV study.1 On the other hand, palivizumab was associated with a reduction in mortality from RSV in another hospitalized
population.23 In our model, the mortality ANN
had no false-positives in identifying deaths.
Future research may use artificial intelligence
models to predict patients at high mortality risk
to exclude them from the list of candidates for
palivizumab during RSV outbreaks. Moreover,
these models may be tested and validated on larger sets of data to develop simple algorithms
that can easily assist clinicians in deferring palivizumab in more patients. Therefore, we suggest
that future research in the NICU outbreak setting should probably retain mortality as an outcome of interest.
Male premature infants are at high risk for
increased supplemental oxygen, ventilation, and
chronic lung disease.24 Previous studies have
also shown that in patients with HSCHD, there
was an association between palivizumab use during RSV season and reduced DOSO.25, 26 For
example, a 73% reduction in total RSV hospital
days with increased supplemental oxygen/100
children (p=0.014) due to palivizumab prophylaxis in these patients.26 In our study, the risk of
more DOSO in extremely low-birth-weight male
infants was proportional to the benefit we may
expect from use of palivizumab. Patient 6, who
was already at extremely high riskmale with a
birth weight of 585 gwould have less improvement in DOSO with palivizumab if he had
HSCHD ( 10 days vs 37 days). On the other
hand, patient 4 (3)male with a birth weight of
685 gwould have double improvement in
DOSO with palivizumab if he had HSCHD
(34 days vs 17 days). Although individual
patients may also have reduced LOSA, we were
not able to find a statistically significant
improvement in LOSA after palivizumab in this
setting.

According to the AAP recommendations, graduates from NICU who qualify for RSV prophylaxis during the season may receive the first
dose within 4872 hours before discharge.2
There are no evidence-based recommendations
with regard to the use of palivizumab in the
NICU during RSV outbreaks. If we use the same
AAP criteria used during the season, all eight
patterns (patients) reviewed in our testing scenarios for ANN would be great candidates for
prophylaxis with palivizumab in this setting.
However, based on our findings, we support
using more stringent criteria for palivizumab
during nosocomial RSV outbreak in the NICU.
First, we should exclude cases with high mortality risk from the list of candidates. Then, we
believe that our study identifies extremely
low-birth-weight male infants with or without
HSCHD as the group most likely to benefit from
palivizumab. Finally, other babies may be
offered prophylactic palivizumab based on estimated benefit from prediction models balanced
against the risk of losing cost-effectiveness.
Our ANN model combined with competent
clinical judgment should assist clinicians in
making individualized decisions. It is interesting
to note that patients 6, 4, 7, and 1 all tested
RSV antigen positive. The remaining three
(patients 2, 3, and 5) were all RSV antigen negative. Therefore, in this model, the decision to
use palivizumab during a nosocomial RSV outbreak will be based on more than the mere
probability of a baby converting to RSV positive.
Patient 4 is especially interesting because this
patient witnessed the third and forth outbreaks.
In our model, he would have benefited from palivizumab only in the third outbreak. Other than
palivizumab use, LOSB, outbreak, and age were
the input variables that changed for this patient
in the two outbreaks in this model. We recommend that future ANN models elaborate more
on LOSB as a predictor of DOSO. Inclusion of
other factors such as current weight may be warranted. Eventually, our findings may be further
refined to defer more patients from palivizumab
candidacy.
Lastly, our study has two important limitations. First, one may argue that the timing and
number of doses for palivizumab could have
improved performance. However, it was quite
impractical to attempt an evaluation of this
chronology in reality. One reason is that it is
almost impossible to know with certainty when
infection with RSV occurs and when viral shedding stops. Second, generalizability of this model

requires more external validation. However, the
consistency of ANN in converging to solutions
that favor the use of palivizumab in newly
admitted extremely low-birth-weight males with
or without HSCHD makes us doubt that future
validations will contradict these results.
Conclusion
Based on our study findings, we advocate a
revision of current AAP recommendation for the
use of palivizumab prophylaxis during RSV
outbreaks in the NICU. Premature, extremely
low-birth-weight male infants (< 0.7 kg) newly
admitted to NICU, with or without HSCHD, are
candidates for palivizumab. Palivizumab may
prove to be a cost-effective intervention in this
subgroup.
