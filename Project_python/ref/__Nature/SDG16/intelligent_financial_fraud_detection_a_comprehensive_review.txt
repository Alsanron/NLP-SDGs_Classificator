Review

Abstract. Financial fraud is an issue with far reaching consequences in the finance industry, government, corporate sectors, and for ordinary consumers. Increasing dependence on new technologies such as cloud and mobile computing
in recent years has compounded the problem. Traditional methods involving
manual detection are not only time consuming, expensive and inaccurate, but in
the age of big data they are also impractical. Not surprisingly, financial institutions have turned to automated processes using statistical and computational
methods. This paper presents a comprehensive review of financial fraud detection research using such data mining methods, with a particular focus on computational intelligence (CI)-based techniques. Over fifty scientific literature,
primarily spanning the period 2004-2014, were analysed in this study; literature
that reported empirical studies focusing specifically on CI-based financial fraud
detection were considered in particular. Research gap was identified as none of
the existing review articles addresses the association among fraud types, CIbased detection algorithms and their performance, as reported in the literature.
We have presented a comprehensive classification as well as analysis of existing fraud detection literature based on key aspects such as detection algorithm
used, fraud type investigated, and performance of the detection methods for
specific financial fraud types. Some of the key issues and challenges associated
with the current practices and potential future direction of research have also
been identified.

Introduction

Financial fraud is an issue that has wide reaching consequences in both the finance
industry and daily life. Fraud can reduce confidence in industry, destabilise economies, and affect people's cost of living. Traditional approaches relied on manual
techniques such as auditing, which are inefficient and unreliable due to the difficulty
of the problem. Data mining-based approaches have been shown to be useful because
of their ability to identify small anomalies in large data sets [32]. There are many

Page 3 of 38

different types of fraud, as well as a variety of data mining methods, and research is
continually being undertaken to find the best approach for each case.
Financial fraud is a broad term with various potential meanings, but for our purposes it can be defined as the intentional use of illegal methods or practices for the
purpose of obtaining financial gain [59]. Fraud has a large negative impact on business and society: credit card fraud alone accounts for billions of dollars of lost revenue each year [7], and some figures suggest that the total yearly cost to the U.S. could
be in excess of $400 billion [28], while a third study shows that UK insurers are out
1.6 billion pounds a year due to fraudulent claims [32]. Financial fraud also has
broader ramifications on the industry, such as providing funding for illicit activities
like drug trafficking and organised crime [7]. For credit card fraud the cost is typically worn by the merchants, who end up paying shipping, chargeback, and administrative costs as well as losing consumer confidence after being victim to a fraudulent
transaction [37], [41]. In this way we can see the widespread consequences that
fraud can have and the importance in minimising it.
Advancements in modern technologies such as the internet and mobile computing
have led to an increase in financial fraud in recent years [54]. Social factors such as
the increased distribution of credit cards has increased spending but also resulted in an
increase to fraud [41]. Fraudsters are continually refining their methods, and as such
there is a requirement for detection methods to be able to evolve accordingly [7].
Data mining has already been shown to be useful in similar domains such as credit
card approval, bankruptcy prediction, and analysis of share markets [35]. Fraud detection is a considered to be a similar classification problem but with a vast imbalance
in fraudulent to legitimate transactions, and a sizable difference in cost for misclassifying them [16]. Data mining approaches are also applicable to fraud detection for
their efficiency at processing large datasets and their ability to work without requiring
knowledge of the input variables [38].
A useful framework for applying data mining to fraud detection is to use it as a
method for classifying suspicious transactions or samples for further consideration.
Studies show that reviewing 2% of credit card transactions could reduce fraud losses
to 1% of the total cost of all purchases, with more assessments resulting in smaller
loss but with an increase in auditing costs [37]. A multi-layer pipeline approach can
be used with each step applying a more rigorous method to detect fraud. Data mining
can be utilised to efficiently filter out more obvious fraud cases in the initial levels
and leave the more subtle ones to be reviewed manually [37].
In this article we will use a few broad terminologies that are defined here for clarity. Data mining refers to any method that processes large quantities of data to derive
an underlying meaning. Within this classification we will consider two categories of
data mining: statistical and computational. We define the statistical techniques as
those that are based on traditional mathematical methods, such as logistic regression
and Bayesian theory. Computational methods are those which use modern intelligence techniques, such as neural networks and support vector machines. Though
these categories share many similarities, we will consider that the main difference
between them is that computational methods are capable of learning from and adapt-

Page 4 of 38

ing to the problem domain, while statistical methods are more rigid. Both types of
data mining will be researched in this article.
The objective of this paper is to provide a review of existing literature in financial
fraud detection and compare their findings (focusing primarily on literature published
during 2004-2014 and research that reports empirical studies using CI-based techniques). A key focus of this review is on the reported performance of CI techniques
for specific fraud types. None of the existing reviews (for example, [32], [62] and
[63]) covers this aspect. This will provide an indication to future researchers on the
areas that are currently available for future study. The remainder of the article is structured as follows. In the next section we will detail the history of intelligent fraud
detection research. Section 3 will list the different types of financial fraud. Section 4
presents an overview of the assorted detection methods used. Section 5 details the
specific efforts of previous researchers in detecting financial fraud. Section 6 offers
an insight into what is missing from existing techniques and proposes areas for future
research. Section 7 provides a conclusion to our research and a discussion of our
findings.

Related Work

Prior investigation has already been performed on some aspects of intelligent financial fraud detection, and a brief history of the specific research methods undertaken is
given here. Figure 1 shows the timeline of research for the last decade.
Initial fraud detection studies focussed heavily on statistical models such as logistic
regression, as well as neural networks [37], [55], [24]. Zhang et al. discovered that
neural networks had been used for financial applications such as forecasting since
1988 [58]. In 1995 Sohl and Venkatachalam first predicted financial statement fraud
using a back-propagation neural network [42]. Fraser et al. compared techniques
across a quantitative spectrum including statistical and computational methods such
as regression and neural networks [19]. In 1998 Fanning and Cogger used a neural
network based on other financial ratios and variables and found it compared favourably to discriminant analysis and logistic regression [17]. In 2001 and 2002 Bolton
and Hand performed some general analysis on fraud detection, focussing specifically
on statistical learning [8], [9], and Rezaee investigated financial statement fraud in
depth [39]. Table 1 shows the bias towards neural networks and statistical methods
with a list of further fraud detection research performed outside of the last decade.

Recent fraud detection research has been far more varied in methods studied, although the former techniques are still popular. In 2004 Kou et al. reviewed the study

Page 5 of 38

of general fraud detection using analytic techniques including neural networks [30].
Vatsa et al. investigated a novel approach using game theory in 2005, which modelled
fraudsters and detection methods as opposing players in a game, each striving to obtain the greatest financial advantage [48]. The following year Yang and Hwang studied health care fraud using a process-mining approach [53].
In 2007 Pinquet et al. and Viaene et al. both studied logistic regression with insurance fraud, concentrating on a database of Spanish automobile insurance claims [36],
[49]. Kirkos et al. compared statistical methods with neural networks to identify
fraudulent Greek manufacturing companies [28], and Bose and Wang focussed on
classification and regression trees to solve financial statement fraud in a selection of
Chinese companies [10].
Also in 2007 Hoogs et al. introduced a genetic algorithm on Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases to detect fraudulent companies in the US [24], and Yue et
al. performed a review of existing fraud detection literature. They claimed that the
only successful methods of fraud detection to date, as well as the most commonly
researched, were classification based [55].
Bai et al. used decision trees to study financial statement fraud for a selection of
Chinese companies in 2008 [3]. Bermdez et al. took a statistical approach to insurance fraud detection, using the same samples that Pinquet et al. and Viaene et al. used
previously [6]. Quah and Sriganesh looked at visualising credit card fraud with selforganising maps, focussing on real-world samples from the Singaporean branch of an
international bank [37]. Wu and Banzhaf modified the standard artificial immune
system method with a coevolutionary approach, using it to solve transactional fraud
with automatic teller and point-of-sale data for a financial institution [52].
In 2009 Holton utilised a combination of text mining and Bayesian belief networks
to identify disgruntled employees likely to commit corporate fraud [23]. Panigrahi et
al. combined a Dempster-Schaefer adder with a Bayesian learner to solve credit card
fraud with their own synthesised data [35]. Snchez et al. focussed on credit cards
provided by a multinational department store, using self-organising maps to cluster
and visualise fraudulent patterns [41]. Whitrow et al. compared support vector machines with decision trees in solving credit card fraud, with a focus on aggregating
common transactional variables to create new inputs [50].
In 2010 Cecchini et al. studied Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases
(AAER) with their own text mining and support vector machine hybrid to predict
financial statement fraud in US companies [13]. Then in 2011 Bhattacharyya et al.
compared the ability of logistic regression, support vector machines, and random
forests on a large sample of credit card transactions to identify which were fraudulent
[7]. Duman and Ozcelik combined the strengths of genetic algorithms and scatter
search to create their own hybrid method. They used it to track consumer spending
with a large Turkish bank, as an aid to predicting the occurrence of credit card fraud
[16].
Humphrys et al. created text mining hybrids by utilising other common methods to
act as the classifier. With a support vector machine, decision tree, and Bayesian belief network they managed to successfully identify fraud within the companys 10-K
document filings [26]. Glancy and Yadav also studied sections of 10-K documents

Page 6 of 38

for US companies known to be fraudulent, processing the text with a singular validation decomposition vector to classify the samples [20]. Jans et al. applied process
mining to the internal logs created by a European financial institution to detect corporate fraud [27], and Ngai et al. performed a substantial review of existing fraud detection literature as of 2011 [32].
Also in 2011 Ravisankar et al. compared a large range of methods to identify financial statement fraud within Chinese companies. In addition to support vector machines they looked at genetic programming, logistic regression, group method of data
handling, and variety of neural networks [38]. Zhou and Kapoor created a generic
framework for financial statement fraud detection using response surface methodology[59], then in 2012 Wong et al. utilised an artificial immune system to predict
credit card fraud for a major Australian bank [51].
In 2013 Huang investigated financial statement fraud in a series of Taiwanese
companies using logistic regression and a support vector machine [25]. Zaki and
Theodoulidis took a more direct approach and focussed on the litigation section of the
Securities and Exchange Commission website, applying their own text mining algorithm to classify financial statement fraud [56]. Sahin et al. studied the ability of decision trees to identify fraudulent credit card transactions, using a six-month sample
from a major bank [40].
In 2014 Dong et al. used text mining to study AAERs for Chinese companies that
were trading publicly in the US [15]. Olszewski visualised credit card fraud with self
organising maps, focusing only on accounts held by residents of Warsaw, Poland
[33]; Soltani Halvaiee and Akbari utilised an artificial immune system to identify
credit card fraud for an anonymous Brazilian bank [43]; and West et al. investigated
the present state of fraud detection research [60].

Types of Financial Fraud

There are many different types of financial fraud, and a brief description of some of
the major types will be listed here (also see Figure 2). The fraud types were selected
from the list provided in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Financial Crimes Report
(2010-2011), United States [61].
Credit Card Fraud. Credit card fraud refers to the unauthorised use of a persons
credit card to perform fraudulent transactions without the user's knowledge [32]. The
transactions can be performed using the physical card, where the card was either lost
or stolen, but is often performed remotely [7]. The cardholders information may be
acquired by one of a few methods. Phishing involves a fraudster impersonating a
finance official to convince the user to divulge their details, swipers or skimmers
provide an interface to an ATM or POS device which can read the card directly, or
entire databases of user's information can be obtained if the fraudster is able to breach
the financial institutions network security or enlist the help of an accomplice within

Page 7 of 38

the company [7], [37]. Obtaining the user's card could even be as simple as intercepting mail containing a new or replacement card [37]. The anonymity and availability
of these remote methods has given rise to the prevalence of organised crime in credit
card fraud [7]. A typical method for identifying credit card fraud is to analyse a customer's regular spending habits and flag transactions which are noticeably outside of
this model [16].
Securities and Commodities Fraud. Securities fraud, also known as commodities
fraud, refers to a variety of methods by which a person is deceived into investing into
a company based on false information. It includes Pyramid Schemes, Ponzi Schemes,
Hedge Fund Fraud, Foreign Exchange Fraud, and Embezzlement [32].
Financial Statement Fraud. Financial statements are the documents release by a
company that explain details such as their expenses, loans, income and profits [38].
They can also include comments from management on the business' performance and
expected issues that may arise in the future [20]. The various financial statements that
the company releases give an overall picture of the company's status, and can be used
to indicate how successful the company is, influence stock prices, and determine if
they are applicable for loans [38]. Financial statement fraud, also known as corporate
fraud, involves doctoring these statements to make the company appear more profitable.
Reasons for committing financial statement fraud include improving stock performance, reducing tax obligations, or as an attempt to exaggerate performance due to
managerial pressure [38]. Financial statement fraud can be difficult to diagnose because of a general lack of understanding of the field, the infrequency in which it occurs, and the fact that it is usually committed by knowledgeable people within the
industry who are capable of masking their deceit [31].
Insurance Fraud. Insurance fraud is fraud that can be committed at any point during
the insurance process, and by any people in the chain. Insurance claims fraud occurs
when a customer submits a fraudulent insurance claim as a result of an exaggerated
injury or loss of assets, or a completely fraudulent event. A common form of claims
fraud is automobile insurance fraud, which is often committed by faking or intentionally committing accidents that result in excessive repair and injury costs. Larger scale
claims fraud also occurs, such as crop insurance fraud where a consumer overstates
their losses due to declining agricultural prices or the effects of natural disasters.
Insurance fraud can also include excessive billing, duplicate claims, kickbacks to
brokers and upcoding of items [32].
Mortgage Fraud. Mortgage fraud is a specific form of financial fraud that refers to
manipulation of a property or mortgage documents. It is often committed to misrep-

Page 8 of 38

resent the value of a property for the purpose of influencing a lender to fund a loan for
it [32].
Money Laundering. Money laundering is a method used by criminals to insert proceeds obtained from illicit ventures into valid businesses. This conceals the origin of
the money, giving them the appearance of legitimate income and making it difficult to
track their crimes. Money laundering is also undesirable as it enables the criminals to
have economic influence [32].

Computational Intelligence and Data Mining Methods for
Financial Fraud Detection

A large number of statistical and computational techniques exist that have been applied to data mining problems in recent years (see Figure 8). This section contains a
description of the operation of each method used in the reviewed literature, and Table
2 lists the relative strengths and limitations of each.
Bayesian Belief Networks. Bayesian belief networks are a statistical classification
technique that makes use of Bayes theorem, a method to determine the probability
that a given hypothesis is true. The theorem states that for a hypothesis H (such as
whether an object X can be classified within a given class), the probability P is given
by:
(1)
A Bayesian belief network uses a classifier to calculate
for all possible
classes and inserts X into the class with the highest
. In this way the network is shown to classify each sample into the class that it is most likely to belong to
[28].
Graphically, a Bayesian belief network can be modelled as a directed acyclic
graph, with nodes to represent the samples and edges to reflect a causal dependency
between them (see Figure 3). Missing edges can then demonstrate that two variables
are independent of one another [32].
Logistic Regression or Logistic Model. Logistic regression is a statistical method of
classifying binary data which uses a linear model, often referred to as a logistic or
logit model, to perform regression on a set of variables [32], [38]. It is a commonly
used method for predicting patterns in data with unambiguous or numeric attributes
[32], [7]. Logistic regression makes use of a series of input vectors and a dependant
response variable, using the natural logarithm to calculate the probability that the
result lies within a particular category. For binary classification the response variable
takes the form:

Page 9 of 38

(2)
And the formula for calculating that a sample

belongs in class

is given by:
(3)

Where
and w are the regression tuning parameters representing the intercept
and coefficient vector respectively [38].
Neural Network. A neural network is a computational approximation of the human
brain which uses a graph of vertices and edges to represent neurons and synapses
[32]. The network performs by modelling the input variables as a layer of vertices
and then assigning a weighting to each connection in the graph, while the other vertices are put into separate levels reflecting their distance from the input nodes [28] (see
Figure 4).

Each node considers its input as a function of the vertices connected to it at the previous layer. For each neuron the signal received is given by:
(4)
Where
is the weight of the link between neurons and and is the input of .
If the result is greater than a predetermined amount the current neuron fires and
becomes an input for the next layer [28].
A back propagation neural network is trained by running samples from a set of training data through the network and comparing the results. For the first iteration the
weights at each edge are normally determined randomly, and after the results have
been calculated each weighting is adjusted slightly for the next sequence [57]. This
continues until either the network has reduced its error to an acceptable amount or a
predetermined iteration limit has been reached. After training the networks performance may be tested with a set of validation data [32]. A common problem with back
propagation neural networks is overtraining, which can cause the network to focus on
tendencies particular to the training set but not the overall problem [57].
Support Vector Machine. Support vector machines are a classification method
which work by converting a linear issue into a higher dimensional feature space. This
enables complicated, non-linear problems such as financial fraud detection to be
solved by linear classification without increasing the computational complexity. The
function used to transform the dataset is called the kernel function, which can be con-

Page 10 of 38

sidered as a mapping of points between the input space and a higher dimensional
space. The kernel function is defined by:
(5)
Where
maps points in input space X to higher-dimensional space H. After
applying the kernel function to the dataset a hyperplane is used to separate the classes,
which takes the form:
(6)

The hyperplane is constructed in such a way as to maximise the separation between
both classes, which helps to reduce potential errors caused by overtraining (see Figure
5).
The classification for a support vector machine can therefore be defined as:
(7)

The choice of which kernel function to use is dependent on the dataset and classification requirements, though there are many commonly used kernel functions such as the
Gaussian radial basis function and polynomial function [7].
Genetic Algorithms and Programming. Genetic algorithms use the concept of
population evolution to iteratively improve solutions to the problem. It works by
randomly creating a starting generation, then continuously reproducing each population using various techniques and choosing the survivors based on their fitness. Reproduction occurs by taking pairs of parents from the current generation and applying
crossover on two points, then randomly mutating a single element of the resulting
child. The ability of the children is measured using a fitness function, and the result
of this determines which parents and children are chosen to represent the next generation.
Measuring the fitness of the children can be as simple as measuring the percentage of
samples they classify correctly. The algorithm terminates once a required fitness has
been reached, but to avoid infinite looping a limit may be set on the number of iterations that are run (see Figure 6). Genetic algorithms are similar to neural networks in
that they require no prior knowledge of the problem domain and are capable of detecting underlying relationships between the samples [38].

Page 11 of 38

Decision Trees, Forests, and CART. Decision trees are a technique that classifies or
predicts data using a tree with internal nodes representing binary choices on attributes
and branches representing the outcome of that choice [57] (see Figure 7). The nodes
are created such that as a sample traverses the tree it is partitioned into subsets until it
is eventually sorted into a mutually exclusive subgroup. Decision trees are also
known as Classification and Regression Trees (CART) [28].
A decision forest, or random forest, is a collection of decision trees used to avoid the
instability and risk of overtraining that can occur with a single tree [7]. Random forests use separate training data between trees and randomly restrict the pool of attributes available when building each internal node [7]. Another method for reducing
overfitting in decision trees is pruning, which involves removal of decision nodes
without reducing the overall accuracy of the tree [28]. These methods make random
forests robust to overtraining and noise, and as each tree is generated independently
there is little additional computational complexity [7]. Additionally, the only two
parameters that require adjustment are the number of trees and the set of attributes to
choose from when building each node, which makes decision forests simple to generate [7].
Group Method of Data Handling. Group method of data handling is an inductive
data mining algorithm that calculates optimal solutions through a series of increasingly accurate models. It begins with a simple model, typically a polynomial of the
form:
(8)
After assessing the validity of the model further models are generated by using linear regression to calculate new coefficients for the polynomial. In this way group
method of data handling is continually moving toward an optimal approximation.
The generated models are functionally similar to a feed forward neural network, with
the input to each neuron being derived from a polynomial representation of neurons in
the preceding layer and a single neuron in the output layer. After each iteration the
success of the model is calculated as the margin of error between actual and expected
outputs. If this reaches a predetermined level of correctness the algorithm concludes
[38].
Text Mining. Text mining refers to a specific form of data mining which is performed on plain text. Given this broad description there are a variety of different
approaches to text mining, though many work by using one or more common preprocessing steps to transform the data into more quantitative samples:
 Filtering of stop words. Common joining words such as the or is are
removed to simplify the dataset.
 Stemming. This involves reducing derived words to their common base,
such as removing plurals and tenses.

Page 12 of 38



Identification of part-of-speech. This recognises the part of a sentence
that a word occurs in and can be helpful in reducing error due to homophones and other language nuances.
 Word frequency analysis. The frequency of word in document is calculated as
 Word combination. Words are further combined into common concepts
using a synonym list or more complicated measures.
Once the text has been converted to a more quantitative form a traditional data
mining method is applied to actually perform the classification [13], [20]. An alternative to the above approach is to avoid pre-processing and deliberately include all raw
data as a method of detecting abnormalities in the text. Measuring factors such as
expression, complexity, and specificity within the text can be used to identify subtle
differences between samples [26].
Self-Organising Map. Self-organising maps are a form of artificial neural network
which consists of a single matrix of neurons. A non-linear algorithm is used to map
inputs from a high-dimensional space to the two-dimensional array of neurons. The
mapping is designed to model similar input vectors as neurons that are closer together
in the resulting matrix, providing a visualisation of the inputs. A distance or
neighbourhood function is used to group the nodes, such as the Euclidean distance
formula or Gaussian formula [37]. The clustering function applied to each neutron is
given by:
(9)

Where is the current weighting of a specific node, is the current input vector,
and is the chosen distance function. The clustering step is performed a set number
of iterations before the algorithm completes [33].
Process Mining. Process mining involves analysis of transactions and event logs to
construct models representing the behaviour of a system. A specific process instance
is created to represent the individual cases within the system, and assumptions are
applied to the available data to determine whether it is suitable for observation with
this particular process. Given a model of expected behaviour within the system, the
typical operation steps are:
 Log preparation and inspection. The logs are obtained and pre-processed
to remove extraneous noise. If no existing model was available one can be
created based on the provided logs.
 Analysis. Models are observed to check various behaviours. Aspects
such as control flow, performance, and user-roles can be analysed to determine the expected outcomes of the system.

Page 13 of 38



Verification. Given the results of the above analysis, the process miner is
applied to various samples and determines whether they represent typical
system behaviour.
In addition to classification, the ability to generate its own model makes process mining useful for discovering flows and practices within a complicated system [27].
Artificial Immune System. Artificial immune systems are a data mining approach
that work by imitating the behaviour of a biological immune system to detect antigens
[52]. A variety of biological characteristics can be simulated by the artificial immune
system, but most model the creation of detector cells and their ability to detect foreign
bodies. The detector cells are generated randomly and the simulation is performed to
test and evaluate their effectiveness, similar to the training performed by other classification methods.
One common form is clonal selection, which continually generates detector cells
that only live a short time. If a cell detects an antigen it extends its life to fight the
intruder, and may also mutate as a result of the conflict. The surviving cells at the end
of the simulation are therefore the ones best suited to detecting the antigens. Another
common implementation is negative selection, which works by randomly creating
cells and determining which of these react with other non-invasive cells within the
system. Any that do are discarded, resulting in the remainder being proficient at detecting intruders [43].
Hybrid Methods. Hybrid methods are a combination of multiple traditional methods
by selecting beneficial attributes of each in an attempt to create a superior algorithm
for a specific problem domain. Hybrid methods can be constructed in a variety of
different ways: at the highest level methods can simply be applied linearly, with the
outputs of the first providing the inputs of the second [35]. Similarly one method may
be used as a pre-processing step to modify the data in preparation for classification
[27], or at a lower level the individual steps of the algorithms can be intertwined to
create something fundamentally original [16]. Additionally, hybrid methods can be
used to tailor solutions to an individual problem domain. Different aspects of performance can be specifically targeted, including classification ability, ease of use, and
computational efficiency.

Classification of Existing Financial Fraud Detection

In the following section we will classify the financial fraud detection techniques
reviewed based on success rate, method chosen, and fraud type studied. This categorisation will enable us to demonstrate trends in current research methods, including
which have been successful and any factors that have not been covered.

Page 14 of 38

5.1

Classification Based on Performance

A variety of standards have been used to determine performance, but the three
most commonly used are accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Accuracy measures the
ratio of all successfully classified samples to unsuccessful ones. Sensitivity compares
the amount of items correctly identified as fraud to the amount incorrectly listed as
fraud, also known as the ratio of true positives to false positives. Specificity refers to
the same concept with legitimate transactions, or the comparison of true negatives to
false negatives [7], [38].
Tables 3, 4, and 5 classify financial fraud detection research based on these performance measures. Additionally, figure 9 depicts the amount of studies that have
been performed on each combination of detection method and fraud type, and the
comparative performance of each
In addition to the three performance measures discussed here, several other performance measures have been used in the literature. For example, Duman et al. chose
to show their results for sensitivity in graph form instead of deterministic values,
grouped by each set of input parameters [16]. In addition to other forms of graphing
[37], some research used software-determined success levels or case-based procedures to determine the success of their fraud detection techniques [41], [27].
From the results we can see that CI methods typically had better success rate than
statistical methods. Sensitivity was slightly better for random forests and support
vector machines than logistic regression, with comparable specificity and accuracy
[7]. Genetic programming, support vector machines, probabilistic neural networks,
and group method of data handling outperformed regression in all three areas [38].
Additionally, a neural network with exhaustive pruning was found to be more specific
and accurate than CDA [10]. One statistical method seems to contradict this theory
however: Bayesian belief networks were reported to be more accurate than neural
networks and decision trees [28], and adding Bayesian logic to regression outperformed logistic regression alone [6].
Most of the research showed a large difference between each method's sensitivity
and specificity results. For example, Bhattacharyya et al. showed that logistic regression, support vector machines and random forests all performed significantly better at
detecting legitimate transactions correctly than fraudulent ones [7]. Support vector
machines, genetic programming, neural networks, group method of data handling, and
particularly logistic regression were also slightly less sensitive [38]. And a neural
network with exhaustive pruning showed more specificity than sensitivity [10].
As explained previously, fraud detection is a problem with a large difference in
misclassification costs: it is typically far more expensive to misdiagnose a fraudulent
transaction as legitimate than the reverse. With that in mind it would be beneficial for
a detection techniques to show a much higher sensitivity than specificity, meaning
that these results are less than ideal. Contrary to this belief, Hoogs et al. hypothesised
that financial statement fraud may carry higher costs for false positives, and their
results reflect this with a much higher specificity [24]. Panigrahi et al. also acknowledged the costs associated with following up credit card transactions marked as
fraudulent, focussing their results on sensitivity only [35]. The CDA and CART

Page 15 of 38

methods, as well as the neural networks, Bayesian belief networks and decision trees
performed better in this regard, with all showing a somewhat higher ability to classify
fraudulent transactions than legitimate ones [10], [28].
5.2

Classification Based on Detection Algorithm

Classifying fraud detection practices by the detection algorithm is a useful way to
identify the suitable techniques for this problem domain. It can also help us to
determine why particular methods were chosen or successful. Additionally, we can
identify any gaps in research by looking at algorithms which have not been explored
sufficiently. Table 6 shows classification of financial fraud detection practices based
on detection algorithm (conventional data mining and CI-based approaches) used.
Previously it was mentioned that early fraud detection research focussed on
statistical models and neural networks; however, it may be noted that these methods
still continue to be popular. Many used at least one form of neural network [28], [38],
[10], some investigated logistic regression [7], [36], [49], [38], [25], while others
applied Bayesian belief networks and other Bayesian algorithms [23], [28], [6].
Application of CDA has been relatively uncommon [10]. Neural networks and
logistic regression are often chosen for their well-established popularity, giving them
the ability to be used as a control method by which other techniques are tested.
Comparatively, more advanced methods such as support vector machines and genetic
programming have received substantially less attention. Yue et al. also reported that
all the methods mentioned in their research were a form of classification, with no
studies performed on clustering or time-series approaches, and that most of the
research focussed on supervised learning as opposed to unsupervised [55].
Several of the research focussed on a single form of fraud detection which they
advocated above others, such as studying text mining with the singular validation
decomposition vector [20], self-organising maps [37], [33], logistic regression [49],
[36], and fuzzy logic [41]. Additionally, some researchers focussed soley on
classification and regression trees [3],[40], Bayesian belief networks [23], individual
statistical techniques [35], artificial immune systems [51], [43] or their own hybrid
methods [16]. This unilateral approach is useful for demonstrating the ability of the
specific method in isolation, but without comparing it to other methods it is difficult
to understand the relative performance of the technique. Additional factors such as
the fraud type researched and the specific dataset used can influence the results of the
experiment. Future research could focus on reviewing these methods as against other
more established techniques.
A rising trend in fraud detection is the use of hybrid methods which utilise the
strengths of multiple algorithms to classify samples. Duman and Ozcelik used a
combination of scatter search and genetic algorithm, based on the latter but targeting
attributes of scatter search such as the smaller populations and recombination as the
reproduction method [16]. A different approach was taken by Panigrahi et al. who
used two methods sequentially, beginning with the Depster-Schaefer method to
combine rules and then using a Bayesian learner to detect the existence of fraud [35].
Some researchers applied fuzzy logic to introduce variation to their samples,

Page 16 of 38

attempting to transform it to resemble real world data before deploying a different
technique to actually detect the presence of fraud [27]. The investigators recognised
that applying 'fuzziness' to their problem increased the performance of their solution
[52]. Similarly, several researchers combined traditional computational intelligence
methods with text mining to analyse financial statements for the presence of fraud
[13], [26], [15].
5.3

Classification Based on Fraud Type

Given the varying nature of each type of fraud, the problem domain can differ
significantly depending on the form that is being detected. By classifying the existing
practices on the type of fraud investigated we can identify the techniques more
suitable and more commonly used for a specific type of fraud. Additionally we can
infer the varieties which are considered the most important for investigation
depending on the scope and scale of their impact. Table 7 depicts the classification
based on fraud types considered, along with the detection methods used. Table 9 lists
the datasets used by each researcher.
As with each chosen algorithm, feature selection will differ depending on the
problem domain. Specific financial statement fraud exists within individual
companies, and as such attribute ratios are used instead of absolute values. Koh and
Low provide a good example of the relevant ratios such as net income to total assets,
interest payments to earnings before interest and tax, and market value of equity to
total assets [29]. In comparison, research into credit card fraud has typically selected
independent variables or aggregate values which may be quantitative or qualitative.
For example, Bhattacharyya et al. made use of transaction amount, categorical values
such as account number, transaction date, and currency, and aggregated properties
like total transaction amount per day, and average amount spent at a single merchant
[7].
We can see that the existing research has been greatly unbalanced in fraud type
studied. The vast majority of papers have focussed on two forms of financial fraud:
credit card fraud and financial statement fraud. Only a handful of studies have
looked at securities and commodities fraud, and many focussed on external forms of
corporate fraud while neglecting the internal ones [27]. Ngai et al. found that
insurance fraud had received the highest coverage during their research [32]: the fact
that we identified only a few examples of published literature on this type of fraud
since 2007 indicates that research into insurance fraud is declining. Additionally, no
studies have been performed directly on mortgage fraud or money laundering.
Reasons for this disparity may include differing relevance to stakeholders of each
fraud type.
To determine which method was the most successful for each fraud type we looked
at the accuracy scores reported in the experimental research. There are many metrices
used to assess performance but accuracy was the most commonly used and therefore
provided the best basis for comparison. Analysis of the individual problem domain is
required to completely assess the usefulness of each method, but the results shown

Page 17 of 38

here should provide a useful starting point for future researchers to investigate new
fraud detection algorithms. It should be noted that we have reported only the best
accuracy result obtained by each method for specific fraud types; the test conditions
for individual experiments are not necessarily comparable. Table 8 shows these
results for each fraud type, as well as comparable methods.
All the solutions used for credit card fraud had a very high success rate, including
regression, support vector machines, artificial immune systems, and random forests.
Out of these the self organising map is recommended due to its perfect accuracy with
a 10000 transaction sample [33]. As mentioned earlier there has been a lack of recent
research into insurance fraud, with only one researcher comparing typical logistic
regression to a hybrid version with Bayesian logic. In this case the hybrid method
offered a significant improvement with an accuracy of 99.5% compared to 60.7% [6].
Financial statement fraud had a large variance in results, from CDA at 71.4% to a
probibalistic neural network with 98.1% [10], [38]. Several other methods also had
success rate greater than 90%, including Bayesian belief networks, support vector
machine, genetic programming, group method of data handling, and some hybrid
methods based on text mining.

Financial Fraud Detection Challenges and Future Directions

Financial fraud detection is an evolving field in which it is desirable to stay ahead of
the perpetrators. Additionally, it is evident that there are still facets of intelligent fraud
detection that have not been investigated. In this section we present some of the key
issues associated with financial fraud detection and suggest areas for future research.
Some of the identified issues and challenges are as follows:
 Typical classification problems: CI and data mining-based financial fraud
detection is subject to the same issues as other classification problems, such as
feature selection, parameter tuning, and analysis of the problem domain.
 Fraud types and detection methods: Financial fraud is a diverse field and there has
been a large imbalance in both fraud types and detection methods studied: some
have been studied extensively while others, such as hybrid methods, have only
been looked at superficially.
 Privacy considerations: Financial fraud is a sensitive topic and stakeholders are
reluctant to share information on the subject. This has led to experimental issues
such as undersampling.
 Computational performance: As a high-cost problem it is desirable for financial
fraud to be detected immediately. Very little research has been conducted on the
computational performance of fraud detection methods for use in real-time
situations.
 Evolving problem: Fraudsters are continually modifying their techniques to remain
undetected. As such detection methods are required to be able to constantly adapt
to new fraud techniques.

Page 18 of 38

 Disproportionate misclassification costs: Fraud detection is primarily a
classification problem with a vast difference in misclassification costs. Research on
the performance of detection methods with respect to this factor is an area which
needs further attention.
 Generic framework: Given that there are many varieties of fraud, a generic
framework which can be applied to multiple fraud categories would be valuable.
As a classification problem, financial fraud detection suffers from the same issues
as other similar problems. Feature selection has a high impact on the success of any
classification method. While some researchers have mentioned feature selection for
one type of fraud [29], [7], no comparisons have been made between features for
differing problem domains. Also, one of the major benefits of the computational
intelligence and data mining methods is their ability to be adjusted to fit the problem
domain. Existing research has rarely used any form of customisation or tuning for
specific problems; however, tuning is an important factor in the context of an
algorithms performance. For example, the number of nodes and internal layers within
a neural network has a large impact on both accuracy and computational performance.
Similarly the kernel function chosen will considerably alter the success of a support
vector machine and parameters such as the fitness function, crossover method, and
probability for mutation will impact the results of a genetic programming algorithm.
Research on customisation or tuning of the computational methods is required to truly
comprehend the ability of each method. Further, in other data mining cases the
solution algorithm is selected based on its performance within the problem domain,
which for financial fraud detection is the type of fraud investigated. Studies on the
suitability of various methods for each fraud category are necessary to understand
which attributes of each algorithm make them appropriate for detecting financial
fraud.
From the existing literature it is apparent that there are some forms of fraud that
have not been investigated as extensively as others. Financial statement fraud has
been considerably investigated, which is understandable given its high profile nature,
but there are other forms of fraud that have a significant impact on consumers. Credit
card fraud often has a direct impact on the public and the recent increase in online
transactions has led to a majority of the U.S. public being concerned with identity
theft [7]. A benefit of this close relation to the user is that credit card fraud is
typically detected quickly, which gives researchers access to large datasets of
unambiguous transactions. Other forms of fraud which have not been covered in
depth include money laundering, mortgage, and securities and commodities fraud. A
lack of sufficient sample size may be the reason for the lack of research in these areas
[32]. Future studies that focussed on these types of fraud detection would be
beneficial.
The private nature of financial data has led to institutions being reluctant to share
fraudulent information. This has had an affect both on the fraud types that have been
investigated as well as the datasets used for the purpose. In the published literature
many of the financial fraud simulations consisted of less than a few hundred samples,
typically with comparable amounts of fraudulent and legitimate specimens. This is

Page 19 of 38

contrary to the realities of the problem domain, where fraud cases are far outweighed
by legitimate transactions [7]. Undersampling the problem domain like this can cause
biases in the data that do not accurately represent real-world scenarios [24]. There is
a definite need for further studies with realistic samples to accurately depict the
performance of each method [20].
Some forms of financial fraud occur very rapidly, such as credit card fraud. If a
fraudster obtains an individuals credit card information its very likely that they will
use it immediately until the card limit is reached. The ability to detect fraud in realtime would be highly beneficial as it may be able to prevent the fraudster from
making subsequent transactions. Computational performance is therefore a key factor
to consider in fraud detection. Though some researchers have noted the performance
of their particular methods [7], [37], most studies were simulations performed on test
datasets. Further research focussing on the computational as well as classification
performance is required.
Unlike many classification problems, fraud detection solutions must be capable of
handling active attempts to circumvent them. As detection methods become more
intelligent, fraudsters are also constantly upgrading their techniques. For example, in
the last few decades credit card fraud has moved from individuals stealing or forging
single cards to large-scale phone and online fraud perpetrated by organised groups
[7]. It is therefore necessary for fraud detection methods to be capable of evolving to
stay ahead of fraudsters. Some researchers have considered models for adaptive
classification, however further research is required to fully develop these for use in
practical fraud detection problems [59].
As explained previously fraud has a large cost to businesses. Additionally, fraud
detection has associated costs: systems require maintenance and computational
power, and auditors must be employed to monitor them and investigate when a
potential fraud case is identified [28]. The expense of a false positive, in
misclassifying a legitimate transaction as fraud, is typically far less than that of a false
negative [32]. Insufficient study has been performed on the disproportionate nature of
these costs, with attention typically focussing on the traditional classification
performance methods outlined in Section 5.1. Considering the accuracy of each fraud
detection method, focus should be on achieving an optimum balance for each
technique such that the expense is smallest. Research specifically focused on finding
this balance would add significant real-world value to financial fraud detection.
Given the diversity of common categories of fraud it would be useful to have some
form of generic framework that could apply to more than one fraud category. Such a
framework could be used to study the differences between various types of fraud, or
even specific details such as differentiating between stolen and counterfeit credit
cards [7]. A ubiquitous model could also be used to determine which specific fraud
detection method is applicable given the problem domain. This approach has been
investigated slightly with response surface methodology [59], but more detailed
research is desirable.

Conclusion

Fraud detection is an important part of the modern finance industry. This literature
review studied research into intelligent approaches to fraud detection, both statistical
and computational. Though their performance differed, each technique was shown to
be reasonably capable at detecting various forms of financial fraud. In particular, the
ability of the computational methods such as neural networks and support vector
machines to learn and adapt to new techniques is highly effective to the evolving
tactics of fraudsters.
There are still many aspects of intelligent fraud detection that have not yet been the
subject of research. Some types of fraud, as well as some data mining methods, have
been superficially explored but require future study to be completely understood.
There is also the opportunity to examine the performance of existing methods by
adjusting their parameters, as well as the potential to study cost benefit analysis of
computational fraud detection. Finally, further research into the differences between
each type of financial fraud could lead to a general framework which would greatly
improve the accuracy of intelligent detection methods.
