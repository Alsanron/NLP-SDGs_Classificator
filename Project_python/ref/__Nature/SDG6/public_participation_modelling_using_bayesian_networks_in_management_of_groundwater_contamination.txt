Abstract
Negotiation and active involvement with participation of water managers, experts, stakeholders and representatives of the general public requires decision support tools (Environmental Decision Support Systems; EDSS) that build on transparency and flexibility in order to reach sound
action plans and management instruments. One possible EDSS for active involvement of stakeholders is application of Bayesian networks (Bns).
The paper gives an example of a case study (The Danish case) where farmers and hydrologists disputed the degree to which pesticide application
affected the quality of deep groundwater. Instead of selecting one opinion or another, the decision was made to include both in the Bns. By
adopting this approach, it was possible to view the results from either point of view, accepting the reality of the situation, not becoming mired
in an insoluble conflict, and in this way laying the foundation for future compromises. The paper explores Bns as a tool for acting on and dealing
with management of groundwater protection. Bns allow stakeholders divergent values, interests and beliefs to be surfaced and negotiated in
participatory processes for areas where conventional physically based groundwater models are insufficient due to lack of data, physical understanding, flexibility or lack of integration capability. In this way, the agency will be able to address the institutional arrangement influencing
groundwater protection in all its complexity.

1. Introduction
The objective of the present paper is to describe the way
Bayesian networks (Bns) can be applied as a tool for public
participatory modelling in the management of groundwater
contamination.
The topic will be discussed and exemplified by making reference to a real world case study in Denmark, focusing on pesticide contamination and protection strategies for a well field

outside Copenhagen in Denmark, where drinking water is abstracted from a deeper groundwater aquifer for the Danish capital area.
In the following we define public participatory modelling
(PP modelling) as a modelling process that concerns reasoning
and decision making about whole systems using computerbased modelling and analysis technology, and with active
involvement of stakeholders. The guidelines for planning in
relation to the WFD (EC, 2003) encourage active involvement
of stakeholders but do not give details for use of EDSS.
Development of EDSS and PP modelling involves disciplines such as computer science, decision theory, statistics,
psychology, information and knowledge engineering, and

1102

organisational science (Eom and Farris, 1996; Eom, 1999;
Myrsiak et al., 2005).
Traditional groundwater models for flow and transport are
constructed according to model protocols in dialogue between
model experts and the water manager with reviews when passing
different milestones (Refsgaard and Henriksen, 2004; Refsgaard et al., 2005; Scholten et al., 2004). Such types of models
are excellent for water resource assessments and predictive simulations, but in most cases they do not link directly to the wider
social, cultural and economic aspects of water management.
A basic requirement for PP models with high level stakeholder engagement in the decision process, is that manager, expert and stakeholders should try to use a shared language for
the dialogue and communication in order to reach informed decisions. Even though the goal is not necessarily consensus, dialogue can only make progress with an enlivened process
where stakeholders exchange viewpoints. They may not agree
on the outcome, problems, results etc., but the process may reveal common ground (as well as uncommon). What we share is
not necessarily as interesting as what we do not share (Campell,
2000). Differences in ideas, attitudes and experiences may result in new types of knowledge and new solutions to common
problems. This raises the question, whether Bns can support
and enable such dialogue and negotiation processes.
The paper is structured in the following way. After the present introduction, Section 2 describes the theoretical basis.

Section 3 describes EU WFD terminology and how Bns as
EDSS for PP modelling can be applied. Section 4 describes institutional framework. Finally, Section 5 describes a test case
where Bayesian networks were constructed with active involvement of stakeholders for the purpose of groundwater
management and protection.

2. Theoretical basis
2.1. EU Guidelines on public participation
As illustrated in Fig. 1, there could be PP modelling for every phase of the overall planning cycle, feeding input into
comprehensive modelling and vice versa. The guidance document on public participation (EC, 2003) categorised into three
levels, which are of importance to the Water Framework Directive (see Table 1):
 Information provision (about management timetables, issues and to the participants. It is considered the foundation
for all further participation activities).
 Consultation (encouraging written and oral responses).
 Active involvement (involving people in developing and
implementing plans that could form the final plan decided upon).

Fig. 1. Water Framework Directive planning process. Public participation (PP) will take place in WFD processes within the inner circle, whereas comprehensive
modelling are expected to take place outside as a part of modelling loop. PP modelling should give input for comprehensive modelling and vice versa.

There is also a meta-level of participation termed awareness raising and developing a learning approach, something
that will support all the other levels of participation and management, which should be remembered. Participation in river
basin management concerns three separate groups (Table 1):
Public (general public); Stakeholders (interested parties) and
Competent authority.
2.2. Bayesian networks as EDSS for active involvement
and dialogue
A Bayesian network (Bn), also called a Bayesian belief network, is a type of decision support system based on probability
theory. This rule, devised by Thomas Bayes, an eighteenthcentury English clergyman, shows mathematically how existing beliefs can be modified with the input of new evidence.
Bns organise the body of knowledge in any given area by mapping out cause-and-effect relationships among key variables
and encoding them with numbers that represent the extent to
which one variable is likely to affect another (Pearl, 1988;
Cowel et al., 1999; Jensen, 2002; Korb and Nicholson,
2004). Factors, associations and probabilities can be adjusted
and validated and Bns are powerful for integrating data and
knowledge from different sources and domains, e.g. domain
models. They are also capable of handling uncertain information in a practical and easy understandable way (Jensen, 2002;
Soncini-Sessa et al., 2003; Henriksen et al., 2004, 2005; Castelletti and Soncini Sessa, 2006; Bromley et al., 2005).
Bns have gained a reputation of being powerful techniques
for modelling complex problems involving uncertain knowledge and impacts of causes. Ideally, Bns are techniques to assist
decision-making and are especially helpful when there is uncertainty in the data and the factors are highly interlinked. Constructing the qualitative part of a Bayesian network (nodes and
links), although elaborate, is relatively straightforward, and experts are comfortable doing so.
This part of the net is relatively easily communicated to
stakeholders (Henriksen et al., in press). On the other hand,
when parties negotiate, the process is speeded up considerable,
when they focus on the selection of states, variables, links
and the quantitative part, with the probabilities over the variables, the numbers. Numbers and conditional probability
tables are the most critical part of Bns, but at the same time
the most important and powerful feature compared to more soft
EDSS tools like multi-criteria techniques or spreadsheets.
In the early stages of the Bn construction phase, it may be
most efficient to have broader groups of stakeholders and the

general public to provide input to Bn development. In the later,
more quantitative stages, it is often better to consult stakeholders
at individual meetings focusing on domains of interest (Henriksen et al., 2004). Experts or domain models may be necessary
for quantitative inputs but credible Bns require engagement of
stakeholder groups in order to validate Bns as a whole (Henriksen et al., in press), encouraging authorities to identify all
the relevant information, for clarifying gaps in knowledge and
to build support before subsequent implementation. It is impossible to be certain about the consequences of any environmental
management decision. This fact must be recognised together
with the effect of the uncertainty of the decision.
Many commercial software tools are available for implementing Bn based models, among which Hugin is one
(www.hugin.com). Hugin was selected for the case study in
Denmark as graphical user interface and decision engine providing the following main features:
1. The Graphical User Interface:
 Construction, maintenance and usage of knowledge
bases using Bayesian networks and Influence diagrams technology
 Supports development of object-oriented Bayesian
networks
 Interface to automated learning of Bayesian networks
from databases
 Wizard for generation of probability tables
2. The Hugin Decision Engine:
 Calculation of revised beliefs, optimal strategy, conflict analysis, and other features for exploiting graphical probabilistic models
 Automated learning/construction of Bayesian
networks
3. New concepts for relation between decision making and
modelling process
3.1. Planning and modelling in WFD
WFD planning is an ongoing process that can be described
as a cyclic process of four main steps: Identification, design,
implementation and evaluation. For each of these steps different types of modelling may be carried out to support decision
making (see Fig. 1).
Identification consists of establishment of status and overall
goals, building commitment to reform process and gaps analysis. Design includes the preparation of strategy and action plan

1104

H.J. Henriksen et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 22 (2007) 1101e1113

and building commitment to actions. Implementation comprises implementing of the programme of measures. Evaluation
involves establishment of monitoring programmes and evaluation of the first period and planning of the next (EC, 2003).
Unorganised groups of individuals in the community who
nevertheless have a stake in the management of the river basin
are termed general public. Stakeholders are persons, groups or
organisations affected by a management plan, e.g. professional
bodies, government authorities, resident organisations, farmers
groups, individual landowners or residents. Usually stakeholders invited to participate are representatives of such groups.
Competent authorities are the authorities given final responsibility for deciding on and implementing the management plan.
4. Institutional framework
According to North (Kemper, 2003) a distinction has to be
made between institutions, as the underlying rules of the
game and actorsdthe individuals, agencies and organisationsdhere the public, stakeholders and competent authorities. Actors interact with, and influence, the institutional
framework. Institutional arrangements and actors compose
the institutional framework and how the different parts of an
institutional framework interact.
An institutional arrangement of major importance in the
context of groundwater management relates to contracts and
property rights, since economic activity takes place in the
form of contracting. The institutional arrangement can facilitate these actionsdfor instance, by providing clear rules on
contract layout and by helping to enforce such rules (Kemper,
2003).
The institutional framework defines the management instruments to be used (e.g. groundwater use rights, pricing, information, water user participation, farming contracts etc.).
This framework in turn has an impact on the management results (e.g. groundwater allocation, use and future groundwater
quality). It should be noted that there is a feedback between
institutional framework and management instruments and
again between management instruments and management results (Kemper, 2003). Management results feed back into the
system for reinforcement, adjustment and refinement.
The institutional framework does not only consist of formal
institutional arrangements (like groundwater laws and decrees,
etc.), but also strongly depends on informal institutional
arrangements in the water sector (cultural and social norms,
beliefs and values). Furthermore, other institutional arrangements indirectly may affect groundwater (e.g. energy, health
and agricultural policy etc.).
In the following we will use the term T-organisation
(temporary organisation) for the collective of an agency and
the temporarily involved stakeholders in the groundwater protection activities.
Using the definition of an organisation by Argyris (1960):
An organisation is (a) A plurality of parts, (b) Maintaining
themselves through their interrelatedness, and (c) Achieving
specific objectives. While accomplishing (a) and (b), an

organisation (d) Adapt to the external environment, thereby
(e) Maintaining their interrelated state of the parts,
the T-organisation is characterised by a highly dynamic network of collective action, an arena for exchange of meaning
and influence, social learning and awareness.
In the T-organisation (see Fig. 2) the agency has the leadership (authority to run process and make the final decisions),
while stakeholders and citizens are invited as stakeholders to
participate in the construction of the EDSS as members of
working groups, negotiations and evaluation of the final Bns.
A T-organisation, or any working group within it, is exposed to both intra-group and inter-group characteristics (Alderfer, 1987). Stakeholders are members of different groups
and categorise themselves and others according to identity, interests, values and attitudes towards the problem or project
(Mikkelsen and Riis, 1996).
In order to deal properly with the primary task and to
achieve the goals of the participatory process different requirements are necessary:
 (a) Structural subsystem which interacts with home stakeholder organisations (e.g. clear rules, planning, authority
and decision making);
 (b) Technological subsystem selected according to PP
modelling objectives (e.g. use of appropriate tools, acknowledgement of guidelines, procedures, work methods
and knowledge bases); and
 (c) The philosophy of leadership and style balanced to
consider both formal (e.g. involvement plan and task descriptions) and informal factors (roles and emotions),
and appropriate according to authority relation and delegation of working group members.
Several ingredients are necessary for individuals (managers, experts and stakeholders) to come together and generate
new meanings in dialogue. Primarily, each person must come
as a responsible individual, aware of ideas and actions that he
or she wants to contribute to the construction of new meaning.
Secondly, an appreciation of difference among different people and points of view, which must be seen as a resource,
not a threat. We cannot learn or progress from shared meaning;
we only learn by encountering new ideas and acting them out
in intersubjective acts. Thirdly, each person must honour an
obligation to create meaning for the others ideas or actions
(Campell, 2000).
Creating new meaning in dialogues require clear rules of
the game. It is necessary to prepare a stakeholder involvement
plan describing how to involve stakeholders and general public which is balanced with respect to problem framing and the
type of decision support systems used for the planning and/or
implementation. Developing common understanding, defining
goals, objectives and principles and the character of public
participation and clarifying team roles and responsibilities
are parts of stakeholder involvement plans. Furthermore,
a list of all stakeholders to include with evaluation of groups
interest and responsibilities are valuable for the subsequent

forming of working groups and planning of public meetings,
selection of facilitator and clarifying plans for informing the
general public. Finally, mission statements for all groups,
time schedule for meetings and milestones, including allocation of resources for implementation of the stakeholder involvement plan, has to be decided and written down.
An enabling environment (the governments regulatory role
and capacity building) is required if groundwater protection in
relation to pesticide applications is to be efficient. In addition,
a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches has to
be applied. The new management tool package should not
only focus on market-based instruments such as pesticide
taxes and/or water pricing but should also include PP tools
and methods for involving the groundwater users in decisionmaking processes. Groundwater management is a field, which
has to be developed in order to cope with present and future
demands (WDF Guidelines and the new Groundwater Daughter
Directive). Formerly, groundwater was simply an invisible
resource. Today it has become a highly visible resource in
many areas due to problems of overabstraction and pollution
affecting stakeholders access to groundwater in different
ways (Kemper, 2003).
Bayesian networks may be a good tool for dealing with the
informal institutional arrangements in the water sector, e.g. the
cultural and social norms, and the different perceptions among
stakeholders, may they be of political, historical or religious
origin. The question of how to actively involve stakeholders,

e.g. farmers, residents and other interested parties, more effectively in the decisions necessary, to assure an improved protection of groundwater in local areas is important issues. The
need is to illuminate the significance of various instruments
(e.g. voluntary agricultural agreements, taxes on pesticides,
pesticide-free buffer zones, etc.) and their influence on water
cycle, groundwater quality, value of natural resources, macroeconomics, and commercial and social aspects.
The question is whether establishment of a T-organisation
with active involvement of stakeholders and application of
Bns can provide a broader local acceptance of innovative decisions, as well as improve the dialogue between water companies, local stakeholders and the authorities. This is what
we set out to investigate in the Danish case, Copenhagen Energy being the competent user responsible for groundwater
management and experts and farmers organisations as the
main stakeholders involved.
5. Case study: Groundwater protection for Havelse
well field with Bn construction with full
stakeholder involvement
5.1. Introduction to case study
Basic hydrological data and land coverage maps were collected from several sources, and geochemical data from
groundwater was extracted from databases at the Geological

1106

H.J. Henriksen et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 22 (2007) 1101e1113

Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS). Data were also
obtained from reports made available by Frederiksborg
County and Copenhagen Energy (Henriksen et al., 2004).
The Havelse waterworks well field catchment area covers
an area of 26 km2 with a well field zone of about 3.7 km2
with 21 boreholes. The land use is mostly agricultural, with
small villages. The Havelse waterworks catchment area covers
the lower part of the Havelse Creek catchment area. The geology at the depth of one meter below the surface is in the southern part of the area covered with a clayey till; the northern part
is meltwater sand. Stretched SE-NW across the area is a large
sand and gravel esker. Along the streams are postglacial freshwater deposits, and deposits from the Stone Age period near
downstream part of the Havelse river.
The primary groundwater reservoir in the area is limestone
and chalk deposits from the Danian period. The limestone may
be in hydraulic contact with overlaying meltwater sand. The
surface of the limestone is located at about 20 m below sea
level. The reservoir is generally well protected by the overlying clayey till, which is from 15e30 m thick in large regions
of the catchment area. Running through the area along NeS
direction is an area where the thickness of the clay is less
than 5 m, and it may be totally lacking in some spots. This
area may represent a 500-m-wide and buried valley filled
with meltwater sand. The clay thickness is also reduced along
the esker, to a layer five to ten metres thick in a 250-m-wide
zone (Henriksen et al., 2004).
In the area there is a threat of pesticide contamination of the
groundwater. South-east, in an area with thin clay layers above
the primary reservoir, there have been a few findings of pesticides but in general the data coverage is limited. The primary
reservoir is meltwater sand overlaying limestone and covered
by 4e16 m of clayey deposits. The pesticide found is
BAMd2,6 dichlorbenzamidedwhich is a metabolite of the
herbicides dichlobenil or chlorthiamide. BAM is the greatest
threat to groundwater quality at the moment in Denmark and
the use of these herbicides is now prohibited.
Similar vulnerable or very vulnerable areas are also found
inside the catchment area and in the present well field zone.
The vulnerability is here an expression of the thickness of
the clay layer above the primary reservoir and whether the
aquifers are unconfined or confined. A recent pesticide survey
in five drilled wells, four dug wells and Havelse Creek show
pesticides in two dug wells and one drilled well, but also in
Havelse Creek, with all findings above the MAC value of pesticides used today.
Groundwater is the backbone for drinking water supply,
industrial supply and supply for aquatic environment in the
greater Copenhagen area. In Denmark, 99% of the water supply is groundwater. Furthermore, most Danes agree that clean
groundwater and drinking water has the highest priority of all
environmental issues. Chemical treatment of groundwater is
rarely accepted before it is supplied to the consumers.
From a preventive groundwater protection point of view,
the goal should be no pesticides in the groundwater above
the maximum limit value. Perhaps the vulnerability of the
area with respect to the deeper aquifers is less than for other

Danish aquifers, but we do not know in detail which parameters or factors we should base such an assessment on. In fact,
we know very little about the vulnerability of the deep groundwater in the Havelse area at the depths from which groundwater is abstracted. We do know that pesticides have a very low
degradation rate (nearly none) once they have reached the anaerobic parts of the aquifer, which in this area is located a few
meters below the surface.
5.2. Bn construction process
In the Danish case study the water company responsible
for decision making and actions towards well field protection
is Copenhagen Energy representing the Municipality of
Copenhagen.
The construction process of Bayesian networks with stakeholder involvement followed a seven step procedure (see
Fig. 3). There is no single best way to involve stakeholders,
but that does not mean that there is not a need for guidelines
for how to construct Bayesian networks with stakeholder involvement. In a recent EU research project (Bromley et al.,
2005) one main deliverable was to establish such a proposal
for guidelines for Bns, and the sequence suggested in Fig. 3
follows roughly this proposal.
In Step 1: Define context (see Fig. 3), physical and socioeconomical boundaries, area of interest, alternative actions
and indicators are defined. In Step 2: Identify factors, actions
and indicators, a list of stakeholder and general public concerns is drawn up, and actions to be taken and important indicators are defined. A synopsis of data sources, reports and
existing models is described. In Step 3: Build pilot Bn, the important variables are identified and directed edges are selected
and connected. In Step 4: Collect data, the data from different
sources are collected. Data are analysed and a simple Bn prepared to illustrate what to do in next step. In Step 5: Define
states, input from stakeholders and general public is important.

(Bns), Henriksen et al. (2004).

H.J. Henriksen et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 22 (2007) 1101e1113

States are implemented in Bns for all variables. Step 6: Construct CPTsdconstruction of conditional probability tables
(CPTs)dincludes a review of the networks at stakeholder
meetings. Structural learning is encouraged as a method of
consulting stakeholders in an interactive mode. Input from
models and experts for CPTs is also part of this step. Bns
should also be carefully checked for internal consistency at
this stage. Finally, in Step 7: Collect feedback from stakeholders, stakeholders and general public opinions on the final
network (perceptions, motivation etc.) are collected, and a conclusion based on the final Bn is drawn.
Like the overall planning cycle PP modelling (Steps 1e7) is
a cycle that may be circulated several times in a specific case
study. In our case study at least three full rounds were done.
The aim of the case study was to test the benefits of Bns as
an EDSS with full stakeholder involvement. The scope was to
identify instruments against pesticide threats, which could be
implemented as part of groundwater protection based on voluntary agreements with farmers. In the present section we
want to analyse to which extent Bns can be used as a decision
support tool for water resource management, in what ways
Bns are helpful for focusing on the primary task in temporary
organisations (T-organisations)? We also want to evaluate
what was experienced about efficient involvement of stakeholder groups in the decision-making process and the construction of Bns. What was learned from the process of
involving stakeholders and citizens in T-organisations?
Copenhagen Energy (CE), is the largest water supply company in Denmark. It supplies roughly one million inhabitants
in the greater Copenhagen area with drinking water each
day. CE operates Havelse well field together with 55 other
large well fields located in northern and eastern Zealand
(Fig. 4). The aim of the case study was to identify a groundwater protection strategy for CE against pesticide application to
agricultural areas, which could be applied for all 55 well
fields. Could voluntary compensational payment agreements
with farmers (Brouwer, 2003) be an instrument for CE for
dealing with the threats from pesticides? Because afforestation
is not possible in the Havelse area to any great extent, CE
decided to analyse farming contracts, for areas where more
permanent change in land use from agriculture to forest are
impossible, but what are the costs?
5.3. The final Bn and the outcome of the exercise
The final results of the Bn construction process are shown
in Fig. 5.
The results of the Bns analysis are described in more details
in Henriksen et al. (2004, in press). We do not need to go into
detail here about the general results and how the Bns were
constructed. Different options such as afforestation, establishment of a new wetland, a move of the entire well field to another location and occasional flooding were considered. The
focus in the present paper is narrowed down to the construction of Bns for farming contracts.
The general idea with the Bn for farming contracts was to
analyse the effects of compensation payments to farmers for

1107

not using pesticides on agricultural fields. The higher the compensation level, the more farmers will join such a voluntary
contract. However, farmers signing a contract will also try to
optimise land use by growing crops more suitable for farming
without pesticides, and this means that contracts will also affect crop rotation.
Farming contract restrictions and crop rotation affect the
farmers bottom line, so to speak, and this, together with the
compensation payment, has an impact on farm economics as
a whole. The relationship between size of compensation and
farmers acceptance rate in this part of the Bn was provided
by an expert (Rasmussen, 2003). The other part of the Bn
shows variables concerning environmental impacts of pesticide application. These variables were based on information
from monitoring data and from research projects. The variable
safe supply of drinking water is an overall indicator for the
likelihood of safe groundwater abstraction from the groundwater aquifer of good quality suitable for drinking water supply.
The final Bn documents that compensation payment must
be in the highest state of the variable compensation, the
rather costly compensations of DKK 4400 per ha/year, if at
minimum a 95% probability for the state true of the safe
supply should be achieved. This could be a relevant goal since
clean groundwater is very important and also of limited
amount in the capital area.
For a compensation of DKK 500 per ha/year, only very few
farmers (4%) would join voluntary farming agreements prescribing no pesticide application. For DKK 1000 per
ha/year, a slightly larger fraction of 11% would join. At
DKK 2500 per ha, nearly 50% would join, but their willingness to sign voluntary farming contracts is much less than
evaluated by the expert (Rasmussen, 2003).
For water quality the final Bn showed that the probability of
polluting deep groundwater drops to below 5% with a compensation level of DKK 2500 per ha/year, given that only farming
contracts are implemented (no removal of point sources). If
both measures are taken the total effect (5% level) can be
achieved for a compensation payment of DKK 1000 per
ha/year (cost of removing point sources not included).
Shallow groundwater has very high probabilities of pesticide content above the Maximum Allowable Content (MAC)
(42% in current situation) and 33% (with farming contracts
at DKK 1500 per ha/year). Similar results were the outcome
for surface water. This is documented by findings of pesticides
in shallow groundwater and in the Havelse River.
The variable perception of vulnerability was included in
order to communicate disagreement and a special uncertainty
regarding the controlling factor vulnerability of the subsurface with respect to pesticide leaching (Henriksen et al.,
2004). This variable implies that some stakeholders and/or experts have the perception that pesticides in shallow groundwater will not spread to the deeper groundwater aquifers. Other
experts and stakeholders argue, that the opposite is more likely
to be the case, that it is a matter of time. There is an agreement
about the poor quality of the shallow groundwater and the
river, but the T-organisation is split up when it comes to the
overall outcome of the Bns.

5.4. Stakeholder involvement process
The case study had a project leading committee with four
members: two from GEUS (project leader and secretary) and
two from CE (project responsible for CE input and a process
specialist in stakeholder engagement). The group first met
when the case study was initiated in June 2001. In the following this group will be named the leadership group. The
group represented different perspectives about leadership,
both from experiences with the field of project leadership
but also experiences with stakeholder involvement in partnership building between CE and local communities.

There was considerable scientific knowledge about groundwater problems and comprehensive groundwater modelling.
By the start of the project we did not know anything about
Bns or how to apply Bns in a proper way, and which capacity
such models had. Before the primary task of testing Bns and
involving stakeholders in the construction, the leadership
group therefore spent some time with hands-on experiences
with the software Hugin Researcher.
The leadership group was a core group of the T-organisation,
which only consisted of these four members in the period from
June 2001 to November 2002. However, during this period
the leadership group formed the core of the subsequent

T-organisation by selecting a case study among different optional, balancing vision with strategy, looking for the whole
picture, and drawing a road map for the process.
The starting point was to identify stakeholders, additional
domain experts and to list categories of water users, potential
groundwater pollution sources, and authorities in the area: local waterworks, water consumers, farmers, industry, anglers,
county and municipalities. Draft evaluations of formal institutional arrangements (groundwater laws, decrees etc.) and other
institutional arrangements indirectly affecting groundwater
(e.g. health and agricultural policies) were discussed in the
leadership group.
A broad range of various management instruments was
evaluated (current groundwater user partnerships, innovative
instruments for groundwater protection) and current management results (groundwater allocation and use, quality of shallow and deep groundwater etc.) were initially identified.
However, at this point the informal institutional arrangements
(e.g. cultural and social norms and historical perceptions) in
the water sector in the case study was rather unknown, and
a local water user partnership had not been established dealing
with groundwater protection in the area. The leadership group
in this initial phase developed a first Bn for the purpose of informing stakeholders and the general public about different
management instruments and allow prediction of most likely

management results (e.g. groundwater quantity and quality
and exploitable resources). The preliminary network was
made up of three main branches:
 Management actions against urban pesticide sources (removal of urban point sources, use of pesticides on public
areas and use of pesticides in private gardens).
 Management actions against rural pesticide sources (instruments directed towards rural point sources, farm forestry, low use farming and set aside areas).
 Management actions related to groundwater use allocation
(well field renovation).
The purpose of this initial Bn was to allow an open dialogue at the subsequent kick-off meetings with stakeholders
providing a broad perspective and debate about various water
problems in the area.
Another important decision taken by the leadership group
was to identify and contract with a facilitator for the subsequent stakeholder meetings, which were planned for November 2002. A facilitator from the local joint municipality
Agenda-21-Centre was contracted to run the meetings of the
citizens group (representatives of the general public).
Two external subcontractors were contracted to deliver input for the Bn construction, e.g. farm economics (Rasmussen,

1110

H.J. Henriksen et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 22 (2007) 1101e1113

2003), value of biodiversity, land use, etc. (Schou, 2003). In
addition, the project drew on groundwater expertise from Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland/GEUS with respect
to groundwater monitoring data and modelling results from
comprehensive modelling.
The PP process was initiated by inviting all stakeholders
and professional stakeholder organisations with a potential interest in groundwater protection in the specific area to a oneday workshop in October 2002. One result of this workshop
was the formation of a professional, stakeholder-working
group with 10 institutions in addition to the members of the
leadership group and the facilitator. At the kick-off meeting
with the professional stakeholder the initial Bn was shown
but not discussed in details.
Since the case study was linked to a specific local area, the
Havelse well field capture zone area, and because involvement
of landowners and farmers is vital for groundwater protection,
the leadership group decided to involve the local citizens in
a citizens group, a parallel working group to the group of professionals. A public meeting was arranged in November 2002
in the local community house. Invitations were distributed to
around 1100 local households, and the meeting was announced in the local newspaper. Around 100 persons, and
the local TV, showed up for this meeting. At the end of the
meeting a local citizens group of 9 persons was formed.
The stakeholders were asked to present issues and problems
they found important in relation to groundwater protection.
The initial Bn was not presented at this meeting. Instead,
a small multi-choice test had been created that tested the
knowledge of the locals. A sheet containing 15 questions and
answers was to be filled in and returned before the correct answers were shown using an overhead projector and various
charts. After a short collaboration in breakout groups, the various groups displayed their different suggestions for groundwater protection and land use at Havelse well field catchment area.
The representatives of stakeholders were organised in two
different groups, the professional stakeholder group, and
local citizens stakeholder group. The idea behind the two
groups was the perception that the professional stakeholders
were already deeply involved in groundwater management
and protection, whereas local citizens might have another
starting point for their involvement in groundwater management and protection.
Three workshops in the professional group were held during 2003. At the first workshop the main topic was to get
stakeholder opinions on roles and responsibilities (in order
to map the formal institutional arrangements) and on consequences of different management instruments in active
groundwater protection. This had the dual purpose of creating
a common understanding (not consensus) within the group of
the different responsibilities and viewpoints among the stakeholders (a first input to informal institutional arrangements).
The following two workshops were dedicated to Bn development and included inputs from external experts, especially
from the expert in agricultural economics (including an initial
picture of other institutional arrangements e.g. agricultural
policy indirectly affecting groundwater).

The institutional framework defines the management instruments to be used and management instruments impact management results. Based on management results there is
a feed back into the system for reinforcement, adjustment
and refinement of institutional framework. Bns are an excellent tool for this dialogue process, because it is possible gradually to develop a network consisting of the most important
variables (and states) and to establish links and conditional
probability tables, which quantify relationships between management instruments and management results. And because
the Bns are developed with active involvement of stakeholders, it is also possible to incorporate the possible effects
of informal institutional arrangements (e.g. farmers that build
up a social norm that voluntary farming contracts against pesticides should not be contracted).
The three workshops were followed by individual meetings
with Frederiksborg County Council, Sjllandske Familielandbrug (Zealand Farmers Union) to collect more data for the
Bns, and to discuss the Bns in greater detail.
The citizens group met five times in the first half of 2003.
The idea was to give the group the opportunity to develop its
own identity without being influenced by professional stakeholders. A facilitator was attached to the citizens group to
help organise meetings and to produce a newsletter with information about progress in the project to the local community.
Two newsletters were published in the first half-year of 2003
and a third newsletter July 2004 introducing the members of
the citizens group to the general public and bringing papers
related to groundwater protection, water supply and water
quality. The newsletters were distributed to 1000 households
in the local area. GEUS and CE were invited to participate
in two of the five meetings to answer specific questions
from the citizens and to introduce and discuss the development
of the Bns.
At the final joint meeting in March 2004, the stakeholder
groups were asked to comment on the involvement process
on the basis of four questions: (1) Is there a need for further
initiatives for the protection of groundwater? (2) How have
you experienced project progress (Bns, citizens meeting,
workshops, citizen groups, newsletter, individual meetings,
etc.)? (3) How should stakeholders be involved in future in,
for example, active groundwater protection and the establishment of wetlands? and (4) Other comments to the process?
5.5. Positioning of stakeholders towards deep
groundwater quality
Both the professional stakeholder group and the citizens
group clearly expressed their opinions and concerns about water resource management and groundwater situation. This initial stage of stakeholder involvement was quite successful,
among other things because it resembles the Danish administrative system built on information dissemination and public
hearings, and the fact that groundwater abstraction, flooding
problems and a planned restoration of a wetland area had
been hot topics in the area during the past couple of years.
The Havelse well field was established in 1955e1956 and is

H.J. Henriksen et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 22 (2007) 1101e1113

on CEs investment plan from 2002 to 2006. Abstraction has
stopped in 2001 due to water quality problems as well as inundation problems. The well fields siphon system will be altered to a system based on individual centrifugal pumps in
each new borehole. The well field will most likely be moved
to a new location due to the Countys plans to establish new
wetlands in the area. Re-establishment of wetlands involve removal of drains and inundation of large areas in the downstream part of the river Havelse in order to reduce the total
discharge of nitrates from the catchment to the Fiord of
Roskilde.
The initial involvement of stakeholders during October and
November 2002 were followed by half-day workshops with
presentations and discussions in the first half-year of 2003.
In the process it became clear that it is important to use facilitators to run workshops because they are considered neutral
actors and are able to mediate between the parties involved
while the project leadership group members are considered
as stakeholders as well, especially when dealing with politically sensitive issues. The issue of what affects the quality
of deep groundwater is such a sensitive issue, because it is
very closely interlinked with drinking water quality (99% of
the drinking water supply is based on groundwater in Denmark). Similarly, it is the experience from the project that active involvement of stakeholders in the construction of Bns
and decision-making processes necessitates the existence of
clearly defined rules for participation.
Workshops and meetings with representatives from several
interest groups tended to become a political and tactical arena
rather than a forum of open discussion and were therefore not
very useful for more detailed discussions. This raised the question to which extent the professional group was dominated by
individual motives, interest group relations or coalition
groups relationships that developed during meetings.
If we compare our results with an ordinary SWOT
(Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis
for public participation, then we did not experience particular
strengths such as Brings our technical knowledge from the
public and others or Allows the public to understand the
system better. We did, however, identify issues not thought
of beforehand, the barriers towards voluntary farming contracts, which we had not expected. We had solely based our
work on expert assessments (e.g. the report from the Royal
Veterinary and Agricultural College).
An important statement about stakeholder engagement
based on our Danish case study experience is as follows:
The use of Bns goes beyond information and consultation
and requires the full involvement of stakeholders during the
implementation phase of a given action plan.
Bns are excellent for structural learning, strategic considerations, integration and breakdown of barriers between different domains. However, they can be difficult to understand
for non-experts, they are not useful for implementation of specific protection zones.
In the comments from the citizens group, the group believes that Bns are necessary tools in making complicated decisions. They also say that it is essential that specialists

1111

prepare the Bns, but that it is also an absolute necessity that
the citizens take part as well.
The citizens group felt that it was a shame that the outcome of the activities concerning stakeholder involvement
were not larger. The groups first impression was that the specialists did not want to involve themselves with the citizens.
At the final joint workshop in March 2004 only two groups
presented their comments: the citizens group and the farmers
organisations. Both groups positioned themselves against the
leadership group. The farmers organisation contested the
need for further groundwater protection on the large scale.
The organisation did, however, agree on establishment of
larger well field zones and active groundwater protection in
vulnerable zones. In other words a more pinpointed groundwater protection towards specific areas.
The citizens group had decided to continue with a group of
six or seven people under the title clean water. This group
had been reduced to the members who had expressed interest
in groundwater protection. The group felt they were very much
in opposition to the official representatives (CE and GEUS),
the county and other authorities to form common front actively opposed by the interests of the citizens group. Old
stories were given new life, the group felt that everything
had been arranged in advance between the official representatives and the other authorities participating in the project, and
that the citizens group would never stand a chance anyway, no
matter what.
The citizens group never made it to a real performing
phase. As a member of the group said it: Yes, it has been
nice, but also highly frustrating because the meetings lacked
structure and trailed off into a lot of local and personal problems. It was apparent, seeing the attempts of the meeting attendees to form a group, that all attempts to lead the group to
a greater degree were futile. There was a strong group process
that had its own inner logic, and in contrast to the professional
group, where members were representatives of organisations,
the members of the citizens group needed to achieve a kind
of consensus (at least that was what they thought). First at
the very last meeting in the citizens group, the group seemed
to acknowledge the leader they had selected (an organic
farmer). For some reason it was difficult for the citizens group
to take follow their selected leader.
Finally, two very important messages for the subsequent
WFD design phase came out of the joint meeting in March
2004. The farmers organisation (the strong leader of interest
group against farming contracts) agreed that voluntary farming
contracts is not the way forward, instead delineation of vulnerable groundwater areas should be the way forward and the waterworks should buy those vulnerable areas for groundwater
protection. They also told us that use of Bns was not sufficient
for the subsequent design phase and that more detailed modelling should be performed, based on comprehensive modelling.
In spite of a lot of frustration, there was a clear outcome of the
engagement of stakeholders.
Based on the voiced and written feedback from stakeholders, the Bns were adjusted with an additional variable,
the perception of vulnerability, in order to incorporate the

1112

splitting into the final networks, by an additional uncertainty
variable.
6. Conclusions
To be effective, groundwater protection strategies must win
broad-based support from stakeholders to be effectively implemented. But they must also not fall into the trap of endless
consultation at the expense of action. So mechanisms for negotiation and managing conflict are an important ingredient.
Bayesian networks comprise a tool that enables and supports decision makers to make rational and informed choices
between alternative actions, which are based on agreed policies, environmental impacts and social and economic consequences. Bns are excellent tools for quantification of the
whole picture, e.g. economics, hydrology, hydraulics, environmental and sociological impacts of various instruments and
offers a transparent, inclusive, coherent and equitable
methodology for dealing with groundwater management that
incorporates both formal and informal institutional arrangements (including social norms) of different stakeholder
groups.
Bayesian networks allow stakeholders divergent values, interests and beliefs to be surfaced and negotiated in participatory processes for areas where conventional physically based
groundwater models are insufficient due to lack of data,
knowledge, or mutual trust between parties. Social and ecological issues can be incorporated and coupled with hydrology.
Bns are excellent for strategic considerations and dialogue.
Expert knowledge and data can be combined. Algorithms for
structural learning based on data are available for analysis of
complex systems, or in cases where data sets are incomplete.
Finally, uncertainty can be dealt with in a very practical and
transparent way.
The Danish case study has documented that active involvement of stakeholders in construction and validation of Bns are
not only possible, but are imperative for a proper construction
of variables, selection of states, identification of links and
evaluation of numbers for the conditional probability tables.
The real strength and opportunity of Bns are to use this tool
in a participatory process in an interactive dialogue and negotiation process.
Hereby, public participation and Bns construction did make
use of local and citizens knowledge not known by the agency
and the experts. It did encourage diverse perspectives and
helped identify important issues not originally thought of. It
did enable a better and broader evaluation of the water issues.
It did not only integrate the various natural and social science
issues (hydrology, economy, ecology and informal institutional arrangements), but also provided the opportunity for
an open debate.
Public participation can be weakened by a lack of resources
(time, money, staff), a lack of rules of participation, a lack of
in-depth involvement of authorities, a lack of hands-on use of
Bns for the stakeholders, and a lack of professional supervision of the process. All these threats were at some time present
in the Danish case. In contrast to the professional stakeholders,

the citizens group did not participate as much as they wanted
to in the Bn construction but, in the end, they participated in
the evaluation of the outcome and provided valuable input to
data collection, unfolded uncertainty issues not incorporated,
etc. Even though there was a lack of rules for the participation,
much was learned from that case study experience. A better
training of stakeholders in the use of the tool would have
been an advantage, because it requires a new way of thinking
about the system to use Bns and probabilistic reasoning. It
could also have been helpful with a bit more professional supervision of the stakeholder involvement process, establishment of working groups, facilitation of meetings, etc. These
concerns call for the importance of carefully preparing a stakeholder involvement plan that addresses all these issues: rules
of the game, mission statements for working groups, time
schedule for important milestones, allocation of sufficient resources, etc.
There are some pitfalls that should be avoided when using
Bns. Bns are difficult to understand for non-experts without
any training. Bns can be malconstructed and should be reviewed by an experienced Bn expert for consistency. Bns require expert input and should not be constructed for domains
without such experts on board. Validation with participation
of experts, stakeholders and citizens are imperative in order
to increase the credibility of Bns. Skills in communication, organisation of participatory processes and practical psychological insight into group relations and human behaviour are vital.
Experts and non-expert stakeholders do not necessarily
agree, as happened in the Danish case study where the farmers
and hydrologists disputed the degree to which pesticide application affected the quality of deep groundwater. However, instead of selecting one opinion or another, the decision was
made to include both in the networks through the addition
of an extra variable with two states to represent the two different opinions. By adopting this course it was possible to view
the results from either point of view, accepting the reality of
the situation, not becoming mired in an insoluble conflict,
and laying the foundations for future compromises.
