Just one of todays standard tablet devices possesses the equivalent processing power of more than
5,000 desktop computers from the mid-1980s, the height of the NASA Space Shuttle programme.
Storing 1GB of data in 1997 would have cost you more than $10,000 a year; today it costs you
approximately $0.03. In 2001, the first human genome was sequenced. It took more than a decade
and cost $2.7 billion. Today, a genome can be sequenced in a few hours and for less than a
thousand dollars.1 The first App appeared in 2008 when Apple founder, Steve Jobs, enabled outside
developers to create applications for the iPhone. Today, not even a decade later, the app economy is
worth $1.3 trillion, more than the total revenue for the global pharmaceutical market. WhatsApp, which
was created in 2009, sends 55 billion messages a day.2 News about everything from celebrity gossip
to bad air quality now travels fast, and globally.
The Forum has termed this period of accelerating innovation in science and technology  the
transformative change in data and technology capabilities combined with a merging of digital, physical
and biological realms  and its impact on society as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It is not only
transforming social networks and scientific research, it is also radically reshaping the agenda for
industries, governments and the international community.
In the same way that the Fourth Industrial Revolution is reshaping healthcare, mobility and education
systems worldwide, it can reshape how the environmental community and its related institutions
work. Scientists tell us we are facing more, and more urgent, global environmental challenges than
ever before. This is despite all the international environmental agreements that have been established
since the 1970s. Environmental professionals are aware they cannot be complacent. The policybased and institutional approaches that worked 40 years ago are necessary, but no longer appear
sufficient on their own to manage our growing environmental challenges. While their goals and targets
are often sound, their ability to deliver the environmental outcomes required needs to be augmented.
As a result, there is increasing interest, and great potential, in exploring how the science, data and
technology innovations driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution could also be applied to improving
environmental and natural resource management arrangements. This includes through technology
and systems innovations that we might not yet even be able to imagine. If technology is starting to
transform how we look after our health, surely it can also be harnessed to help transform how we
look after our environment. For example, where is the wearable tech for measuring not only a persons
heart rate, but also the quality of the air they breathe?
There is also a growing realization that these rapid advances in science and technology could also
have unintended negative consequences on nature and people, which will need to be recognized,
managed and avoided. With new technology comes the need for improved and more agile
governance. For the Fourth Industrial Revolution to be the first fully sustainable industrial revolution,
an effective enabling environment (approaches that help governments create smart safeguards,
protocols, policies, and effective oversight and recourse mechanisms) needs to be put in place to
avoid any unintended consequences and to ensure that society and nature benefit from this revolution.
For example, if there were wearable sensors to measure the quality of the air people breathe, then
who would control access to the data that was collected and how would it be used?
Governments, civil society and industry have important roles to play to help answer these questions,
and develop principles and usage guidelines. A means of bringing stakeholders together to
co-develop ways that make the most of these science and technology developments is needed.
These will need to help us better understand and manage nature and our environment and avoid
creating negative or unforeseen outcomes. This focus on developing policy principles must run
alongside, and interact with, any acceleration programmes that promote the innovation and wider
deployment of science and technology for environmental management.
This is the heart of the challenge. In practical terms, how can the environmental sector be helped to
harness the science and technology revolution that is reshaping our wider economy and society so
that current arrangements can be enhanced to better manage the environmental systems that sustain
planet earth, given the increasing pressure nature faces from human activity? At the same time, how
can policy principles and protocols be developed for use across the environmental sector so that risks
from these new technologies to individuals, society or the environment itself are minimized and the
opportunities maximized.

Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution for the Earth

Humanitys current challenge

The great acceleration in human activity, particularly during
the 20th century, has delivered exponential economic
growth. Real output grew five-fold in the four centuries
to 1900, before accelerating more than 20-fold in the
20th century.3 The last 60 years, and the last 25 years in
particular, have witnessed a further acceleration in human
economic activity. Projections suggest that global economic
growth will average approximately 3% per annum in coming
decades. Although some economic commentators view this
as a slow growth world, this would still create a 20-fold
increase in the human economic footprint by the end of the
21st century, while a 4% growth rate would yield a 50-fold
increase.4
Previous economic growth has delivered impressive
improvements in human welfare. For example, since 1990
the world has reduced the number of people living on less
than $1.25 a day by one-half5, and witnessed approximately
700 million more people move into the rapidly expanding
global middle classes.6 The world is on track to meet the
(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)
OECDs 2010 forecast that the global middle class could
double by 2020 and triple by 2030.7
Human success in reducing global poverty levels and
expanding the middle class since the early 1990s has
also spurred a wider economic power shift in the global
economy.8 Emerging economies now account for more
than 40% of global GDP, doubling their share since 1990.
Analysts forecast that the emerging middle-income
economies and their rising middle classes could account for
close to 60% of global GDP by 20509; and more specifically,
that almost one-half the worlds GDP growth to 2025 will
come from 440 cities in emerging markets  cities such as
Kumasi (Ghana), Porto Alegre (Brazil) and Tianjin (China).10

A planet under stress
From an anthropocentric perspective, the last century
(particularly the last few decades) of human existence
has marked a very successful period for population and
economic growth.15 The recent past in particular, is a history
of markets working, as technologies have driven progress
and real commodity prices have fallen, despite a 20-fold
increase in demand of some resources.16 Based on the
human experience to date, no one seems to seriously doubt
the ingenuity of humans to meet the growth challenges
being forecast to 2030 and beyond. A world of continued
economic growth at levels of approximately 3% seems
achievable, if not a little lacking in ambition.
Yet, from an Earth systems perspective, the human success
story is not so positive.
Underpinning these extraordinary human advances has
been the consistently steady state of the Earths global
environmental systems provided by the so called Holocene
equilibrium. Global patterns of temperature, precipitation,
seasonality, and the overall health of our atmosphere,
cryosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere, have remained
predictable for much of the last 10,000 years. During this
period, they have functioned within a Goldilocks zone
 not too hot and not too cold  for humans.17 This has
provided a bio-physical environment conducive for humanity
to flourish. In the success story to date of human economic
history, the stability of global environmental systems has
been taken for granted, as if they will never, and can never,
be changed.18

Many argue that rapid urbanization has been the key to
this economic success story. The speed and scale of
the shift in human existence from rural to urban living for
todays millennial generation is extraordinary.11 In 1990,
approximately 2 billion people lived in an urban environment;
by 2014 this figure had almost doubled. By 2030, this
figure is forecast to be 5 billion.12 Today, there are 1,040
cities worldwide with more than 500,000 inhabitants, and
37 mega-cities with more than 10 million inhabitants.13 The
extraordinary difference in how most humans experience
their existence today, compared to even 1990 is profound,
especially when we consider that more than 40% of the
worlds population is under 25.14

Yet, the footprint of human impact on the Earths global
systems (particularly since the great acceleration of the
last 40 years) has generated much scientific concern.
Advances in recent decades in scientific monitoring and
data collection, processing and modelling has enabled
scientists to better assess and forecast the impact of human
development on environmental systems.19
The findings are worrying. As a result of the historical,
cumulative human footprint, many scientists research
suggests that the Earth could be entering a period of
unprecedented environmental systems change.20













Greenhouse gases. Todays greenhouse gas levels
may not have been seen for at least 3 million years.21
Biodiversity. The Earth is rapidly losing its biodiversity
at mass extinction rates, such that 70% of its genetic
biodiversity has become extinct.22
Deforestation. Current deforestation rates in the
Amazon Basin could lead to an 8% drop in regional
rainfall by 2050, triggering a shift to a savannah state,
with wider consequences for the Earths atmospheric
circulatory systems.23
Oceans. The chemistry of the oceans is changing
faster than at any point in perhaps 300 million years
because of the annual absorption of approximately
33% of anthropocentric greenhouse gas pollution.24
The resulting acidification and rising temperatures of the
ocean is having an unprecedented impact on corals and
fish stocks.25
Ice fields. Polar and glacial ice fields are retreating at
an alarming rate with potentially calamitous knock-on
effects for the wider water and climate systems.26 The
Arctic is now the fastest-warming region on the planet
and the resultant warmer air and water at the North
Pole is disturbing the predictability of the Gulf and the
Jet streams,27 which help to regulate the Earths climatic
circulatory system.
Nitrogen cycle. We are suffering from arguably the
largest and most rapid impact on the nitrogen cycle
for some 2.5 billion years, as widespread nitrogen and
phosphate pollution from poorly applied fertilizer has
washed into seas. This has affected fish stocks and
created so-called dead zones in 10% of the worlds
oceans.28
Water cycle. The global water cycle is facing
similarly severe impacts through over abstraction and
uncontrolled pollution, with related analysis suggesting
that the world may face a 40% shortfall in the freshwater
needed to support the global economy by 2030.29

These are wide-ranging and serious impacts on the Earths
systems resulting from human activity. Scientists are also
concerned that these impacts might even interconnect to
trigger cascading negative feedback loops, which could
flip the Earth system into a wholly new state. This would
likely be a period of environmental disequilibrium, something
far from the Goldilocks conditions that the Holocene has
provided for human activity to flourish over the last 10,000
years. The Forums 2017 Global Risks Report reflects these
concerns.30

Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution for the Earth

Facing the future
Against this disturbing environmental backdrop, todays
politicians and decision-makers are facing very real social
and economic pressures. As the world rapidly urbanizes,
more people than ever are demanding secure, safe and
affordable supplies of food and energy, personal mobility
and decent jobs.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
has estimated that global demand for food will increase
60% between 2006 and 2050.31 This will require the worlds
farmers to produce more food in the next 40 years than
they have done in the last 10,000 years.32 The International
Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts an increase in global energy
consumption of approximately 30% by 204033, with a 71%
increase in non-OECD economies.34 This will lead to a
34% rise in global energy-related CO2 emissions by 2040
compared to 2012.35 Meanwhile, the OECDs International
Transport Forum forecasts that there will be approximately
2.5 billion cars on the road by 2050, up from just over 1
billion today.36 Aircraft manufacturer, Boeing, estimates that
global demand for commercial airliners will reach almost
40,000 in the next two decades,37 which is double todays
total fleet.

In search of a new approach
The standard international model used in the past 40 years
to address our environmental problems has focused on
the power of national governments to deliver outcomes,
supported by international processes. For example, the
use of international conventions or frameworks either for
protection of areas on land and at sea, or to phase out
dumping and pollution. These have been negotiated and
agreed among the governments, while leeway has been
given at the national level on how each nation might honour
the particular framework. Typically, specialized public
funds and (often time-bound) protocols and targets, with
corresponding national voluntary plans, have augmented
these global conventions. There have been some notable
successes with this model, e.g. the Montreal Protocol
for ozone depleting substances agreed in 1987, recently
revised to also include HFCs.38
Arguably, however, and despite best efforts, in the
aggregate the environmental indicators of planetary health
have not improved. Things may be less bad than they
would have been without these various international efforts
since the 1970s, but the situation has still deteriorated, and
potentially, there is worse to come.

It could be argued that these models for fixing global
environmental challenges may have a few design
weaknesses when considered in the context of the mid21st century. To date, it has generally been officials in the
international environmental community who have designed
and negotiated international environmental conventions
and agreements. They have attempted to reactively try to
protect different parts of the global environment against the
effects of economic activity (pollution, degradation etc).39
As a result, they have tended towards the development
of expert and technical protocols (e.g. tackling hazardous
waste, mercury pollution and soil degradation) rather than
presenting themselves as platforms for action. Such
platforms could encourage a broader base of stakeholders
(private-sector, city leaders, investors, civil society etc)
to proactively try to transform those industrial or urban
systems that are creating pressure on the environment in
the first place. By effectively ghettoizing approaches for
environmental management within the official environmental
community, there has been limited engagement opportunity
for a broader group of stakeholders to partner in problem
solving. This model has arguably had the unintended
consequence of limiting innovation.40 This poses some
difficult questions, especially as the scale and complexity of
global environmental challenges seem to be getting worse
and becoming more urgent to resolve.
Albert Einstein said: The definition of insanity is doing the
same thing over and over again and expecting different
results. History would suggest that there will be insufficient
improvement in the global environment system if the
international environmental community only promotes more
of the same kinds of management models into the mid-21st
century. In addition to current strategies, what new forces
can also be harnessed to accelerate innovation and increase
the scale of action under way? What new models can also
be deployed to help fix environmental challenges? How can
these innovations be put-to-work in ways that complement
and strengthen existing international environmental
processes, goals and targets to reinvigorate (rather than
ignore or restart) the global environmental agenda as a
curator and driver of innovation?41

The Fourth Industrial Revolution

The shift in economic power and acceleration in middle
class growth, consumer demand and urbanization in recent
decades has coincided with extraordinary progress in
communications and technology. This has enabled societies
to become more connected and have more data available
to a degree impossible to conceive even just 25 years
ago at the time of the first Earth Summit. Sir Tim Berners
Lee created the first web server and browser in 1990 and
email barely existed in 1992.42 Now 46% of the worlds
population uses the internet and approximately 269 billion
emails are sent daily.43 In 2000, just 12% of the worlds
population had a cell phone subscription;44 by 2015 it was
63%.45 The rise of the smartphone means that mobile
internet traffic is accelerating at more than 60% per year;46
an astonishing growth rate when one considers exponential
trends. To this end, the smartphone has become
essential; in 2016 approximately 3.8 billion people had a
smartphone subscription, a figure that is projected to rise to
approximately 6 billion by 2021,47 with 90% of the growth
coming from emerging regions.48 A total of 87% of US
millennials say that the smartphone now never leaves their
side and 44% use their camera or video function daily.49
As technologies like smartphones are also becoming
increasingly powerful, common and connected, the merging
of digital, physical and biological realms is accelerating. For
example, wearable wellness technologies, which can help
monitor vital health and fitness signs, connect the wearer
with their doctor 24/7, and provide clouds of valuable
public health data for officials to monitor, process and run
predictive algorithms on, all at once.

Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution for the Earth

The Forum terms this explosion in access to a ubiquitous
and mobile internet, by smaller and more powerful sensors
that are becoming ever cheaper, and characterized by
artificial intelligence and machine learning as the Fourth
Industrial Revolution. Its potential to radically transform the
management of our environmental surroundings appears
boundless. For example, what if wearable technologies
could also monitor the quality of the air the wearer breathes,
or the quality of the water they are drinking, as well as the
rate of their heart?
Over and above the expansion of such personal data
gathering and  when scaled up  new networks and
movements that can leverage ever more powerful digital
platforms for social connectivity and environmental
information sharing, the internet of things (IoT) also offers
great potential for innovation in environmental management.
There are already approximately 8.3 billion connected
industrial devices covering products from cars, homes,
appliances and industrial equipment. Analysts suggest this
will reach more than 20 billion by 2020.50 When combined
with rapid advances in data processing and technology
innovation, IoT could help drive countless localized
initiatives. These could include smart street lighting and
energy efficient buildings,51 or even real-time city-wide
urban dashboards of interconnected environmental
information across buildings, transport systems and industry
enabling optimized energy, emissions and environmental
footprint management.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution also encompasses specific
clusters of transformative technologies such as artificial
intelligence (AI), robotics, additive manufacturing (or 3D
printing), neurotechnologies, drones and autonomous
vehicles, biotechnologies, virtual and augmented reality, and
blockchain, along with technologies and capabilities that
havent yet been created. All of these could offer profound
implications for innovative approaches to managing
environmental footprints. (A list of current Fourth Industrial
Revolution technology clusters most applicable for the
environment can be found in Annex I.)
The Fourth Industrial Revolution is, however, about more
than just identifying technology game-changers. It also
encapsulates the need for society to recognize and manage
the systems change that these technologies create. For
example, the arrival of the Spinning Jenny in 19th century
Britain not only revolutionized cloth manufacturing, but also
drove demand for child labour. Children were employed
to climb underneath the machines to fix difficult-to-access
parts when the loom broke. This prompted a revolution
in child labour laws and child protection legislation and
ultimately the right to childhood education, exemplifying a
wider societal systems change prompted by technology.

governments and the markets should have in place. These
will include policies to minimize the risks and maximize the
opportunities to society of the technology transformation.
This is particularly important for societys poorest
and weakest, who will require policies to support the
transformation in jobs or to ensure access to information.
It is also pertinent for protecting and managing the health
of the environment, which is a public good upon which
everyone depends. For example, if wearable technologies
start to capture personal data on exposure to air and water
quality levels, then questions will arise as to who should own
this aggregate personal information, who should be able to
access it and how might society best use it?
The challenge is to find the balance between exploring
the innovations that technology offers for improving the
environment, while developing ways and means to ensure
that risks are minimized and opportunities are maximized.
The next section looks at these issues in greater depth.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is also providing an
opportunity  and a need  to pre-emptively rethink
governance structures and to innovate to ensure they
are updated and purpose-built for the 21st century,
comprising the policies and protocols that societies feel their

A revolution for the environment

The potential to harness the Fourth Industrial Revolution to
help transform how humanity manages its environmental
footprint and, more fundamentally, to re-imagine how
human and economic systems might interact with the
natural world (e.g. through cities, transport and energy
networks, production and consumption systems, financial
markets and agricultural and industrial value chains) appears
potentially boundless. In exploring this transformation,
however, the debate needs to focus not just on
technological applications, but also on reshaping mindsets,
incentives, policies and institutions. This will be critical to
building inclusive, sustainable, resilient and ethical systems.
The following illustrations offer a glimpse of the breakthrough
transformations that are becoming available.

roads each day. In 2016, it is estimated that this avoided
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of 1.4 million tonnes
of CO2, along with providing the associated benefits of
reduced air and Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) pollution from
vehicle air conditioners. Today, there are 200,000 electric
cars in Didis fleet and this is set to rise to 1 million within
the decade.54 New public-private platforms are under
development to help cities in China share information locally
and globally about: how to enable car sharing to reduce
pollution; how to redesign city streets to enable these
innovations; and how to work with the car and truck industry
to accelerate production of electric vehicles designed for
passenger sharing/optimal logistics delivery and ready for
autonomous driving.

In transport

In product traceability

Advanced materials are close to enabling breakthroughs
in battery design and production, which could create
inexpensive, quick-charging and energy dense batteries that
would outperform internal combustion engines. The growing
market for electric cars is forecast to displace oil demand
by approximately 2 million barrels per day by 2025, rising
to 16 million by 2040. An oversupply of 2 million barrels
per day was attributed as triggering the major oil industry
downturn experienced during the last three years, which has
been described as the biggest in a generation.52 Meanwhile,
commentators have described moves to produce
autonomous vehicles as the new arms race.53 There is a
risk that technology, data, expertise and decision-making
will become concentrated in the hands of a relatively small
set of market leaders. Technology companies have become
direct competitors of traditional automotive companies, and
its the mobility services software, not the hardware, where
competition is most fierce. This creates a new governance
challenge, which spans multiple industry sectors and
technology sets and requires cooperation between the
public and private sectors.

Geospatial data monitoring platforms such as the Global
Forest Watch, Global Fishing Watch and Eyes on the Sea
utilize advanced sensors and satellite imagery, combined
with big data analytics, to enable anyone with a smartphone
to track and monitor activity within important environmental
systems. These are just the first releases  future iterations
could leverage AI, such as machine learning to forecast
where illegal fishing or logging is likely to occur. When
complemented by other Fourth Industrial Revolution
innovations, such as the ability to rapidly undertake DNA
sequencing of seafood products and bilge water from ships,
there is the potential to create greater transparency and
accountability from ocean to plate, giving consumers and
regulators confidence in the sustainability and legality of
products.

Through connected products and
services
The rapidly growing IoT network and capabilities hold
great promise. In China, the digital car-ride company, Didi,
receives more than 20 million orders daily, twice the number
of rides of all other markets in the world. Didi operates in
400 cities across China, engaging 17.5 million drivers, and
car-pools approximately 2 million passengers daily. This
pooling is taking approximately 1 million vehicles off the
10

Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution for the Earth

These platforms will generate, but also rely on, a wealth of
data gathered from multiple sources, potentially including
satellites, ships, ocean drones and DNA sequencing. As
part of this project, dialogue is already under way to explore
how alliances among data providers and data processors
can help them to better apply their collective efforts to the
challenge of environmental management.

On the blockchain
The potential of blockchain provides another good
example of what might be possible in terms of a wholesale
transformation in our approach to global environmental
commons management. Blockchain is a distributed ledger,
utilizing a secure protocol where a network of computers
can collectively verify a transaction before it can be recorded
and approved. It enables people who do not know each

other to collaborate without having to go through a neutral
central authority. It offers its users a shared, programmable,
secure and trusted ledger, which no single user controls
but which can be inspected by everyone. Blockchain was
the enabling technology for bitcoin. However, its potential
applicability for widespread use in other areas is just starting
to be realized. The Government of Sweden is already
exploring the potential of blockchain to help with land rights
management,55 while entrepreneurs are exploring similar
applications in Ghana, Georgia and Honduras.
Could a distributed ledger like blockchain play a role in
managing global greenhouse gas emissions? By 2030,
when most of the worlds households will have a least
one 3G cell phone and the global emissions trajectory
is expected to have stabilized, perhaps there could be
a worldwide blockchain for mobile carbon trading. The
technology would ensure a transparent system where
algorithms were used to assign every person on the planet
a science-based carbon budget, which people could
then trade. Such a system could potentially spur the next
generation of a global climate framework, removing the
political and institutional challenges that governments and
international regimes, frameworks and systems currently
face.56 It would also facilitate market-driven financial
flows to people in poorer nations who typically produce
fewer greenhouse emissions. Perhaps a blockchain-style
distributed ledger could also be used for managing water
allocations and deforestation.

In monitoring greenhouse gas
emissions
Rapid advances in satellites, drones and advanced sensors
 augmented by smart algorithms or AI technology  could
provide a real-time flow of data on GHG emissions, which
would then be relayed across the cloud to be tracked by
anyone from government officials to schoolchildren. This
would greatly improve the transparency of Monitoring,
Reporting and Verification (MRV) data, which is crucial for
the accountability and efficacy of global climate agreements.
The political implications could be transformative, as
could be similar real-time satellite and drone monitoring
of industrial GHG emissions for investors, insurers and
regulators. No longer would disclosure regimes rely on
companies choosing when and how to report. Instead, the
information would be available, possibly in the blockchain,
for all to see and to act upon.

In understanding the value of our
biodiverse inheritance
An unprecedented acceleration in science and technology
innovation is now helping researchers to map, sequence
and replicate biology on Earth in new ways. This uncharted
period of analysis may change societys perception of nature
from a commodity to be exploited to a unique endowment
that contains wholly new levels of value for society in the
future. For example, studies within the Amazon of the ant,
Eciton burchelli, using computational chemistry and AI
have identified that the species uses swarm intelligence to
ensure their worker ant army (numbering in the hundreds
of thousands) avoids traffic congestion. This is inspiring the
development in AI algorithms of autonomous, shared and
electric power transport systems.
The Earth Bio-Genome Project (EBP) aims to sequence
all the plants, animals and single-celled organisms (the
eukaryotic species) on Earth within 10 years, to help us
unlock the vast potential of our biodiversity inheritance. The
EBP will rely on innovative, multi-stakeholder collaborations
drawing on the science, research and ethics community,
governments and the private-sector. The EBP has the
potential to help redraw several components of the
Convention on Biodiversity by the COP in 2020, when
new targets need to be agreed. The Amazon Third Way
initiative is a project working in partnership with the Earth
Bio-Genome project to map the DNA of the Amazon Basin
(creating an Amazon Bank of Codes) to help create a proof
of concept for the wider EBG methodology. The Amazon
Bank of Codes will be an open, global digital platform,
which registers and maps the genetic sequences of Amazon
biodiversity. It will also register biological and biomimetic
IP assets on blockchain, providing a regulatory platform to
help implement the fair sharing of benefits as intended by
the 2017 Nagoya Protocol, which governs access to genetic
resources.
These are just a few examples of the ways Fourth Industrial
Revolution innovations in science and technologies could be
applied to transform current approaches to environmental
issues. Much more work is needed to explore and refine the
possibilities. Further help will also be required to scale those
applications that are already available.

Risks as well as opportunities

For all the potential of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it also
poses many and various risks.
A widespread digital revolution in the global environment
seems just around the corner57 and data will be an
increasingly prized asset, but there are important questions
to be resolved about who owns and has access to which
pieces of data. If environmental data becomes proprietary
(either by design or default) this could limit access for those
wishing to develop applications for the public good (whether
for profit or not-for-profit). Disconnected platforms and
competing networks of data provision may also emerge,
each using their own data protocols and standards. To
ensure data can be accessed and utilized effectively for
innovative environmental applications, it will be important to
ensure interoperability. Common protocols and standards
may need to be created. New market and finance models
may also be required, along with new or augmented roles
for international environmental organizations. Could such
organizations become the curators of global environmental
information? If so, how will this work? How can they change
their culture to attract the public- and private-technology
talent they will need to keep abreast of the latest technology
developments, remain cyber secure, and curate global
platforms of environmental data? How will they avoid being
seen as monopolies holding our earth system data for their
own purposes, rather than being platforms for promoting
widespread and open innovation? These big questions will
need addressing.

Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution for the Earth

Many of the Fourth Industrial Revolution innovations that
hold great promise for disrupting how we manage the
global environmental commons may also pose great
risks, particularly if not implemented with the support of
appropriate governance systems. For example, rich new
streams of information about ocean conditions and fish
stocks can help improve the sustainable management of
ocean resources, in line with the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). This same data could also radically improve
the transparency and traceability of legally fished seafood
products, providing new tools in the fight against illegal
fishing, which represents an annual theft of $23 billion.58
However, if an international organization that hosted this
data was hacked, these same data innovations could enable
even more intensive illegal fishing by helping unregistered
and unreported boats to find prime target stocks and
escape enforcement. Similarly, tech-savvy poachers could
access new sources of data on the location and habitats
of protected species; on land, some poachers are already
using geo-tagged photos posted on social media sites by
tourists to locate endangered animals.59

Building the right enabling
environment is critical

Realizing the opportunities available while also effectively
managing potential risks will not happen automatically.
Proactive, collaborative processes with policy-makers,
scientists, civil society and technology champions will be
required so that commonly agreed policies and protocols
are developed and trialled concurrent to the acceleration
and adoption of new technologies for environmental
management and improvement.

The speed of innovation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution
means these partnerships and platforms to develop
protocols and governance systems need to be developed
early. This needs to take place in conjunction with the
development of the technologies themselves, rather than
as a reactive afterthought. Partnerships and platforms also
need to remain agile, and able to adapt and change policies
and protocols as nimbly as the technology itself evolves.

The following kinds of collaborations will be particularly
important:

There is a unique opportunity to harness the Fourth
Industrial Revolution, and the societal shifts it triggers,
to help reimagine the models for how we manage our
shared global environment and natural resources. If we
get the design of both the technology applications and the
enabling environment right, there is huge potential for
a revolution in managing our environmental future. It will,
however, require a significant effort in public-private and civil
society collaboration, and it will redraw many of the current
issue and institutional boundaries of who feels responsible
for what, in todays global environment community. It will
also require the environmental community to open up and
engage many different actors into a multistakeholder agenda
to help manage our global environmental commons. This
may be challenging, but given the pressure the Earths
systems are under, the global community cannot afford not
to try.







Dialogues and partnerships that bring
technology developers and providers together
with environmental experts to co-develop these
innovations and to ensure they are developed for the
public good, while minimizing risks of unintended
environmental consequences.
Innovative investment platforms, financing
structures, and business models that can accelerate
the scaling of promising environmental innovations,
regardless of whether they have a clear commercial
proposition or are less profitable public good
applications.
Partnerships with governments and international
institutions to enable the development of common
and agile governance systems, including the
championing of common policy principles for managing
new technologies (e.g. those recently developed for
the G20), and the development of specific policy
frameworks and protocols, transparency mechanisms,
and equity related checks and balances for particular
use case examples.

About the Fourth Industrial Revolution for the Earth
Initiative
The World Economic Forum is collaborating with PwC (as
official project adviser) and the Stanford Woods Institute for
the Environment on a major global initiative on the Fourth
Industrial Revolution for the Earth. Working closely with
leading issue experts and industry innovators convened
through the World Economic Forums Global Future Council
on the Environment and Natural Resource Security, and with
support from the MAVA Foundation, this initiative combines
the platforms, networks and convening power of the Forum
and its new Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in
San Francisco. It also brings Stanford Universitys cutting
edge research departments and connections with the
Silicon Valley technology community together with the global
insight and strategic analysis on business, investment and
public-sector issues that PwC offers. Together with other
interested stakeholders, this unique partnership is exploring
how Fourth Industrial Revolution innovations could help
drive a systems transformation across the environment and
natural resource security agenda.

Annex I
List and description of Fourth Industrial
Revolution technology clusters most
relevant for environmental applications

Fourth Industrial Revolution technology clusters
The following descriptions60 are provided as background
and are not intended to be exhaustive.


3D Printing. Additive manufacturing techniques used
to create three-dimensional objects based on printing
successive layers of materials.



Advanced Materials (including nanomaterials). A
set of nanotechnologies and other material science
technologies, which can produce materials with
significantly improved or completely new functionality,
including lighter weight, stronger, more conductive
materials, higher electrical storage (e.g. nanomaterials,
biological materials or hybrids).



Artificial Intelligence. Computer science learning
algorithms capable of performing tasks that normally
require human intelligence and beyond (e.g. visual
perception, speech recognition and decision-making).



Robotics. Electro-mechanical, biological and hybrid
machines enabled by AI that automate, augment or
assist human activities, autonomously or according to
set instructions.



Drones & autonomous vehicles. Enabled by robots,
autonomous vehicles can operate and navigate with
little or no human control. Drones fly or move in water
without a pilot and can operate autonomously or be
controlled remotely.



Biotechnologies. Encompassing bioengineering,
biomedical engineering, genomics, gene editing, and
proteomics, biomimicry, and synthetic biology this
technology set has applications in areas like energy,
material, chemical, pharmaceutical, agricultural and
medical industries.





Energy capture, storage, and transmission. New
energy technologies range from advanced battery
technologies through to intelligent virtual grids, organic
solar cells, spray-on solar, liquid biofuels for electricity
generation and transport, and nuclear fusion.
Blockchain (and distributed ledger). Distributed
electronic ledger that uses cryptographic software
algorithms to record and confirm immutable
transactions and/or assets with reliability and anonymity.

It has no central authority and allows for automated
contracts that relate to those assets and transactions
(smart contracts).


Geo-engineering. Large-scale, deliberate interventions
in the Earths natural systems to, for example, shift
rainfall patterns, create artificial sunshine or alter
biospheres.



Internet of things. A network of advanced sensors and
actuators in land, air, oceans and space embedded with
software, network connectivity and computer capability,
which can collect and exchange data over the internet
and enable automated solutions to multiple problem
sets.



Neurotechnologies. Technologies that enable humans
to influence consciousness and thought through
decoding what they are thinking in fine levels of detail
through new chemicals that influence brains for
enhanced functionality and enable interaction with the
world in new ways.



New computing technologies. This includes
technologies such as quantum computing, DNAbased solid state hard drives and the combining of
Third Industrial Revolution technologies (e.g. big data,
cloud) with the other technologies (e.g. IoT, advanced
sensor platforms). Quantum computers make direct
use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as
entanglement to perform large-scale computation
of a particular class of currently impossible tasks by
traditional computing approaches.



Advanced sensor platforms (including satellites).
Advanced fixed and mobile physical, chemical and
biological sensors for direct and indirect (remote
sensing) of myriad environmental, natural resource
and biological asset variables from fixed locations or
in autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles in land,

Annex II
The Fourth Industrial Revolution for the
Earth initiative

The Fourth Industrial Revolution for the Earth initiative is
designed to raise awareness and accelerate progress
across this agenda for the benefit of society. In the first
phase of the project, specific environmental focus areas will
be considered in depth, exploring in detail how to harness
Fourth Industrial Revolution innovations to better manage
the worlds most pressing environmental challenges. Initial
focus areas will include:








Air pollution
Biodiversity
Cities
Climate change and greenhouse gas monitoring
Food systems
Oceans
Water resources and sanitation

Working from these thematic areas the Forum, supported
by Stanford University and PwC (as project adviser), and
advised by the members of the Global Future Councils on
the Future of Environment and Natural Resource Security
and specific Fourth Industrial Revolution clusters, will seek
to leverage their various networks and platforms to:








Develop a set of insight papers, taking a deep dive
into the possibilities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution
and each of these issues.
Build new networks of practitioners and support
them to co-design and innovate for action on the
environment in each of these issue areas, leveraging
the latest technologies and research that the Fourth
Industrial Revolution offers.
Design a public-private accelerator for action,
enabling both government, foundational, research,
organization and commercial funds to be pooled and
deployed into scaling innovative Fourth Industrial
Revolution solutions for the environment.
Help government stakeholders to develop and trial
the requisite policy protocols that will help Fourth
Industrial Revolution solutions for the environment take
hold and develop.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution for the Earth initiative will be
driven jointly out of the World Economic Forum Center for
the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco and other
Forum offices in New York, Geneva and Beijing.

Arguably, the exceptions that potentially prove this rule have been
the public-private orientation of the Montreal Protocol since 1987 to
help promote industry wide innovation; and the more recent action
agenda on Climate Change that the Governments of Peru and France
with the support of the UNFCCC promoted to help muster a wave of
innovation and complementary actions from more than just national
governments alone, to help support and shape the Paris Agreement on
Climate Change and its delivery through to 2020.
