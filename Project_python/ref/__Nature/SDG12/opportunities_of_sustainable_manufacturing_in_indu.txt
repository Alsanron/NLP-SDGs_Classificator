Abstract
The current globalization is faced by the challenge to meet the continuously growing worldwide demand for capital and consumer goods by
simultaneously ensuring a sustainable evolvement of human existence in its social, environmental and economic dimensions. In order to cope
with this challenge, industrial value creation must be geared towards sustainability. Currently, the industrial value creation in the early
industrialized countries is shaped by the development towards the fourth stage of industrialization, the so-called Industry 4.0. This development
provides immense opportunities for the realization of sustainable manufacturing. This paper will present a state of the art review of Industry 4.0
based on recent developments in research and practice. Subsequently, an overview of different opportunities for sustainable manufacturing in
Industry 4.0 will be presented. A use case for the retrofitting of manufacturing equipment as a specific opportunity for sustainable
manufacturing in Industry 4.0 will be exemplarily outlined.

1. Introduction
The industrial value creation in the early industrialized
countries is currently shaped by the development towards the
fourth stage of industrialization, the so-called Industry 4.0.
This development follows the third industrial revolution
which started in the early 1970s and was based on electronics
and information technologies for realizing a high level of
automation in manufacturing [1].
The development towards Industry 4.0 has presently a
substantial influence on the manufacturing industry. It is
based on the establishment of smart factories, smart products
and smart services embedded in an internet of things and of
services also called industrial internet [2]. Additionally, new
and disruptive business models are evolving around these
Industry 4.0 elements [1,3].
This development towards an Industry 4.0 provides
opportunities
for
realizing
sustainable
immense
manufacturing using the ubiquitous information and
communication technology (ICT) infrastructure. This paper
will present a state of the art review of Industry 4.0 based on
recent research and practice. Wherein, the macro and micro

perspectives of Industry 4.0 will be visualized and analyzed.
Subsequently, approaches to sustainable manufacturing are
combined with the requirements of Industry 4.0 and an
overview of opportunities for sustainable manufacturing in the
macro and micro perspectives will be presented. Finally, a use
case for retrofitting of equipment as a specific opportunity for
sustainable manufacturing in Industry 4.0 will be exemplarily
outlined.
2. State of the Art
The main ideas of Industry 4.0 have been firstly published
by KAGERMANN in 2011 [4] and have built the foundation
for the Industry 4.0 manifesto published in 2013 by the
German National Academy of Science and Engineering
(acatech) [1]. At European level, the Public-Private
Partnership (PPP) for Factories of the Future (FoF) addresses
and develops Industry 4.0-related topics [5]. The contents of
Industry 4.0 in the US are promoted by the Industrial Internet
Consortium (ICC) [6].

T. Stock and G. Seliger / Procedia CIRP 40 (2016) 536  541

The paradigm of Industry 4.0 is essentially outlined by
three dimensions [3, 7, 8]: (1) horizontal integration across the
entire value creation network, (2) end-to-end engineering
across the entire product life cycle, as well as (3) vertical
integration and networked manufacturing systems.
The horizontal integration across the entire value creation
network describes the cross-company and company-internal
intelligent cross-linking and digitalization of value creation
modules throughout the value chain of a product life cycle
and between value chains of adjoining product life cycles [7].
The end-to-end engineering across the entire product life
cycle describes the intelligent cross-linking and digitalization
throughout all phases of a product life cycle: from the raw
material acquisition to manufacturing system, product use,
and the product end of life [7].
Vertical integration and networked manufacturing systems
describes the intelligent cross-linking and digitalization within
the different aggregation and hierarchical levels of a value
creation module from manufacturing stations via
manufacturing cells, lines and factories, also integrating the
associated value chain activities such as marketing and sales
or technology development [7].
The intelligent cross-linking and digitalization covers the
application of an end-to-end solution using information and
communication technologies which are embedded in a cloud.
In a manufacturing system, the intelligent cross-linking is
realized by the application of so-called Cyber-Physical
Systems (CPS) which are operating in a self-organized and
decentralized manner [7, 9, 10]. They are based on embedded
mechatronic components i.e., applied sensor systems for
collecting data as well as actuator systems for influencing
physical processes [9]. CPS are intelligently linked with each
other and are continuously interchanging data via virtual
networks such as a cloud in real-time. The cloud itself is
implemented in the internet of things and services [7]. Being
part of a sociotechnical system, CPS are using humanmachine-interfaces for interacting with the operators [11].

2.1. The Macro Perspective of Industry 4.0
The macro perspective of Industry 4.0 as shown in Figure
1 covers the horizontal integration as well as the end-to-end
engineering dimension of Industry 4.0. This visualization is
based on a strong product-life-cycle-related point of view by
putting cross-linked product life cycles as central element of
the value creation networks in Industry 4.0.
The horizontal integration from the macro perspective is
characterized by a network of value creation modules. Value
creation modules are defined as the interplay of different
value creation factors i.e., equipment, human, organization,
process and product [12]. The value creation modules,
represented in their highest level of aggregation by factories,
are cross-linked throughout the complete value chain of a
product life cycle as well as with value creation modules in
value chains of adjoining product life cycles. This linkage
leads to an intelligent network of value creation modules
covering the value chains of different product life cycles. This
intelligent network provides an environment for new and
innovative business models and is thus currently leading to a
change in business models.
Displayed in Figure 1, the end-to-end engineering from the
macro perspective is the cross-linking of stakeholders,
products and equipment along the product life cycle,
beginning with the raw material acquisition phase and ending
with the end-of-life phase. The products, the different
stakeholder such as customers, workers or suppliers, and the
manufacturing equipment are embedded in a virtual network
and are interchanging data in and between the different phases
of a product life cycle. This life cycle consists of the raw
material acquisition phase, the manufacturing phase containing the product development, the engineering of the
related manufacturing system and the manufacturing of the
product - the use and service phase, the end-of-life phase containing reuse, remanufacturing, recycling, recovery and
disposal - as well as the transport between all phases.

Those value creation modules i.e., factories which are
embedded in this ubiquitous flow of smart data will evolve to
so called smart factories. Smart factories are manufacturing
smart products and are being supplied with energy from smart
grids as well as supplied with water from fresh water
reservoirs. The material flow along the product life cycle and
between adjoining product life cycle will be accomplished by
smart logistics. The stream of smart data between the different
elements of the value creation networks in Industry 4.0 is
interchanged via the cloud.
Smart data arises by expediently structuring information
from big data which then can be used for knowledge advances
and decision making throughout the product life cycle [13].
Smart factories are using embedded Cyber-Physical Systems
for value creation. This enables the smart product to selforganize its required manufacturing processes and its flow
throughout the factory in a decentralized manner by
interchanging smart data with the CPS [14].

The smart product holds the information about its
requirements for the manufacturing processes and
manufacturing equipment. Smart logistics are using CPS for
supporting the material flow within the factory and between
factories, customers, and other stakeholders. They are also
being controlled in a decentralized manner according to the
requirements of the product. A smart grid dynamically
matches the energy generation of suppliers using renewable
energies with the energy demand of consumers, e.g. smart
factories or smart homes, by using short-term energy storages
for buffering. Within a smart grid, energy consumers and
suppliers can be the same.
2.2. The Micro Perspective of Industry 4.0
The micro perspective of Industry 4.0 presented in Figure 2
mainly covers the horizontal integration as well as the vertical
integration within smart factories but it also is part of the endto-end engineering dimension.

Fig. 2. Micro perspective of Industry 4.0

Table 1 provides an overview of the main trends and
expected development for the different value creation factors
in Industry 4.0.
Table 1. Trends and expected developments for the value creation factors
Equipment

The manufacturing equipment will be characterized by the
application of highly automated machine tools and robots. The
equipment will be able to flexibly adapt to changes in the other value
creation factors, e.g. the robots will be working together
collaboratively with the workers on joint tasks [2].
The current jobs in manufacturing are facing a high risk for being
automated to a large extent [16]. The numbers of workers will thus
Human

decrease. The remaining manufacturing jobs will contain more
knowledge work as well as more short-term and hard-to-plan tasks
[10]. The workers increasingly have to monitor the automated
equipment, are being integrated in decentralized decision-making,
and are participating in engineering activities as part of the end-toend engineering.
The increasing organizational complexity in the manufacturing
Organization

system cannot be managed by a central instance from a certain point
on. Decision making will thus be shifted away from a central
instance towards decentralized instances. The decentralized instances
will autonomously consider local information for the decisionmaking [14]. The decision itself will be taken by the workers or by
the equipment using methods from the field of artificial intelligence.
Additive manufacturing technologies also known as 3D printing will
be increasingly deployed in value creation processes, since the costs
Process

of additive manufacturing have been rapidly dropping during the last
years by simultaneously increasing in terms of speed and precision
[17]. This allows designing more complex, stronger, and more
lightweight geometries as well as the application of additive
manufacturing to higher quantities and larger scales of the product
[17].
The products will be manufactured in batch size one according to the
individual requirements of the customer [7]. This mass customization
Product

The smart factory as value creation module at the highest
aggregation level contains different value creation modules on
lower aggregation levels such as the manufacturing lines,
manufacturing cells or manufacturing stations. Smart factories
will increasingly use renewable energies as part of a selfsufficient supply in addition to the supply provided by the
external smart grid [18]. The factory will thus become an
energy supplier and consumer at the same time. The smart
grid as well as the energy management system of the smart
factory will have to be able to handle the dynamic
requirements of energy supply and feedback. The supply of
fresh water for the value creation modules within the smart
factory is also another essential resource flow, requiring
adequate and intact water reservoirs.
The horizontal integration from the micro perspective is
characterized by the cross-linked value creation modules
along the material flow of the smart factory also integrating
the smart logistics. The in- and outbound logistics from and to
the factories as part of the smart logistic will be characterized
by transport equipment that is able to agilely react to
unforeseen events such as a change in traffic or weather and
which is able to autonomously operate between the starting
point and the destination. Autonomously operating transport
equipment such as Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) will
be used for realizing the in-house transport along the material
flow. All transport equipment is interchanging smart data with
the value creation modules in order to realize a decentralized
coordination of supplies and products with the transport
systems. For this purpose, the supplies and products contain
identification systems, e.g. RFID chips or QR codes. This
enables a wireless identification and localization of all
materials in the value chain.
Vertical integration and networked manufacturing systems
from the micro perspective describes the intelligent crosslinking of the value creation factors: product, equipment and
human, along the different aggregation levels of the value
creation modules from manufacturing stations via
manufacturing cells and manufacturing lines up to the smart
factory. This networking throughout the different aggregation
levels also includes the cross-linking of the value creation
modules with the different value chain activities, e.g.
marketing and sales, service, procurement, etc. [15].
The value creation module in a factory corresponds to an
embedded Cyber-Physical-System. The manufacturing
equipment, e.g. machine tools or assembly tools, are using
sensor systems for identifying and localizing the value
creation factors, such as the products or the humans, as well
as for monitoring the manufacturing processes, e.g. the
cutting, assembly, or transport processes. Depending on the
monitored smart data, the applied actuators in the
manufacturing equipment can react in real-time on specific
changes of the product, humans or processes. The
communication and exchange of the smart data between the
value creation factors, between the value creation module and
the transport equipment, as well as between the different
levels of aggregation and the different value chain activities is
being executed via the cloud.

of the product integrates the customer as early as possible in the
value chain. The physical product will be also combined with new
services offering functionality and access rather than product
ownership to the customer as part of new business models [17].

3. Sustainability in Industry 4.0
A paradigm Industry 4.0 will be a step forward towards
more sustainable industrial value creation. In current
literature, this step is mainly characterized as contribution to
the environmental dimension of sustainability. The allocation
of resources, i.e. products, materials, energy and water, can be
realized in a more efficient way on the basis of intelligent
cross-linked value creation modules [2].

539

T. Stock and G. Seliger / Procedia CIRP 40 (2016) 536  541

Besides these environmental contributions, Industry 4.0
holds a great opportunity for realizing sustainable industrial
value creation on all three sustainability dimensions:
economic, social and environmental. Table 2 summarizes the
opportunities of sustainable manufacturing for the macro
perspective of Industry 4.0. Table 3 gives an overview of the
opportunities for the micro perspective. The concepts
presented in both tables merge the most important approaches
of sustainable manufacturing in current literature with the
trends and developments related to Industry 4.0.

Humans will still be the organizers of value creation in Industry 4.0 [8].
Three different sustainable approaches can be used for coping with the
social challenge in Industry 4.0. (1) Increasing the training efficiency of
workers by combining new ICT technologies, e.g. virtual reality headmounted displays with Learnstruments. (2) Increasing the intrinsic

[10]. Retrofitting can thus be used as an approach for realizing a CPS
throughout a value creation module, such as a factory, with already
existing manufacturing equipment. It extends the use phase or
facilitates the application in a new use phase for the manufacturing
equipment and can essentially contribute to the economic and
environmental dimensions of sustainability. It is particularly suitable
for small and medium sized companies, being a low-cost alternative to
the new procurement of manufacturing equipment.

The objective of this use case has been the development of
a retrofitting solution for a desktop machine tool within the
laboratory of sustainable manufacturing of the Collaborative
Research Centre 1026 at TU Berlin. The method for
developing the retrofitting solution covers four sequential
steps: (1) situation analysis, (2) definition of the monitoring
strategy, (3) data processing and (4) implementation of the
equipment in a CPS.
The situation analysis includes the definition of the list of
requirements. In this case, the retrofitting solution is supposed
to monitor the existing operational states of the equipment:
shut on/off, idling, processing and fault. It also should be easy
to install as well as cost effective.
Additionally, the situation analysis focuses on the selection
of the sensor system according to the list of requirements.
In terms of the use case, an acceleration sensor has met the
requirements appropriate.

The definition of the monitoring strategy contains the
definition of the measuring parameters, the definition of the
monitoring position and orientation of the sensor, the
application of the sensor as well as the execution of the
measurement. For the use case, a Beckhoff PLC has
transformed the analog signals of the acceleration sensor into
digital signals for the subsequent data processing.
The data processing evaluates the input data according to a
predefined logic in order to identify the different operational
states. The visualization of the data has been realized by a
Human-Machine-Interface, which displays the current
operational state as well as the measured vibration profile of
the machine tool. Figure 3 shows the experimental setup of
the milling machine, sensor and HMI.
This milling machine can now be implemented in a CPS.
In connection with a smart product the retrofitted machine can
decentrally schedule the material flow and is furthermore able
to automatically react to any machine failures by e.g.
informing the responsible worker.

5. Summary and conclusion
In this paper a state of the art review for the current
industrial development know as Industry 4.0 has been
presented. In order to give a comprehensive understanding of
this development, the micro and macro perspective of
Industry 4.0 have been described based on the current
findings in research and practice. Subsequently, different
opportunities for realizing a sustainable manufacturing in
Industry 4.0 have been presented for the macro as well as for
the micro perspectives. These opportunities are combining
current research approaches in the field of sustainable
manufacturing with the future requirements of Industry 4.0.
Finally, a use case for retrofitting of a machine tool as a
specific opportunity for sustainable manufacturing in Industry
4.0 has been outlined.
