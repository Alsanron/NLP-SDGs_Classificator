The competition for marine space is a recognized challenge, and the implementation of new activities, such as
those emerging from Blue Growth initiatives, may amplify this competition. The marine spatial planning (MSP)
framework requires decision makers to analyse spatially explicit environmental and socio-economic data to
determine where user conicts are or might emerge and consider several potential management scenarios. In the
present research, a spatially explicit Bayesian belief network (BBN) was applied for this purpose. The BBN was
developed to analyse the potential reallocation of artisanal shing eort to alternative sites due to the introduction of a new, non-take area: an oshore aquaculture site along the Basque continental shelf. The constructed model combined discrete, operational sheries data, continuous environmental data, and expert
judgment to produce shing activity suitability maps for three dierent mtiers (longlines, nets and traps). The
BBN was run with various eort reallocation scenarios for each metier, and the best alternative shing locations
were identied based on environmental suitability, past revenue, and past shing presence. The closure had a
lesser eect on net and longline activity, displacing 10% and 7% of local shing eort respectively.
Comparatively, 50% of all local eort by traps took place within the closed grounds, and few alternative sites
were identied. Nets were found to have the greatest number of alternative shing grounds surrounding the
aquaculture site. The present research demonstrates how BBNs can support spatially explicit scenario building
and user-user conict analysis for sustainable and successful ecosystem-based marine spatial planning.

1. Introduction
1.1. Emerging conicts and marine spatial planning
Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) provides decision makers a general
framework for managing activities over time and space. However,
managers are confronted with the considerable task of designing, selecting and adapting spatial plans that are socially, economically and
ecologically balanced. In MSP, maritime activities that would traditionally be regulated within independent sectors on a case-by-case basis
are managed in the context of the entire ecosystem [1], so as to maximize sustainable development and minimize human impacts on placebased resources [2]. In order to develop these plans, decision makers
rely on tools that allow them not only to centralize and integrate
multiple types of spatial information [3], but also to analyse potential
spatial scenarios, and make informed decisions about future resource
allocation for activities that are likely to conict [4,5].



Within the framework of MSP, two types of spatial conict are cited:
user-environment conicts, and user-user conicts [2]. The former
describes the impact of human activity on the environment, from the
depletion of natural resources (e.g. overshing) to pollution and the
destruction of habitats [6]. Comparatively, user-user conicts may arise
when multiple sectors, such as sheries, tourism and energy, seek to use
natural resources at the same time and in the same space. As states
continue to support traditional maritime activities, in addition to developing innovative ways to use marine resources, the competition for
marine space increases [79]. Coastal regions are particularly sensitive
to conicts among users because they are highly productive and increasingly exploited, providing more annual value in ecosystem services than the global ocean in roughly one tenth of the area [10,11].
The European Commission denes Blue Growth as a strategy to
support novel, sustainable uses of oceanic and coastal resources for new
jobs and markets, while maintaining healthy marine ecosystems
[12,13]. However, the European Union aquaculture sector has

new aquaculture site. This analysis was undertaken by developing a
spatially explicit BBN and by using the Basque continental shelf (SE Bay
of Biscay) as case study. The research team created and employed a
model that could be used to analyse spatially explicit management
scenarios based on the fewest number of relevant environmental and
sheries activity variables. In order to achieve this aim, the following,
specic objectives were established: (i) collation of available geospatial
data; (ii) determination of the relevant variables for the model; (iii)
creation of a conceptual diagram; (iv) implementation of the conceptual
model in BBN software; (v) denition of scenarios according to present
and future conditions; and (vi) analysis of the resulting shing activity
relocation options for the established scenarios.

exhibited unstable growth rates over the past several years compared to
markets in Asia and South America, and aquaculture products on the
whole still only account for 26% of EU seafood consumption [14]. This
limited development may be due in part to site carrying capacity, strong
market competition from imports, and restrictive administrative processes [1517], but also to the competition for space at the local level
[18], as may be the case in the Basque Country.
The Basque Country, like many regions throughout Europe, has
continued to transform its use of the coastal ocean in recent decades. In
addition to supporting more traditional sectors, such as commercial
sheries (purse seine, trawl and artisanal sheries), tourism, and recreation, the Basque Country has committed to a number of Blue
Growth initiatives, including marine renewable energy production [19]
and aquaculture [20]. The Basque Government has recognized oshore
aquaculture as a potential solution for the increasing demand for local
seafood products and overall resource stagnation [21]. However, due to
certain restrictions and requirements (e.g. specic ecological, bathymetric and wave energy conditions) [22,23], oshore aquaculture developments may be limited to a few available areas along the coast, and
such suitable locations may coincide with areas where other activities
may already be well established. Thus, managers must be able to analyse the compatibility of activities that might conict and consider
opportunities to optimise the space and resources. By considering both
traditional and developing sectors in an integrated and spatially explicit
manner, it is possible to help highlight and resolve disputes and avoid
economic, social and environmental losses [24,25].

2. Methods
2.1. Case study area
The Basque coast (SE Bay of Biscay) is approximately 150 km long,
stretching from the French border to the province of Cantabria. The
Basque section of the Cantabrian continental shelf is long and narrow,
ranging from 7 km wide at Cape Matxitxako to only 20 km wide at the
mouth of the Oria River [54]. The area has a high degree of geomorphologic diversity, and rocky reefs, sedimentary habitats, and mixed
rock and sediment seascapes are dominant throughout the study site
[55].
2.2. Maritime activities

1.2. Bayesian belief networks as a decision support tool
There is a diverse array of human activities taking place along the
narrow Basque continental shelf, which makes the region especially
prone to present and future spatial conicts [19,5658] (Fig. 1). The
coast has long hosted more traditional activities, such as the pelagic
purse seiners, trawlers and artisanal sheries, and recreation. There are
also two protected areas along the coast, and two larger, proposed
Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). In addition, new activities have
emerged alongside these existing activities, including oil and gas development, marine renewable energy development projects (the Biscay
Marine Energy Platform), and a new oshore aquaculture initiative.
In 2016, the Basque Government declared a 3 km2 MaritimeTerrestrial Public Domain (MTPD) zone in the littoral area of the
Basque coast for the exclusive use of oshore aquaculture [59]. The
area is located less than 1 km o the coast between Lekeitio and Ondarroa municipalities. It overlays soft substrata, and is intended primarily for mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and oyster (Ostrea edulis)
cultivation. Although commercial-scale aquaculture has not yet been
implemented in the area, on-site mussel production experiments over
the past two years have indicated its economic viability. During the
aquaculture site identication and selection process, artisanal sheries
were identied as one of the sectors most aected by the potential
closure of the area.
The artisanal sheries sector has pronounced socio-economic and
cultural importance in the region [57,60]. The main objective of this
study was to provide scenario analyses for potential conict resolution.
Therefore, a broader denition of artisanal sheries was selected, in
order to incorporate all vessels that could be aected by the closure of
grounds for aquaculture development. The denition for artisanal
sheries used in this study included all local crafts up to 28 m in overall
length that conduct short shing trips to coastal shing grounds
[61,62]. According to this denition, the Basque artisanal eet comprises 129 vessels operating from 14 major ports along the Basque
coast. This eet is heterogeneous, using a diversity of gear and apparatus to land over 80 dierent species over the course of the year
[56,61]. For this reason, it is useful to distinguish the employed mtier,
or the type of shing activity, most often characterised by shing gear
and mesh size, species caught, geographic area and time of the year
[63,64].

In view of the existing and emerging maritime activities, there is a
demand for robust approaches that help users create scenarios, generate
trade-o analysis and generate valuable information that can be used to
resolve spatial and temporal conicts between sectors. One innovative
approach for building spatial scenarios is to use Bayesian belief networks (BBN). BBNs are probabilistic models that make use of causal
reasoning and allow for limited or uncertain data. These models are
simplied conceptual diagrams of a system, where the relationships
between variables (nodes) are described graphically by arrows, and
parameterized by conditional and joint probabilities [26]. In BBNs, the
probabilities are directly associated to current observations or expert
based hypotheses, and these can be continuously updated as new data
becomes available [27]. This modelling approach oers additional
benets, including its capacity to combine qualitative and quantitative
information and its applicability in data-poor conditions [28,29].
Moreover, Bayesian belief networks allow users to explore future scenarios that test original assumptions [30]. This exibility makes BBNs a
useful tool for decision-makers considering several, potential courses of
action [31,32].
In recent years, researchers have used BBNs for a variety of environmental applications [33]. This approach has been applied to
analyse potential changes in land-use [3438], determine habitat suitability [39,40], provide risk and environmental impact assessments for
water quality management [41] and inform sheries management decisions [4246]. Despite growing interest, there are still relatively few
BBN applications developed for environmental management compared
to other disciplines (e.g. engineering, health sciences) [47], and as such,
much of their potential in this eld is unexploited. Moreover, according
to Landuyt et al. [33], only one third of BBNs developed for environmental management purposes were spatially explicit, and the majority
of these applications were related to land-use management decisions
[48]. Thus, few of the spatially explicit BBNs have been applied to the
marine realm [4951], and specically, user-user conicts analysis in
the context of MSP [52,53].
Given this context, the objective of this research is to provide information about potential eort reallocation opportunities for artisanal
sheries when an area is closed to this activity for the development of a

pilot aquaculture site is located in the rectangular area between the ports of Lekeitio and Ondarroa.

Based on the ndings from the PRESPO and BATEGIN projects
[61,65], there are three mtiers whose traditional activity could be
aected by the declared aquaculture site: nets, longlines, and traps.
Vessels using traps operate very close to the coastline, and their activity
would be the most directly impacted by the declared aquaculture site.
Their limited technical capacity further reduces their relocation options. Comparatively, nets and longlines are the most widespread mtiers, operating along much of the Basque continental shelf, as well as
within the declared site.
2.3. Development of the Bayesian belief network
The development and application of the BBN required a series of
steps [66,67], which are shown in Fig. 2 and described below. There are
multiple ways to determine the structure of a BBN, often referred to as
the directed acyclic graph, and parameterize the relationships between
nodes.
2.3.1. Step 1. Collation and preparation of geospatial data
A 1  1 km grid covering the study area was adopted as reference
for the subsequent analysis and to produce continuous coverage output
maps. This grid yielded 2355 unique grid cells along the study site.
Environmental data (e.g. marine habitat, distance variables) and shing
data were integrated into a single geographic information system (GIS).
The European Union Nature Information System (EUNIS) benthic
habitat map was obtained from Galparsoro et al. [68]. The habitat
classes were grouped into four broader habitat types: rock, sand, coarse
sediment, and mud (Supplementary Table 1). For each grid cell, primary habitat type was summarized by selecting the habitat with the
greatest coverage.
Fishing activity data were obtained from the BATEGIN project database [65]. All shing events from 2010 (14,506) were mapped in

mechanisms, and is widely applied in the literature [33,70,71]. Arrows
were drawn in the direction of the target nodes in order to facilitate the
writing of CPTs learned through expert judgment. When developing the
spatial BBN in Netica, each node referred to a GIS layer or attribute, and
each ID in the input case le referred to a specic grid cell in the study
site, so as to create a continuous coverage and spatially explicit output.
The input case le for the BNN was produced by combining all the
instances (rows or grid cells) and attributes (columns) into a data matrix using GIS software.

events (typically trips) per grid cell.
Distance from port and distance from rock were calculated for both
individual shing events and grids. For the shing events, distance from
port was calculated as the geodesic distance (the shortest distance between two points) between each vessel's base port and the shing event
location. For individual grids cells, a Euclidean distance raster was
calculated in QGIS based on the 14 major ports and the average distance in each cell. Similarly, the average Euclidean distance from rock
in each grid cell was calculated based on a distance from rock raster
layer (Supplementary Table 2). A spatial join was performed to obtain
the distance from rock value at each shing event.
The declared aquaculture site overlapped fully or partially with 13
grid cells. These cells were labelled as closed or open depending on
the scenario analysis that was going to be performed.

2.3.4. Step 4. Discretization of geospatial data
Prior to training the BBN, continuous data (i.e. distance from port,
distance from rock, revenue, and eort) were discretized according to
Jenks natural breaks in R, to maximize variance between bins and
minimize variance within bins [72], and these bins were used as node
states in Netica (Supplementary Table 2). The shing eort bins were
rescaled (03 units) to facilitate redistribution in the reallocation scenarios 1b-c (scenarios described in the following section).

2.3.2. Step 2. Creation of the conceptual diagram
The model was designed to minimize the number of parameters
needed for assessing shing ground suitability in order to maximize its
robustness given the limited environmental data available at the spatial
resolution (1 km2). The nal conceptual model was designed to predict
the shing ground suitability of a given grid cell for each mtier based
on environmental suitability (primary habitat, distance from port and
distance from rock), past shing eort, and past catch revenue. The
resulting model would be used to perform scenario analysis by reallocating shing eort from the closed site to alternative grid cells.
Expert judgement, contributed by local researchers with experience in
habitat modelling, sheries economics, sheries management and
Bayesian networks modelling, was used to develop the structure of the
network. To create the conceptual diagram, the research team brainstormed a list of available predictor attributes that were most relevant
to the model output and connected these variables to represent all expected relationships using their collective expert judgment.

2.3.5. Step 5. Denition of the conditional probability tables
Based on the availability of spatial data and to avoid creating an
overly selective model, the team decided to use a combination of empirical data and expert judgement to inform the CPTs. First, the model
was used to learn CPTs for the mtier and their environmental predictor
attributes through a dataset of shing activity events. The research
team then visualized each of the mtier's environmental preferences
based on these empirical data. Expert judgement was used to inform the
remaining CPTs for overall suitability.
Due to the grid resolution (1 km2), there was a high degree of data
variability within the grid cells. For example, within a single grid, there
were tens of events occurring over dierent habitat types. So, although
point data were dened by a single state of a given parameter, twodimensional spaces, like the grid cells, were dened by one or more
states of a given parameter. For this reason, the team decided to train
the environmental attribute CPTs with point data, but run the overall
model with grid data to produce continuous coverage maps. The BBN
implemented in Netica is shown in Fig. 3.

2.3.3. Step 3: model implementation in Bayesian belief network software
The conceptual diagram was converted into a BBN (Fig. 3) using
Netica 6.03 (Norsys, https://www.norsys.com/netica [69]). Netica
provides a simple user interface, built-in parameter learning

traps.

The total number of shing events (14,506) was used to train the
CPTs. The modelling software, Netica, uses Bayes Theorem and machine learning algorithms (Norsys) to determine the probabilistic relationships between the shing events and geographic conditions in
which they took place (i.e. primary habitat, distance from port, distance
from rock).
After all shing events were loaded into the model, the BBN was
calibrated to each mtier by moving the belief-bar, and model users
visualized the conditional probabilities of each of the environmental
parameters (Fig. 4). The mtier presence node was used to distinguish
shing events performed by the mtier of interest and trips performed
by all other mtiers, in order to train the model for both positive and
negative ndings.
A scoring system was implemented to capture the variability of the
shing activities. The CPTs learned from the empirical data were used
to inform the scoring of the intermediate, environmental suitability
node (Supplementary Table 2). Points were assigned to each state of the
parent node according to their respective conditional probabilities; the
most probable state received the highest score (3/3), and the least
probable state received the lowest score (0/3). An average score was
calculated in R for each unique combination of states (n = 3), and
suitability categories were assigned to the following bins: no (00.667),
low (0.6671.667), medium (1.6672.667), high (2.6673), and very
high (> 3). High scores were associated to the environmental conditions that were associated with the greatest number of shing events by
a given mtier, and low scores were associated to conditions associated
with the fewest number of shing events.
The CPT for the overall suitability node was calculated similarly.
High scores were assigned to high previous eort and high catch revenue, and low scores to low previous eort and low catch revenue. The
average score from the environmental suitability, eort, and revenue
nodes was used to predict the overall suitability class. Finally, the
model was trained to associate any grid cell classied as closed to the

no suitability state.
This step was repeated for each of the three mtiers to produce
distinct, spatially explicit scenarios.
2.4. Scenario denitions
The model was run for several scenarios to explore how shing
grounds suitability might change under new spatial management options. The scenarios were dened as follows:
Scenario 0 (Baseline): the model was run for all grids in the case
study, for each of the three mtiers analysed. No grid cells were closed
to shing activity and thus, no eort was reallocated.
Scenario 1a: this scenario was dened similarly to Scenario 0, but
the 13 grid cells overlapped by the aquaculture site were closed, and
shing eort from those cells was removed (set to zero) and redistributed evenly to all available cells.
Scenario 1b: the model was run for a subset of grids in the case
study, for each of the three mtiers analysed. This subset corresponded
to the activity range of the 6 vessels that shed within the declared
aquaculture area (Fig. 5). The 13 aquaculture site grid cells were closed,
and shing eort from those cells was removed and redistributed
evenly to cells with predicted high environmental suitability and low
previous shing eort.
Scenario 1c: this scenario was dened similarly to Scenario 1b, but
shing eort from the aquaculture site grid cells was removed and
redistributed evenly to cells with predicted high environmental suitability and high previous shing eort.

shing events made by these vessels are plotted in the gure.

the majority of medium suitability sites were located in the central belt
of the continental shelf, between the ports of Bermeo and Getaria. The
areas suitable for longlines exhibited the greatest spatial dispersion
along the study area, with high and medium suitable sites speckling the
narrow, northwestern reaches of the continental shelf near the port of
Armintza. Suitability for traps was predicted to be low for 66% of the
study site, but suitability increased in grid cells very close to the coast.
The model results illustrated that there were highly suitable areas for
both nets and traps within the aquaculture site. In contrast, the amount
of grid cells with no suitability was comparable for the three mtiers,
ranging from 23% to 33%. The majority of unsuitable sites were
identied as areas far from rocky substrata, in the northeast portion of
the study site.

the case study area, it was observed that nets were the most abundant
and spatially widespread mtier, followed by longlines (Fig. 6). There
were comparatively fewer vessels operating with traps, and their shing
events occurred close to the coastline and near to their base ports.
The majority of shing events by netters took place over mud habitats (54%), in areas located on rocks (39%) or less than 250 m from
rock (27%), and in locations between 2 and 5 km from their base port
(38%) (Table 1). On the other hand, the majority of longliners shed
over rocky substrata (56%) and were more likely to seek out shing
locations farther away (distanced greater than 5 km) from their base
port. Trap users seemed to be the most restricted to the seaoor type
over which they undertake their activity. Based on the empirical data,
75% of the shing events took place over rocky habitats (75%) and 50%
took place between 0.25 and 1 km from rock. In 32% of the cases, trap
users were active between 2 and 5 km from port base port.
Based on the records from 2010, the shing activity taking place
within the aquaculture site area was performed by just 6 vessels. These
six vessels are directly aected by the closure, as their shing grounds
are located within the declared aquaculture site. Four of these vessels
operated with nets throughout the declared aquaculture site, one vessel
operated with longlines in a sub-section of the site, and the remaining
vessel operated with traps within the site and in the immediately surrounding coastal waters. These vessels contributed 3% of the total net
eort and just over 1% of total longline eort expended along the entire
Basque coast. In contrast, the single aected vessel operating with traps
contributed to over 30% of the total eort by traps.

3.3. Scenario 1a: reallocation opportunities for artisanal shing eort
In this scenario, each mtier's eort in the aquaculture area was
summed and redistributed evenly to all open cells in the study site. All
aquaculture site cells were reclassied as closed, and the model was
trained to recognize these grid cells as unsuitable (Table 2). Given that
the whole study area comprised 2355 grid cells, the relatively small
amount of reallocated eort did not change the suitability status of the
open grid cells for any of the mtiers (i.e. 3% of their total eort, or 35
units of eort by nets divided evenly among 2355 grid cells).
3.4. Scenario 1b: eort reallocation for directly aected vessels

3.2. Artisanal shing grounds

For this scenario, the model was run with a subset of grid cells
corresponding to the shing grounds of directly aected vessels. The six
vessels that had shed within the aquaculture site operated in 286 of
the surrounding grid cells. Traps experienced the greatest degree of
displacement by the closure, as 50% of the vessels eort occurred
within the closed area. The other mtiers were less aected, as 10% of
the local eort by nets and 7% of the local eort by longlines took place
within the closed grounds. The BBN was used to highlight changes in
local suitability when eort was redistributed to cells with predicted
high suitability and low previous eort. In this scenario, the closure of
the aquaculture site resulted in increased suitability for nets in two grid
cells (Fig. 8). This scenario did not produce any observable changes for

The predicted shing ground suitability for nets, longlines and traps
is shown in Fig. 7. The predicted suitability for the three mtiers within
the range of the directly aected vessels is shown in Fig. 8.
The predicted shing ground suitability based on the baseline scenario mirrored the spatial distribution of mtier activity along the
Basque coast. The BBN results showed that there is a wide range of
suitable sites for nets along the continental shelf. Nets were found to
have the largest percentage of medium and high suitability sites in the
study area (20%), compared to longlines (8%) and traps (< 1%)
(Table 2). The suitable areas for nets closely followed the coastline, and

the reallocation of longlines and traps eort led to fewer changes in
suitability. However, for traps, the site closure and eort reallocation
highlighted alternative suitable shing grounds in nearby grids to the
west of the aquaculture site.
Overall, the BBN results for the limited activity range in Scenario 1c
showed the most noticeable changes in suitability, whereas the reallocation of a relatively small amount of eort to all potential areas in
the case study did not produce an observable eect.

the two other mtiers, from which less than 10% of eort was redistributed.

3.5. Scenario 1c: eort reallocation to alternative sites
Comparatively, when eort was redistributed to cells with predicted
high environmental suitability and high previous eort, the suitability
status of the study site changed considerably (Fig. 9). For nets, shing
ground suitability increased in grid cells near to the coast, to the east
and west of the closed site, and two cells were reclassied as having
very high suitability. For this particular mtier, many of the grids that
had medium suitability in the baseline scenario were reclassied as
highly suitable in the site closure scenario. As in the previous scenarios,

analyse scenarios for artisanal shing eort reallocation at the highest
spatial resolution permitted by available data. This analysis benetted
from the capacity of BBNs to combine data-driven methods (i.e. shing
activity reports and environmental characteristics) with expert knowledge. The current model can be considered as a rst step in creating a

account the spatial and temporal patterns of all relevant maritime activities, as well as the interactions between them [73]. Unfortunately,
many modelling approaches are generally unable to fully capture these
complex activity patterns in a spatially explicit manner [53]. In this
research, a Bayesian belief network was developed to model, map and

overall suitability was assigned to the region along continental shelf
covered by rocky substrata where few shing events had occurred. The
modelling approach generated the most informative results for netters,
for which the greatest amount of shing event data was available, although alternative shing locations for longlines and traps were also
identied. When eort by nets was reallocated in the scenarios, the
suitability status of multiple grid cells increased, thereby identifying
alternative shing sites. In Scenario 1b, when eort was reallocated to
grids with low previous eort, highly suitable sites were identied
farther away from the coast to the northeast of the aquaculture site.
These potential relocation sites match the mtier's identied environmental preferences, but could be relatively unknown to the sherman
because few vessels have operated there previously. Comparatively, the
results from Scenario 1c emphasise alternative shing locations that are
both environmentally suitable and have hosted shing activity in the
past. In this scenario eight additional grid cells with high and very high
suitability were identied, but given that the model does not consider
environmental carrying capacity (i.e. species biomass), it is uncertain
whether these areas could sustain increased activity.
Similarly, the model was used to identify a few grid cells west of the
aquaculture site to which trap eort could be reallocated. Not only
were traps the most aected by the closure in terms of eort, but also
the model results showed that there were few grid cells in the surrounding area that were environmentally suitable. The limited relocation options for traps reect both the reduced technical capacity of this
particular shing activity and the few number of shing event data in
this region. These results conrm that it may be more dicult to relocate vessels operating with traps, and that mitigating their potential
losses due to the introduced aquaculture site should be prioritized.

BBN for analysing conict resolution opportunities for marine activities
and space and resource optimisation under the framework of ecosystem-based marine spatial planning. To the authors knowledge, this is
the rst application of a spatially explicit BBN that can be used to
analyse dierent management scenarios for sheries when there is a
possibility of grounds closure due to an emerging marine activity. This
particular application is of high relevance for MSP and management
plans, as artisanal sheries make up 83% of the total EU eets [74] and
marine aquaculture production is expected to increase.
For this research, the overall suitability for artisanal sheries was
dened by past eort, past revenue and environmental suitability, so
areas with a high degree of previous activity and prot corresponded to
high overall suitability. Comparatively, in areas that resembled the
environmental preferences of the mtier but where few shing events
had taken place were assigned low suitability. This outcome was most
evident in the baseline scenario (Scenario 0, Fig. 7), Therefore, low

4.1. Model assumptions
Despite the simplicity of the BBN, several of its parameters and their
underlying assumptions are in agreement with previous, spatial characterizations of shing activity [75,76]. Suitability was based in part on
the assumption that high catch per unit eort is equivalent to high
abundance of species of commercial interest [77]. Although the eort
and revenue nodes speak to the notion that shing is an economic activity and that shermen are driven by expected prot [78,79], the
model was designed to give weight to traditional shing grounds over
environmentally suitable but previously un-visited sites. In Scenario 1c,
eort was purposefully reallocated to sites that artisanal shermen had
visited before, which increased the overall suitability of grid cells to the
west of the aquaculture site from medium to high. Thus, the concept of
tradition, with respect to traditional shing locations, was incorporated
implicitly in the model and in the scenarios. Distance from port was

4.2. Model performance and underlying uncertainties

included explicitly in the model, as a means of linking the user and their
resource, as well as introducing distance as a proxy for cost [77]. In this
sense, the choice of shing grounds can depend on a number of additional factors, including expected prot and market demand, season,
and the shermen's knowledge of habitat distribution [80,81]. Ultimately, there was a trade-o between the number of variables needed
for a robust and reliable model and the data limitations to create a
spatially explicit BBNs. Pradhan and Leung [80] highlight that it is most
important for managers to identify which parameters ultimately trigger
shers to choose one location over another when developing a particular shery, which is one reason why expert judgment was incorporated into this BBN.

The model produced showed uncertainty in assigning low to
medium suitability and did not capture extreme values. Stelzemller
et al. [52] and van Verseveld et al. [71] encountered the same diculties in their BBN applications for analysing marine landscape vulnerability and categorizing hurricane damage to coastal structures,
respectively. It is likely that much of the uncertainty produced in this
model is related to the discretization of the data. In the model produced, it was observed that the coarse discretization of the eort data
greatly impacted the suitability score in the reallocation scenarios. The
skewness of the available data and the proportion of eort relative to
the number of available cells diminished the eect of the reallocated
eort on the overall suitability score. Greenstreet and team [82] used

scenarios for artisanal sheries, whose traditional grounds may be
closed for aquaculture development. This analysis was accomplished
through a novel approach: the creation and application of a spatially
explicit Bayesian belief network. The results indicated that there are
opportunities for traditional artisanal shing activities to reallocate
their eort and thus, coexist with the aquaculture initiative in areas
immediately surrounding the aquaculture site. The results obtained
revealed that there is added value in combining empirical data and
expert knowledge when developing this kind of model, especially in the
context of reaching marine spatial planning objectives. To our knowledge, the proposed model is still one of the only spatially explicit BBNs
applied to artisanal sheries and aquaculture in the context of MSP.
Subsequent research should seek to develop models that incorporate
additional maritime activities in order to address continued and newly
emerging user-user conicts and associated environmental eects.
BBNs can be adapted to explore management scenarios for a range of
actors and activities, thus proving their usefulness for ecosystem-based
marine spatial planning implementation.

an alternative modelling approach and ICES data with a lower spatial
resolution, but also found diculty in redistributing eort eectively,
observing that shing eort increases in open grids were smaller than
the eort expended previously in the closed area.
Aalders and co-workers [83] expressed that the ultimate objective in
creating a BBN is to train all CPTs with empirical data, as opposed to
expert judgement. However, in the present research incorporating expert judgement to inform the suitability node was essential because the
target node needed to convey value. In order to produce the dierent
scenarios, the shing eort had to be reallocated, and therefore this
variable could not be used as the target node. For this reason, future
research eorts should investigate how to adjust the suitability scoring
system and discretization of the classes in order to best summarize the
available information.
Given the current availability of relevant spatial data, structured,
expert and stakeholder elicitation may be the most appropriate means
for further development and validation [39,53]. This study relied on a
small group of experts for the development of the alpha model, but
other BBN applications have elicited between 3 and 60 experts to discretize nodes and parameterize CPTs [84]. In particular, determining
node states (bins) has been recognized as a critical part of the elicitation
process [85]. Once the functional model has been established, its assumptions, parameters and outputs can be more easily assessed and
edited by additional subject domain experts and relevant stakeholders
[8688].

4.3. Application of Bayesian belief networks in the marine spatial planning
process
Some of the principal characteristics and capabilities of Bayesian
belief networks make them valuable for ecosystem based MSP and integrated management-related applications. BBNs can be used to combine available empirical data with expert knowledge to increase the
user's understanding of spatial phenomena, as was shown in the present
research. Moreover, the resulting BBN can be amended and updated.
The environmental parameters can be retrained with higher resolution
spatial data, and the model could be updated with additional case les
from more recent shing activity reports and geodata obtained from
Automatic Identication Systems (AIS) and Vessel Monitoring Systems
(VMS) [89], although artisanal shing gears are typically not well
captured by these technologies. Researchers have used a Bayesian approach to predict sh species richness and abundance hot-spots from
environmental and remotely sensed data, so this information could be
used to update the current model and verify potential eort reallocation
scenarios [90].
The key contribution of this research is that the produced BBN can
be used to explore alternative management scenarios for a marine area
supporting a high density of economic activities. Such scenarios can be
created and run with modied versions of this BNN. The existing BBN
could be applied to a large range of economic activities, such as the
selected aquaculture site, proposed MPAs, or new oshore wind energy
platforms. The model developed here can also be integrated with other
BBNs to address marine spatial planning initiatives at a systems-wide
scale. As this case study illustrates, implementing new objectives in one
sector may introduce and change conict patterns with another [73].
Making trade-os explicit through applications like BBNs can improve
the decision making process and help reduce overall losses for individual sectors [91]. BBNs may be especially useful in integrating
management domains that primarily rely on expert judgment, as they
provide a structured and statistically sound format for incorporating
such information [28].
