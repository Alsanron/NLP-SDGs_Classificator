Abstract
Wallis, Alofi, and Futuna are three small islands in the central Pacific Ocean,
characterized by different reef geomorphologies. Following a request from the
local Environment Service, we developed an indicative conservation plan for
each island with two objectives: (1) representing 20% of the extent of each
coral reef habitat within no-take areas while (2) keeping all subsistence fishing
grounds open for extraction. The first objective was more ambitious than the
current Convention on Biological Diversity (Aichi) targets. We found that both
objectives could not be achieved simultaneously and that large compromises
are needed. Due to the small size of these islands, and the dependence of local
communities on coral reef resources, the fishery objective significantly limited
the extent of most habitats available for conservation. The problem is exacerbated if the conservation plan uses larger conservation units and more complex
habitat typologies. Our results indicate that international conservation guidelines should be carefully adapted to small Pacific islands and that incentives to
make feasible the necessary reductions in available fishing grounds will probably be needed.

Introduction
As a response to increasing global and local threats to
marine and coastal ecosystems, a worldwide system of
plans of action with ambitious conservation guidelines
has been established by the international community
(Butchart et al. 2010; Wabnitz et al. 2010). These guidelines typically target percentage representation of marine and coastal habitats within marine-protected areas
(MPAs), involving various levels of restrictions on extractive uses within the seven International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN)-protected area management categories (IUCN 2008; WCPA). If reached successfully, these representation objectives are expected to
help protect habitats, promote the viability of species,
and ensure long-term and sustainable benefits to fisheries, thus sustaining economies and livelihoods as well as
biodiversity.

46

In 2003, participants in the Cross-cutting Theme on
Marine Issues at the 5th IUCN World Parks Congress in
Durban, South Africa, called on the international community to include in networks of MPAs at least 2030%
of each marine habitat by 2012 (IUCN World Parks
Congress 2005). Since then, targets such as these have
been identified for countries or whole regions. Regional
action plans target protection in no-take areas of at least
20% of habitats associated with coral reefs (Coral Triangle
Initiative 2008), or effective conservation of at least 30%
of near-shore marine resources by 2020 (The Micronesia
Challenge 2006). The US national conservation strategy
aims at protecting at least 20% of all coral reefs and associated habitats in each major island group and Florida
(United States Coral Reef Task Force 2000). In Choiseul,
in Solomon Islands, the local conservation strategy aims
to protect 10% of the original extent of each terrestrial
and marine ecosystem (Lipsett-Moore et al. 2010).

In 2010, based on the last meeting of the Conference
of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity
in Nagoya, Japan, the previous 2030% global targets
were revised and the new objective is to protect 10%
of coastal and marine areas [. . .] through [. . .] systems of
protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures by 2020 (UNEP/CBD/COP/10/X/2 2010).
Yet, there is increasing recognition that (1) percentages
larger than 10% are likely needed in the longer term
for effective conservation (Rodrigues & Gaston 2001;
Svancara et al. 2005; Gaines et al. 2010), and (2) failing to
frame targets in terms of individual habitats (e.g., rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Fernandes et al.
2009) is likely to strongly bias conservation to habitats
easiest to protect and perhaps least in need of protection,
as demonstrated widely on land (Scott et al. 2001).
Although quantitative conservation objectives are
a foundation of systematic conservation planning
(Margules & Pressey 2000) and a common tool in policy,
many conservation plans based on such targets are
either infeasible or ineffective in the short term (Agardy
et al. 2003; Mace et al. 2010; Wood 2011). Important
reasons include limited funds, inadequate biological or
socioeconomic data, and insufficient areas available for
conservation. The question of the ecological relevance
of targets and general conservation guidelines is being
debated within the scientific community (Carwardine
et al. 2009) but the difficulty of complying with these
recommendations is not yet well-addressed.
How achievable are these global conservation objectives in regions such as in developing Pacific Islands,
where people depend heavily on marine habitats and associated resources for day-to-day survival (Dalzell et al.
1996; Bell et al. 2009; Govan et al. 2009)? Because of their
small sizes and the dependence of local communities on
coastal resources, these countries might be unable to balance food security with the closure of near-shore fisheries
for protection of habitats. Finding areas available for conservation that are not used for resource extraction can
be difficult in these countries and, if fishing grounds are
to be closed, there is often limited scope for compensating resource users or finding them alternative livelihoods
(Govan et al. 2009). Consequently, tensions are likely in
Pacific Island countries between resource users and proponents of conservation (Hviding 2006).
In this article, we demonstrate the conflict between
conservation objectives based on the previous mid to
upper range of international conservation guidelines
and small-scale fisheries objectives for the three Pacific
islands of Wallis, Alofi and Futuna, a French overseas
territory where coral reef habitats are mainly exploited
for subsistence. We focus on a conservation objective of
20% of each marine habitat for two reasons. First, we

Conservation and fisheries in Pacific islands

believe that the present 11th Aichi target (10%) will
be seen as an underestimate of required protection of
near-shore marine environments (Allison et al. 2003;
Botsford et al. 2003). Second, we note that some jurisdictions have specified larger percentages (2030, or even
greater) of near-shore marine habitats to be protected
(Airame et al. 2003; Fernandes et al. 2009; Mills et al.
2011). Specifically, we show the spatial extent of the
trade-off between sets of objectives for conservation and
fisheries. In this case, we considered the best protection
option for marine habitats and associated resources (i.e.,
the implementation of no-take zones) and the best-case
short-term scenario for fisheries (i.e., no restriction
on take in current fishing grounds). Different sizes of
potential no-take zones and different habitat data were
tested to understand their influence on the trade-offs
between conservation and fisheries objectives.

Materials and methods
Study sites and context
Wallis, Alofi, and Futuna are three Polynesian high
islands belonging to the French Territory of Wallis and
Futuna Islands, in the central South Pacific (Figures 1a
and b). Both Wallis and Futuna, the largest islands, are
inhabited. Alofi is uninhabited but used daily by Futuna
habitants for agriculture, fishing, and leisure. The three
islands vary in size and in habitat complexity.
Because tourism is not well developed, demand for
reef fish is confined to local communities, who exploit
the reefs and lagoons for their own subsistence. Almost
a third of the population practises artisanal small-scale
fishing in Wallis, Alofi and Futuna, mostly with nets and
speargun (Egretaud et al. 2007a, b). Most catches are either eaten by the fishers themselves or exchanged or
given away, with the remainder sold to buy fuel for fishing boats. The total lagoon fishery production, estimated
at 200300 tonnes per year (Kronen et al. 2008; Ministere
de lOutre-Mer 2011), is lower than the local demand,
estimated at 900 tonnes per year (Egretaud et al. 2007b).
This indicates that reduction in production resulting from
marine conservation actions will be problematic.
Thus far, there are no MPAs in Wallis, Alofi, and
Futuna that have been integrated into a territorial
management plan (Verducci & Juncker 2007). However, three small informal customary MPAs have been
established in Wallis, based on a ad hoc decisions between local fishermen, customary authorities, and the
Territorial Environment Service (Egretaud et al. 2007b).
Wide agreement among both the local communities and
authorities to increase the protection of these islands
reefs and manage their resources led the local authorities

to launch a territorial Management Plan for Marine Areas
(in French, Plan de Gestion des Espaces Maritimes). Based
on Frances national biodiversity strategy (Ministere de
lEcologie du Developpement durable des Transports et
du Logement 2011) which parallels the Aichi biodiversity
targets (UNEP/CBD/COP/10/X/2 2010), the future territorial management plan for Wallis aims to move from
the existing informal reserves to a new MPA network at
the territory level.

Objectives for the indicative conservation plan
for this study
An indicative conservation plan was set up for the three
islands to reflect objectives of the Territorial Environment
Service, with two sets of objectives based respectively
on international habitat conservation guidelines and local fishery requirements. Wallis managers initially considered the guidelines of the previous 20022010 CBD
Strategic Plan, which targeted a mid- to long-term protection of 2030% of each habitat (IUCN World Parks
Congress 2005). They also considered a network of notake areas as the most efficient tool to provide rapid

48

ecological benefits. Thus, for this study, the conservation objective was to include 20% of the total extent
of each habitat within no-take areas: a more ambitious
amount than the new CBD marine target (11th target
in UNEP/CBD/COP/10/X/2 2010) and, unlike the CBD
guidelines, not considering zonings that permit extractive
uses.
Here, the fishery objective was intended to avoid conflicts with local communities highly dependent on reef
habitats both culturally and economically. It prevented
the main current fishing grounds for nets and spearguns
from being identified as no-take areas. The data and analyses below allowed an assessment of the extent to which
these potentially conflicting objectives can be reconciled.

Coral reef habitat maps
Two types of habitat maps with two levels of detail
were used (see detailed methods in Andrefouet & Dirberg
2006). First, a high-resolution geomorphic habitat map
(hereafter the geomorphic map) of the three islands
was derived from the Millennium Coral Reef Mapping
Project (Andrefouet et al. 2006). Millennium Coral Reef

M. A. Hamel et al.

Mapping Project maps were all created from Landsat 7
ETM+ satellite imagery at 30-m spatial resolution. Second, a very high-resolution detailed habitat map (hereafter the geomorphic + benthic map), combining geomorphic attributes and benthic data, was derived from
digital aerial photographs at 2-m spatial resolution (see
Andrefouet & Dirberg 2006; Andrefouet et al. 2007, and
Dalleau et al. 2010 for more information on these maps).
In Wallis, Alofi, and Futuna, geomorphic habitats were
respectively described in 16, 4, and 3 thematic classes.
The combination of data in the geomorphic + benthic
maps allowed habitats to be described in 55, 6, and 3
thematic classes, respectively, excluding land features. To
understand how map type would affect the feasibility
of conservation and fishery objectives, all analyses were
conducted for both habitat maps.

Fishing grounds data
In 2006, an environmental study was conducted in
Wallis, Alofi, and Futuna to initiate the Plan de Gestion
des Espaces Maritimes (Egretaud et al. 2007a, b). Socioeconomic and environmental data were collected to map
the different uses of the marine environment and to
understand the views and expectations of stakeholders
in terms of management. The fishery geographic information system includes the boundaries of coral reef
fishing grounds, itemized for different fishing gears and
techniques (gleaning, line, speargun, net, and informal
offshore fishing). For our analysis, we focused on net and
speargun fisheries because they were the dominant gears.
For Alofi and Futuna, only speargun data were available.

Conservation units
Each island of interest was partitioned into manageable
conservation units by superimposing a grid of square cells
on all areas containing coral reef habitats on the maps. To
understand whether the size of conservation units would
affect the feasibility of reconciling conservation and fishery objectives, all analyses were conducted for two different sizes of conservation units (500  500 m and 200 
200 m, hereafter large and small, respectively).

Reef area left available for conservation
The set of possible no-take areas or areas left for conservation considered in these analyses initially excluded
all fished units. For each combination of island/habitat
map/size of conservation unit, we first measured the proportion of conservation units available for conservation
when all fishing areas were left open. Within all conservation units (fished, and unfished), we computed the

Conservation and fisheries in Pacific islands

number of habitats (excluding land features) and their
extent, and the occurrence of net or speargun fishing.
Then we measured the proportion of habitats that could
potentially meet the 20% objective within unfished conR
servation units. All data were analysed using ESRI
TM
ArcMap
10.0 and R (R Development Core Team
2008).

Trade-off between objectives for habitat
conservation and small-scale fisheries
Conservation objectives were fully achieved when 100%
of habitats could meet the 20% objective. Full achievement of the fishery objective meant that 100% of initial fished units were available for harvest. We measured
the actual extent to which conservation objectives must
be compromised to fully achieve the fishery objective,
and vice versa. For this, we created trade-off curves with
Marxan (Possingham et al. 2000; Ball et al. 2009), a software system for systematic conservation planning. Fished
conservation units were attributed a cost of 1. Nonfished
conservation units had zero cost.
We applied Marxan iteratively, starting with the set of
unfished conservation units (full achievement of the fishing objective) and progressively increasing the percentage
of fished conservation units to be considered as potential
reserves (allowing increasing achievement of the habitat
conservation objectives). To do this, we defined a series of
increasing cost thresholds by the percentages of the total
fished conservation units that could be moved to no-take
zones: from 0 to 100% in 10% increments. For each of
these 11 cost thresholds, 1,000 different sets of conservation units were selected to meet the objectives. Across
these 1,000 repeat runs, we selected the best solution
(with the lowest total cost) for each percentage threshold.
For each threshold, we recorded the proportion of habitats that would meet their objectives in the best solution.

Results
Avoiding a priori any fishing ground in no-take areas had
a large impact on the number of conservation units available for conservation, and on the extent of habitats that
could be protected. At best, for both sizes of conservation units, about 60% of the potential conservation units
would be left available in both Wallis and Futuna, and
about 20% in Alofi (Figure 2). In these sets of available conservation units, a substantial proportion of the
total number of habitats could not meet the 20% objective (unrepresented and under-represented habitats in
Figure 3).
Figure 4 shows the spatial distribution of unrepresented and under-represented habitats. Figure 5 shows

ing sizes of conservation units and thematic resolution of
habitat maps had the greatest impact on the trade-off in
Futuna, the simpler island in terms of habitats.

the extent of each habitat left available for conservation (see Table 1 and Table 2 for lists of specific
under-represented and unrepresented habitats types
and percentage representation in unfished areas). Fringing reefs are of concern over the three islands. All
geomorphic fringing reef classes (3/3 for either size of
conservation unit; Table 1) and most geomorphic + benthic fringing reef classes (11/13 for smaller conservation
units, 12/13 for larger ones; Table 2) could not meet
their 20% objectives. In Wallis, barrier reef, and channel habitats would also be under-protected, especially
when considering geomorphic + benthic habitats and
larger conservation units (10/26 classes, against 5/26 for
smaller units). In addition, none of the seagrass beds (4/4
geomorphic + benthic classes) would be represented in
Wallis. Using smaller conservation units in Futuna would
allow all three geomorphic + benthic habitats to meet
their conservation objectives. Overall, conservation objectives cannot be fully achieved if all fishing grounds are
avoided, except for Futuna when geomorphic habitats
and smaller conservation units are considered.
The trade-off analyses showed that, if local communities harvested 100% of their fishing grounds (full
achievement of the fishery objective), only 69% of all
Wallis habitats and 75% of Alofi habitats, at best, can
meet their conservation objectives (Figure 6). On the
other hand, for all habitats to reach their objectives, at
least 20% of fished conservation units must be made
available for conservation in Wallis and Alofi. In general,
geomorphic habitats could meet their conservation objectives with less impact on fisheries than geomorphic +
benthic habitats. The habitat conservation objectives
were also achieved with less impact on fisheries when
smaller conservation units were used. A combination of
geomorphic habitats and smaller conservation units reduced (Wallis, Alofi) or eliminated (Futuna) the tradeoff between conservation and fishery objectives. Modify-

Achieving 20% habitat conservation targets within
no-take areas appears incompatible with the socioeconomicx context of small Pacific island countries such
as Wallis, Futuna, and Alofi. Managers and conservation
planners worldwide are already well aware of the tradeoff needed between conservation and fisheries objectives
(see Proceedings of the Fourth World Fisheries Congress:
Reconciling Fisheries with Conservation, 2004), and
MPA designs now account for local socio-economic constraints (Klein et al. 2008). Here, we quantified the extent
of trade-offs needed to reconcile two conflicting types of
objectives, in the particular context of small tropical coral
reef islands, rich in habitats, limited in extent, and with
high levels of use for daily subsistence, and thus with limited scope to favor habitat protection over food security.
To our knowledge, no study has previously assessed
the extent of the compromises needed between fisheries
and strict habitat conservation in this tropical island context. Our analyses, based on immediately available data
sets, provide quantitative and spatially explicit answers
to questions about compromises between core objectives
for managing marine regions. We found that achievement of both strict conservation and fishery objectives is
generally not possible in Wallis, Alofi, and Futuna, regardless of the habitat maps and sizes of conservation
units considered. However, although the 20% no-take
objectives were not all achievable without reducing fishing areas, the achievement of objectives for specific habitats was greatly influenced by the type of habitat maps
and the size of the conservation units, so choosing these
variables carefully is fundamental to understanding such
trade-offs.
Our results show that using more detailed habitat
maps makes the achievement of habitat objectives more
difficult. Very detailed habitat maps provide a finer
description of physical and biological variation across
reef systems, and Dalleau et al. (2010) suggested that
finer resolution coral reef habitats might also be better
surrogates of species diversity. However, finer resolution
maps also contain more habitat classes that need to be
represented in conservation designs, increasing the total
area required to achieve objectives. The reason for this
increase is the greater mismatch between the boundaries
of conservation units and those of more detailed habitat
classes, as demonstrated for terrestrial planning by
Pressey & Logan (1995).

Under-represented habitats are those for which conservation objectives
were only partially achievable (less than 20% of total extent available for
conservation). Unrepresented habitats were those that could not be protected at all because their entire extents were fished. Figures are shown

for the three islands (Wallis, Alofi, and Futuna), two sizes of conservation
units (500  500 m and 200  200 m), and two types of maps (geomorphic in blue, and geomorphic + benthic in red). We considered 16
geomorphic habitats and 55 geomorphic + benthic habitats for Wallis, 4
geomorphic habitats, and 6 geomorphic + benthic habitats for Alofi, and
3 geomorphic habitats and 3 geomorphic + benthic habitats for Futuna.

Figure 4 Spatial patterns of under-represented and unrepresented habitat types in units available for conservation after exclusion of fished units,
both shown in red. Under-represented and unrepresented habitats were
those for which conservation objectives were only partially achievable
(more than 80% of total extent unavailable for conservation, so less than

20% available) or not achievable, respectively. Effects of exclusion of fished
conservation units are shown for each island, two sizes of conservation
units, and two types of maps. The lower panels show the spatial footprint
of net and speargun fishing in blue. For Alofi and Futuna Islands, only data
on speargun fishing could be obtained.

Decisions about the sizes of conservation units also
influence the potential to achieve both habitat conservation and fishery objectives. In general, smaller
conservation units allow a more exact habitat representation, for any given spatial and thematic resolution of
map, in the sense that fewer objectives are over-achieved

(see Mills et al. 2010 for coral reefs; Pressey & Logan
1995; 1998 for land systems). Our findings agree with
these studies, showing that smaller conservation units
lead to easier compromises. However, the appropriate
size of conservation units must be decided taking account
of other factors such as data resolution, manageability,

and effectiveness of conservation actions in the long-run
(Gaines et al. 2010; Mills et al. 2010).
Prioritizing the fishery objective in Wallis, Alofi, and
Futuna, as requested by the Territorial Environment Service, resulted in a deficit of reef areas available for conservation. The consequences were that several habitat
types could not be protected at all, or could only partially
achieve their objectives. These results were expected
because several types of reef habitats are preferentially
used by net and speargun fishermen for their accessibility, exposure, and resource abundance.
An extreme response to avoiding conflicts between
conservation and fishery objectives is to abandon heavily
fished or overfished areas to further extraction. However,
failing to protect such areas from further fishing is likely

to preclude their ability to restore or enhance stocks, and
ignores the potential benefits of spillover of larvae and
adults to supplement other fished areas. Therefore, avoiding conflicts at all costs might not be the best strategy
in the long run, even to maximize benefits to fishermen
themselves. Although subject to controversy, there is a
now a wide body of work demonstrating the benefits of
MPAs for adjacent fisheries (Roberts et al. 2001; Hilborn
et al. 2004; Russ et al. 2004; Kaiser 2005; Harrison et al.
2012;). To incorporate these perspectives, our indicative
conservation designs could be refined by considering past
fishing activities, fishing pressure and yields, and the locations of potential MPAs relative to fished areas.

conservation as we defined them here for small Pacific

islands is clearly not feasible without compromises on
both sides. Methods to identify achievable, realistic
objectives early in the process of conservation planning
are needed urgently for these countries. By achievable,
we mean objectives that can actually be reached through
effective conservation and management actions, not
simply on paper. By realistic, we mean conservation
objectives that converge towards the strict application of
international objectives while allowing some flexibility to
minimize socio-economic impacts on local communities
heavily dependent on fishing. On the fisheries side,
objectives must allow flexibility to minimize impacts on
targeted species, other species, and physical habitats.
Current international conservation guidelines such as
the CBD targets have moderated their options through
time to allow some flexibility for complying countries.
If no-take areas are seen by some as the best protection
option for marine habitats and associated resources (see
Graham et al. 2011 for a review on benefits for coral
reefs), they are also the most difficult to implement.

Low compliance can be expected, especially in small
Pacific countries that depend heavily on coastal habitats
and associated resources. There is now a multitude of
spatial arrangements for marine management that do not
require total and permanent restrictions on harvest (see
for example Cinner & Aswani 2007; Gaines et al. 2010;
Agardy et al. 2011; Mills et al. 2011). The IUCN-protected
area management categories themselves offer a range of
options to avoid the hard trade-offs demonstrated in this
article.
Incentives to accept marine conservation measures are
also being investigated and include compensatory services such as schools or medical facilities (e.g., Aswani &
Weiant 2004) and buyouts or alternative livelihoods (e.g.
Niesten & Gjertsen 2010; Jones & Qiu 2011). For islands
where most fishing activities provide food for subsistence,
incentives might also need to include additional imports
of food. Our analyses show that the extent of trade-offs
between objectives and the need for such incentives
can be demonstrated readily. Appropriate responses to

trade-offs must then be formulated amongst the affected
communities, decision makers concerned with fisheries
and conservation, and conservation scientists.
