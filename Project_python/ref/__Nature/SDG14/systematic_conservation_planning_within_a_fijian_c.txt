Abstract. Although conservation planning research has influenced conservation actions globally in the last two decades,
successful implementation of systematic conservation plans in regions where customary marine tenure exists has been
minimal. In such regions, local community knowledge and understanding of socioeconomic realities may offer the best
spatially explicit information for analysis, since required socioeconomic data are not available at scales relevant to
conservation planning. Here we describe the process undertaken by the Kadavu Yaubula Management Support Team, a
team of researchers from The University of the South Pacific and the local communities to assess whether systematic
conservation planning tools can be effectively applied and useful in a customary governance context, using a case study
from Fiji. Through a participatory approach and with the aim of meeting local-scale conservation and fisheries needs, a
spatial conservation planning tool, Marxan with Zones, was used to reconfigure a collection of locally designed marine
protected areas in the province of Kadavu in order to achieve broader objectives. At the local scale, the real value of such
tools has been in the process of identifying and conceptualising management issues, working with communities to collate
data through participatory techniques, and in engaging communities in management decision making. The output and use
of the tool has been of secondary value. The outcome was invaluable for developing marine protected area network design
approaches that combine traditional knowledge with ecological features in a manner appropriate to a Melanesian context.

Introduction
Conservation planning is the process by which conservation
areas are located, configured and managed in some way to
promote the persistence of natural features (Bottrill and Pressey
2009). Systematic approaches to conservation planning (Margules
and Pressey 2000), which involve working through a structured,
transparent and defensible process of decision-making, increasingly underpin the conservation and management of marine
and coastal ecosystems worldwide (Bottrill and Pressey 2009).
However, whilst the Pacific islands have a long history of
community-based marine resource management (Johannes
2002), systematic conservation planning has had very little
influence in this region.
There are substantial challenges to undertaking systematic
conservation planning in the Western Pacific (Weeks et al.
2014): local communities are highly dependent upon natural
resources; management of marine resources is typically decentralised and often under customary systems of governance; few
ecological or socioeconomic datasets are available across the
regional extents required by systematic conservation planning;
Journal compilation  CSIRO 2016

and in-country capacity to undertake planning is lacking.
Nevertheless, new approaches are needed to address the
growing threats to the regions resources, and conservation
planning might provide a means to better coordinate communitybased management actions to increase their overall impact.
In Pacific Island Countries increased local subsistence
harvests and commercial fishing have left most coastal waters
in the region overfished (Gillett 2009; Bell et al. 2011). In
response, a growing number of villages have begun to regulate
the use of their marine areas through the establishment of
locally-managed marine areas (LMMAs). To date there are
hundreds of these LMMAs in operation around the region
(http://www.lmmanetwork.org/).
Management
measures
employed within LMMAs include permanent no-take marine
protected areas (MPAs), periodically harvested fisheries
closures, species-specific regulations such as size limits, fishing
gear and access restrictions (Jupiter et al. 2014).
The benefits of permanent, no-take MPAs have been widely
demonstrated in the literature. Over time, MPAs have shown
conservation benefits through increased abundance, biomass,

density, body size, species diversity and richness of targeted
fishes and invertebrates (Russ and Alcala 2003a; McClanahan
and Graham 2005). MPAs have also offered fisheries benefits
through spillover effects outside MPA boundaries (McClanahan
and Kaunda-Arara 1996; McClanahan and Mangi 2000) and
may contribute towards poverty alleviation and increase the
quality of life of surrounding communities (Allison et al. 1998;
Leisher et al. 2007; Gurney et al. 2014).
In Fiji, as the number of LMMAs and MPAs has increased,
there has been a shift in focus towards management of these sites
at the provincial level. The Province of Kadavu has been leading
the way in this regard. The Kadavu Provincial Administration
(with support from the Institute of Applied Science of the
University of the South Pacific, IAS-USP) established the
Kadavu Yaubula (living-wealth) Management Support Team
(KYMST) to promote the sustainable development and utilisation of Kadavus natural resources. Since its establishment, the
KYMST has taken a lead role in resource management initiatives, environmental awareness and protection activities in the
Province.
Since 1997, 60 MPAs have been established within LMMAs
with support from the provincial office. The boundaries of these
MPAs were selected by the local communities to meet localscale conservation and fisheries needs, as determined through
community-based adaptive-management processes (Govan
et al. 2008) and informed by community-level political boundaries and governance considerations. Each iqoliqoli (traditional
fishing ground) in Kadavu is now under some form of management, with many having at least one MPA within their boundaries.
As this ground-swell of management has grown, greater
consideration has been given to principles of MPA placement
and the nature of management interventions being undertaken.
Many management interventions are believed to contribute
towards food security at the individual community level

(Tawake et al. 2005; Leisher et al. 2007; UNEP/GRID-Arendal
2008). For instance, results from five LMMA sites across
Kadavu saw a 55% increase in fish abundance within MPAs
compared with 30% increase in harvested areas between 2003
and 2007 (Tawake et al. 2005). Similarly, there was a 30%
increase in invertebrates within MPAs and 10% increase in
adjacent harvest areas (Tawake et al. 2005). However, individual MPAs lack the coordinated island-wide outcomes sought
by the province and the biodiversity conservation benefits
associated with an integrated network of MPAs. Furthermore,
some of the existing MPAs were located far offshore and were
thus subject to poaching, others had disputed boundaries, and
some communities had lifted their MPAs after observing no
change in fish populations after one or two years of protection.
Here we describe the process undertaken by the IAS-USP,
the KYMST and the communities of Kadavu to strengthen the
MPA network design to better achieve both local and provincial
objectives. This represents one of the first attempts to use
systematic conservation planning tools to inform customary
governance of natural resources, providing an opportunity to
evaluate the effectiveness of these tools in this context.
Methods
Study site
Kadavu is a volcanic island arc in the Fiji Island group located in
the South-west Pacific (Fig. 1). The island province is the fourth
largest island in Fiji and is considered to be an area of great
natural beauty and resource wealth. The island consists of
75 villages in nine districts, with a total population of ,10 200,
most of whom rely almost entirely on fishing and farming for
their livelihood. Kadavu has a land mass of 475 km2 and
31 iqoliqolis covering an area of 719 km2. Under the Fiji
Fisheries Act these iqoliqolis, which range in size from 0.01 km2

to 88 km2, are under a system of customary usage rights (Clarke
and Jupiter 2010). Typically, many villages will share usage
rights over an iqoliqoli. In this case the iqoliqoli is further
subdivided into ikanakana (or grounds from which food can be
caught). It is estimated that there are 75 ikanakana around
Kadavu, approximately one per village. However, ikanakana
are not legally recognised or demarcated, and in many cases
their boundaries may be disputed. Our study region covers the
main island of Kadavu which includes 29 inshore iqoliqolis with
a total shallow reef area of ,200 km2 (Fig. 1).
Community engagement and resource-use mapping
In Fiji, the customary marine tenure system qualifies the people
of Kadavu to be the primary stakeholders because of their customary fishing rights over the iqoliqolis and the resources within
(South and Veitayaki 1998). Initial engagement with local
communities began in 2007, when a visioning exercise was
conducted by the research team from the IAS-USP as part of a
workshop facilitated by individuals from the US National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This workshop
brought together government representatives, local community
leaders and individuals working within the Province who were
instrumental in the development of the KYMST. The workshop
reconfirmed the province-wide principles of marine resource
management. However, perhaps the most important concept
was that the workshop went as far as to explore the potential for
trans-iqoliqoli-boundary MPA networks if these were likely to
have a greater management potential than the sum of the existing
individual MPAs.
At this workshop, stakeholders expressed a commitment to
undertaking an island-wide initiative to establish a network of
interconnected MPAs across the province to maximise fisheries
benefits. Their goal was to protect 30% of their iqoliqoli shallow
reef habitats within a network of MPAs that considered, where
possible, the International Union for Conservation of Nature
World Commission on Protected Areas criteria for MPA network design (IUCNWCPA 2008). An additional target was to
protect at least 80% of known reef fish spawning aggregation
sites (SPAGs). The communities requested assistance with
spatial planning to identify ecologically significant areas to
protect, whilst emphasising the need to consider site-based
traditional governance and ecological knowledge in the design
of the network.
In 2009, one-day workshops were conducted by the team
from the IAS-USP in each of the eight districts around the main
island of Kadavu. Key representatives were invited from each
district to gather information on resource-use patterns, governance and cultural considerations across iqoliqolis (Wendt
2013). In order to maximise attendance, the most accessible
and centrally located village was chosen as the workshop venue
in each district. The maximum number of attendees per district
workshop was 25, including different stakeholder groups based
on the following criteria and covering a wide range of age groups
and both former and current marine resource users: three chiefs
from villages within the district; three representatives from
District Environment Committees; three village headman from
the district; three village fishermen from the district; two
commercial fishermen from the district; two members of the
KYMST from that district; three community representatives

who conduct biological monitoring; three iqoliqoli owners; and
three fisherwomen representatives.
Where socioeconomic data are not available at scales relevant to conservation planning (Cameron et al. 2008; Polasky
2008; Ban et al. 2009; Weeks et al. 2010b), local knowledge
may offer the best information available. During the workshop,
participatory mapping techniques were used whereby participants were divided into groups according to iqoliqoli user rights
ownership. Copies of laminated maps showing satellite imagery
and iqoliqoli boundaries overlaid with hexagonal grids were
provided to participants to identify areas that the communities
felt were important to include or exclude in the MPA network
design. A list of questions prompted each group to indicate on
the map areas that were important fishing grounds for different
gear types and sites of ecological significance (e.g. turtle nesting
sites, fish spawning aggregations) of which they were aware, to
consider whether they were able to enforce any existing MPAs,
and whether any governance boundaries were disputed (see
Appendix 1). The information collected from communities was
brought back to IAS-USP so that community responses could be
digitised and used to identify priority areas for conservation.
In order to assess how well the existing system of communitybased MPAs represented coral reef habitats, we undertook
extensive field surveys to ground-truth the distributions of key
shallow reef habitats derived from satellite imagery, using
methodology adapted from Roelfsema et al. (2013). This led
to the production of maps of reef geomorphic zones, shallow
reef benthic structures and habitat types. These maps were
then used to assess the existing system of MPAs against the
IUCN ecological networking principles for MPAs; gaps in
the current protection status for important marine areas were
also evaluated.
Spatial prioritisation using Marxan with Zones
Marxan is a decision support tool that has been used in the design
of marine reserves worldwide (Airame et al. 2003; Leslie 2005).
Marxan with Zones (Marxan Z) is an extension of the Marxan
software that is able to assign planning units to multiple zones
(i.e. MPAs and fishing areas) and incorporate multiple costs into
a systematic planning framework (Watts et al. 2008). When
running Marxan Z, the software allocates each planning unit in
the study region to a particular zone in order to meet several
ecological, social and economic objectives at a minimum total
cost. We used Marxan Z to identify MPA networks that would
achieve conservation and fisheries objectives specified by the
communities on Kadavu, integrating habitat data derived
from ground-truthed satellite imagery with local knowledge of
ecologically, economically and culturally important sites.
As a result of the 2009 socio-cultural and resource-use
workshops, six important geographic information systems
(GIS) layers were identified: three layers of significant
sites that should be included in the MPA network, and three
layers associated with costs of MPA establishment. Significant
sites identified by the communities included: (1) SPAGs,
(2) turtle nesting sites, and (3) sites of cultural importance.
Information on significant sites gained from community traditional knowledge was a priority inclusion as input conservation
features in the Marxan Z analysis and in the redesign process of
the community-based MPA network.

(b) disputed areas; (c) enforceability distance; (d ) significant sites.

The cost layers included: (1) fishing use intensity (i.e.
opportunity cost), (2) disputed areas, and (3) enforceability
(Fig. 2). Fishing grounds identified in each iqoliqoli were
assigned to grid cells, validated using a rule set that constrained
fishing gears to the appropriate depth zone (e.g. gleaning can
only be undertaken in depths ,5 m), summed and weighted to
give equal importance to avoiding opportunity costs in each
iqoliqoli. There were certain areas within an iqoliqoli where
there have been historic disputes regarding traditional ownership. These disputed areas were assigned a high cost due to the
perceived difficulty of implementing and enforcing an MPA in
these areas. In most of the villages in the study area, the ability of
the local community to enforce MPAs is limited. Few have
access to boats, and those that do have limited access to fuel to
undertake enforcement patrols. It was therefore considered
important that any MPA be established within a relatively short
distance from a village, and certainly within line-of-sight. Thus,
an enforceability cost layer was created as the distance of each
planning unit from the nearest village. The three cost layers were
scaled from 0 to 1 to be used in the Marxan Z analysis.
The study region covering the entire inshore iqoliqoli areas
was divided into 29 728 1.5-ha hexagonal planning units, to
which information on the conservation features they contained
and costs of inclusion in the MPA network were assigned.
Conservation targets were to include in the MPA network
30% of the total extent of identified habitat types (continuous
corals, patchy corals, sparse corals, patchy coralline algae, dense
seagrass, sparse seagrass and patchy mangrove), and 80% of
SPAGs, cultural sites and turtle nesting sites identified by
communities. Targets were set for both the MPA and fishing
zones with the aim to distribute costs and benefits more equitably across all iqoliqolis. In addition to minimising opportunity,
enforceability, and disputed area costs, we specified fisheries

objectives to ensure that at least 60% of each iqoliqoli remained
open to fishing. Conservation targets for the MPA zone were set
across the entire network, whilst the fishing targets were set for
each iqoliqoli. We used Marxans boundary length modifier to
define a degree of clumping that produced compact areas that
were more or less the same size as existing MPAs.
We produced two Marxan Z outputs, based on two different
scenarios. First, the best run solution (Ardron et al. 2010) was
an output with the existing MPAs locked in and with conservation targets included. In this scenario, the contribution already
made by the existing MPAs was recognised by Marxan Z and
only additional areas to make up the shortfall between existing
protection and the overall target were identified. It was decided
early on in the study that, as many of the MPAs have been
established for many years, the costs associated with relocating
them would be considerable. This output was specifically
produced for those communities who wanted to retain their
existing MPAs but added additional areas to achieve the overall
targets. Second, the selection frequency solution was an output
without the existing MPAs locked in and with conservation
targets included. In this scenario, only the overall feature targets
were recognised by Marxan. This output was specifically for
communities who expressed a desire to move the location of the
existing MPAs within their iqoliqoli or for those communities
who did not have any MPAs before this study.
Redesigning the MPA network
In February 2011, the team from IAS-USP worked with the
KYMST and Kadavu Fisheries Department to conduct four
community-level workshops to communicate the outputs
from the reserve design scenarios and use these, through a
collaborative planning process, to redesign the existing
system of community-based MPAs to better protect identified

conservation features and fisheries targets (Wendt 2013). A
similar criterion to that used by the 2009 workshop was used
to include the same stakeholders and decision makers in the
network-redesign process. The redesign process used satellite
imagery as base maps, with tracing paper overlays indicating
priority conservation areas derived from the Marxan Z analyses
(Fig. 3). These maps were used in the workshop to assist in the
community discussions. In some instances communities wanted
to retain their existing MPAs, and to add additional areas. Where
this was the case, the best-run maps were most frequently used to
guide the selection of areas for new MPAs. In other instances,
some communities expressed a desire to move the location of
their existing MPAs within their iqoliqoli to other areas that
would contribute more towards conservation objectives. In these
cases the selection-frequency maps were of most value in
identifying these areas. Some villages that did not have any
MPAs before this study used the best-run and the selectionfrequency maps together. All modifications to the MPA network
were endorsed at the relevant village meetings, and came into
effect on 1 March 2011.
Results
The existing system of community-based MPAs protected 12%
of key shallow reef habitats, 41% of SPAG sites, 24% of the area
of turtle nesting sites and 7% of culturally important areas
identified by communities (Table 1). Following the collaborative redesign workshops, a redesigned MPA network was finalised with communities based on the Marxan Z output scenarios.
The number of MPAs increased from 60 to 77 (Fig. 4). Of the 60
existing MPAs at the start of the study, 35 were unchanged,
whilst the remaining 25 were modified in some way (12
increased in size, three decreased in size, nine were moved, and
one large area was split into four smaller areas). In addition, 14
new MPAs were established. Nine villages that did not have any
MPAs before this study now have managed MPAs. The total
area of shallow reefs within MPAs increased from 24 km2 (12%)
to 38 km2 (19%) as a result of the redesign process.
Table 1 summarises the effects of redesigning the MPA
network parameter by parameter. Most parameters assessed show

that the post-redesign network is likely to perform better ecologically than the existing MPA system. However, the need to avoid
placing MPAs offshore, where enforcement is more difficult, is
one cause for caution. Given that different habitat types are
arranged onshore to offshore, and that providing for ecological
linkages between habitats is one of the fundamental design
principles for MPA networks (Fernandes et al. 2005), this
suggests that MPAs should be arranged to represent the
inshoreoffshore gradient. For Kadavu to establish and enforce
MPAs offshore would require a different management model,
with support from Provincial and National Fisheries Authorities.
Further research on the connectivity of habitats, larval and adult
home-range movements between MPAs might allow for the MPA
network design to be refined without excessive enforcement costs.
Discussion
Although conservation planning research has influenced
conservation actions on the ground in the last two decades (e.g.
Fernandes et al. 2005; Bottrill and Pressey 2009) very few
systematic conservation planning processes have been successfully implemented in regions with customary marine tenure.
Thus, our study provides important insights into the utility of
conservation planning tools and processes in such contexts. We
first discuss three factors that might limit the use of conservation
prioritisation tools such as Marxan Z: the difficulty of using
computerised software in remote and rural regions; the need for
technical capacity to use tools effectively; and the small scale of
natural resource management decision-making. We then discuss
lessons learnt in Kadavu regarding the process of planning: on
constraints to scaling up local management, and incorporating
local knowledge of socioeconomic costs. Finally, we outline
how the Kadavu MPA network might influence future conservation efforts in Fiji.
The utility of systematic conservation planning tools
in customary governance contexts
Recent applications of conservation planning have been
characterised by the use of planning support tools such as
GIS and decision support software (e.g. Marxan). Our study

Conservation planning and customary management

demonstrates that such planning tools can be used offline with
local communities. With unreliable power supply and very little
capacity within communities to operate computerised tools,
workshop participants were provided with colour-printed maps
of satellite imagery and iqoliqoli boundaries, with the MPA
design scenarios on tracing paper overlays (Fig. 3). We believe
that using this offline approach, whilst diminishing the possibility of on-site iterative planning, was critical to ensuring local
ownership of the process and the success of the study. Other
examples of non-computer-based community-based management tools have been used extensively in the region for years.
Participatory mapping, threat analysis and Participatory
Learning and Action rely on simple instruments such as paper
and pens but could also be considered as planning tools
(Veitayaki et al. 2003).
Nevertheless, our study did employ the use of GIS and
Marxan Z by the research team from the IAS-USP. Technical
capacity to implement computer-based spatial planning tools is
very limited in the Pacific Islands region. Many examples of tool
use have relied on the work of researchers who are unlikely to
have a sustained presence in the region (e.g. Game et al. 2011;
Weeks and Jupiter 2013). It is considered unlikely, though not
impossible, that capacity to use specialist conservation planning
software can be mainstreamed into government agencies. One
example of this is the Marine and Coastal Biodiversity in Pacific
Island Countries (MACBIO) project, which is currently providing technical support to the governments of Fiji, Kiribati,
Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu to undertake marine
spatial planning.
In regions with customary marine tenure, management of
natural resources is typically undertaken at small geographic
scales equivalent to individual tenure units (Foale and Manele
2004), in this case iqoliqolis. After several demonstrations of
conservation prioritisation tools at the local scale, there is a
feeling that the use of computer-based tools is perhaps not
necessary. We found that, at the local scale, the real value of
conservation planning was in the process of identifying and
conceptualising the management issue, working with communities to collate data through participatory techniques, and
engaging communities in management decision-making. The
Marxan Z outputs were of secondary value. However, as many
countries in the region begin, under relevant national and
international commitments, to examine the possibilities and
strategies for scaling up from individual site-based management
to national networks of conservation areas, the value of applying
computer-based tools may be realised. We suggest that computerbased spatial planning tools are likely to be most useful in
identifying conservation priorities at the subnational and national
scale, rather than directing management actions at the sitespecific scale.
Constraints on scaling up local management
Whilst it has previously been demonstrated that local management can achieve local objectives (Tawake et al. 2005; Leisher
et al. 2007; UNEP/GRID-Arendal 2008), our study suggests that
coordination of local management initiatives across greater
spatial extents can result in greater conservation benefits.
Nevertheless, we identified two important constraints on
horizontal coordination (i.e. adjacent districts working together):

first, the clear need to avoid disputed areas, and, second, that
communities were strongly opposed to the idea of merged,
jointly managed MPAs. Whilst trans-boundary protected areas
or peace parks have been proposed as a means to scale-up local
management to overcome social-ecological scale mismatches
(Sandwith et al. 2001; Mackelworth 2012; Weeks et al. 2014),
our experience in Kadavu suggests that placing MPAs over the
boundaries of tenure areas/jurisdictions does not allow for clear
ownership and responsibility for management to a particular
community, potentially undermining compliance and enforcement of the area.
Equitability and socioeconomic costs
In Kadavu, it was considered critical to consider the equitability
of costs and benefits of the MPA network. The inequitable
distribution of conservation costs and benefits among stakeholders may cause disagreements between communities, poor
compliance, and implementation failure (Cinner 2007; Klein
et al. 2010; Grantham et al. 2013). For this reason, we
standardised opportunity costs across the different iqoliqolis,
and specified fisheries targets (for the amount of each iqoliqoli
that must remain open to fishing) to avoid disproportionately
impacting any one community. This was considered particularly
important since resource-user rights do not extend beyond the
boundaries of their iqoliqoli and communities may not be able to
redistribute fishing effort to areas outside their iqoliqoli after
MPA implementation.
During the redesign process, the location of individual
MPAs was more important to communities than the design of
the MPA network overall. While seeking to achieve the overall
conservation targets without consideration of stakeholder
interests within each iqoliqoli would have a lesser overall cost
per unit area protected than seeking to minimise cost to each
iqoliqoli individually, in regions where resource-use patterns
are defined by traditional tenure systems, it is more important
to minimise costs to each local community individually than to
minimise the overall cost of an MPA network (Weeks et al.
2010a). This is in contrast with previous studies where minimising the overall cost of the entire marine reserve system was
the primary objective (Stewart and Possingham 2005; Naidoo
et al. 2006).
The final MPA network implemented by communities is
costlier than the existing MPA system, when calculated as the
sum of opportunity, enforceability, and disputed area costs of
planning units included in the network. This increase in cost was
the result of two villages choosing to establish offshore MPAs
(with high enforcement cost) due to interest in potential dive
tourism activities. Tourism, which is a potential industry on
Kadavu, and might generate income to offset the costs associated
with MPA enforcement, was not taken into account in the initial
planning stage. Later in the redesign process stakeholders
expressed their interest in tourism and the potential benefits it
might bring to their villages. Thus, despite the inclusion of three
socioeconomic cost layers mapped through participatory process,
these did not adequately identify all costs and opportunities for
communities. This emphasises the importance of engaging as
many stakeholders as possible in the initial stages of conservation
planning, and the need for several iterations of consultation and
planning.

Moving forwards
All modifications to the Kadavu MPA network were endorsed at
the relevant village meetings, and came into effect on 1 March
2011. In developed countries, conservation areas are usually
established under national law (e.g. Airame et al. 2003;
Fernandes et al. 2005; Gleason et al. 2010), which can be a
lengthy process. In Kadavu the presence of the chiefs and
iqoliqoli owners, who are the ultimate decision makers regarding
management of their iqoliqolis, during discussion throughout the
MPA redesign process meant that changes and additions to the
network were implemented quickly. This is perhaps the greatest
advantage of conservation planning within a customary governance context.
At present, Kadavu Province has the highest number of
MPAs to be established by a province in Fiji. It is envisaged
that the work done in Kadavu will inform the successful
integration of a networking approach with community-based
marine resource management in other provinces, and finally at
the national level in Fiji. The aim is that this will assist the
national government of Fiji to implement its commitment to
effectively conserve 30% of its inshore marine resources.
Moving forwards, it will be important to understand the contribution of community management actions towards achieving
conservation success at the national level (Mills et al. 2011). The
inclusion of more permanent MPAs in the different management
zones along with other management actions will likely be
required to achieve the 30% national targets in the future.

Appendix 1. List of questions used to elucidate GIS and Marxan Z layers
Session 1: Important fishing and resource-use
1. What are the five most important gears you use for subsistence, artisanal and commercial fishing respectively? Please map where these gears are used in
your iqoliqoli? Example: handline, spear fishing, etc
Session 2: Governance issue
2. Are the iqoliqoli boundaries by Native Lands and Fisheries Commission correct? If not, please mark out the boundaries that you know.
3. Are there any areas in your iqoliqoli that are disputed? Please map these disputed areas.
4. Are the MPA boundaries you see correct? If not, please mark out the changed/current boundaries that you know.
5. Are you able to enforce MPAs that are not within line-of-sight or far offshore?
Session 3: Mapping significant sites
6. Are there any significant sites in your iqoliqoli? For example SPAGs, turtle nesting sites, etc.? Are these sites fished or not?
