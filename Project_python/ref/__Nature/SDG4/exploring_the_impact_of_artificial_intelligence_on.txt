Abstract
This paper explores the phenomena of the emergence of the use of artificial intelligence
in teaching and learning in higher education. It investigates educational implications of
emerging technologies on the way students learn and how institutions teach and evolve.
Recent technological advancements and the increasing speed of adopting new
technologies in higher education are explored in order to predict the future nature of
higher education in a world where artificial intelligence is part of the fabric of our
universities. We pinpoint some challenges for institutions of higher education and
student learning in the adoption of these technologies for teaching, learning, student
support, and administration and explore further directions for research.

Introduction
The future of higher education is intrinsically linked with developments on new
technologies and computing capacities of the new intelligent machines. In this
field, advances in artificial intelligence open to new possibilities and challenges for
teaching and learning in higher education, with the potential to fundamentally
change governance and the internal architecture of institutions of higher education. With answers to the question of what is artificial intelligence shaped by
philosophical positions taken since Aristotle, there is little agreement on an ultimate definition.
In 1950s, Alan Turing proposed a solution to the question of when a system
designed by a human is intelligent. Turing proposed the imitation game, a test that
involves the capacity of a human listener to make the distinction of a conversation
with a machine or another human; if this distinction is not detected, we can admit that
we have an intelligent system, or artificial intelligence (AI). It is worth remembering
that the focus on AI solutions goes back to 1950s; in 1956 John McCarthy offered one
of the first and most influential definitions: The study [of artificial intelligence] is to
proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other
feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be
made to simulate it. (Russell and Norvig 2010).

Since 1956, we find various theoretical understandings of artificial intelligence that
are influenced by chemistry, biology, linguistics, mathematics, and the advancements of
AI solutions. However, the variety of definitions and understandings remains widely
disputed. Most approaches focus on limited perspectives on cognition or simply ignore
the political, psychological, and philosophical aspects of the concept of intelligence. For
the purpose of our analysis of the impact of artificial intelligence in teaching and
learning in higher education, we propose a basic definition informed by the literature
review of some previous definitions on this field. Thus, we can define artificial
intelligence (AI) as computing systems that are able to engage in human-like processes
such as learning, adapting, synthesizing, self-correction and use of data for complex
processing tasks.
Artificial intelligence is currently progressing at an accelerated pace, and this already
impacts on the profound nature of services within higher education. For example,
universities already use an incipient form of artificial intelligence, IBMs supercomputer
Watson. This solution provides student advice for Deakin University in Australia at any
time of day throughout 365 days of the year (Deakin University 2014). Even if it is
based on algorithms suitable to fulfill repetitive and relatively predictable tasks,
Watsons use is an example of the future impact of AI on the administrative workforce
profile in higher education. This is changing the structure for the quality of services,
the dynamic of time within the university, and the structure of its workforce. A supercomputer able to provide bespoke feedback at any hour is reducing the need to employ
the same number of administrative staff previously serving this function. In this context, it is also important to note that machine learning is a promising field of artificial
intelligence. While some AI solutions remain dependent on programming, some have
an inbuilt capacity to learn patterns and make predictions. An example is AlphaGoa
software developed by DeepMind, the AI branch of Googlesthat was able to defeat
the worlds best player at Go, a very complex board game (Gibney 2017). We define
machine learning as a subfield of artificial intelligence that includes software able to
recognize patterns, make predictions, and apply the newly discovered patterns to
situations that were not included or covered by their initial design.

Results and discussion
As AI solutions have the potential to structurally change university administrative
services, the realm of teaching and learning in higher education presents a very
different set of challenges. Artificial intelligence solutions relate to tasks that can be
automated, but cannot be yet envisaged as a solution for more complex tasks of higher
learning. The difficulty of supercomputers to detect irony, sarcasm, and humor is
marked by various attempts that are reduced to superficial solutions based on
algorithms that can search factors such as a repetitive use of punctuations marks, use
of capital letters or key phrases (Tsur et al. 2010). There is a new hype about possibilities of AI in education, but we have reasons to stay aware of the real limits of AI
algorithmic solutions in complex endeavors of learning in higher education.
For example, we can remember that the enthusiastic and unquestioned trust in the
AI capabilities of a revolutionary new car led on May 2016 to the death of the driver,
when the car set on autopilot went underneath a tractor-trailer that was not detected
by the software (Reuters/ABC 2016). There is also the story of Microsofts embarrassing

mistake to trust the AI-powered bot named Tay to go unsupervised on Twitter.
Confident on the bot capacity to operate independently, Microsoft discovered that
Tay turned fast into a racist, bigoted, and hate-spewing account. Tay had to be
shut down by Microsoft after only 16 h of work. For example, Tay answered the
question Are you a racist? with a disturbing because ur mexican. A Microsoft
spokesperson explained that: The AI chatbot Tay is a machine learning project,
designed for human engagement. It is as much a social and cultural experiment, as
it is technical. Unfortunately, within the first 24 hours of coming online, we
became aware of a coordinated effort by some users to abuse Tays commenting
skills to have Tay respond in inappropriate ways. As a result, we have taken Tay
offline and are making adjustments. (Perez 2016).
There is consistent evidencesome presented in this paperthat AI solutions open
a new horizon of possibilities for teaching and learning in higher education. However, it
is important to admit the current limits of technology and admit that AI is not (yet)
ready to replace teachers, but is presenting the real possibility to augment them. We
are now seeing computing algorithms impacting on the most mundane aspects of daily
life, from individuals credit scores to employability. Higher education is placed at the
center of this profound change, which brings with it both extraordinary opportunities
and risks. This important crossroad requires careful consideration and analysis from an
academic perspective, especially as we can find tendencies to look at technological
progress as a solution or replacement for sound pedagogical solutions or good teaching.
The real potential of technology in higher education iswhen properly usedto
extend human capabilities and possibilities of teaching, learning, and research. The
purpose of this paper is to kindle scholarly discussions on the evolving field of artificial
intelligence in higher education. This stays aligned with some of the most ambitious
research agendas in the field, such as the National Artificial Intelligence Research and
Development Strategic Plan, released by the US President Barack Obama in October
2016. The Report states that the walls between humans and AI systems are slowly
beginning to erode, with AI systems augmenting and enhancing human capabilities.
Fundamental research is needed to develop effective methods for human-AI interaction
and collaboration (U.S. National Science and Technology Council 2016).
As we note that significant advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence
open new possibilities and challenges for higher education, it is important to observe
that education is eminently a human-centric endeavor, not a technology centric solution. Despite rapid advancements in AI, the idea that we can solely rely on technology
is a dangerous path, and it is important to maintain focus on the idea that humans
should identify problems, critique, identify risks, and ask important questions that can
start from issues such as privacy, power structures, and control to the requirement of
nurturing creativity and leaving an open door to serendipity and unexpected paths in
teaching and learning. The hype on AI can lead to an unquestioned panacea that can
leave many who are on their path to higher learning under the wheels of reality, such
as that tragic event of the driver led under a truck by what was considered to be a
matchless software. Maintaining academic skepticism on this issue is especially important in education, as this is an act that can be reduced to information delivery and
recollection; we need to maintain its aim to build educated minds and responsible
citizens that are attached to general values of humanism.

The role of technology in higher learning is to enhance human thinking and to
augment the educational process, not to reduce it to a set of procedures for content
delivery, control, and assessment. With the rise of AI solutions, it is increasingly
important for educational institutions to stay alert and see if the power of control over
hidden algorithms that run them is not monopolized by tech-lords. Frank Pasquale
notes in his seminal book The Black Box Society that Decisions that used to be based
on human reflection are now made automatically. Software encodes thousands of rules
and instructions computed in a fraction of a second (Pasquale 2015). Pasquale is
revealing in his book that we do not only have a quasi-concentrated and powerful
monopoly over these solutions, but also an intentional lack of transparency on
algorithms and how they are used. This is presented casually as a normal state of facts,
the natural arrangements of Internet era, but it translates to highly dangerous levels of
unquestioned power. Those who control algorithms that run AI solutions have now
unprecedented influence over people and every sector of a contemporary society. The
internal architecture of the mega-corporations such as Facebook or Google is not
following a democratic model, but those of benevolent dictators who know what is best
and decide with no consultation with their internal or external subjects. The monopoly
and the strong control over sources of information, stifling critique and silencing de
facto through invisibilisation views that are not aligned with interest and narratives
promoted by techlords interests stand in direct opposition with higher learning.
Universities have a role if they encourage dissent and open possibilities revealed by it.
Higher learning is withering when the freedom of thinking and inquiry is suppressed in
any form, as manipulations and the limitation of knowledge distorts and cancel indepth understandings and the advancement of knowledge. If we reach a point where
the agenda of universities is set by a handful of techlords, as well as the control over
their information and the ethos of universities, higher education is looking ahead a very
different age. The set of risks is too important to be overlooked and not explored with
courage and careful analysis.
At the same time, the rapid advancements of AI are doubled by the effort of
defunded universities to find economic solutions to balance depleted budgets. AI
already presents the capability to replace a large number of administrative staff and
teaching assistants in higher education. It is therefore important to explore the effects of these factors on learning in higher education, especially in the context of
an increasing demand for initiative, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit for
graduates. This paper opens an inquiry into the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on
teaching and learning and higher education. It also operates as an exploratory analysis of
literature and recent studies on how AI can change not only how students learn in universities, but also on the entire architecture of higher education.

The rise of artificial intelligence and augmentation in higher education

The introduction and adoption of new technologies in learning and teaching has rapidly
evolved over the past 30 years. Looking through the current lens, it is easy to forget the
debates that have raged in our institutions over students being allowed to use what are
now regarded as rudimentary technologies. In a longitudinal study of accommodations
for students with a disability conducted between 1993 and 2005 in the USA, authors

Page 4 of 13

Popenici and Kerr Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2017) 12:22

remind us of how contentious the debate was surrounding the use of the calculators and
spell check programs for students with a disability none-the-less the general student body
(Lazarus et al. 2008). Assistive technologiessuch as text to speech, speech to text, zoom
capacity, predictive text, spell checkers, and search enginesare just some examples of
technologies initially designed to assist people with a disability. The use of these technological solutions was later expanded, and we find them now as generic features in all
personal computers, handheld devices or wearable devices. These technologies now
augment the learning interactions of all students globally, enhancing possibilities opened
for teaching and design of educational experiences.
Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) is now enhancing tools and instruments used
day by day in cities and campuses around the world. From Internet search engines,
smartphone features and apps, to public transport and household appliances. For
example, the complex set of algorithms and software that power iPhones Siri is a
typical example of artificial intelligence solutions that became part of everyday experiences (Bostrom and Yudkowsky 2011; Luckin 2017). Even if Apples Siri is labeled as a
low complexity AI solution or simply a voice controlled computer interface, it is
important to remember that it started as an artificial intelligence project funded in the
USA by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) since 2001. This
project was turned a year later into a company that was acquired by Apple, which
integrated the application in its iPhone operation system in 2007. Google is using AI
for its search engines and maps, and all new cars use AI from engine to breaks and
navigation. Self-driving technology is already advanced, and some major companies are
making this a top priority for development, such as Tesla, Volvo, Mercedes, and Google
(Hillier et al. 2015) and trials on public roads in Australia commenced in 2015.
Remarkably, a mining corporation is already taking advantage of self-driving
technologies, now using self-driving trucks for two major exploitations in Western
Australia (Diss 2015).
Personalized solutions are also closer than we imagined: new scientist presented at
the end of 2015 the initiative of Talkspace and IBMs Watson to use artificial
intelligence in psychotherapy (Rutkin 2015). This seems to be a major step towards
changing the complex endeavor of education with AI. In fact, Nick Bostrom, Director
of the Future of Humanity Institute at the UKs Oxford University, observed since 2006
that artificial intelligence is now an integral part of our daily life: A lot of cutting edge
AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once
something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labelled AI anymore
(Bostrom 2006). Again, very few people identify today Siri as a typical example of
artificial intelligence and more as an algorithm-based personal assistant that is part of
everyday life experiences. Given their increasing role within the global digital
infrastructure, this also begs the question as to how algorithms are conceived of as we
prepare ourselves for a range of different possible futures.
Students are placed now at the forefront of a vast array of possibilities and challenges
for learning and teaching in higher education. Solutions for human-AI interaction and
collaboration are already available to help people with disabilities. They can inspire
educators to apply them in education to augment learners and teachers for a more
engaging process. Carl Mitcham describes in his Encyclopedia of Science, Technology
and Ethics a cyborg as a crossbreed of a human and a machine (Mitcham 2005). The

Page 5 of 13

Popenici and Kerr Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2017) 12:22

idea of cyborgs is not as far away as we may imagine, as the possibilities to combine
human capacities with new technologies are already being used and developed at an
accelerated pace. For example, Hugh Herr, who is directing the Biomechatronics group
at the MIT Media Lab and works with the HarvardMIT Division of Health Sciences
and Technology, recently observed in an interview for new scientist that disability
will end, Id say, by the end of this century. And I think thats a very conservative statement. At the rate technology is progressing, most disability will be gone in 50 years
(De Lange 2015, p. 25). This company is producing technologically advanced prosthetics and exoskeletons, pioneering bionic technology for people with or without a disability. He notes that his research group developed an interface that uses biology to close
the loop between human and machine [] Imagine a world where our physicality
doesnt decrease as we age (De Lange 2015, p. 24). Complex computing systems using
machine learning algorithms can serve people with all types of abilities and engage to a
certain degree in human-like processes and complex processing tasks that can be
employed in teaching and learning. This opens to a new era for institutions of higher
education.
This type of human-machine interface presents the immediate potential to
change the way we learn, memorize, access, and create information. The question
of how long it will take to use this type of interface to enhance human memory
and cognition is one which we are currently unable to answer. It may turn to reality beyond the end of this century, as the MIT scholar suggests or much sooner
when we consider the pace of change in the technologies used in teaching and
learning since 2007 when the first iPhone was launched. Since then, not only has
the iPhone integrated breakthrough technologies that seemed impossible just a few
years ago to how we access and use information (such as fingerprint identification
and the intelligent Siri assistant), but this technology has introduced a significant
cultural shift that impacts on our everyday lives. Either way, if we shift the focus
of cyborgs from science-fiction to the idea of computer augmented capacity for
teachers and students alike, it is not unrealistic to consider that cyborgsor crossbreeds of human and machineswill soon be a reality in teaching and research in
universities of the near future.
The impact of artificial intelligence is already visible in the world economy and
has captured the attention of many analysts. The largest investment ever made by
Google in the European Union is the acquisition in 2014 of DeepMind technologies, with $400 million. DeepMind Technologies, now named Google DeepMind, is
a London-based artificial intelligence startup specialized in machine learning and
advanced algorithms. Notably, Google also made significant investments in the
German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI GmbH), which is, according to their website, the biggest research center worldwide in the area of Artificial
Intelligence and its application, in terms of number of employees and the volume
of external funds (DFKI 2015). Tech giants like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and
Facebook currently compete in the field of artificial intelligence and are investing
heavily in new applications and research. Google announced in December 2015
that the companys quantum computer called D-Wave 2X will be used for complex
operations of AI, generically referred to as optimization problems (Neven 2015).
This new machine is 100 million times faster than any other contemporary

Page 6 of 13

Popenici and Kerr Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2017) 12:22

computers, a serious leap ahead for AI, considered by Google researchers as a significant breakthrough: We hope it helps researchers construct more efficient and
more accurate models for everything from speech recognition, to web search, to
protein folding (Neven 2013).
This wave of interest and investments in artificial intelligence will soon impact
on universities. Most likely, financial pressures related to the large numbers of
students currently undertaking higher education driven by the goal of
democratization of higher education, and the international student market will
stand as a compelling reason to seek out AI solutions. The outsourcing of the
academic workforce, in terms of numbers of academics employed and tenured positions, is now open to a massive takeover by intelligent machines (Grove 2015).
Massification of higher education and the political call to cut public funding for
universities translates into a real need to cut costs. With research still being the
main source of funds and prestige in international rankings, the MOOC hype
unveiled the tempting solution for many university administrators to cut costs by
reducing expensive academic teaching staff. This shift is currently being aggressively pursued in Australian universities, with a constant shift towards casual and
short-term contracts; in a study conducted by L.H. Martin Institute it is documented that there is an escalating trend in the number and percentage of academic staff on contingent appointments, and a declining trend in the percentage of
academic staff with continuing appointments who undertake both teaching and research (Andrews et al. 2016). In the UK, we find various initiatives following the
same trend, such as that of University of Warwick, which created a new department to employ all casual teaching staff to outsource teaching. This new department was established to function in a way similar to another subsidiary used to
pay cleaners and catering staff, suitable to serve the University of Warwick and
also sell teaching and assessment services to other institutions (Gallagher 2015).
As examples presented in previous page show, the crossbreed of the human brain and
a machine is already possible, and this will essentially challenge teachers to find new dimensions, functions, and radically new pedagogies for a different context for learning and
teaching. For example, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), that captured the imagination of
researchers across the world, are currently recording significant advances. Using brain signals with various recording and analysis methods, along with innovative technological approaches for new computing systems, specialists in the field now provide feasible
solutions to remotely control software with a brain-computer interface (Andrea et al.
2015). BCIs are now able to capture and decode brain activity to enable communication
and control by individuals with motor function disabilities (Wolpaw and Wolpaw 2012).
Kbler et al. observe that at this point studies have demonstrated fast and reliable control
of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) by healthy subjects and individuals with neurodegenerative disease alike (Kbler et al. 2015). The concept of humanity and the possibilities of
humans stand currently to be redefined by technology with unprecedented speed: technology is quickly expanding the potential to use AI functions to enhance our skills and
abilities. As Andreas Schleicher observed, Innovation in education is not just a matter of
putting more technology into more classrooms; it is about changing approaches to teaching so that students acquire the skills they need to thrive in competitive global economies
(Schleicher 2015).

Past lessons, possibilities, and challenges of AI solutions

Widening participation in higher education and the continuous increase in the number
of students, class sizes, staff costs, and broader financial pressures on universities
makes the use of technology or teacherbots a very attractive solution. This became
evident when massive open online courses (MOOCs) enlightened the imagination of
many university administrators. The understanding of open courses is that no entry
requirements or fees were required, and online students could enroll and participate
from any country in the world with internet access. Both of these factors enabled
universities to market globally for students, resulting in massive enrolment numbers.
The promise was generous, but it soon became evident that one of the problems
created for teachers was their human capacity to actively engage with massive numbers
of diverse students studying globally from different time zones, at different rates of
progress and with different frames of reference and foundational skills for the course
that they are studying. Assisting students in large classes to progress effectively through
their learning experience to achieve desired outcomes, conduct assessments, and
provide constructive personalized feedback remained unsolved issues. Sian Bayne
makes the observation in Teacherbot: Interventions in Automated Teaching, that the
current perspective of using automated methods in teaching are driven by a
productivity-oriented solutionism, not by pedagogical or charitable reasoning, so we
need to re-explore a humanistic perspective for mass education to replace the cold
technocratic imperative (Bayne 2015). Bayne speaks from the experience of meeting
the need created by the development and delivery of a massive open online course by
the University of Edinburgh. This course had approximately 90,000 students from 200
countries enrolled.
The lesson of MOOCs is important and deserves attention. Popenici and Kerr
observed that MOOCs were first used in 2008 and since then: we have been hearing
the promise of a tsunami of change that is coming over higher education. It is not
uncommon with a tsunami to see people enticed by the retreat of the waters going to
collect shells, thinking that this is the change that is upon them. Tragically, the real
change is going to come in the form of a massive wave under which they will perish as
they play on the shores. Similarly, we need to take care that we are not deluded to
confuse MOOCs, which are figuratively just shells on the seabed, with the massive
wall of real change coming our way (Popenici and Kerr 2013). It is becoming
clear in 2016 that MOOCs remain just a different kind of online course, interesting and useful, but not really aimed at or capable of changing the structure and
function of universities. Research and data on this topic reflect the failure of
MOOCs to deliver on their proponents promises. More importantly, the
unreserved and irrational hype that surrounded MOOCs is a when decision-makers
in academia decided to ignore all key principlessuch as evidence-based
arguments or academic skepticismand embrace a fad sold by Silicon Valley
venture capitalists with no interests in learning other than financial profits. As noted in a
recent book chapter this reckless shift impacts on the sustainability of higher learning in
particular and of higher education by and large (Popenici 2015).
There are solid argumentssome cited above in this paperto state that it is more
realistic to consider the impact of machine learning in higher education as the real
wave of change. In effect, lessons of the past show why it is so important to avoid the

Page 8 of 13

Popenici and Kerr Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2017) 12:22

same mistakes revealed by the past fads or to succumb to a convenient complacency
that is serving only the agenda of companies that are in search of new (or bigger) markets. Online learning proved very often the potential to successfully help institutions of
higher education reach some of the most ambitious goals in learning, teaching, and
research. However, the lesson of MOOCs is also that a limited focus on one technology
solution without sufficient evidence-based arguments can become a distraction for
education and a perilous pathway for the financial sustainability of these institutions.
Higher education is now taking its first steps into the unchartered territory of the
possibilities opened by AI in teaching, learning, and higher education organization and
governance. Implications and possibilities of these technological advances can already
be seen. By way of example, recent advancements in non-invasive brain-computer
interfaces and artificial intelligence are opening new possibilities to rethink the role of
the teacher, or make steps towards the replacement of teachers with teacher-robots,
virtual teacherbots (Bayne 2015; Botrel et al. 2015). Providing affordable solutions to
use brain computer interface (BCI) devices capable to measure when a student is fully
focused on the content and learning tasks (Chen et al. 2015; Gonzlez et al. 2015) is
already possible, and super-computers, such as IBMs Watson, can provide an automated teacher presence for the entire duration of a course. The possibility to communicate and command computers through thought and wider applications of AI in
teaching and learning represents the real technological revolution that will dramatically
change the structure of higher education across the world. Personalized learning with a
teacherbot, or cloud-lecturer, can be adopted for blended delivery courses or fully online courses. Teacherbotscomputing solutions for the administrative part of teaching,
dealing mainly with content delivery, basic and administrative feedback and supervisionare already presenting as a disruptive alternative to traditional teaching assistants.
An example is offered by the course offered by Professor Ashok Goel on knowledgebased artificial intelligence (KBAI) in the online Master in Computer Sciences program,
at Georgia Tech in the USA. The teaching assistant was so valued by students that one
wanted to nominate her to the outstanding TA award. This TA managed to meet the
highest expectations of students. The surprise at the end of the course was to find out
that Jill Watson was not a real person, but a teacherbot, a virtual teaching assistant was
based on the IBMs Watson platform (Maderer 2016).
This enlightened the imaginations of many, reaching international news across the
world and respected media outlets such as The New Your Times or The Washington
Post. However, we must be careful when we see the temptation to equate education
with solutions provided by algorithms. There are widespread implications for the
advancement of AI to the point where a computer can serve as a personalized tutor
able to guide and manage students learning and engagement. This opens to the worrying possibility to see a superficial, but profitable, approach where teaching is replaced
by AI automated solutions. Especially as we are at a point where we need to find a new
pedagogical philosophy that can help students achieve the set of skills required in the
twenty-first century for a balanced civic, economic, and social life. We have a new
world that is based on uncertainty and challenges that change at a rapid pace, and all
this requires creativity, flexibility, the capacity to use and adapt to uncertain contexts.
Graduates have to act in a world of value conflicts, information limitations, vast
registers of risks, and radical uncertainty. All this, along with the ongoing possibility of

Page 9 of 13

Popenici and Kerr Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2017) 12:22

staying within personal and group bubbles of and being exposed to vast operations of
manipulation require a new thinking about the use of technology in education and a
new set of graduate attributes. As advanced as AI solutions may become we cannot yet
envisage a future where algorithms can really replace the complexity of human mind.
For certain, current developments show that it is highly unlikely to happen in the next
decade, despite a shared excessive optimism. The AI hype is not yet double by results;
for example, Ruchir Puri, the Chief Architect of Watson, IBMs AI supercomputer,
recently noted that There is a lot of hype around AI, but what it cant do is very big
right now. What it can do is very small.
This reality may encourage policy-makers and experts to reimagine institutions of
higher education in an entirely new paradigm, much more focused on imagination,
creativity, and civic engagement. With the capacity to guide learning, monitor
participation, and student engagement with the content, AI can customize the feed of
information and materials into the course according to learners needs, provide
feedback and encouragement. However, teachers can use this to prepare students to a
world of hyper-complexity where the future is not reduced to the simple aim of
employability. Teacherbots are already presenting as a disruptive alternative to
traditional teaching staff, but it is very important to inquire at this point how do we
use them for the benefit of students in the context of a profound rethink of what is
currently labeled as graduate attributes (Mason et al. 2016).
Even if in 2017 we find little and exploration of what is a teacherbot and what their
capabilities are possible now and in a predictable future, AI technology has slipped into
the backdoor of all our lives and this is imposing a much more focused research in
higher education. AI solutions are currently monitoring our choices, preferences,
movements, measuring strengths, and weaknesses, providing feedback, encouragement,
badges, comparative analytics, customized news feeds, alerts, predictive text, so they
are project managing our lives. At this point, we can see a teacherbot as a complex
algorithmic interface able to use artificial intelligence for personalized education, able
to provide bespoke content, supervision, and guidance for students and help for
teachers. Teacherbots are defined as any machine-based software or hardware that
assumes the role traditionally performed by a teacher assistant in organizing
information and providing fast answers to a wide set of predictable questions; it can be
facilitating, monitoring, assessing, and managing student learning within the online
learning space. These solutions are closer than many academics may think. Tinkering
with the old system of transmitting information to passive students, in class or in front
of computers, is open to disruption from a highly personalized, scaleable, and affordable alternative AI solutions, such as Jill Watson. While contact time and personal
guidance by faculty may be should be retained not only in some elite institutions of
higher education, as this will define the quality of education, but intelligent machines
can be used by all to meet the learning and support needs of massive numbers of
students.

Conclusion
The rise of AI makes it impossible to ignore a serious debate about its future role of
teaching and learning in higher education and what type of choices universities will
make in regard to this issue. The fast pace of technology innovation and the associated

Page 10 of 13

Popenici and Kerr Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning (2017) 12:22

job displacement, acknowledged widely by experts in the field (source), implies that
teaching in higher education requires a reconsideration of teachers role and
pedagogies. The current use of technological solutions such as learning management
systems or IT solutions to detect plagiarism already raise the question of who sets the
agenda for teaching and learning: corporate ventures or institutions of higher
education? The rise of techlords and the quasi-monopoly of few tech giants also come
with questions regarding the importance of privacy and the possibility of a dystopian
future. These issues deserve a special attention as universities should include this set of
risks when thinking about a sustainable future.
Moreover, many sets of tasks that are currently placed at the core of teaching practice
in higher education will be replaced by AI software based on complex algorithms
designed by programmers that can transmit their own biases or agendas in operating
systems. An ongoing critique and inquiry in proposed solutions stay critical to guarantee that universities remain institutions able to maintain civilization, promote, and
develop knowledge and wisdom.
In effect, now is the time for universities to rethink their function and pedagogical
models and their future relation with AI solutions and their owners. Furthermore,
institutions of higher education see ahead the vast register of possibilities and
challenges opened by the opportunity to embrace AI in teaching and learning. These
solutions present new openings for education for all, while fostering lifelong learning in
a strengthened model that can preserve the integrity of core values and the purpose of
higher education.
We consider that there is a need for research on the ethical implications of the
current control on developments of AI and the possibility to wither the richness of
human knowledge and perspectives with the monopoly of few entities. We also believe
that it is important to focus further research on the new roles of teachers on new learning pathways for higher degree students, with a new set of graduate attributes, with a
focus on imagination, creativity, and innovation; the set of abilities and skills that can
hardly be ever replicated by machines.
