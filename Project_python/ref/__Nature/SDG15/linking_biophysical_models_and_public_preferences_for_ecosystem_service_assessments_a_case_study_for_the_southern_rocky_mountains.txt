Abstract Through extensive research, ecosystem services have been mapped using both survey-based and
biophysical approaches, but comparative mapping of public values and those quantified using models has been
lacking. In this paper, we mapped hot and cold spots for
perceived and modeled ecosystem services by synthesizing
results from a social-values mapping study of residents
living near the PikeSan Isabel National Forest (PSI),
located in the Southern Rocky Mountains, with corresponding biophysically modeled ecosystem services.
Social-value maps for the PSI were developed using the
Social Values for Ecosystem Services tool, providing statistically modeled continuous value surfaces for 12 value
types, including aesthetic, biodiversity, and life-sustaining
values. Biophysically modeled maps of carbon sequestration and storage, scenic viewsheds, sediment regulation,

and water yield were generated using the Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services tool. Hotspots for both
perceived and modeled services were disproportionately
located within the PSIs wilderness areas. Additionally, we
used regression analysis to evaluate spatial relationships
between perceived biodiversity and cultural ecosystem
services and corresponding biophysical model outputs. Our
goal was to determine whether publicly valued locations
for aesthetic, biodiversity, and life-sustaining values relate
meaningfully to results from corresponding biophysical
ecosystem service models. We found weak relationships
between perceived and biophysically modeled services,
indicating that public perception of ecosystem service
provisioning regions is limited. We believe that biophysical
and social approaches to ecosystem service mapping can
serve as methodological complements that can advance
ecosystem services-based resource management, benefitting resource managers by showing potential locations of
synergy or conflict between areas supplying ecosystem
services and those valued by the public.

Introduction
A large and rapidly growing body of research seeks to
quantify and value ecosystem goods and servicesthe
benefits that ecosystems provide to people (Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment 2005)in support of better
resource management and decision making (Ruhl et al.
2007; Daily et al. 2009). This has included spatially
explicit biophysical modeling of ecosystem services, both
through modeling tools intended to be applicable across

diverse geographic contexts (Kareiva et al. 2011; Villa
et al. 2014) and locally developed and applied ecosystem
service models (Martinez-Harms and Balvanera 2012). The
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA 2005) advanced
the now well-known typology of supporting services
(ecological processes that underpin the provision of other
types of ecosystem services), regulating services (control
of environmental conditions within optimal ranges for the
survival of people and other species on which we depend),
provisioning services (goods supplied by ecosystems), and
cultural services (nonmaterial benefits that enhance individual and social well-being). Many biophysical ecosystem
service models have developed out of past ecological,
hydrologic, and other physical process models, and have
proven useful in quantifying supporting, regulating, and
provisioning services. By contrast, cultural services have
often remained more difficult to quantify. With the
exception of a limited number of cultural ecosystem services, such as the viewshed component of aesthetic values
(Kareiva et al. 2011; ARIES Consortium 2014), biophysical models are poorly suited to quantifying cultural services. Their intangible nature and the limited collaboration
between ecologists and social scientists outside of the field
of economics have historically limited the opportunities for
cultural services to inform decision making (Chan et al.
2011, 2012; Daniel et al. 2012).
Scientists have, however, mapped public and expert
perceptions of ecosystem services, through Public Participatory Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS)
approaches (Brown 2005; Sieber 2006; Dunn 2007;
Raymond et al. 2009). They have also developed tools to
systematize the mapping of social values for ecosystem
services, i.e., using surveys of the publics values and
attitudes to map their perceived values for ecosystem
services (Sherrouse et al. 2011). We define social values
as those assigned by people to places in the world (Ives
and Kendal 2014), expressed as nonmonetary preferences.
These approaches ask the public, which could include
residents, visitors, focus groups, and/or online panels, to
allocate value across a series of social-value types and/or
to place points on maps that correspond to the locations
where they feel the landscape provides these values.
Social-values mapping largely focuses on understanding
values for cultural ecosystem services, including non-use
values, although most social-value typologies have
included biological diversity (a supporting service) and
life-sustaining values (defined by past surveys as help[ing] produce, preserve, clean, and renew air, soil, and
water, roughly corresponding to multiple regulating
services). Social-values mapping thus offers a means of
quantifying cultural and other services to inform environmental planning and management decisions (Brown
and Reed 2009; Brown 2012).

123

Multiple methods exist for eliciting social values. An
extensive peer-reviewed literature has been developed
using point-based, social-value elicitation methods and
representative sampling of visitors to or residents of an area
(Alessa et al. 2008; Bryan et al. 2011; Brown et al. 2012;
van Riper et al. 2012; Sherrouse and Semmens 2014).
Others have used polygons or fuzzy boundaries (Evans and
Waters 2008; Carver et al. 2009) and/or semi-structured
interviews, which often seek to answer different, though
related, questions than representative sampling (Carver
et al. 2009; Fagerholm et al. 2012; Klain and Chan 2012).
Additional work has been undertaken to use internet-based
mapping surveys and understand trade-offs in responses
based on paper and internet surveys (Pocewicz et al. 2012).
Brown and Pullar (2012) compared the results of polygon
versus point-based studies. Theoretically, PPGIS results
obtained using points should converge to polygons given
an adequate sample size. Brown and Pullar found this to be
the case, though they caution that this convergence may not
occur for value types that are infrequently mapped. Brown
and Pullar recommend the use of polygons for focus groupbased research and points when surveying individuals and
note that polygons covering all or nearly all of an area must
usually be discarded, as they give little distinguishing
information and can introduce error.
While some survey-based studies have asked the public
or experts to specifically map supporting, regulating, and
provisioning services in addition to cultural services
(Raymond et al. 2009; Bryan et al. 2011; Brown et al.
2012), those same studies acknowledge the difficulty in
asking the public to map complex ecosystem processes and
services of which they may have only limited understanding. Regulating and supporting services are likely to
be the most cognitively challenging landscape attributes for
the public to map (Brown 2012, 2013). In a study conducted in coastal Wales, only more technical respondents
(i.e., academics and representatives of environmental
groups, but not representatives of business, fisheries, or
recreational groups) chose to map supporting and regulating services at all (Ruiz-Frau et al. 2011). In another case
study in South Australia, cultural services were most frequently mapped by respondents, followed by provisioning,
then regulating, then supporting services (Bryan et al.
2011).
Indeed, in a study that asked the public to map 22
ecosystem service types, Brown et al. (2012) noted that
Although the purpose of [our] exploratory research was
not to scientifically validate the ecosystem service data
generated through PPGIS, future research should undertake
this challenge. While few would question the validity of
using PPGIS to generate maps for identifying cultural
ecosystem services, many would question the utility of
consulting the public to identify more complex and

Linking biophysical models and public preferences

invisible ecosystem services (p. 647). Brown et al.s
(2012) suggestion is to have the general public and experts
independently map ecosystem services. Carefully combined use of social-values mapping and biophysical modeling may, however, be a better strategy to integrate
cultural services into ecosystem services assessments
(Chan et al. 2012; Plieninger et al. 2013). In this study, we
thus compare survey-derived maps from the general public
against outputs of biophysical models designed to quantify
and map corresponding ecosystem services, rather than
against maps generated solely by expert opinion.
Although biophysically modeled ecosystem services
have not, to our knowledge, been mapped against corresponding social values, others have used spatial statistics to
explore the strength of relationships between social values
and diverse types of ecological data. Brown et al. (2004)
found moderate overlap between public perceptions and
expert opinion in locating biodiversity hotspots in Prince
William Sound, Alaska. They also found that commercial
fishermen, who make their living from the oceans biodiversity, were better able to identify biodiversity hotspots
than the general public. Donovan et al. (2009) mapped
social values against biodiversity in the Palouse region of
Idaho and Washington, and found that the public was able
to identify meaningful places for natural diversity that
overlapped with forest and prairie remnants. Finally,
Alessa et al. (2008) compared public perceptions of biological value to net primary productivity on the Kenai
Peninsula, Alaska, and found a moderately significant
positive relationship. Others have demonstrated the
potential value of combining mapped social values and
ecological data in support of land use and conservation
planning in Australia (Bryan et al. 2011; Whitehead et al.
2014).
Aside from these past studies combining social values
mapping and ecological data, biophysical modeling and
social-values mapping of ecosystem services have largely
taken place independently. Yet they could function as
complementary approaches to support resource managementpairing social-values data to quantify and map cultural services with biophysically derived approaches to
assess regulating and supporting services. As public
agencies seek to incorporate ecosystem services information into planning (36 CFR 219; McIntyre et al. 2008; Zhu
et al. 2010; U.K. National Ecosystem Assessment 2011;
Bagstad et al. 2013a), information about cultural ecosystem
services will be as important to consider as other services.
The difficulty in monetizing cultural services has led to the
development and use of multicriteria analysis for decision
support (Hermans and Erickson 2007). Yet concurrent
mapping of biophysically modeled services and social
values could provide another approach to synthesizing such
information for management.

Alessa et al. (2008) identified social-ecological hotspotsareas of high ecological and/or social value and
their conversescoldspots with low ecological and/or
social value. A 2 9 2 matrix of social values and biophysically modeled ecosystem services (hereafter social
value and/or ecosystem service hotspots and coldspots) can
describe potential public land management implications for
these hotspots and coldspots (Table 1). Our approach is
also analogous to 2 9 2 decision matrices used in the
social values mapping literature to help guide mixed publicprivate land management (Bryan et al. 2011; Whitehead et al. 2014) and climate change adaptation (Raymond
and Brown 2011). By identifying social-ecological hotspots and coldspots, we might conduct more complete
ecosystem service analysis than by using biophysical
models or social-values mapping alone, better informing
resource managers about potential synergies, trade-offs,
and conflicts between existing or planned uses, management strategies, and the provision of ecosystem services.
This approach also offers a way to conceptualize trade-offs
and synergies between cultural and other ecosystem services and to consider some difficult-to-monetize cultural
ecosystem services in quantitative, spatial ecosystem service assessments.
In this study, we extend on these themes from past
analyses, using the PikeSan Isabel (PSI) National Forest
in Colorado as a study area. We first map hotspots for
summed social values and ecosystem services and their
overlap, to provide a mapped example of the management
implications hypothesized in Table 1. If social-values
mapping and biophysical modeling of ecosystem services
are indeed complements and not substitutes, joint mapping may thus more comprehensively map and value a
broader array of ecosystem service types. Second, we
statistically model the relationship between three individual social values and five corresponding biophysically
modeled ecosystem services to determine whether survey
respondents are capable of mapping those services that we
can concurrently assess using biophysical models
(Table 2). If corresponding social values and ecosystem
service maps align well, then we may be collecting
redundant information, suggesting that it may only be
necessary to use one approach rather than both. If they
align poorly, one or the other type of map may be
inappropriate, suggesting that the less scientifically trusted
approach could be dropped. Based on the findings of
Bryan et al. (2011) and Brown (2012, 2013), we
hypothesize that non-expert survey respondents will best
be able to map cultural services, which public preferences
are integral to understanding, next best able to map provisioning services, i.e., ecosystem goods used by the
public (provided they are willing to identify the locations
on which they depend for basic resources, Klain and Chan

Materials and methods
Study area
The PSI is located on the eastern side of the Continental
Divide in the Southern Rocky Mountains and covers
9,011 km2, about 3.3 % of Colorados land area (Fig. 1).
With approximately 6.8 million recreational visits per year,
the PSI ranks third in the nation for annual national forest
recreational visits, providing visitors with a wide range of
outdoor recreational opportunities. The headwaters of the
Arkansas and South Platte Rivers are located within the
PSI, which provides over 60 % of the Denver metropolitan
areas water (USDA 2012). The region thus provides
important ecosystem services based on its recreational
visitation and delivery of sediment-free water for metropolitan Denver alone. Like most forests in the arid and
semiarid intermountain western USA, the PSIs forests
frequently burn. Notably the Buffalo Creek (1996) and
Hayman (2002) fires burned nearly 150,000 acres and cost
Denver Water $26 million in dredging and water treatment
costs for reservoirs located within or downstream of the
PSI. The Hayman fire also caused nearly $39 million in
insured property losses, $42 million in fire suppression

123

costs, and $37 million on post-fire restoration and stabilization. In 2010, the Forest Service and Denver Water
created a Forests to Faucets partnership designed to
invest $33 million into forest thinning, clearing, and fuel
break creation within priority water supply watersheds in
the PSI, Arapahoe-Roosevelt, and White River National
Forests (Denver Water 2014). Such management trade-offs
illustrate the importance of understanding the biophysical
and social interactions between resource management and
ecosystem services provided by the PSI.
Social-values mapping and ecosystem service modeling
We generated social-values maps for this analysis using the
Social Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES) 2.0 tool, a
GIS application intended to quantify and map perceived
social values for ecosystem services (Sherrouse et al. 2011,
2014). We drew data from results of a mail survey conducted in 20042005, which was sent to a random sample
of 2,000 residents living within 72 km of the PSI (Clement
and Cheng 2011). Along with a series of questions to gauge
respondents attitudes and preferences toward forest management, the survey asked respondents to allocate 100
hypothetical dollars (not actually paid or spent by the
respondent or the Forest Service) among 12 value types
(based on Rolston and Coufals (1991) forest values
typology; Table 3), then to mark locations on a paper map
corresponding to those value types. Of 2,000 surveys, 684,

Linking biophysical models and public preferences

or 34 %, were returned. Of those 684, 55 % of respondents
completed maps, yielding an effective response rate of
19 %. Respondents mapped 2,289 total points within the
PSIapproximately six points mapped per respondent.
After the points were manually digitized into a GIS,
Sherrouse et al. (2014) applied SolVES and the MaxEnt
algorithm (Elith et al. 2011) to develop statistical models
relating the location of mapped points to six environmental
data layers (land cover, landforms, elevation, slope, distance to roads, and distance to water). Using these models,
Sherrouse et al. (2014) created raster layers covering the
entire PSI for each social-value type. SolVES creates a
value index for each layer, ranging from 0 to 10 depending
on the frequency and density that values were selected and
mapped by respondents. The value index does not represent
monetary values for ecosystem services but relative values
for each social-value type.
We quantified ecosystem services using biophysical
models included in the Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) modeling system (Villa et al. 2014).
We ran models for carbon sequestration and storage, surface water supply, sediment regulation, and aesthetic
viewsheds from both recreation sites and residences with
views of the PSI (Table 4). Detailed descriptions of data
sources and model structure and assumptions used in
ARIES are provided by ARIES Consortium (2014). The
models incorporated regionally specific spatial data and
account for ecological and socioeconomic influences on
ecosystem service supply and demand that are specific to

the Southern Rocky Mountains. We also used biodiversity
data from Boykin et al. (2013), who aggregated deductive
habitat modeling results of vertebrate species distributions
in the U.S. Southwest (generated for 817 amphibian, bird,
mammal, and reptile species as part of the Southwest
Regional Gap Analysis (SWReGAP) project) to yield
species richness maps. We used this summed habitat for all
terrestrial vertebrate species as our biophysically based
species richness measure.
Hotspot analysis
To identify social value and ecosystem service hotspots,
coldspots, and regions of overlap (Table 1), we used the
Getis-Ord Gi* statistic (Getis and Ord 1992) of local spatial autocorrelation on summed social and ecosystem service values. Past social-values mapping studies have used
different methods for hotspot analysis: Alessa et al. (2008)
mapped the upper third of values as hotspots, Bryan et al.
(2011) mapped the upper 20 % of values, and Zhu et al.
(2010) used the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. We follow Zhu
et al. (2010), because this approach lets us identify statistically significant clusters of high landscape values at the
a = 0.05 significance level. We conducted this analysis
using ArcGIS 10.1 with data at a spatial resolution of 450
meters to match the resolution of the SolVES output.
We equally weighted then summed the modeled surfaces for the 12 social values and 4 biophysically modeled
ecosystem services (excluding biodiversity) and ran the

Linking biophysical models and public preferences

Getis-Ord Gi* tool on both summed layers, using a fixed
distance band specified to ensure that all features had at
least one neighbor. We excluded biodiversity from the
ecosystem service hotspot analysis because, by definition
as a supporting service, it benefits humans indirectly. The
maximum summed value index for a given cell across all
12 social-value types was 61. We normalized ecosystem
service values by setting each service (scenic views from
housing and recreation sites, carbon sequestration and
storage, sediment deposition, and water yield) from 0 to 1,
rescaling the individual maps for the two viewshed and
carbon metrics (views provided to recreation sites and
residences, carbon sequestration and storage) between 0
and 0.5, and summing all layers. This gave equal weight to
each of the four biophysically modeled ecosystem services.
Although a maximum value of four could thus theoretically
be achieved, the actual maximum actual value was 1.79,
indicating relatively little overlap between areas of maximum provision of each of the four services.
Regression analysis
Our regression analyses build on recent comparisons
between spatially explicit social values and ecological data,
such as expert-derived biodiversity maps (Alessa et al.
2008) or ecological metrics including protected areas,
species richness, and patch size (Bryan et al. 2011). To
quantify the relationship between social values and ecosystem services, we developed nine univariate regression
models comparing social values (dependent variable,
Table 3) and biophysically modeled ecosystem services
(independent variable, Table 4). We compared life-sustaining value against biophysical model results for (1)
carbon sequestration, (2) summed vegetation and soil carbon storage, (3) surface water yield, (4) soil erosion, and
(5) sediment deposition. We compared aesthetic values to
modeled viewshed quality provided to (6) PSI recreation
sites and (7) residences with views of the PSI, measured as
developed land cells with views within a 48 km range of
the PSI, and viewshed quality received by (8) aesthetic
value points marked by survey respondents to the social
values survey. Finally, we compared (9) biodiversity values
against vertebrate species richness modeled by SWReGAP.
We used Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analyses within ArcGIS 10.1.
The only spatially explicit biodiversity data for the
region were for vertebrate species richness, which does not
perfectly align with the surveys description of biological
diversity value. We compared the aesthetic value survey
results to spatially explicit viewshed quality model results
(themselves calibrated based on visual preference studies
for the Rocky Mountain region); obviously viewshed
models capture only the visual component of aesthetic

quality and exclude other sensory elements important to
aesthetics. The surveys description of life-sustaining value
comes close to definitions of regulating ecosystem services; we thus compared this value to modeled results for
clean air (carbon sequestration and storage), soil (soil
erosion and sediment deposition), and water (water yield).
Despite the imperfect alignment of the description of social
values and biophysically modeled services, we feel that the
biophysically modeled services come close to matching the
defined social values.
We used point locations for our regression models that
were marked by survey respondents for each value type
(n = 238 life-sustaining points, 242 biodiversity points,
and 466 aesthetic points). These points were located at an
average minimum distance of 1.24 km from each other,
helping to avoid inflation of test statistics due to spatial
autocorrelation of values. Rather than using the statistically
modeled raster surface generated by SolVES using the
MaxEnt algorithm (which could also yield unacceptably
high spatial autocorrelation), we divided the number of
dollars allocated by each respondent to a given value type
during the value allocation exercise by the number of
points they marked for that value type. For instance, if a
respondent allocated 60 dollars to aesthetic value, then
marked three points on their map, each point would be
assigned a value of 20. We then extracted the corresponding biophysically modeled ecosystem service values
for each point layer. JarqueBera tests revealed a highly
non-normal distribution of residuals for the initial OLS
results, so we applied BoxCox power transformations to
transform the dependent variable in each model using the
lambda value recommended by the BoxCox test (Box and
Cox 1964). BoxCox transformed model results reduced
the JarqueBera test statistics by 9299 %, and also yielded 3560 % smaller values for Akaikes Information
Criterion. The use of spatially adjusted regression (i.e.,
spatial error modeling) may be appropriate for spatial statistical analysis when test statistics are inflated due to
spatial autocorrelation; however, given the very low test
statistics we found (see Results below), we did not apply
spatially adjusted regression.

Results
Hotspot analysis
Just over 20 % of the PSI was classified as statistically
significant hotspots for social values and/or ecosystem
service at the a = 0.05 significance level, and less than
2 % of the PSI was classified as hotspots for both
(Table 5). Nine federally designated wilderness areas are
located within the PSI, totaling approximately 18 % of the

123

K. J. Bagstad et al.

PSIs total land area. Ecosystem service and social value
hotspots were overrepresented within these wilderness
areas (Table 5; Fig. 2). Statistically significant ecosystem
service hotspots were generally clustered at higher-elevation locations with greater values for water yield and scenic
viewsheds, and also at locations below treeline where
forests sequestered and stored more carbon in their vegetation and soils. Social-value hotspots were generally found
around the Fourteeners (mountain peaks greater than
14,000-ft (4,267 m) in elevation) at the western edge of the
PSI (along the Continental Divide), within some lowerelevation wilderness areas, and along the corridor of the
South Platte River (which flows southnorth through the
northeastern portion of the PSI).
Regression analysis
Using a linear functional form with BoxCox transformation of the dependent variable, all OLS results were nonsignificant at the a = 0.05 level (Table 6). Contrary to our
hypotheses, we found the smallest p values for biodiversity
and some of the largest p values for aesthetics; however, all
p values were large and adjusted R2 values were extremely
small.

Discussion
Hotspots and coldspots: Implications for planning
and resource management
Wilderness areas were generally found at higher elevation
and despite their relative inaccessibility were perceived by
the public as valuable locations (Fig. 2). Colorado is home
to 54 Fourteeners, which are highly visible landmarks
and popular locations for hiking, mountaineering, and
backcountry skiing. Thirty of these Fourteeners are located
within or adjacent to the PSI, including the highest point in
the state, Mt. Elbert (14,439 ft/4,401 m). Recreation sites
were relatively well distributed throughout the PSI and
were found within, near, and distant from social-value/
ecosystem service hotspots. The location of wilderness
areas and Fourteeners thus seems to better explain

concentrations of social values than the location of general
purpose recreation sites.
Wilderness boundaries were marked on the maps that
respondents used to locate social value points. Notable
social values hotspots outside of wilderness areas included
the South Platte River corridor and southern end of the
Collegiate Peaks. Non-wilderness ecosystem service hotspots included the Pikes Peak area, Wet Mountains, and
the southernmost part of the PSI located west of the
Spanish Peaks Wilderness. Using summed social-values
data, PSI wilderness areas, on average, were valued 32 %
more than non-wilderness areas. Based on the results of
parallel studies in more rural northwest Wyoming that
also included wilderness boundaries on maps marked by
respondents (Sherrouse et al. 2014), however, the summed
value index for non-wilderness areas was 15 % greater
than wilderness areas in the Bridger-Teton National Forest
(BTNF) and 100 % greater than in the Shoshone National
Forest (SNF). In their study of nearby residents attitudes
about forest management in Colorado and Wyoming,
Clement and Cheng (2011) found that PSI respondents
favored wilderness more than BTNF or SNF respondents,
whereas BTNF and SNF respondents were more favorable
to fishing and hunting, motorized recreation, and oil/gas
drilling. Wilderness areas provide important ecosystem
services (Watson and Venn 2012), though efforts to catalog and quantify them have generally tended toward
isolated case studies rather than systematic, quantitative,
spatial analyses. Additional studies to map social values
and biophysically modeled ecosystem services for wilderness and non-wilderness areas would improve our
understanding of ecosystem services generated by wilderness areas, particularly for a greater variety of services
and geographic contexts.
Ecosystem services are increasingly entering into the
decision processes of public agencies, particularly those
charged with planning and resource management (McIntyre et al. 2008; Zhu et al. 2010; U.K. National Ecosystem
Assessment 2011). In Colorados national forests, joint
mapping of cultural and biophysically modeled ecosystem
services has implications for resource management by the
USDA Forest Service and adjacent land management
agencies such as the National Park Service and Bureau of

Land Management (Bagstad et al. 2013a), particularly
given the Forest Services 2012 Planning Rule requirement
to account for ecosystem services in the development of
new Forest Plans (36 CFR 219). Hotspot analysis results
enable spatial and visual comparisons between cultural and
other ecosystem services, putting difficult-to-monetize
cultural services on a level playing field for decision
making with biophysically modeled services that are more
amenable to monetary valuation. In planning contexts,
hotspot results can be used to identify potential resource
management synergies, trade-offs, and conflicts between

existing or planned uses, management strategies, and the
provision of ecosystem services (Table 1).
Given that resource extraction and motorized recreation
are prohibited within wilderness areas, we expect that
threats to ecosystem services there would originate more
from either global change (e.g., climate change) or accessrelated environmental degradation. Risk and value can be
incorporated into resource management, with resources
directed to higher-value and/or higher-risk landscapes
(Raymond and Brown 2011). Outside these wilderness
areas, managers could overlay the spatial extent of

123

K. J. Bagstad et al.

potential management actions atop social-values and ecosystem service maps to better visualize human/landscape
relationships (Alessa et al. 2008) and areas of potential
management synergies or conflicts. Coldspots were prevalent outside of wilderness areas (Fig. 2). While coldspots
have lower total ecosystem service values than hotspots,
managers should not assume that these areas are devoid of
value. Coldspot management strategies may include raising
awareness of their value or distributing human use and
related impacts to underutilized areas, while being aware
that greater use can degrade sensitive environments (van
Riper et al. 2012).
Public perceptions of biodiversity and ecosystem
services
Although no results were statistically significant (Table 6),
visual inspection of selected ecosystem service combinations is still instructive (Fig. 3). Similar parts of the PSI
notably high-elevation regions, the South Platte River
corridor, and wilderness areas (see Hotspot analysis
above) had high aesthetic, biodiversity, and life-sustaining
social values. Many areas marked by the public as being
important for high biodiversity in fact have very low vertebrate species richness; this is particularly true for lowdiversity, high-elevation parts of the PSI (Fig. 3a).
Although visitors views of mountain peaks and water
bodies at recreation sites are distributed heterogeneously
through the PSI, no clear visual relationships with the
aesthetic value type are obvious (Fig. 3b). Water yield
seems to align well with life-sustaining value, with highelevation parts of the PSI important to both value types.
However, the South Platte River corridor is notably marked
as important for the life-sustaining value type but not for
modeled water yield (Fig. 3c); though its built capital (i.e.,
reservoirs) does play a critical role for the regions water
supply.
We hypothesized that the public might perform best at
mapping cultural services (e.g., aesthetics), next best at
mapping provisioning services (e.g., water yield), and find
the mapping of biophysically complex supporting and
regulating services (e.g., biodiversity, carbon sequestration
and storage, and sediment yield) to be the most challenging
(Bryan et al. 2011; Brown 2012, 2013) (Table 2). However, all results were non-significant at the a = 0.05 level
and lacked explanatory power (adjusted R2 values of 0.01
or less, Table 6). The statistical fit between biodiversity
value and vertebrate species richness indicated the strongest relationship (p = 0.058); however, the public fared
better in mapping biologically significant areas in Alaska
and the Palouse region of Idaho and Washington than in

Linking biophysical models and public preferences

this study (Brown et al. 2004; Donovan et al. 2009). Further research could test the relationship between public
perceptions of ecosystem services and their biophysically
modeled values in other geographic contexts to more
widely support or refute these hypotheses from the social
values mapping literature.
Our findings align with past studies that acknowledge
the difficulty, in terms of a potentially high cognitive
burden, in asking the public to map biophysically complex
ecosystem services (Raymond et al. 2009; Bryan et al.
2011; Ruiz-Frau et al. 2011; Brown et al. 2012). Brown
et al. (2012) recommend that the general public and experts
be asked to separately map ecosystem services and that
researchers compare results to better understand the
strengths and limitations of public and expert ecosystem
service mapping. In this study, we extend this approach by
using maps generated using ecosystem service modeling
tools rather than through elicitation of expert opinion.
Indeed, the use of ecosystem service modeling tools is
becoming more widespread and is an increasingly viable
option for ecosystem service assessments that go beyond
elicitation of expert opinion (Kareiva et al. 2011; Bagstad
et al. 2013a; Villa et al. 2014).
We believe that biophysical ecosystem service models
and survey-based assessments of cultural services provide
complementary information. As biophysical models and
social values mapping are applied more broadly, a key
question for their use is whether the information that both
methods collect about biodiversity and non-cultural ecosystem services is redundant (i.e., aligns well) or divergent
(i.e., aligns poorly). If both align well, the more difficultto-apply approach could potentially be dropped; if they
align poorly, as was the case in this study, the less scientifically trusted approach might be dropped. The weak
alignment of biophysical and social data has implications
for the values typology used in future social-values studies.
The values typology used with such studies has generally
remained relatively stable across a broad array of studies,
dating to Brown and Reeds (2000) validation of Rolston
and Coufals (1991) forest value typology (though more
recent work has sought to better understand social value
types in coastal contexts, Cole 2012). In the light of our
findings, we question whether the continued inclusion of
value types like biological diversity or life-sustaining
values is sensible in future PPGIS or social-values mapping
typologies, or whether spatially explicit information collected from the general public about cultural ecosystem
services and non-use values is better paired with maps of
biodiversity, regulating, and provisioning services that
draw directly from biophysical data or models. If the
general public tends to default to mapping charismatic or
well-known places when asked to map non-cultural ecosystem services, such data will poorly represent high-value

areas for these services. Public understanding of the concept of biodiversity and recreationists perceptions of
ecological condition are often limited and unreliable
(Brown et al. 2004; Manning 2011). This suggests that the
value of using PPGIS or social-values mapping for biodiversity and non-cultural ecosystem services may be limited, except for in cases where researchers lack
corresponding biophysical data and models or specifically
aim to test the divergence between social and biophysical
values. This point has been noted by past authors, who for
example excluded life-sustaining value from their values
typology (Beverly et al. 2008) or argued that PPGIS should
solely consider cultural and provisioning services (Brown
2013).
However, an alternate view suggests that since building
trust and empowerment is a primary goal of PPGIS,
reducing the scope of PPGIS studies by reducing the
number of value types included in social values mapping
would have negative consequences. Since conservation
planning must achieve social license as it seeks to protect
biodiversity and ecosystem services, comprehensive
assessments of social values are important to evaluate
alongside biophysical assessments (Bryan et al. 2011;
Whitehead et al. 2014). The question of whether community empowerment and conservation planning success
would decline if fewer value types were elicited during
PPGIS efforts may thus require further research before
certain value types are excluded from social values mapping exercises. Additionally, when communicating ecosystem services concepts with the lay public, simpler
metaphors may be more useful than the complex linked
biophysical-socioeconomic models that have dominated
research to date (Raymond et al. 2013).
Limitations and future work
Four caveats or assumptions were built into our work and
could be revisited in future studies. First, potential error
and scale effects in our biophysical ecosystem service
models could lead to error in either our regression or hotspot analysis. Data for our analysis were collected at different spatial scales. SolVES recommends analysis at a
scale (output cell size) one thousandth the denominator of
the survey map scale, with the assumption that a handmarked point on a map is approximately one millimeter in
width (Sherrouse and Semmens 2012). As rule-of-thumb
guidance, this does not account for the uncertainty introduced by the ability of individual respondents to resolve a
point to an intended location on the map; however, analyzed collectively, the points from all respondents provide
a reasonable estimate of valued locations. The PSI map
scale was 1:450,000, so we conducted our analysis at
450 m resolution. SWReGAP biodiversity data were

123

K. J. Bagstad et al.

modeled at 30 m; ARIES input data ranged from 30 to
800 m, and ARIES modeling was conducted at 450 m to
facilitate direct comparison to SolVES data. The effects of
scale in the analysis of ecosystem services modeling have
been an under-researched area, though research is appearing to address this gap in the literature (Kandziora et al.
2013; Gret-Regamey et al. 2014). We used relevant datasets to parameterize each biophysical model (e.g., carbon
sequestration and storage, evapotranspiration, infiltration,
and soil erosion; ARIES Consortium 2014); however, the
poor spatial resolution of many of these datasets precluded
more rigorous model calibration via Bayesian network
training (Villa et al. 2014). An initial comparative analysis
of multiple biophysical ecosystem service assessment tools
to a common context found general agreement between
tools about the impacts of landscape-scale change on
ecosystem service provision (Bagstad et al. 2013b). However, further work is needed to improve our confidence
about the appropriateness of using different biophysical
ecosystem service modeling tools across diverse geographic contexts.
Second, we weighted all biophysically modeled ecosystem services equally in our hotspot analysis. These
services could alternatively be weighted through monetary
valuation or public or expert-generated weighting schemes
(Whitehead et al. 2014).
Third, the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic provides a statistical
method for hotspot delineation, but is not the only
approach to hotspot identification and mapping. The GetisOrd Gi* statistic has both advantages and disadvantages.
Unlike other approaches, such as Local Morans I, GetisOrd Gi* can distinguish between hotspots of clustered high
value and clustered low value. Its limitations include an
inability to detect negative autocorrelation, a somewhat
greater likelihood of Type 1 (false positive) errors than
Local Morans I, and greater sensitivity to the presence of
overall global spatial structure or second-order trends in the
data (i.e., the influence of other environmental gradients
aside from clustering affecting hotspot analysis results).
However, a preliminary comparison of hotspots for the PSI
derived using Getis-Ord Gi* and Local Morans I methods
yielded relatively similar hotspot extents and patterns.
Sensitivity analysis that compares ecosystem service hotspot extents using different methods would be a useful area
for further study.
Fourth, we recognize that not all of the social-values
types align perfectly with the corresponding biophysically
modeled services that we used in this study and that this is
a potential source of error in our regression models
(Tables 3, 4). In survey-based research, the wording and
presentation of questions are well known to influence
responses (Schwartz 1999). However, we believe that the
very weak relationships we found indicate that even had

123

perfectly aligned biophysical measures been available for
comparison to social values, weak relationships would
have persisted.
Neither biophysical modeling nor social-values mapping
tools have yet received widespread adoption by the Forest
Service (Brown and Reed 2009). To be tractable at an
agency-wide scale, particularly given limited agency
resources and growing management demands, ecosystem
service assessments need to be quantifiable, replicable,
credible, flexible, and affordable (Bagstad et al. 2013a).
Agency field offices, which are typically resource limited,
could benefit greatly from generalizable models that can be
applied across diverse geographic contexts (Kareiva et al.
2011; Villa et al. 2014) and demonstrably transferrable
social-value models (Brown and Brabyn 2012; Sherrouse
and Semmens 2014). Although local stakeholders and
managers often feel their sites are too unique for generalized approaches to be applicable, generalized modeling
tools have in some cases been shown to have adequate
accuracy when compared to more data-intensive models
(Tallis and Polasky 2011). The further development and
testing of transfer models for social-values data (Sherrouse
et al. 2011; Sherrouse and Semmens 2014) and of adaptable modeling systems (Villa et al. 2014) are two important
paths forward. With expanding recent work to map and
understand social values in national forests and elsewhere
(Brown and Reed 2009; van Riper et al. 2012; Sherrouse
et al. 2014; Sherrouse and Semmens 2014), the proliferation of tools for biophysical ecosystem service modeling
(Bagstad et al. 2013a), and venues to archive and share
such maps for wider use (ESP Maps 2014), it should be
increasingly possible to pilot test our approach in other
case study regions.
