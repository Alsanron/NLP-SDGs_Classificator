INTRODUCTION
A smart city is an urban region that is
highly advanced in terms of overall
system, safe mobility, sustainable real
estate, communications and market
viability. The smart-city management
system handles information and controls
across the different types of system needed
by a city[1]. The United Nations estimates
that the urban population of emerging
economies across the world, the stride of
migration from rural to urban areas is

increasing. In 2050, about 70 per cent of
the population will be living in urban
areas, and India is no exception[2]. With
growing urbanization the government has
now realized the need for smart cities in
urban area that can cope with the
challenges of urban living and also be
magnets for investment in India
announcement of 100 smart cities falls in
line with this vision[1]. Intelligent
transportation system play an essential role
in todays world and are a vital extension

for development of a smart city due to
concerns regarding the environmental,
economic, and social equity[3]. Intelligent
transport system move people and freight
by
emphasizing
accessible,
environmentally friendly, comfortable,
affordable and accessible with integrated
various transport modes which is safe and
operates at suitable speeds without
compromising the future needs. However,
at present there are various problems
involved in Indian cities such as severe
congestion, deteriorating air quality,
increasing incidence of road accidents and
a rapidly increasing energy cost due to
present traffic management, the city
largely lacks of Intelligent Transport
System in India. As the number of vehicles
increased everyday on Indian roads, the
average motorists spend hours in traffic
jam due to due to lack of urban planning,
traffic mismanagement, and parking
control which leads to billions of rupees
wasted every year in major cities of India.

Agarwal et al.

Most of the major cities in India, due to
lack of Intelligent Transport System faces
various
problems
like
accidents,
environmental degradation, congestion;
overcrowding and parking space etc.
Today India leads the world in traffic
accidents and also has the highest fatality
rate of traffic accidents in the world.
Hence there is urgent need to develop
intelligent transport systems in smart cities
proposed to be developed in India for
traffic control management and to tackle
the rising menace of road accidents and
fatalities. Artificial Intelligence is a key
technology for development of Intelligent
Transport System in smart citiesto better
understand and control its operations and
optimize the use of limited resources in
smart cities. Table 1 represents the
requirement of Intelligent Transport
System in smart cities in India and need
for application of Artificial Intelligence
system for developing such system.

Hence, the main objective of this study is
to present some basic concepts of
Artificial Intelligence and its applications
for development of Intelligent Transport
System in smart cities in India. This study
presents
applications
of
Artificial
Intelligence system in developing smart
public transport system, intelligent traffic
management and control, smart traveller
information system, smart parking
management and safe mobility &
emergency system in smart cities.
Artificial Intelligent system is a key
technology for improvement of traffic
management
&
control,
traveller
information system i.e. real-time traffic
information provision route navigation
systems, parking information etc. It
maximizes the capacity of transport system
applying real time traffic data. Traffic
signal lights can improve traffic flow
significantly, reducing the need to build
additional highway capacity, reducing
stops by as much as 40%, reducing travel
time by 25%, decreasing fuel consumption
by 10% and thereby reducing the carbon
emission[4]. This study will be useful for
engineers and planners to develop efficient
transport system in smart cities in India.
This paper consists of four sections of
which this is the first one. The first section
introduces the study. The second section
highlighted the basic concepts, challenges
and advantages of artificial intelligent for
development of intelligent transport
system. Third section briefly presents an
application of artificial intelligent system
for development of intelligent transport
system in smart cities. The last section
presents the important conclusions drawn
from this study.
Artificial Intelligence System
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science of
making machines or systems do things that
would require intelligence if done by
men[5]. The main objective of the Artificial

Intelligence system is to create intelligent
machines and through this, to understand
the principles of intelligence. Artificial
Intelligence system is suitable when a
direct mathematical relationship cannot be
established between cause and effect.
Artificial intelligence system models
capture the uncertainty between real-life
cause and effect scenarios by incorporating
available knowledge with probabilities and
probability inference computations[6].
Artificial Intelligence system is dealing
with both qualitative as well as
quantitative data. Artificial Intelligence
system may be categorised in two types (i)
Symbolic which focuses on development
of Knowledge Based system (ii) Computer
intelligence which includes methods such
as neural network, fuzzy system and
evolutionary computing[7].
Knowledge Based system (KBS)
KBS is a computer system capable of
giving advice in a particular domain using
the knowledge provided by a knowledge
base which has data provided from past
events in similar domains and feedbacks
by a human expert. In this system, the
knowledge is represented in several ways
such as rules, frames, or cases, and the
inference engine or algorithm[7] wherever
needed the domain expert intervenes to
arrive at appropriate decisions. In order to
arrive at more reliable and satisfactory
results, the introduction of an expert to
intervene and assist in judging on actual
performance in arriving at solutions based
on his knowledge and experience in the
relevant field is considered appropriate and
this is the basis on which Expert systems,
including KBS function[7].
KBS differs from conventional programs
in the following ways[7]
1. It simulates human reasoning about a
domain,
2. It
performs
reasoning
over
representation of human knowledge, in
addition
to
doing
numerical
computations or data revival;

Artificial Intelligence for Development of Intelligent Transport System

3. It solves problems by heuristic or
approximate methods.
KBS deals with subject matters of realistic
complexity, and therefore must exhibit
high performance in terms of speed and

Agarwal et al.

reliability in order to be a useful tool and it
must also be capable of explaining and
justifying the solutions to convince the
user that its reasoning is correct[7, 8].

knowledge based system.

Computational Intelligence (CI)
Computational

techniques provide superior analysis of
complex real-time data sets that arise
within transport systems. According to
literature, improved use of existing
transport infrastructures can accomplish

positive sustainable outcomes, decreasing
congestion, improving air quality,
providing real-time travel information and
supporting low carbon vehicles[8]. Table 3

Remark
NNs can be trained to approximate virtually any nonlinear function to a
required degree of accuracy and are provided with a set of input and output
examples.
A learning algorithm is then used to adjust the weights in the network so that
the network would give the required output.
Deal with the ambiguity associated with real-world problems.
Classic set theory defines sharp boundaries between sets and an object can
only be a member of a given set. Fuzzy set functions allow gradual
transitions between sets and also varying degree of membership of a given
set.
The use of Fuzzy set theory, though not necessarily minimises uncertainty
relating to problem objectives or input values, provides a standard way to
systematically capture and define ambiguity.
GA would yield a near optimum solution.

Some of the advantages of the Artificial
Intelligence in developing transport system
may be summarised as follows:

1. Artificial Intelligent is useful solution
for design, construction, maintenance,

and time scheduling of transport
system.
It can be used better and faster models
for solving complex problems of
transport system involving huge
volume of data such as airways,
roadways, railway and waterways.
It can be formulated and adopted to
ensure proper use of available
resources.
It helps to converting traffic sensors
into intelligent agents that can
automatically detect and report traffic
accidents or predict traffic conditions.
It is more reliable system for assessing
and predicting traffic conditions,
It can be used to review and evaluation
of transport technology.
It can be used to analysis of traffic
demands and analysis & simulations of
pedestrian and herd behaviour.

However, there are a number of challenges
involved in developing and deploying
Artificial Intelligence in smart cities in
India. Artificial Intelligence System face a
range of challenges, including system
interdependency, network effect, scale,
funding, political, institutional and other
challenges[9]. Some of the challenges in

implementing
Artificial
Intelligence
System in India are as follows:
1. Artificial
Intelligence
System
challenges include a lack of expertise
within local and regional transportation
agencies
with
regard
to
the
technologies underlying intelligent
transportation systems and their
implementation.
2. A lack of technical standards for
Artificial Intelligence technologies
makes it difficult to ensure that
systems purchased by different
localities can be integrated.
3. Establishing Artificial Intelligence
System standards and comprehensive
data collection system for applicable
throughout the urban and rural sections
of India.
4. Designing an Artificial Intelligence
System
that
encompasses
the
heterogeneous vehicle population.

Agarwal et al.

even allow drivers to reserve spaces
in for parking.
Application for Development of Safety
Management and Emergency System
The traffic accident patterns word wide
indicated that it is not enough to have the
safest vehicle and road technology to
ensure safe mobility but the city structure,
modal share split, and exposure of
motorists and pedestrians also have a
significant role in ensuring safe mobility.
Artificialal Intelligence plays an important
role for reducing the traffic accidents and
increases the safe mobility in smart cities.
Some applications of the Artificial
intelligence for development of Safety
management and emergency system in
smart cities are summarized as follows:

traffic structures, topography and financial
possibilities. Smart parking management
systems provide customized solutions of
parking problems. Artificial Intelligence is
a most recognized technology for
development
of
smart
parking
management in smart cities. Some
applications of the Artificial Intelligence
system for development of smart parking
management systems in smart cities are
summarized as follows:
1. Dynamic displays guide the driver to
parking spaces and to multi-storey car
parks.
2. In the multi-storey car park, every
space can be monitored by ultrasound
sensors.
3. All information is monitored online
in the management centre, which
relieves the driver of finding a parking
space.
4. Optimum use of multi-storey car park
capacities,
5. It boosts demand and high customer
satisfaction and
6. Reduces
carbon
emissions
by
minimizing the number of drivers
searching for a parking space.
Application for Development of Smart

maintaining it to the desired level
without resorting to restoration
spending huge amount of money.
3. It can be used to develop project level
analysis tools based on economic
principles to arrive at maintenance
standards and maintenance strategies

and to optimize the use of funds
allocated for pavement maintenance
and rehabilitation.
4. It is used to develop expert systems for
pavement
management
i.e.
PAVEMENT EXPERT, PAVER,
SEVADER and ORAGE which can be
used to manage roads, incidence,
severity, streets, parking lots and
airfield and the extent of range of
distress for each road section.
The computer engineers can develop
appropriate models using his knowledge
in Artificial Intelligence and combining
them with transport experts to evolve
realistic solution for developing transport
systems in smart cities. Though the
computer engineer could handle computer
part of the Artificial Intelligence System,
it will not be appropriate to expect him to
deal with transport specific problems and
hence the need arises for him to work
jointly with transport expert. Similarly,
the transport expert is also not expected to
have so much exposure to computer
applications as to independently handle all
the nuances of Artificial Intelligence
Systems in solving the complex problems
of developing transportation infrastructure
in smart cities. The application of
Artificial Intelligence in developing
transport Systems will therefore involve a
joint effort of transportation experts and
computer engineers. The application of
Artificial Intelligence in developing
transport Systems will therefore involve a
joint effort of transportation experts and
computer engineers.
