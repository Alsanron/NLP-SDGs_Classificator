mobile cellular services have spread rapidly and have allowed people living in previously unconnected areas to join the global information society. in 2016, 95 per cent of the worlds population and 85 per cent of people in the least developed countries were covered by a mobile cellular signal. goal 9 encompasses three important aspects of sustainable development: infrastructure, industrialization and innovation. infrastructure provides the basic physical systems and structures essential to the operation of a society or enterprise. industrialization drives economic growth, creates job opportunities and thereby reduces income poverty. innovation advances the technological capabilities of industrial sectors and prompts the development of new skills. an important component of physical infrastructure is air shipping and air travel. in 2014, 45 per cent of all air passengers originated from developing regions; 55 per cent originated from developed regions. however, in the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states, air passenger volume was extremely low, making up only 0.8 per cent, 0.8 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, of the global total. similar patterns are found for freight volumes in air transit: the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states made up only 1.1 per cent, 0.9 per cent and 2.6 per cent of the global total, respectively, in 2014. manufacturing is a foundation of economic development, employment and social stability. in 2015, the share of manufacturing value added in terms of gdp of developed regions was estimated at 13 per cent, a decrease over the past decade owing largely to the increasing role of services in developed regions.
