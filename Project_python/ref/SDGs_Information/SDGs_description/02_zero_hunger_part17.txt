chronic malnutrition, which affects an estimated 155 million children worldwide, also stunts children s brain and physical development and puts them at further risk of death, disease, and lack of success as adults. as of 2017, only 26 of 202 un member countries are on track to meet the sdg target to eliminate undernourishment and malnourishment, while 20 percent have made no progress at all and nearly 70 percent have no or insufficient data to determine their progress. a report by the international food policy research institute (ifpri) of 2013 stated that the emphasis of the sdgs should not be on ending poverty by 2030, but on eliminating hunger and under nutrition by 2025. the assertion is based on an analysis of experiences in china, vietnam, brazil, and thailand. three pathways to achieve this were identified: 1) agriculture led; 2) social protection  and nutrition  intervention led; or 3) a combination of both of these approaches. a study published in nature concluded that it is unlikely there will be an end to malnutrition by 2030. hunger is the leading cause of death in the world. our planet has provided us with tremendous resources, but unequal access and inefficient handling leaves millions of people malnourished. if we promote sustainable agriculture with modern technologies and fair distribution systems, we can sustain the whole worlds population and make sure that nobody will ever suffer from hunger again.
