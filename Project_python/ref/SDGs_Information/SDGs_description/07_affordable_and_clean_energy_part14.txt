globally, energy intensity decreased by 1.7 per cent per year from 2010 to 2012. this represents a considerable improvement over the period from 1990 to 2010, when it decreased by 1.2 per cent a year. as a result, global energy intensity, which stood at 6.7 (millijoules (mj) per 2011 united states dollar ppp) in 2000 fell to 5.7 by 2012. the proportion of the worlds energy use covered by mandatory energy efficiency regulation, which has almost doubled over the past decade, from 14 per cent in 2005 to 27 per cent in 2014, was a factor. still, current progress is only about two thirds of the pace needed to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. among end use sectors, industry was the largest contributor to reduced energy intensity, followed closely by transportation. about 68 per cent of the savings in energy intensity between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions, with eastern asia as the largest contributor. by 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services. proportion of population with access to electricity. proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology. by 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption. by 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and gdp. by 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.
