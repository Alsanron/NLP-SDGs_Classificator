globally, the proportion of people held in detention without being sentenced for a crime has remained almost unchanged  from 32 per cent of total prisoners in 2003 2005 to 31 per cent in 2013 2015  which indicates that substantive progress has not been achieved in the ability of judicial systems to process and try the accused in a fair and transparent manner. opaque, burdensome and inefficient regulations and procedures nurture opportunities for corrupt officials to extract bribes or unofficial payments. in 2015, over 18 per cent of firms worldwide reported receiving at least one bribery payment request. the share of firms in low  and lower middle income countries totalled 25 per cent, compared to 4 per cent in high income countries. to provide a sound basis for development, government budgets should be comprehensive, transparent and realistic. while expenditure in nearly 2 in 3 countries was within 10 per cent of their original national budgets, more than 1 in 7 countries deviated by at least 15 per cent. nevertheless, budget reliability has improved over time, with about 8 in 10 countries in southern asia and eastern asia and the pacific showing improvement. birth registration is a first step towards safeguarding individual rights and providing every person with access to justice and social services. while many regions have reached universal or near universal birth registration, globally the average is just 71 per cent, on the basis of available country data reported from 2010 to 2016. fewer than half (46 per cent) of all children under 5 years of age in sub saharan africa have had their births registered. legislation that calls for freedom of information has increased steadily, but slow or inefficient implementation of such laws remains a concern.
