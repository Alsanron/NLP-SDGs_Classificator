globally, manufacturing value added as a share of gdp increased from 15.3 per cent in 2005 to 16.2 per cent in 2016. in 2016, manufacturing value added per capita amounted to $4,621 in europe and northern america, compared to about $100 in the least developed countries. as many countries move to more efficient and less energy intensive industries, their emissions of carbon dioxide per unit of manufacturing value added are generally declining. from 2000 to 2014, europe and northern america reduced their emissions intensity by 36 per cent. all of the 10 largest manufacturing countries saw decreases in their emissions intensity. such promising trends are not reflected in the global emissions intensity level, however, since a significant share of global manufacturing value added has moved to countries with generally higher intensity levels. in 2014, investments in research and development stood at 1.7 per cent of global gdp, up from 1.5 per cent in 2000. worldwide, there were 1,098 researchers per million inhabitants in 2014, ranging from 63 in the least developed countries to 3,500 in europe and northern america. oda for economic infrastructure in developing countries reached $57 billion in 2015, an increase of 32 per cent in real terms since 2010. the main recipient sectors were transport and energy ($19 billion each). manufacturing is increasingly shifting towards more technologically complex products. while medium  and high tech products continue to dominate manufacturing production in industrialized economies (where they contribute about 80 per cent of total manufacturing output), the share has barely reached 10 per cent in least developed countries.
