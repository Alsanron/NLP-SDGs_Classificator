the per capita material footprint of developing countries increased from 5 metric tons in 2000 to 9 metric tons in 2017. 93% of the worlds 250 largest companies are now reporting on sustainability. water. less than 3 per cent of the worlds water is fresh (drinkable), of which 2.5 per cent is frozen in the antarctica, arctic and glaciers. humanity must therefore rely on 0.5 per cent for all of mans ecosystems and fresh water needs. humankind is polluting water in rivers and lakes faster than nature can recycle and purify. more than 1 billion people still do not have access to fresh water. excessive use of water contributes to the global water stress. water is free from nature but the infrastructure needed to deliver it is expensive. energy. if people worldwide switched to energy efficient lightbulbs, the world would save us$120 billion annually. despite technological advances that have promoted energy efficiency gains, energy use in oecd countries will continue to grow another 35 per cent by 2020. commercial and residential energy use is the second most rapidly growing area of global energy use after transport. in 2002 the motor vehicle stock in oecd countries was 550 million vehicles (75 per cent of which were personal cars). a 32 per cent increase in vehicle ownership is expected by 2020. at the same time, motor vehicle kilometers are projected to increase by 40 per cent and global air travel is projected to triple in the same period.
