to achieve inclusive and sustainable industrialization, competitive economic forces need to be unleashed to generate employment and income, facilitate international trade and enable the efficient use of resources. the global share of manufacturing value added in gdp increased from 15.2 per cent in 2005 to 16.3 per cent in 2017, driven by the fast growth of manufacturing in asia. globally, the carbon intensity decreased by 19 per cent from 2000 to 2015 from 0.38 to 0.31 kilograms of carbon dioxide per dollar of value added. in 2015, medium high  and high technology sectors accounted for 44.7 per cent of total manufacturing value added globally. the value added reached 34.6 per cent in developing economies, up from 21.5 per cent in 2005. by 2016, the proportion of the population covered by a third generation (3g) mobile broadband network stood at 61 per cent in the ldcs and 84 per cent globally. despite steady improvements in manufacturing output and employment, renewed investment will be needed in the least developed countries to build needed infrastructure and ensure the doubling of industrys share of gdp in those countries by 2030. efficient transportation services generate employment and wealth. in 2015, the estimated global economic impact (both direct and indirect) of air transport was $2.7 trillion, equivalent to 3.5 per cent of global gdp. the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states represent far less air travel and freight volumes, with each country group accounting for only 1 per cent to 2.7 per cent of the global total. manufacturing is a principal driver of economic development, employment and social stability.
