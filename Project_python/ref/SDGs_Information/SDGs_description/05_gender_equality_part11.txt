such slow progress suggests that stronger political commitment and more ambitious measures and quotas are needed to boost womens political participation and empowerment. women are still underrepresented in managerial positions. in the majority of the 67 countries with data from 2009 to 2015, fewer than a third of senior  and middle management positions were held by women. just over half (52 per cent) of women between 15 and 49 years of age who are married or in union make their own decisions about consensual sexual relations and use of contraceptives and health services. that statistic is based on available data from around 2012 for 45 countries, 43 of which are in developing regions. gender equality and womens empowerment have advanced in recent decades. girls access to education has improved, the rate of child marriage declined and progress was made in the area of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including fewer maternal deaths. nevertheless, gender equality remains a persistent challenge for countries worldwide and the lack of such equality is a major obstacle to sustainable development. assuring womens rights through legal frameworks is a first step in addressing discrimination against them. as of 2014, 143 countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their constitutions; another 52 countries have yet to make this important commitment. in 132 countries, the statutory legal age of marriage is equal for women and men, while in another 63 countries, the legal age of marriage is lower for women than for men. violence against women and girls violates their human rights and hinders development.
