3 billion people lack access to clean cooking fuels, resulting in nearly 4 million premature deaths each year. AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY: WHY IT MATTERS. Whats the goal here? To ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Why? A well-established energy system supports all sectors: from businesses, medicine and education to agriculture, infrastructure, communications and high-technology. Access to electricity in poorer countries has begun to accelerate, energy efficiency continues to improve, and renewable energy is making impressive gains. Nevertheless, more focused attention is needed to improve access to clean and safe cooking fuels and technologies for 3 billion people. I have access to electricity. Why should I care about this goal? For many decades, fossil fuels such as coal, oil or gas have been major sources of electricity production, but burning carbon fuels produces large amounts of greenhouse gases which cause climate change and have harmful impacts on peoples well-being and the environment. This affects everyone, not just a few. Moreover, global electricity use is rising rapidly. In a nutshell, without a stable electricity supply, countries will not be able to power their economies. How many people are living without electricity? Nearly 9 out of 10 people now have access to electricity, but reaching the unserved will require increased efforts. In sub-Saharan Africa, an estimated 573 million people still lacked access to electricity.
