fifteen per cent of land is currently under protection, but that does not cover all areas important for biodiversity. protecting key biodiversity areas is necessary to strengthen natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. from 2000 to 2017, average worldwide coverage of terrestrial, freshwater and mountain key biodiversity areas by protected areas increased from 35 per cent to 47 per cent, from 32 per cent to 43 per cent and from 39 per cent to 49 per cent, respectively.  as of 2017, 76 per cent of the worlds mountain areas are covered by some form of green vegetation, including forests, shrubs, grasses and crops. green cover on mountains is lowest in central asia (31 per cent) and highest in oceania (excluding australia and new zealand) (98 per cent). from 1998 to 2013, about one fifth of the earths land surface covered by vegetation showed persistent and declining trends in productivity. south america and africa are most affected; in some cases, advanced stages of land degradation there are leading to desertification in dryland areas, particularly in the grasslands and rangelands. land and soil degradation undermine the security and development of all countries. reversing the effects of land degradation and desertification through sustainable land management is key to improving the lives and livelihoods of more than 1 billion people currently under threat. biodiversity loss continues at an alarming rate according to the red list index. the extinction risk for corals is increasing most rapidly among all assessed species groups owing to the growing threat from climate change and local impacts.
