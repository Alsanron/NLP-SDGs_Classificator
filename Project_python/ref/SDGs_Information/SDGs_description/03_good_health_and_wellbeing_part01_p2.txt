Four out of every five deaths of children under age five occur in these regions. Children born into poverty are almost twice as likely to die before the age of five as those from wealthier families. Children of educated mothers, even mothers with only primary schooling, are more likely to survive than children of mothers with no education. Maternal health. Maternal mortality has fallen by 37% since 2000. In Eastern Asia, Northern Africa and Southern Asia, maternal mortality has declined by around two-thirds. But maternal mortality ratio, the proportion of mothers that do not survive childbirth compared to those who do in developing regions is still 14 times higher than in the developed regions. More women are receiving antenatal care. In developing regions, antenatal care increased from 65 per cent in 1990 to 83 per cent in 2012. Only half of women in developing regions receive the recommended amount of health care they need. Fewer teens are having children in most developing regions, but progress has slowed. The large increase in contraceptive use in the 1990s was not matched in the 2000s.
