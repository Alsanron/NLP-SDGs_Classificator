REDUCED INEQUALITIES: WHY IT MATTERS. 16,000 children die each day from preventable diseases such as measles and tuberculosis. Whats the goal here? To reduce inequalities within and among countries. Why? Inequalities based on income, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, race, class, ethnicity, religion and opportunity continue to persist across the world, within and among countries. Inequality threatens long term social and economic development, harms poverty reduction and destroys peoples sense of fulfilment and self-worth. This, in turn, can breed crime, disease and environmental degradation.
