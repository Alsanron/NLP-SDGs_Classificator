of the 8,300 animal breeds known, 8 per cent are extinct and 22 per cent are at risk of extinction. of the over 80,000 tree species, less than 1 per cent have been studied for potential use. fish provide 20 per cent of animal protein to about 3 billion people. only ten species provide about 30 per cent of marine capture fisheries and ten species provide about 50 per cent of aquaculture production. over 80 per cent of the human diet is provided by plants. only three cereal crops, rice, maize and wheat, provide 60 per cent of energy intake. as many as 80 per cent of people living in rural areas in developing countries rely on traditional plant based medicines for basic healthcare. micro organisms and invertebrates are key to ecosystem services, but their contributions are still poorly known and rarely acknowledged. by 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements. by 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally. by 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation neutral world. by 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development.
