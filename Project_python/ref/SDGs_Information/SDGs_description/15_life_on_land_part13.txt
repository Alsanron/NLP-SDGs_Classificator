meanwhile, other areas were transformed into forests through planting, landscape restoration or the natural expansion of forest. owing to the balance of the two processes and efforts to slow deforestation, the global net loss of forest area declined from 7.3 million hectares per year in the 1990s to 3.3 million hectares per year during the period from 2010 to 2015. to safeguard places that contribute significantly to global biodiversity, protected areas have been established and identified as key biodiversity areas. in 2014, 15.2 per cent of the worlds terrestrial and freshwater environments were covered by protected areas. the percentage of terrestrial key biodiversity areas covered by protected areas has increased, from 16.5 per cent in 2000 to 19.3 per cent in 2016.  over the same period, the share of freshwater key biodiversity areas that are protected has increased from 13.8 per cent to 16.6 per cent, and the share of mountain key biodiversity areas under protection has grown from 18.1 per cent to 20.1 per cent. the focus in goal 15 on halting biodiversity loss comes at a critical time, since many species of amphibians, birds and mammals are sliding towards extinction. according to the international union for conservation of natures red list index, amphibians are declining most rapidly in latin america and the caribbean, primarily as a result of the chytrid fungal disease, one of numerous wildlife diseases on the rise worldwide. the greatest extinction risks for birds and mammals are found in south eastern asia, mainly owing to the conversion of lowland forests.
