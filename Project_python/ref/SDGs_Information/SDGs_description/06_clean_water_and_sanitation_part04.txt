3 in 10 people lack access to safely managed drinking water services. about 3 billion people lack access to basic sanitation services, such as toilets or latrines. more than 80 per cent of wastewater resulting from human activities is discharged into rivers or sea without any treatment, leading to pollution. what are the effects of this? water and sanitation related diseases remain among the major causes of death in children under five; more than 800 children die every day from diarrhoeal diseases linked to poor hygiene. proper water and sanitation is a key foundation for achieving the sustainable development goals, including good health and gender equality. by managing our water sustainably, we are also able to better manage our production of food and energy and contribute to decent work and economic growth. moreover, we can preserve our water ecosystems, their biodiversity, and take action on climate change. what would it cost to correct the problem? a study by the world bank group, unicef and the world health organization estimates that extending basic water and sanitation services to the unserved would cost us$28.4 billion per year from 2015 to 2030, or 0.10 per cent of the global product of the 140 countries included in its study. what would it cost if we dont correct the problem? the costs are huge, both for people and for the economy. worldwide, more than 2 million people die every year from diarrhoeal diseases.
