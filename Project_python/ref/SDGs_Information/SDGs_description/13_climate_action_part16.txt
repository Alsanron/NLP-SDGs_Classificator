at a 2017 un press briefing, global ceo alliance (gceoa) chairman james donovan described the asia pacific region, which is a region particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, as needing more public private partnerships (ppps) to successfully implement its sustainable development initiatives. in 2018, the international panel of climate change (ipcc), the united nations body for assessing the science related to climate change, published a special report global warming of 1.5c. it outlined the impacts of a 1.5 c global temperature rise above pre industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, and highlighted the possibility of avoiding a number of such impacts by limiting global warming to 1.5 c compared to 2 c, or more. the report mentioned that this would require global net human caused emissions of carbon dioxide (co2) to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net  zero around 2050, through rapid and far reaching transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities. this special report was subsequently discussed at cop 24. despite being requested by countries at the cop 21, the report was not accepted by four countries  the us, saudi arabia, russia and kuwait, which only wanted to note it, thereby postponing the resolution to the next sbsta session in 2019. climate change is a real and undeniable threat to our entire civilization.the effects are already visible and will be catastrophic unless we act now. through education, innovation and adherence to our climate commitments, we can make the necessary changes to protect the planet. these changes also provide huge opportunities to modernize our infrastructure which will create new jobs and promote greater prosperity across the globe.
