various forms of violence against children persist, including discipline that relies on physical punishment and psychological aggression. in 76 countries (most are developing countries) with available data from 2005 to 2016, about 8 in 10 children from 1 to 14 years of age were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment on a regular basis. countries have made solid progress in terms of detecting victims of trafficking in persons, as reflected by the increasing number of detected victims over the last decade. globally, more women and girls than men and boys were identified as victims of trafficking in 2014. however, the share of women and girls has slowly retreated, from 84 per cent in 2004 to 71 per cent in 2014. while the share of victims trafficked for sexual exploitation has declined, the proportion of those trafficked for forced labour has increased. about 28 per cent of all trafficking victims detected in 2014 were children, with girls outnumbering boys (20 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively, of total victims). sexual violence is perhaps the most disturbing of childrens rights violations. underreporting and a lack of comparable data limit understanding of the full extent of the problem. in 35 low  and middle income countries with data, the proportions of women between 18 and 29 years of age who experienced sexual violence for the first time before 18 years of age ranged from 0 per cent to 16 per cent. rates of pretrial detention suggest that progress with respect to the rule of law and access to justice has been slow.
