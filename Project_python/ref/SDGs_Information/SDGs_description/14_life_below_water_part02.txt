oceans serve as the worlds largest source of protein, with more than 3 billion people depending on the oceans as their primary source of protein. marine fisheries directly or indirectly employ over 200 million people. subsidies for fishing are contributing to the rapid depletion of many fish species and are preventing efforts to save and restore global fisheries and related jobs, causing ocean fisheries to generate us$50 billion less per year than they could. open ocean sites show current levels of acidity have increased by 26 per cent since the start of the industrial revolution. coastal waters are deteriorating due to pollution and eutrophication. without concerted efforts, coastal eutrophication is expected to increase in 20 percent of large marine ecosystems by 2050. by 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution. by 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans. minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels. by 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics.
