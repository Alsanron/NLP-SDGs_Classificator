sustained and inclusive economic growth is necessary for achieving sustainable development. the global annual growth rate of real gdp per capita increased by 1.3 per cent in 2014, a significant slowdown compared to 2010 (2.8 per cent growth) and 2000 (3.0 per cent growth). developing regions grew far faster than developed regions, with average annual growth rates in 2014 of 3.1 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively. labour productivity (measured by gdp per worker) spurs economic growth. growth in labour productivity in developing regions far outpaced that of developed regions, especially in asia. between 2010 and 2015, labour productivity grew by 0.9 per cent per year, on average, in developed regions, while rising by 6.7 per cent per year, on average, in eastern asia, the region with the fastest growth. despite rapid growth in some developing regions, labour productivity remains far higher in the developed regions. in 2015, the average worker in developed regions produced 23 times the annual output of an average worker in sub saharan africa (which has the lowest labour productivity in developing regions), and 2.5 times that of an average worker in western asia (which has the highest labour productivity in developing regions). the global unemployment rate stood at 6.1 per cent in 2015, down from a peak of 6.6 per cent in 2009, mostly owing to a decline in unemployment in the developed regions.
