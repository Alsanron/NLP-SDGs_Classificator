in southern asia, for instance, more than 2 out of 3 prisoners remained unsentenced in 2012 2014, despite some improvement over the data available for the period 2003 to 2005. among victims of robbery, between one quarter and one half reported the crime to the police, in 27 countries with available data. the data suggest a significant gap in citizens access to and trust in authorities. although official data on the prevalence of bribery are limited, figures from 19 countries indicate that the rate of prevalence of bribery may reach as high as 50 per cent among citizens who had contact with public officials, undermining trust in state institutions. registering children at birth is a first step in securing recognition before the law and safeguarding individual rights and access to justice. despite recent progress, the births of more than 1 in 4 children under the age of 5 worldwide have not been recorded. in sub saharan africa, over half (54 per cent) of children have not been registered by their fifth birthday. globally, children living in urban areas are around 1.5 times more likely to be registered than their rural counterparts. in most regions, birth registration rates tend to be highest among the richest 20 per cent of the population. efforts are under way to make national and international institutions more effective, inclusive and transparent. over the past 10 years, nearly two thirds of 144 countries with available data were able to plan their national budgets effectively (where final expenses remained within 10 per cent of original budgets). voting rights assigned to various groups of countries in international institutions is one indication of inclusivity at the international level.
