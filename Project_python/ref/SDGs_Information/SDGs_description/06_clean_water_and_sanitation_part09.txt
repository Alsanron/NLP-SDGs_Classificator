in 2015, 29 per cent of the global population lacked safely managed drinking water supplies, and 61 per cent were without safely managed sanitation services. in 2015, 892 million people continued to practise open defecation. in 2015, only 27 per cent of the population in ldcs had basic handwashing facilities. preliminary estimates from household data of 79 mostly high  and high middle income countries (excluding much of africa and asia) suggest that 59 per cent of all domestic wastewater is safely treated. in 22 countries, mostly in the northern africa and western asia region and in the central and southern asia region, the water stress level is above 70 per cent, indicating the strong probability of future water scarcity. in 20172018, 157 countries reported average implementation of integrated water resources management of 48 per cent. based on data from 62 out of 153 countries sharing transboundary waters, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was only 59 per cent in 2017. access to safe water and sanitation and sound management of freshwater ecosystems are essential to human health and to environmental sustainability and economic prosperity. in 2015, 6.6 billion people (over 90 per cent of the worlds population) used improved drinking water sources and 4.9 billion people (over two thirds of the worlds population) used improved sanitation facilities. in both cases, people without access live predominantly in rural areas. achieving universal access to basic sanitation and ending the unsafe practice of open defecation will require substantial acceleration of progress in rural areas of central and southern asia, eastern and south eastern asia and sub saharan africa.
