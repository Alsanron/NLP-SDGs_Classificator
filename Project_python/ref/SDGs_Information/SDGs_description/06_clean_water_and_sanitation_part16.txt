water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented. ending open defecation will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as behavior change of the users. this will require cooperation between governments, civil society, and the private sector. the main indicator for the sanitation target is the "proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand washing facility with soap and water". however, as of 2017, two thirds of countries lacked baseline estimates for sdg indicators on hand washing, safely managed drinking water, and sanitation services. from those that were available, the joint monitoring programme (jmp) found that 4.5 billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation.[46] to meet sdg targets for sanitation by 2030, nearly one third of countries will need to accelerate progress to end open defecation, including brazil, china, ethiopia, india, indonesia, nigeria, and pakistan. the sustainable sanitation alliance (susana) has made it its mission to achieve sdg6. susana s position is that the sdgs are highly interdependent. therefore, the provision of clean water and sanitation for all is a precursor to achieving many of the other sdgs. one in three people live without sanitation. this is causing unnecessary disease and death. although huge strides have been made with access to clean drinking water, lack of sanitation is undermining these advances. if we provide affordable equipment and education in hygiene practices, we can stop this senseless suffering and loss of life.
