goal 10 calls for reducing inequalities in income as well as those based on age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status within a country. the goal also addresses inequalities among countries, including those related to representation, migration and development assistance. target 10.1 seeks to ensure that income growth among the poorest 40 per cent of the population in every country is more rapid than its national average. this was true in 56 of 94 countries with data available from 2007 to 2012. however, this does not necessarily imply greater prosperity, since nine of those countries experienced negative growth rates over that period. the labour share of gdp, which represents the proportion of wages and social protection transfers in an economy, provides an aggregate measure of primary income inequality. a shift of income away from labour towards capital has contributed to rising inequality. globally, the labour share of gdp decreased from 57 per cent in 2000 to 55 per cent in 2015, mainly owing to stagnating wages and a decline in employers social contributions in developed regions, while the trend was stable or slightly upward in developing regions. preferential treatment for developing countries and the least developed countries in trade can help reduce inequalities by creating more export opportunities. major developed country markets already offer duty free market access to the least developed countries on most of their tariff lines. but even when they do not, as in the case of some agricultural products, the average applied tariff rate is often close to zero per cent.
