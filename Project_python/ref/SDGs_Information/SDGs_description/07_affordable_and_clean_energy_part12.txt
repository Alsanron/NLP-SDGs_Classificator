most of the increase was from renewable electricity from water, solar and wind power. solar and wind power still make up a relatively minor share of energy consumption, despite their rapid growth in recent years. the challenge is to increase the share of renewable energy in the heat and transport sectors, which together account for 80 per cent of global energy consumption. from 2012 to 2014, three quarters of the worlds 20 largest energy consuming countries had reduced their energy intensity  the ratio of energy used per unit of gdp. the reduction was driven mainly by greater efficiencies in the industry and transport sectors. however, that progress is still not sufficient to meet the target of doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. energy is crucial for achieving almost all of the sustainable development goals, from its role in the eradication of poverty through advancements in health, education, water supply and industrialization, to combating climate change. the proportion of the global population with access to electricity has increased steadily, from 79 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2012. still, 1.1 billion people are without this valuable service. recent global progress in this area has been driven largely by asia, where access is expanding at more than twice the pace of demographic growth. of those gaining access to electricity worldwide since 2010, 80 per cent are urban dwellers.
