unemployment affects population groups differently. globally, women and youth (aged 15 to 24) are more likely to face unemployment than men and adults aged 25 and over. in all regions, except eastern asia and the developed regions, the unemployment rate among women is higher than that of men. in almost all regions, the rate of youth unemployment is more than twice that of adults. although the number of children engaged in child labour declined globally by one third from 2000 to 2012 (from 246 million to 168 million), more than half of child labourers in 2012 (85 million) were engaged in hazardous forms of work. the incidence of child labour was highest in sub saharan africa, where 21 per cent of children were employed as child labourers. of all child labourers worldwide, 59 per cent were engaged in agricultural activities in 2012. while economic growth and employment are important for economic security, access to financial services is an essential component of inclusive growth. between 2011 and 2014, the proportion of the worlds adult population with an account at a financial institution or a mobile money service provider increased from 51 per cent to 62 per cent, meaning that 700 million adults became account holders during this period. financial exclusion disproportionately affected women and the poor. the proportion of women who are account holders is 9 percentage points lower than the proportion of men who are account holders.
