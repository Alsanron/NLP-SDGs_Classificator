What are some of the most pressing challenges that cities face today? Inequality is a big concern. Over 1 billion people live in slums and this number keeps rising. The levels of urban energy consumption and pollution are also worrying. Cities occupy just 3 per cent of the Earths land, but account for 60-80 per cent of energy consumption and 70 per cent of carbon emissions. Many cities are also more vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters due to their high concentration of people and location so building urban resilience is crucial to avoid human, social and economic losses. I live in a city but Im not affected by any of these issues. Why should I care? All these issues will eventually affect every citizen. Inequality can lead to unrest and insecurity, pollution deteriorates everyones health and affects workers productivity and therefore the economy, and natural disasters have the potential to disrupt everyones lifestyles. What happens if cities are just left to grow organically? The cost of poorly planned urbanization can be seen in some of the huge slums, tangled traffic, greenhouse gas emissions and sprawling suburbs all over the world. Slums are a drag on GDP, and lower life expectancy. By choosing to act sustainably we choose to build cities where all citizens live a decent quality of life, and form a part of the citys productive dynamic, creating shared prosperity and social stability without harming the environment.
