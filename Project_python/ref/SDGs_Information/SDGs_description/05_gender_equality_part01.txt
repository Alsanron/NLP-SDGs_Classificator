goal 5: achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. while the world has achieved progress towards gender equality and womens empowerment under the millennium development goals (including equal access to primary education between girls and boys), women and girls continue to suffer discrimination and violence in every part of the world. gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. unfortunately, at the current time, 1 in 5 women and girls between the ages of 15 49 have reported experiencing physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner within a 12 month period and 49 countries currently have no laws protecting women from domestic violence. progress is occurring regarding harmful practices such as child marriage and fgm (female genital mutilation), which has declined by 30% in the past decade, but there is still much work to be done to completely eliminate such practices. providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision making processes will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large. implementing new legal frameworks regarding female equality in the workplace and the eradication of harmful practices targeted at women is crucial to ending the gender based discrimination prevalent in many countries around the world. globally, 750 million women and girls were married before the age of 18 and at least 200 million women and girls in 30 countries have undergone fgm.
