pollution of both land and seas is a threat in many coastal regions. in addition, since river basins, marine ecosystems and the atmosphere are all part of hydrological systems, the effects of such pollution are often felt far from their source. in many coastal communities, pollution and eutrophication, which is the presence of excessive nutrients in water, frequently owing to runoff from the land, causing dense plant growth and the death of animal life, are driving detrimental changes. the five large marine ecosystems most at risk from coastal eutrophication, according to a global comparative assessment undertaken in 2016 as part of the transboundary water assessment programme, are the bay of bengal, the east china sea, the gulf of mexico, the north brazil shelf and the south china sea. since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the ocean has absorbed about one third of the carbon dioxide released by human activities, thereby mitigating the full impact of climate change. however, this comes at a steep ecological price, as dissolved carbon dioxide in seawater lowers the ph level of oceans, thereby increasing acidity and changing the biogeochemical carbonate balance. concerns about ocean acidification, first expressed in the early 1980s, have now been confirmed, and the extent of its impact on marine ecosystems is being investigated. fisheries contribute significantly to global food security, livelihoods and the economy. however, if not sustainably managed, fishing can damage fish habitats. ultimately, overfishing impairs the functioning of ecosystems and reduces biodiversity, with negative repercussions for sustainable social and economic development. in order to achieve a healthy balance, fish stocks must be maintained within biologically sustainable limits, at or above the abundance level that can produce maximum sustainable yields.
