protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. this goal articulates targets for preserving biodiversity of forest, desert, and mountain eco systems, as a percentage of total land mass. achieving a "land degradation neutral world" can be reached by restoring degraded forests and land lost to drought and flood. goal 15 calls for more attention to preventing invasion of introduced species and more protection of endangered species. forests have a prominent role to play in the success of agenda 2030, notably in terms of ecosystem services, livelihoods, and the green economy; but this will require clear priorities to address key tradeoffs and mobilize synergies with other sdgs. the mountain green cover index monitors progress toward target 15.4, which focuses on preserving mountain ecosystems. the index is named as the indicator for target 15.4. similarly, the red index (red list index or rli) will fill the monitoring function for biodiversity goals by documenting the trajectory of endangered species. animal extinction is a growing problem. a flourishing life on land is the foundation for our life on this planet.we are all part of the planets ecosystem and we have caused severe damage to it through deforestation, loss of natural habitats and land degradation. promoting a sustainable use of our ecosystems and preserving biodiversity is not a cause. it is the key to our own survival.
