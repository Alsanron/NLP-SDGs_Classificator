global carbon dioxide emissions per unit of value added showed a steady decline between 1990 and 2013, a decrease of about 30 per cent. innovation and the creation of new and more sustainable industries are spurred by investments in research and development. global expenditure on research and development as a proportion of gdp stood at 1.7 per cent in 2013. however, this figure masks wide disparities. expenditure on research and development was 2.4 per cent of gdp for developed regions, 1.2 per cent for developing regions, and below 0.3 per cent for the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries. the number of researchers per 1 million inhabitants showed a similar pattern. while the global average was 1,083 researchers per 1 million inhabitants, the ratio ranged from 65 per 1 million in the least developed countries to 3,641 per 1 million in developed regions. total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing regions reached $59.5 billion in 2014. the main sectors receiving assistance were transport and energy. infrastructure and economic development also rely on information and communications technology. mobile cellular services have spread rapidly around the world, allowing people in previously unconnected areas to join the global information society. by 2015, the percentage of the population living in areas covered by mobile broadband networks stood at 69 per cent globally. in rural areas, the share was only 29 per cent. develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all.
