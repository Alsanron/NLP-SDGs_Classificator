globally, 2 billion people do not have access to waste collection services and 3 billion people lack access to controlled waste disposal facilities. with increasing urban populations and the existence of consumer oriented economies amid rising income levels and rapid urbanization, it is estimated that the total waste generated in the world will double from nearly 2 billion tons in 2016 to about 4 billion tons by 2050. while from 2010 to 2018 the proportion of solid waste collected was about 81 per cent globally, in sub saharan africa it was only 52 per cent. in 2016, 9 in 10 people living in urban areas still breathed air that did not meet the world health organizations air quality guidelines value for particulate matter  that particulate matter 2.5 microns or less in size (pm2.5) not exceed an annual mean of 10 micrograms per m3 or a daily mean of 25 micrograms per m3  and more than half of the world population experienced an increase in pm2.5 from 2010 to 2016. most cities have struggled to ensure that their populations have convenient access to open public spaces (defined as spaces within 400 m walking distance of their residence). based on data from 220 cities in 77 countries in 2018, only 21 per cent of the population had convenient access to open public spaces. however, these results do not necessarily mean that there is an inadequate share of land dedicated to open public spaces in these cities, but rather that their distribution across urban areas is uneven.
