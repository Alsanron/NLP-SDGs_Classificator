Coverage of the required three doses of the vaccine that prevents diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis increased from 72 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2015 and has remained unchanged between 2015 and 2017. An estimated 19.9 million children did not receive the vaccines during the first year of life, putting them at serious risk of these potentially fatal diseases.  2000 to 76 per cent in 2019. Adolescent fertility declined from 56 births per 1,000 adolescent women in 2000 to 45 births in 2015 and 44 births in 2019. The level of adolescent fertility has remained high in sub-Saharan Africa, at 101 births per 1,000 adolescent women. Infectious diseases. Strong and steady domestic and international commitment and funding has fuelled an acceleration of evidence-informed HIV prevention, testing and treatment programmes. As a result, the incidence of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (among adults aged 15 to 49) has declined by 37 per cent, from 3.39 infections per 1,000 uninfected people in 2010 to 2.49 in 2015 and 2.14 in 2017. However, the rate of global HIV incidence among adults aged 15 to 49 declined from 0.44 to 0.40 between 2015 and 2017 and overall by 22 per cent between 2010 and 2017, well short of the declines required to meet 2020 and 2030 targets. Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of ill health and death. In 2017, an estimated 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis. The burden is falling globally: incidence of tuberculosis has continued to decline from 170 new and relapse cases per 100,000 people in 2000 to 140 in 2015, and 134 in 2017; and the tuberculosis mortality rate among HIV-negative people fell by 42 per cent between 2000 and 2017.
