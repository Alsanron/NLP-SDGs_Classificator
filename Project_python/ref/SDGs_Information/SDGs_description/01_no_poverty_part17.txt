children make up the majority, more than half, of those living in extreme poverty. in 2013, an estimated 385 million children lived on less than us$1.90 per day. still, these figures are unreliable due to huge gaps in data on the status of children worldwide. on average, 97 percent of countries have insufficient data to determine the state of impoverished children and make projections towards sdg goal 1, and 63 percent of countries have no data on child poverty at all. women face potentially life threatening risks from early pregnancy and frequent pregnancies. this can result in lost hope for an education and for a better income.[citation needed] poverty affects age groups differently, with the most devastating effects experienced by children. it affects their education, health, nutrition, and security, impacting emotional and spiritual development. achieving goal 1 is hampered by lack of economic growth in the poorest countries of the world, growing inequality, increasingly fragile statehood, and the impacts of climate change. eradicating poverty is not a task of charity, it is an act of justiceand the key to unlocking an enormous human potential. still, nearly half of the worlds population lives in poverty, and lack of food and clean water is killing thousands every single day of the year. together, we can feed the hungry, wipe out disease and give everyone in the world a chance to prosper and live a productive and rich life.
