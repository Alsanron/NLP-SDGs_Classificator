achieving inclusive and equitable quality education for all will require increasing efforts, especially in sub saharan africa and southern asia and for vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities, indigenous people, refugee children and poor children in rural areas. in 2014, about 2 in 3 children worldwide participated in pre primary or primary education in the year prior to official entry age for primary school. however, in the least developed countries, the ratio was only 4 in 10. despite considerable gains in education enrolment over the past 15 years, worldwide, the adjusted net enrolment rates were 91 per cent for primary education, 84 per cent for lower secondary education and 63 per cent for upper secondary education in 2014. about 263 million children and youth were out of school, including 61 million children of primary school age. sub saharan africa and southern asia account for over 70 per cent of the global out ofschool population in primary and secondary education. even though more children than ever are going to school, many do not acquire basic skills in reading and mathematics. recent learning assessment studies show that in 9 of 24 sub saharan african countries and 6 of 15 latin american countries with data, fewer than half of the students at the end of primary education had attained minimum proficiency levels in mathematics. in 6 of 24 sub saharan african countries with data, fewer than half of the students who finished their primary schooling had attained minimum proficiency levels in reading.
