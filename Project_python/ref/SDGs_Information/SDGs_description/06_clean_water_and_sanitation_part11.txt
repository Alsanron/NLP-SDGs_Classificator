in 2015, 68 per cent of the global population was using improved sanitation facilities compared to 59 per cent in 2000. nevertheless, the unsafe management of faecal waste and wastewater continues to present a major risk to public health and the environment. more progress has been made in access to drinking water. in 2015, 6.6 billion people, or 91 per cent of the global population, used an improved drinking water source, versus 82 per cent in 2000. despite that improvement, an estimated 663 million people were using unimproved water sources or surface water that year. while coverage was around 90 per cent or more in all regions except sub saharan africa and oceania, widespread inequalities persist within and among countries. moreover, not all improved sources are safe. for instance, in 2012 it was estimated that at least 1.8 billion people were exposed to drinking water sources contaminated with faecal matter. holistic management of the water cycle means taking into account the level of water stress, calculated as the ratio of total fresh water withdrawn by all major sectors to the total renewable fresh water resources in a particular country or region. currently, water stress affects more than 2 billion people around the world, a figure that is projected to rise. already, water stress affects countries on every continent and hinders the sustainability of natural resources, as well as economic and social development. in 2011, 41 countries experienced water stress, an increase from 36 countries in 1998. of those, 10 countries, on the arabian peninsula, in central asia and in northern africa, withdrew more than 100 per cent of their renewable fresh water resources.
