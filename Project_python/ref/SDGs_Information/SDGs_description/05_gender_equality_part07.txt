according to recent data from some 90 countries, women devote on average roughly three times more hours a day to unpaid care and domestic work than men, limiting the time available for paid work, education and leisure and further reinforcing gender based socioeconomic disadvantages. women continue to be underrepresented at all levels of political leadership. as at 1 january 2019, womens representation in national parliaments ranged from 0 to 61.3 per cent, with the average standing at 24.2 per cent, an increase from 19 per cent in 2010. at the local level, data from 99 countries and areas show that womens representation in elected deliberative bodies varies from less than 1 per cent to 48 per cent, with the median of the distribution at 26 per cent. when legislated gender quotas are adopted, significantly higher proportions of women are elected at both national and local levels. while women represented 39 per cent of world employment, only 27 per cent of managerial positions in the world were occupied by women in 2018, up only marginally from 26 per cent in 2015. the proportion of women in management has increased since 2000 in all regions except in least developed countries. in 51 countries with data on the subject, only 57 per cent of women aged 15 to 49, married or in union, make their own decisions about sexual relations and the use of contraceptives and health services.
