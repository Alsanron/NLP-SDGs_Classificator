even though the absolute level of renewable energy consumption has grown by more than 18 per cent since 2010, only since 2012 has the growth of renewables outpaced the growth of total energy consumption. e/2019/68 14/39 19 07404. global primary energy intensity (ratio of energy used per unit of gdp) improved from 5.9 in 2010 to 5.1 in 2016, a rate of improvement of 2.3 per cent, which is still short of the 2.7 per cent annual rate needed to reach target 3 of sustainable development goal 7. international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy reached $18.6 billion in 2016, almost doubling from $9.9 billion in 2010. ensuring access to affordable, reliable and modern energy for all has come one step closer due to recent progress in electrification, particularly in ldcs, and improvements in industrial energy efficiency. however, national priorities and policy ambitions still need to be strengthened to put the world on track to meet the energy targets for 2030. from 2000 to 2016, the proportion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 78 per cent to 87 per cent, with the absolute number of people living without electricity dipping to just below 1 billion. in the least developed countries, the proportion of the people with access to electricity more than doubled between 2000 and 2016.
