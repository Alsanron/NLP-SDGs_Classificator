goal 12: ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. sustainable consumption and production is about promoting resource and energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and providing access to basic services, green and decent jobs and a better quality of life for all. its implementation helps to achieve overall development plans, reduce future economic, environmental and social costs, strengthen economic competitiveness and reduce poverty. at the current time, material consumption of natural resources is increasing, particularly within eastern asia. countries are also continuing to address challenges regarding air, water and soil pollution. since sustainable consumption and production aims at doing more and better with less, net welfare gains from economic activities can increase by reducing resource use, degradation and pollution along the whole life cycle, while increasing quality of life. there also needs to be significant focus on operating on supply chain, involving everyone from producer to final consumer. this includes educating consumers on sustainable consumption and lifestyles, providing them with adequate information through standards and labels and engaging in sustainable public procurement, among others. should the global population reach 9.6 billion by 2050, the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. with rises in the use of non metallic minerals within infrastructure and construction, there has been significant improvement in the material standard of living.
