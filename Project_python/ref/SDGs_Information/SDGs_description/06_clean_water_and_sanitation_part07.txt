almost all countries that have registered high water stress are located in north africa and west asia or in central and south asia, and these levels indicate serious water difficulties in the supply of freshwater, at least during parts of the year. of 172 countries, 80 per cent have medium low implementation or better of integrated water resources management. however, 60 per cent of countries are unlikely to reach the target of full implementation by 2030. a significant effort is needed to ensure that cooperation is operational in all transboundary basins. according to data from 67 of 153 countries that share transboundary waters, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was 59 per cent in the period 20172018, with only 17 countries reporting that all their transboundary basins were covered by such arrangements. following several years of steady increases and after reaching $9 billion in 2016, oda disbursements to the water sector declined by 2 per cent from 2016 to 2017. however, oda commitments to the water sector jumped by 36 per cent between 2016 and 2017, indicating a renewed focus by donors on the sector. too many people still lack access to safely managed water supplies and sanitation facilities. water scarcity, flooding and lack of proper wastewater management also hinder social and economic development. increasing water efficiency and improving water management are critical to balancing the competing and growing water demands from various sectors and users.
