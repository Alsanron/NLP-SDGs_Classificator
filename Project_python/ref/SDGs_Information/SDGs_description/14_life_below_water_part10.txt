in response, about 70 per cent of the respondents to a survey representing 92 countries and the european union have introduced or developed regulations, policies, laws, plans or strategies specifically targeting small scale fisheries. when effectively managed and well resourced, marine protected areas are important mechanisms for safeguarding ocean life. in 2017, protected areas cover 13.2 per cent of the marine environment under national jurisdiction (up to 200 nautical miles from shore), 0.25 per cent of the marine environment beyond national jurisdiction and 5.3 per cent of the total global ocean area. oceans, along with coastal and marine resources, play an essential role in human well being and social and economic development worldwide. they are particularly crucial for people living in coastal communities, who represented 37 per cent of the global population in 2010. oceans provide livelihoods and tourism benefits, as well as subsistence and income. they also help regulate the global ecosystem by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and protecting coastal areas from flooding and erosion. in fact, coastal and marine resources contribute an estimated $28 trillion to the global economy each year through ecosystem services. however, those resources are extremely vulnerable to environmental degradation, overfishing, climate change and pollution. the sustainable use and preservation of marine and coastal ecosystems and their biological diversity is essential to achieving the 2030 agenda, in particular for small island developing states.
