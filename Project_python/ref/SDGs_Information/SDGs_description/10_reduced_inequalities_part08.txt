duty free access continued to increase for least developed countries, small island developing states and developing regions at large. more than 50 per cent of exports from developing countries are now eligible for duty free treatment. the increase of duty free access in world markets was the largest for least developed countries, namely in the industrial and agricultural sector. in 2017, total receipts by developing countries from donors of the development assistance committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development, multilateral agencies and other key providers were $414 billion, of which $163 billion were oda. total oda to small island developing states from all donors was $4.3 billion in 2017, a decrease of 33 per cent in real terms over 2016, due to exceptional debt relief operations for cuba in 2016. efforts have been made in some countries to reduce income inequality, increase zero tariff access for exports from ldcs and developing countries, and provide additional assistance to ldcs and small island developing states (sids). however, progress will need to accelerate to reduce growing disparities within and among countries. between 2010 and 2016, in 60 out of 94 countries with data, the incomes of the poorest 40 per cent of the population grew faster than those of the entire population. in 2016, over 64.4 per cent of products exported by ldcs to world markets and 64.1 per cent of those from sids faced zero tariffs, an increase of 20 per cent since 2010.
