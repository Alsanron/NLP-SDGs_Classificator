how much would it cost to solve this problem? in total, public and private sector investment in clean energy needs to reach at least us$1 trillion per year by 2030, and more to build climate resilience. this sounds like a lot, but consider that of the us$1.7 trillion invested in the global energy supply in 2016, nearly 70% was related to fossil fuels. but more and more, governments and businesses are finding that investments in renewable energy and sustainability are paying off. whats more is that the estimated costs of mitigation do not account for the benefits of reduced climate change. these include cleaner air, greater food security, more liveable cities, and better health. investments of only $6 billion for disaster risk reduction over the next 15 years would result in total benefits of $360 billion in terms of avoided losses over the lifetime of the investment. with rising greenhouse gas emissions, climate change is occurring at rates much faster than anticipated and its effects are clearly felt worldwide. while there are positive steps in terms of the climate finance flows and the development of nationally determined contributions, far more ambitious plans and accelerated action are needed on mitigation and adaptation. access to finance and strengthened capacities need to be scaled up at a much faster rate, particularly for least developed countries and small island developing states. increasing greenhouse gas emissions are driving climate change.
