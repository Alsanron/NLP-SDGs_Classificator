in contrast, the share of manufacturing value added in gdp remained relatively stagnant for developing regions, increasing marginally from 19 per cent in 2005 to 21 per cent in 2015. those values hide substantial differences, with manufacturing value added contributing over 31 per cent to gdp in eastern asia and 10 per cent or less in both sub saharan africa and oceania. the least developed countries face particular challenges in industrializing. although those countries represent 13 per cent of the global population, they contribute less than 1 per cent of global manufacturing value added. worldwide, about 500 million people are employed in manufacturing. while manufacturing job numbers have fallen in industrialized countries, they have steadily increased in developing countries. in the least developed countries, agricultural and traditional sectors remain the main sources of employment. in developing countries, small scale industries accounted for an estimated 15 per cent to 20 per cent of value added and 25 per cent to 30 per cent of total industrial employment in 2015. however, access to financial services in those countries remains a problem. globally, the credit gap for small and medium enterprises (defined as having between 5 and 99 employees) was estimated at $3.2 trillion to $3.9 trillion in 2012. in emerging markets, between 45 per cent and 55 per cent of all small and medium enterprises are unserved or underserved by financial services. as the structure of world economies shifts to less energy intensive industries and countries implement policies for enhanced energy efficiency, almost all regions have shown a reduction in carbon intensity of gdp.
