the intensity of global carbon dioxide (co2) emissions from manufacturing industries declined by more than 20 per cent between 2000 and 2016, to 0.30 kg co2 per united states dollar, showing a general decoupling of co2 emissions and gdp growth. the proportion of global gdp invested in research and development increased from 1.52 per cent to 1.68 per cent from 2000 to 2016, with europe and northern america standing at 2.21 per cent of gdp spent on research and development and most developing regions falling short of the world average in 2016. while there has been an increase in the number of researchers per million inhabitants from 804 in 2000 to 1,163 in 2016, that number reached only 91 in sub saharan africa. total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing countries reached $59 billion in 2017, an increase of 32.5 per cent in real terms since 2010. within this total, the main sectors assisted were transport ($21.6 billion) and banking and financial services ($13.4 billion). in 2016, medium high and high tech sectors accounted for 44.7 per cent of the global manufacturing value added. medium high and high tech products continued to dominate manufacturing production in northern america and europe, reaching 47.4 per cent in 2016 compared with 10.4 per cent in least developed countries. almost all people around the world now live within range of a mobile cellular network signal, with 90 per cent living within range of a 3g quality or higher network. this evolution of the mobile network, however, is growing more rapidly than the percentage of the population using the internet. steady progress has been made in the manufacturing industry.
