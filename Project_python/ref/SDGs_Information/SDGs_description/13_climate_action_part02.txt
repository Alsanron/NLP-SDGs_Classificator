as of april 2018, 175 parties had ratified the paris agreement and 10 developing countries had submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change. limiting global warming to 1.5c would require rapid, far reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society, the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) said in a new assessment. with clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems, limiting global warming to 1.5c compared to 2c could go hand in hand with ensuring a more sustainable and equitable society. as of april 2018, 175 parties had ratified the paris agreement and 168 parties had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the un framework convention on climate change secretariat. as of april 2018, 10 developing countries had successfully completed and submitted their first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change. developed country parties continue to make progress towards the goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020 for mitigation actions. thanks to the intergovernmental panel on climate change we know: from 1880 to 2012, average global temperature increased by 0.85c. to put this into perspective, for each 1 degree of temperature increase, grain yields decline by about 5 per cent. maize, wheat and other major crops have experienced significant yield reductions at the global level of 40 megatons per year between 1981 and 2002 due to a warmer climate. oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished and sea level has risen.from 1901 to 2010, the global average sea level rose by 19 cm as oceans expanded due to warming and ice melted.
