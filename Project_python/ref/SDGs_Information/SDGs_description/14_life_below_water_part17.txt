the sustainable management of our oceans relies on the ability to influence and guide human use of the marine environment. as conservation of marine resources is critical to the well being of local fishing communities and their livelihoods, related management actions may lead to changes in human behavior to support conservation programs to achieve their goals. ultimately, governments and international agencies act as gatekeepers, interfering with needed stakeholder participation in decision making. the way to best safeguard life in oceans is to implement effective management strategies around marine environments. climate action is used as a way of protecting the world s oceans. oceans cover three quarters of the earth s surface and impact global climate systems through functions of carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere and oxygen generation. the increase in levels of greenhouse gases leading to changes in climate negatively affects the world s oceans and marine coastal communities. the resulting impacts of rising sea levels by 20 centimeters since the start of the 20th century and the increase of ocean acidity by 30% since the industrial revolution has contributed to the melting of ice sheets through the thermal expansion of sea water. sustainable development goal 14 has been incorporated into the convention on biological diversity (cbd), the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc), and the united nations convention to combat desertification (unccd). healthy oceans and seas are essential to our existence.they cover 70 percent of our planet and we rely on them for food, energy and water. yet, we have managed to do tremendous damage to these precious resources. we must protect them by eliminating pollution and overfishing and immediately start to responsibly manage and protect all marine life around the world.
