between 1990 and 2016, the proportion of the global urban population living in slums fell from 46 to 23 per cent. this progress was largely offset by internal population growth and rural urban migration. in 2016, just over 1 billion people lived in slums or informal settlements, with over half (589 million) living in east, south east, central and south asia. the proportion of urban residents who have convenient access to public transport (defined as living within 500 m walking distance of a bus stop and within 1,000 m of a railway and/or ferry terminal) remains low, particularly in developing countries. based on data from 227 cities from 78 countries in 2018, on average, 53 per cent of urban residents in all regions had convenient access to public transport, from a low of 18 per cent in sub saharan africa to a high of 75 per cent in australia and new zealand. in some regions that have low access to public transport, informal transport modes are highly prevalent and in many cases provide reliable transport for the majority of urban populations. globally, urban areas are expanding at a faster rate than their populations. between 2000 and 2014, areas occupied by cities grew 1.28 times faster than their populations. closely related to this trend is that the urban densities of cities have been declining, creating profound repercussions for environmental sustainability at the local, regional and global scale. better management of urban growth will be crucial in order to guarantee sustainable urbanization.
