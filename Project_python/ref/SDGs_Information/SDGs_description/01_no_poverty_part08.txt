only one third of all countries spend between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of total government expenditure on education, as recommended in the education 2030 framework for action. while extreme poverty has eased considerably since 1990, pockets of the worst forms of poverty persist. ending poverty requires universal social protection systems aimed at safeguarding all individuals throughout the life cycle. it also requires targeted measures to reduce vulnerability to disasters and to address specific underserved geographic areas within each country. the rate of extreme poverty has fallen rapidly: in 2013 it was a third of the 1990 value. the latest global estimate suggests that 11 per cent of the world population, or 783 million people, lived below the extreme poverty threshold in 2013. the proportion of the worlds workers living with their families on less than $1.90 per person a day declined significantly over the past two decades, falling from 26.9 per cent in 2000 to 9.2 per cent in 2017. based on 2016 estimates, only 45 per cent of the worlds population were effectively covered by at least one social protection cash benefit. in 2017, economic losses attributed to disasters were estimated at over $300 billion. this is among the highest losses in recent years, owing to three major hurricanes affecting the united states of america and several countries across the caribbean. despite the fact that the global poverty rate has been halved since 2000, intensified efforts are required to boost the incomes, alleviate the suffering and build the resilience of those individuals still living in extreme poverty, in particular in sub saharan africa.
