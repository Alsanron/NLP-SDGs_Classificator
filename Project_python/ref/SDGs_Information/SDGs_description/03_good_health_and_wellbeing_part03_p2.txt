whats the goal here? to ensure healthy lives and promote well being for all at all ages. why? ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all at all ages is important to building prosperous societies. major progress has been made in improving the health of millions of people. maternal and child mortality rates have been reduced, life expectancy continues to increase globally, and the fight against some infectious diseases has made steady progress. however, in the case of other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis, progress has slowed or stalled. at least half the worlds population are still without access to essential health services. in rich and poor countries alike, a health emergency can push people into bankruptcy or poverty. concerted efforts are required to achieve universal health coverage and sustainable financing for health; address the growing burden of non communicable diseases, tackle antimicrobial resistance and environmental factors contributing to ill health. what progress have we made so far? major progress has been made in several areas, including in child and maternal health as well as in addressing hiv/aids. despite this progress, maternal mortality continues to affect women in low  and middle income countries disproportionately. the total number of deaths of children under 5 years of age dropped from 9.8 million in 2000 to 5.4 million in 2017. half of those deaths occurred in sub saharan africa, and another 30 per cent in southern asia. yet stark disparities persist across regions and countries. how much will it cost to achieve these targets? ensuring healthy lives for all requires a strong commitment, but the benefits outweigh the cost.
