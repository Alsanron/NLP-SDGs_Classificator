world pensions council (wpc) development economists have argued that the twin considerations of long term economic growth and infrastructure investment were not prioritized enough. the fact they were designated as the number 8 and number 9 objective respectively was considered a rather "mediocre ranking [which] defies common sense". for the least developed countries, the economic target is to attain at least a 7 percent annual growth in gross domestic product (gdp). achieving higher productivity will require diversification and upgraded technology along with innovation, entrepreneurship, and the growth of small  and medium sized enterprises (smes). some targets are for 2030; others are for 2020. the target for 2020 is to reduce youth unemployment and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment. implementing the global jobs pact of the international labour organization is also mentioned. by 2030, the target is to establish policies for sustainable tourism that will create jobs. strengthening domestic financial institutions and increasing aid for trade support for developing countries is considered essential to economic development. the enhanced integrated framework for trade related technical assistance to least developed countries is mentioned as a method for achieving sustainable economic development. economic growth should be a positive force for the whole planet.this is why we must make sure that financial progress creates decent and fulfilling jobs while not harming the environment. we must protect labour rights and once and for all put a stop to modern slavery and child labour. if we promote job creation with expanded access to banking and financial services, we can make sure that everybody gets the benefits of entrepreneurship and innovation.
