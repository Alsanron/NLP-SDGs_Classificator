decoupling economic growth from resource use is one of the most critical and complex challenges facing humanity today. doing so effectively will require policies that create a conducive environment for such change, social and physical infrastructure and markets, and a profound transformation of business practices along global value chains. the per capita material footprint of developing countries grew from 5 metric tons in 2000 to 9 metric tons in 2017, representing a significant improvement in the material standard of living. most of the increase is attributed to a rise in the use of non metallic minerals, pointing to growth in the areas of infrastructure and construction. for all types of materials, developed countries have at least double the per capita footprint of developing countries. in particular, the material footprint for fossil fuels is more than four times higher for developed than developing countries. by 2018, a total of 108 countries had national policies and initiatives relevant to sustainable consumption and production. according to a recent report from kpmg, 93 per cent of the worlds 250 largest companies (in terms of revenue) are now reporting on sustainability, as are three quarters of the top 100 companies in 49 countries. achieving goal 12 requires a strong national framework for sustainable consumption and production that is integrated into national and sectoral plans, sustainable business practices and consumer behaviour, together with adherence to international norms on the management of hazardous chemicals and wastes.
