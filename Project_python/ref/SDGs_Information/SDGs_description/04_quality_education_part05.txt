are there groups that have a more difficult access to education? yes, women and girls are one of these groups. about one third of countries in the developing regions have not achieved gender parity in primary education. in sub saharan africa, oceania and western asia, girls still face barriers to entering both primary and secondary school. these disadvantages in education also translate into lack of access to skills and limited opportunities in the labour market for young women. what can we do? ask our governments to place education as a priority in both policy and practice. lobby our governments to make firm commitments to provide free primary school education to all, including vulnerable or marginalized groups. encourage the private sector to invest resources in the development of educational tools and facilities. urge ngos to partner with youth and other groups to foster the importance of education within local communities. despite the considerable progress on education access and participation over the past years, 262 million children and youth aged 6 to 17 were still out of school in 2017, and more than half of children and adolescents are not meeting minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. rapid technological changes present opportunities and challenges, but the learning environment, the capacities of teachers and the quality of education have not kept pace.
