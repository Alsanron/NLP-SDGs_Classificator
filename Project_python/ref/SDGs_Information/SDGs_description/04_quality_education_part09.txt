equity issues constitute a major challenge in education according to a recent assessment. in all countries with data, children from the richest 20 per cent of households achieved greater proficiency in reading at the end of their primary and lower secondary education than children from the poorest 20 per cent of households. in most countries with data, urban children scored higher in reading than rural children. the lack of trained teachers and the poor condition of schools in many parts of the world are jeopardizing prospects for quality education for all. sub  saharan africa has a relatively low percentage of trained teachers in pre  primary, primary and secondary education (44 per cent, 74 per cent and 55 per cent, respectively). moreover, the majority of schools in the region do not have access to electricity or potable water. on the basis of data from 65 developing countries, the average percentage of schools with access to computers and the internet for teaching purposes is above 60 per cent in both primary and secondary education. however, the share is less than 40 per cent in more than half of sub saharan countries with data. official development assistance (oda) for scholarships amounted to $1 billion in 2015, a decrease from $1.2 billion in 2014. australia, france and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland were the largest contributors. despite progress, the world failed to meet the millennium development goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015.
