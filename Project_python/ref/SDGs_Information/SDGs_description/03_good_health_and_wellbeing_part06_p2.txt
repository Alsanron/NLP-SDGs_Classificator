however, large gaps in detection and treatment persist and the current pace of progress is not fast enough to meet the sustainable development goal target, with drug resistant tuberculosis remaining a continuing threat. after more than a decade of steady advances in fighting malaria, progress has stalled. no significant gains were made in reducing the number of malaria cases worldwide in the period 20152017. sub saharan africa continues to carry the heaviest burden of disease, accounting for more than 90 per cent of the global malaria burden. worryingly, there were an estimated 3.5 million more malaria cases in the 10 highest burden african countries in 2017 compared with the previous year. in 2015, an estimated 325 million people worldwide were living with hepatitis b virus or hepatitis c virus infection. the widespread use of hepatitis b vaccine in infants has considerably reduced the incidence of new chronic hbv infections, as reflected by the decline in hepatitis b prevalence among children under 5 years of age, from 4.7 per cent in the pre vaccine era to 0.8 per cent in 2017. in 2017, 1.58 billion people were reported as requiring the global coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which has the potential to significantly reduce deaths in children under age of 5, has yet to reach 50 per cent. two doses of the measles vaccine are required to prevent the disease and the illnesses, disabilities and deaths caused by complications associated with it.  coverage with the second dose of measles vaccine increased from 59 per cent in 2015 to 67 per cent in 2017, but that is still insufficient to prevent this highly contagious disease.
