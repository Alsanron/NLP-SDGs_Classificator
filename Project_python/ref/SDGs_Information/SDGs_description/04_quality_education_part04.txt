education is also crucial to fostering tolerance between people and contributes to more peaceful societies. how much progress have we made so far? despite years of steady growth in enrolment rates, non proficiency rates remain disturbingly high. globally, an estimated 617 million children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school age, more than 55 per cent of the global total, lacked minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics in 2015. non proficiency rates are highest in sub saharan africa and central and southern asia, where more than 80 per cent of children of primary and lower secondary school age were not proficient in reading. where are people struggling the most to have access to education? adequate infrastructure and teacher training play a critical role in the quality of education. sub saharan africa faces the biggest challenges in providing schools with basic resources. the situation is extreme at the primary and lower secondary levels, where less than one half of schools in sub saharan africa have access to drinking water, electricity, computers and the internet. another important step towards the goal of good quality education for all is getting enough trained teachers into classrooms. here again, sub saharan africa lags behind.
