various forms of violence against children are pervasive, including discipline that relies on physical punishment and psychological aggression. in all but 7 of 73 countries and areas with available survey data from 2005 to 2015, more than half of children between the ages of 1 and 14 were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home. in northern africa, the share was more than 90 per cent. globally, the share of girls and boys among victims of human trafficking (21 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively) peaked in 2011. by 2014, the figures had dropped to 18 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, but were still almost twice the levels recorded for 2004. sexual violence is one of the most unsettling of childrens rights violations. yet underreporting and the lack of comparable data limit understanding of the full extent of the problem. survey data from 31 low  and middle income countries suggest that the proportion of women aged between 18 and 29 who experienced sexual violence for the first time before the age of 18 varies widely, ranging from zero to 16 per cent. comparable data on the experiences of men are only available for five countries, but values are lower than those reported among women in the same countries. progress with respect to the rule of law and access to justice is mixed. globally, the proportion of people held in detention without sentencing decreased slightly, from 32 per cent of total detainees in 2003 2005 to 30 per cent in 2012 2014. however, the percentage for developing regions has consistently been more than two times that of developed regions.
