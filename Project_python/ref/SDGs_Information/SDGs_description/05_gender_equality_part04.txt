In 2018, women only held 27 per cent of managerial positions worldwide. Whats the goal here? To achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Why? Women and girls represent half of the worlds population and therefore also half of its potential. But, today gender inequality persists everywhere and stagnates social progress. Women continue to be underrepresented at all levels of political leadership. Across the globe, women and girls perform a disproportionate share of unpaid domestic work. Inequalities faced by girls can begin right at birth and follow them all their lives. In some countries, girls are deprived of access to health care or proper nutrition, leading to a higher mortality rate. How much progress have we made? Women and girls around the world continue to experience violence and cruel practices. Physical and/or sexual violence affects women of all ages, ethnicities, socioeconomic status and educational level. Child marriage also affects girls education. About one third of developing countries have not achieved gender parity in primary education. In sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania and Western Asia, girls still face barriers to entering both primary and secondary school. How does gender inequality affect women? Disadvantages in education translate into lack of access to skills and limited opportunities in the labour market. Womens and girls empowerment is essential to expand economic growth and promote social development. The full participation of women in labour forces would add percentage points to most national growth rates double digits in many cases. Are there any other gender-related challenges?
