the arctics sea ice extent has shrunk in every successive decade since 1979, with 1.07 million km of ice loss every decade. given current concentrations and on going emissions of greenhouse gases, it is likely that by the end of this century, the increase in global temperature will exceed 1.5c compared to 1850 to 1900 for all but one scenario. the worlds oceans will warm and ice melt will continue. average sea level rise is predicted as 24  30cm by 2065 and 40 63cm by 2100. most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries even if emissions are stopped. global emissions of carbon dioxide (co2) have increased by almost 50 per cent since 1990. emissions grew more quickly between 2000 and 2010 than in each of the three previous decades. it is still possible, using a wide array of technological measures and changes in behavior, to limit the increase in global mean temperature to two degrees celsius above pre industrial levels. major institutional and technological change will give a better than even chance that global warming will not exceed this threshold. strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate related hazards and natural disasters in all countries. integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning. improve education, awareness raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.
