overall average annual gdp growth in the least developed countries followed a similar trend, decelerating from 7.1 per cent in 2005  2009 to 4.9 per cent in 2010 2015, below the sustainable development goals target of 7 per cent. labour productivity (annual growth rate of real gdp per worker) globally has slowed from an average annual rate of 2.9 per cent from 2000 to 2008 to 1.9 per cent from 2009 to 2016. the slowdown represents a negative development for the global economy, with adverse effects on living standards and real wages. the global unemployment rate stood at 5.7 per cent in 2016, with women more likely to be unemployed than men across all age groups. youth were almost three times as likely as adults to be unemployed, with unemployment rates of 12.8 per cent and 4.4 per cent, respectively, in 2016. moreover, in more than 76 per cent of countries with data, more than 1 in 10 youth are neither in the educational system nor working. young women are more likely than young men to fall into that category in almost 70 per cent of countries with data. while the number of children from 5 to 17 years of age who are working has declined from 246 million in 2000 to 168 million in 2012, child labour remains a serious concern. more than half of child labourers (85 million children) participate in hazardous work and 59 per cent of them work in the agricultural sector.
