about 24 per cent of the remaining reefs are under imminent risk of collapse through human pressures, and a further 26 per cent are under a longer term threat of collapse. furthermore, improper marine management results in overfishing. the lost economic benefits from the fisheries sector are estimated to be around us$50 billion annually. the un environment programme estimates the cumulative economic impact of poor ocean management practices is at least us$200 billion per year. in the absence of mitigation measures, climate change will increase the cost of damage to the ocean by an additional us$322 billion per year by 2050. what would it cost to correct this? the costs of taking action largely are offset by the long term gains. in economic terms, the convention on biological diversity suggests that scaled up actions to sustain the global ocean require a us$32 billion one time public cost and us$21 billion dollars a year for recurring costs. so what can we do? for open ocean and deep sea areas, sustainability can be achieved only through increased international cooperation to protect vulnerable habitats. establishing comprehensive, effective and equitably managed systems of government protected areas should be pursued to conserve biodiversity and ensure a sustainable future for the fishing industry. on a local level, we should make ocean friendly choices when buying products or eating food derived from oceans and consume only what we need. selecting certified products is a good place to start. making small changes in our daily lives, like taking public transport and unplugging electronics saves energy.
