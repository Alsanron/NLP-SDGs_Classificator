completion rates for both primary and lower secondary education has been rising steadily since 2000. completion rates for primary education in both developed and developing regions exceeded 90 per cent in 2013. at the lower secondary level, the gap between developed and developing regions has narrowed substantially, but still stood at nearly 20 percentage points in 2013 (91 per cent for developed regions and 72 per cent for developing regions). quality early education provides children with basic cognitive and language skills and fosters emotional development. in the majority of the 58 countries with available data for the period 2009 2015, more than half of children between the ages of 3 and 4 were developmentally on track in at least three of the following domains: literacy, numeracy, physical development, social emotional development and learning. goal 4 strongly supports the reduction of persistent disparities. worldwide, in 2013, two thirds of the 757 million adults (aged 15 and over) who were unable to read and write were women. globally, in 2013, 1 in 10 girls were out of school, compared to 1 in 12 boys. children from the poorest 20 per cent of households are nearly four times more likely to be out of school than their richest peers. out of school rates are also higher in rural areas and among children from households headed by someone with less than a primary education. to fulfil the promise of universal primary and secondary education, new primary school teachers are needed, with current estimates showing a need for nearly 26 million of them by 2030.
