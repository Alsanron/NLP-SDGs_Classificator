international law, as reflected in the un convention on the law of the sea (unclos), stressed the need to include governance instruments to consider anthropogenic activities taking place outside of the ocean. concerns regarding ocean health in destructive fishing practices and marine pollution were discussed, in looking at the role of local communities of small island developing states (sids) and least developed countries (ldcs) to not forget that oceans are a large part of their economies. the targets include preventing and reducing marine pollution and acidification, protecting marine and coastal ecosystems, and regulating fishing. the targets also call for an increase in scientific knowledge of the oceans. although many participating united nations legislative bodies comes together to discuss the issues around marine environments and sdg 14, such as at the united nations ocean conference, it is important to consider how sdg 14 is implemented across different multilateral environmental agreements, respectively. as climate, biodiversity and land degradation are major parts of the issues surrounding the deterioration of marine environments and oceans, it is important to know how each rio convention implements this sdg. oceans cover 71 percent of the earth s surface. they are essential for making the planet livable. rainwater, drinking water and climate are all regulated by ocean temperatures and currents. over 3 billion people depend on marine life for their livelihood. oceans absorb 30 percent of all carbon dioxide produced by humans. the oceans contain more than 200,000 identified species, and there might be thousands of species that are yet to be discovered. oceans are the world s largest sources of protein. however, there has been a 26 percent increase in acidification since the industrial revolution. a full 30 percent of marine habitats have been destroyed, and 30 percent of the world s fish stocks are over exploited.
