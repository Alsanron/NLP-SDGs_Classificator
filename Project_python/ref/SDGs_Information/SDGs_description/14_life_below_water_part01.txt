goal 14: conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources. the worlds oceans  their temperature, chemistry, currents and life  drive global systems that make the earth habitable for humankind. our rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate, coastlines, much of our food, and even the oxygen in the air we breathe, are all ultimately provided and regulated by the sea. throughout history, oceans and seas have been vital conduits for trade and transportation. careful management of this essential global resource is a key feature of a sustainable future. however, at the current time, there is a continuous deterioration of coastal waters owing to pollution and ocean acidification is having an adversarial effect on the functioning of ecosystems and biodiversity. this is also negatively impacting small scale fisheries. marine protected areas need to be effectively managed and well resourced and regulations need to be put in place to reduce overfishing, marine pollution and ocean acidification. oceans cover three quarters of the earths surface, contain 97 per cent of the earths water, and represent 99 per cent of the living space on the planet by volume. over three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. globally, the market value of marine and coastal resources and industries is estimated at $3 trillion per year or about 5 per cent of global gdp. oceans contain nearly 200,000 identified species, but actual numbers may lie in the millions. oceans absorb about 30 per cent of carbon dioxide produced by humans, buffering the impacts of global warming.
