poor hygiene and unsafe water are responsible for nearly 90 per cent of these deaths and mostly affect children. the economic impact of not investing in water and sanitation costs 4.3 per cent of sub saharan african gdp. the world bank estimates that 6.4 per cent of indias gdp is lost due to adverse economic impacts and costs of inadequate sanitation. without better infrastructure and management, millions of people will continue to die every year and there will be further losses in biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, undermining prosperity and efforts towards a more sustainable future. what can we do? civil society organizations should work to keep governments accountable, invest in water research and development, and promote the inclusion of women, youth and indigenous communities in water resources governance. generating awareness of these roles and turning them into action will lead to win win results and increased sustainability and integrity for both human and ecological systems. you can also get involved in the world water day and world toilet day campaigns that aim to provide information and inspiration to take action on hygiene issues. despite progress, billions of people still lack safe water, sanitation and handwashing facilities. data suggests that achieving universal access to even basic sanitation service by 2030 would require doubling the current annual rate of progress. more efficient use and management of water are critical to addressing the growing demand for water, threats to water security and the increasing frequency and severity of droughts and floods resulting from climate change.
