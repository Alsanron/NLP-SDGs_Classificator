still, at least 22 million children in 43 countries will miss out on pre primary education unless the rate of progress doubles. access does not always mean quality of education or completion of primary school. 103 million youth worldwide still lack basic literacy skills, and more than 60 percent of those are women.  in one out of four countries, more than half of children failed to meet minimum math proficiency standards at the end of primary school, and at the lower secondary level, the rate was 1 in 3 countries. target 1 of goal 4 is to ensure that, by 2030, all girls and boys complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education. additionally, progress is difficult to track: 75 percent of countries have no or insufficient data to track progress towards sdg goal 4 targets for learning outcomes (target 1), early childhood education (target 2), and effective learning environments. data on learning outcomes and pre primary school are particularly scarce; 70 percent and 40 percent of countries lack adequate data for these targets, respectively. this makes it hard to analyze and identify the children at greatest risk of being left behind. a 2019 study used computer modeling to estimate educational attainment for men and women from 2000 2017, mapping the results for each country to help identify areas lagging behind. education liberates the intellect, unlocks the imagination and is fundamental for self respect. it is the key to prosperity and opens a world of opportunities, making it possible for each of us to contribute to a progressive, healthy society. learning benefits every human being and should be available to all.
