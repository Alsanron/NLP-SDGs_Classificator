one out of 10 countries had a deviation of more than plus or minus 15 per cent. almost half of low income economies showed more than plus or minus 10 per cent deviation in budget execution. many regions of the world continue to suffer untold horrors as a result of armed conflict or other forms of violence that occur within societies and at the domestic level. advances in promoting the rule of law and access to justice are uneven. however, progress is being made in regulations to promote public access to information, albeit slowly, and in strengthening institutions upholding human rights at the national level. nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 years were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment on a regular basis at home in 81 countries (primarily developing), according to available data from 2005 to 2017. in all but seven of these countries, more than half of children experienced violent forms of discipline. more than 570 different flows involving trafficking in persons were detected between 2012 and 2014, affecting all regions; many involved movement from lower income to higher income countries. in 2014, the majority of detected trafficking victims were women and girls (71 per cent), and about 28 per cent were children (20 per cent girls and 8 per cent boys). over 90 per cent of victims detected were trafficked for sexual exploitation or forced labour. the proportion of prisoners held in detention without being sentenced for a crime remained almost constant in the last decade: from 32 per cent in 20032005 to 31 per cent in 20142016.
