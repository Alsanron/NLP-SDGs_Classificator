globally, 61 per cent of all workers were engaged in informal employment in 2016. excluding the agricultural sector, 51 per cent of all workers fell into this employment category. data from 45 countries suggest that gender inequality in earnings is still pervasive: in 89 per cent of these countries, the hourly wages of men are, on average, higher than those of women, with a median pay gap of 12.5 per cent. the global unemployment rate in 2017 was 5.6 per cent, down from 6.4 per cent in 2000. the decline has slowed since 2009, when it hit 5.9 per cent. youth are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults, with the global youth unemployment rate at 13 per cent in 2017. in high income countries, almost every adult has an account at a bank or other financial institution, compared to only 35 per cent of adults in low income countries. across all regions, women lag behind men in this regard. increasing labour productivity, reducing the unemployment rate, especially for young people, and improving access to financial services and benefits are essential components of sustained and inclusive economic growth. the average annual growth rate of real gdp per capita worldwide was 1.6 per cent from 2010 to 2015, compared to 0.9 per cent in 2005 2009. in the least developed countries, the per capita growth rate accelerated from 3.5 per cent in 2000 2004 to 4.6 per cent in 2005 2009, before slowing to 2.5 per cent in 2010 2015.
