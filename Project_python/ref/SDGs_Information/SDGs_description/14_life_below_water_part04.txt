whats the goal here? to conserve and sustainably use the worlds oceans, seas and marine resources. why? oceans provide key natural resources including food, medicines, biofuels and other products. they help with the breakdown and removal of waste and pollution, and their coastal ecosystems act as buffers to reduce damage from storms. maintaining healthy oceans supports climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. and have you been to the seaside? its also a great place for tourism and recreation. even more, marine protected areas contribute to poverty reduction by increasing fish catches and income, and improving health. they also help improve gender equality, as women do much of the work at small scale fisheries. the marine environment is also home to a stunning variety of beautiful creatures, ranging from single celled organisms to the biggest animal ever to have lived on the earththe blue whale. they are also home to coral reefs, one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet. sounds like a worthwhile thing to protect. so whats the problem? increasing levels of debris in the worlds oceans are having a major environmental and economic impact. marine debris impacts biodiversity through entanglement or ingestion of debris items by organisms, which can kill them or make it impossible for them to reproduce. as far as the worlds coral reefs are concerned, about 20 per cent of them have been effectively destroyed and show no prospects for recovery.
