up to 24 million square kilometres of land were affected, including 19 per cent of cropland, 16 per cent of forest land, 19 per cent of grassland and 28 per cent of rangeland. since 1993, the global red list index of threatened species has fallen from 0.82 to 0.74, indicating an alarming trend in the decline of mammals, birds, amphibians, corals and cycads. the primary drivers of this assault on biodiversity are habitat loss from unsustainable agriculture, deforestation, unsustainable harvest and trade, and invasive alien species.  illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife continues to thwart conservation efforts, with nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants reported in illegal trade involving 120 countries. in 2016, bilateral oda in support of biodiversity totalled $7 billion, a decrease of 21 per cent in real terms from 2015. progress in preserving and sustainably using the earths terrestrial species and ecosystems is uneven. the pace of forest loss has slowed and improvements continue to be made in managing forests sustainably and protecting areas important for biodiversity. however, declining trends in land productivity, biodiversity loss and poaching and trafficking of wildlife remain serious concerns. the net loss of forest continues to slow and forest biomass stock per hecta re is stable. more forests are being protected and areas under long term management plans and voluntary certification have increased. from 2010 to 2015, the annual net loss of forest area globally was less than half that of the 1990s. the proportion of land area covered by forest decreased from 31.6 per cent in 1990 to 30.8 per cent in 2010 and 30.6 per cent in 2015.
