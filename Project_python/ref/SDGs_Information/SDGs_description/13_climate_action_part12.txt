the new agreement aims to reduce the pace of climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future. climate change often exacerbates disasters. between 1990 and 2013, more than 1.6 million people died in internationally reported disasters, with annual deaths trending upwards. as a result, more countries are acting on the imperative to implement national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. in 2015, 83 countries had legislative and/or regulatory provisions in place for managing disaster risk. parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change are responsible for providing a range of national reports on their efforts to implement the agreement. as of 4 april 2016, 161 intended nationally determined contributions, from 189 of the 197 parties to the framework convention (the european commission submitted one joint intended determined contribution) had been recorded by the secretariat of the framework convention, providing insights into the efforts many countries are taking to integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning. among those countries, 137 parties included an adaptation component in their intended nationally determined contributions. some countries stressed that adaptation was their main climate change priority, with strong linkages to other aspects of national development, sustainability and security. in order to help countries move forward on climate action, a global stocktaking was established, in the context of the paris agreement, to assess collective progress every five years. the process will begin in 2018, with a facilitative dialogue to review the efforts of parties towards emissions reductions and to inform the preparation of final nationally determined contributions.
