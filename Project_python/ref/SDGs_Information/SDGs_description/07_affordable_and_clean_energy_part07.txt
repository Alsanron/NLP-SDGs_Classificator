investors can invest more in sustainable energy services, bringing new technologies to the market quickly from a diverse supplier base. you can save electricity by plugging appliances into a power strip and turning them off completely when not in use, including your computer. you can also bike, walk or take public transport to reduce carbon emissions. access to electricity in the poorest countries has begun to accelerate, energy efficiency continues to improve and renewable energy is making gains in electricity sector. despite this progress, some 800 million people remain without electricity while access to clean cooking fuels and technologies needs dedicated attention. in addition, if sustainable development goals 7, 13 and related goals are to be met, much higher levels of ambition are required with regard to renewable energy, including transportation and heating. the global electrification rate rose from 83 per cent in 2010 to 87 per cent in 2015, with the increase accelerating to reach 89 per cent in 2017. however, some 840 million people around the world are still without access to electricity. the global share of the population with access to clean cooking fuels and technologies reached 61 per cent in 2017, up from 57 per cent in 2010. despite this progress, close to 3 billion people still rely primarily on inefficient and polluting cooking systems. the renewable energy share of total final energy consumption gradually increased from 16.6 per cent in 2010 to 17.5 per cent in 2016, though much faster change is required to meet climate goals.
