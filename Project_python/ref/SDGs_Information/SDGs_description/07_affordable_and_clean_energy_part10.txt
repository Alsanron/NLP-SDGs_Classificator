in 2016, 3 billion people (41 per cent of the worlds population) were still cooking with polluting fuel and stove combinations. the share of renewables in final energy consumption increased modestly, from 17.3 per cent in 2014 to 17.5 per cent in 2015. yet only 55 per cent of the renewable share was derived from modern forms of renewable energy. global energy intensity decreased by 2.8 per cent from 2014 to 2015, double the rate of improvement seen between 1990 and 2010. progress in every area of sustainable energy falls short of what is needed to achieve energy access for all and to meet targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency. meaningful improvements will require higher levels of financing and bolder policy commitments, together with the willingness of countries to embrace new technologies on a much wider scale. globally, 85.3 per cent of the population had access to electricity in 2014, an increase of only 0.3 percentage points since 2012. that means that 1.06 billion people, predominantly rural dwellers, still function without electricity. half of those people live in sub saharan africa. access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking climbed to 57.4 per cent in 2014, up slightly from 56.5 per cent in 2012. more than 3 billion people, the majority of them in asia and sub saharan africa, are still cooking without clean fuels and more efficient technologies. the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption grew modestly from 2012 to 2014, from 17.9 per cent to 18.3 per cent.
