advancing the sustainable use and conservation of the oceans continues to require effective strategies and management to combat the adverse effects of overfishing, growing ocean acidification and worsening coastal eutrophication. the expansion of protected areas for marine biodiversity, intensification of research capacity and increases in ocean science funding remain critically important to preserve marine resources. the global share of marine fish stocks that are within biologically sustainable levels declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 69 per cent in 2013. studies at open ocean and coastal sites around the world show that current levels of marine acidity have increased by about 26 per cent on average since the start of the industrial revolution. moreover, marine life is being exposed to conditions outside previously experienced natural variability. global trends point to continued deterioration of coastal waters due to pollution and eutrophication. without concerted efforts, coastal eutrophication is expected to increase in 20 per cent of large marine ecosystems by 2050. as of january 2018, 16 per cent (or over 22 million square kilometres) of marine waters under national jurisdictionthat is, 0 to 200 nautical miles from shorewere covered by protected areas. this is more than double the 2010 coverage level. the mean coverage of marine key biodiversity areas (kbas) that are protected has also increasedfrom 30 per cent in 2000 to 44 per cent in 2018. goal 14. conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development 18.
