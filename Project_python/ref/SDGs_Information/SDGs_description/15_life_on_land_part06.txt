for instance, insects and other pollen carriers are estimated to be worth more than us$200 billion per year to the global food economy. three quarters of the top ranking global prescription drugs contain components derived from plant extracts, which would be threatened. natural disasters caused by ecosystems disrupted by human impact and climate change already cost the world more than us$300 billion per year. deforestation and forest degradation results in loss of habitat for all species, a decrease in freshwater quality, an increase in soil erosion, land degradation and higher emissions of carbon into the atmosphere. in short, not taking action on forests impacts both the health of the planet and our communities. what can we do? inevitably, we change the ecosystems we are a part of through our presence, but we can make choices that either affirm diversity or devalue it. some things we can do to help include recycling, eating a locally based diet that is sustainably sourced, consuming only what we need, and limiting energy usage through efficient heating and cooling systems. we must also be respectful toward wildlife and only take part in ecotourism opportunities that are responsibly and ethically run in order to prevent wildlife disturbance. well managed protected areas support healthy ecosystems, which in turn keep people healthy. it is therefore critical to secure the involvement of the local communities in the development and management of these protected areas. there are some encouraging global trends in protecting terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity.
