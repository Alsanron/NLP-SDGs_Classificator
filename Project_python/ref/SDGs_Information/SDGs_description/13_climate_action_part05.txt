what happens if we dont take action? if left unchecked, climate change will cause average global temperatures to increase beyond 3c, and will adversely affect every ecosystem. already, we are seeing how climate change can exacerbate storms and disasters, and threats such as food and water scarcity, which can lead to conflict. doing nothing will end up costing us a lot more than if we take action now. we have an opportunity to take actions that will lead to more jobs, great prosperity, and better lives for all while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building climate resilience. can we solve this problem or is it too late to act? to address climate change, we have to vastly increase our efforts. much is happening around the world, investments in renewable energy have soared. but so much more needs to be done. the world must transform its energy, industry, transport, food, agriculture and forestry systems to ensure that we can limit global temperature rise to well below 2c, maybe even 1.5c. in december 2015, the world took a significant first step by adopting the paris agreement, in which all countries committed to take action to address climate change. many businesses and investors are also committing themselves to lower their emissions, not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it makes economic and business sense as well.
