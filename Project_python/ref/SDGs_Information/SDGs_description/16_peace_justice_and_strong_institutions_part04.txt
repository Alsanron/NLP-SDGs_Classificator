freedom to express views, in private and in public, must be guaranteed. people must be able to contribute to decisions that affect their lives. laws and policies must be applied without any form of discrimination. disputes need to be resolved through functioning political and justice systems. national and local institutions must be accountable and need to be in place to deliver basic services to families and communities equitably and without the need for bribes. how does this goal apply to me, wherever i live? crimes that threaten the foundation of peaceful societies, including homicides, trafficking and other organized crimes, as well as discriminatory laws or practices, affect all countries. even the worlds greatest democracies face major challenges in addressing corruption, crime and human rights violations for everyone at home. what would be the cost of not taking action now? armed violence and insecurity have a destructive impact on a countrys development, affecting economic growth and often resulting in long standing grievances among communities. violence, in all its forms, has a pervasive impact on societies. violence affects childrens health, development and well being, and their ability to thrive. it causes trauma and weakens social inclusion. lack of access to justice means that conflicts remain unresolved and people cannot obtain protection and redress. institutions that do not function according to legitimate laws are prone to arbitrariness and abuse of power, and less capable of delivering public services to everyone. to exclude and to discriminate not only violates human rights, but also causes resentment and animosity, and could give rise to violence. what can we do? take a genuine interest in what your government is doing.
