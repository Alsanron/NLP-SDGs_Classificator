most importantly, we cannot achieve sustainable development and make the planet better for all if people are excluded from opportunities, services, and the chance for a better life. despite progress in some areas, income inequality continues to rise in many parts of the world. what are some examples of inequality? 16,000 children die each day from preventable diseases such as measles and tuberculosis. rural women are three times more likely to die while giving birth than women in urban centres. persons with disabilities are the worlds largest minority. 80 per cent of them live in developing countries. women and girls with disabilities face double discrimination. these are just a few examples, but it is an issue that affects every country in the world. why should i need to care about inequality if i dont face any discrimination? in todays world, we are all interconnected. problems and challenges, be they poverty, climate change, migration or economic crises are never just confined to one country or region. even the richest countries still have communities living in abject poverty. the oldest democracies still wrestle with racism, homophobia and transphobia, and religious intolerance. global inequality affects us all, no matter who we are or where we are from. can we actually achieve equality for everyone in this world? it can be and should be achieved to ensure a life of dignity for all. political, economic and social policies need to be universal and pay particular attention to the needs of disadvantaged and marginalized communities.
