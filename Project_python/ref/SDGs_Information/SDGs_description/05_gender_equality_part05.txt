yes. worldwide, 35 per cent of women between 15 49 years of age have experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non partner sexual violence. 1 in 3 girls aged 15 19 have experienced some form of female genital mutilation/cutting in the 30 countries in africa and the middle east, where the harmful practice is most common with a high risk of prolonged bleeding, infection (including hiv), childbirth complications, infertility and death. the spotlight initative, an eu/un partnership, is a global, multi year initiative focused on eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls (vawg). but, why should gender equality matter to me? regardless of where you live in, gender equality is a fundamental human right. advancing gender equality is critical to all areas of a healthy society, from reducing poverty to promoting the health, education, protection and the well being of girls and boys. investing in education programmes for girls and increasing the age at which they marry can return $5 for every dollar spent. investing in programs improving income generating activities for women can return $7 dollars for every dollar spent. what can we do to fix these issues? if you are a girl, you can stay in school, help empower your female classmates to do the same and fight for your right to access sexual and reproductive health services. if you are a woman, you can address unconscious biases and implicit associations that form an unintended and often an invisible barrier to equal opportunity.
