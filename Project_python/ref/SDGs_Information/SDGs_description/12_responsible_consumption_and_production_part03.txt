households consume 29 per cent of global energy and consequently contribute to 21 per cent of resultant co2 emissions. the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption has reached 17.5% in 2015. food. while substantial environmental impacts from food occur in the production phase (agriculture, food processing), households influence these impacts through their dietary choices and habits. this consequently affects the environment through food related energy consumption and waste generation. each year, an estimated 1/3 of all food produced  equivalent to 1.3 billion tons worth around $1 trillion  ends up rotting in the bins of consumers and retailers, or spoiling due to poor transportation and harvesting practices. 2 billion people globally are overweight or obese. land degradation, declining soil fertility, unsustainable water use, overfishing and marine environment degradation are all lessening the ability of the natural resource base to supply food. the food sector accounts for around 30 per cent of the worlds total energy consumption and accounts for around 22 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions. implement the 10 year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries. by 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. by 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post harvest losses.
