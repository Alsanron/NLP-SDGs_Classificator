however, recent trends in government spending are not favourable. the agriculture orientation index, defined as agricultures share of government expenditures divided by the sectors share of gross domestic product (gdp), fell globally from 0.37 to 0.25 between 2001 and 2013. the decline in the index was interrupted only temporarily during the food price crisis of 2006 to 2008, when governments increased agricultural spending. since the late 1990s, the percentage of aid for supporting agriculture in developing countries has been stable at around 8 per cent, when measured as a share of sector allocable aid from member countries of the development assistance committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd). this has decreased, from a peak of 20 per cent in the mid 1980s, as a result of donors beginning to focus more on improving governance, building social capital and bolstering fragile states. one of the targets for goal 2 calls for correcting and preventing distortions in world agricultural markets, including the elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies. those subsidies mask market signals, reduce competitiveness and can lead to environmental damage and the inequitable distribution of benefits. that said, some progress is being made, with members of the world trade organization adopting a ministerial decision, in december 2015, on eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products and restraining export measures that have an equivalent effect. by 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round.
