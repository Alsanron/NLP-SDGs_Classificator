productive employment and decent work are key elements to achieving fair globalization and poverty reduction. in addition, unemployment can lead to unrest and disrupt peace if it is left unaddressed. what does decent work mean? decent work means opportunities for everyone to get work that is productive and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration. it is also important that all women and men are given equal opportunities in the workplace. a continued lack of decent work opportunities, insufficient investments and under consumption lead to an erosion of the basic social contract underlying democratic societies: that all must share in progress. what can we do to fix these issues? providing youth the best opportunity to transition to a decent job calls for investing in education and training of the highest possible quality, providing youth with skills that match labour market demands, giving them access to social protection and basic services regardless of their contract type, as well as levelling the playing field so that all aspiring youth can attain productive employment regardless of their gender, income level or socio economic background. governments can work to build dynamic, sustainable, innovative and people centred economies, promoting youth employment and womens economic empowerment, in particular, and decent work for all.
