reducing violent crime, sex trafficking, forced labor, and child abuse are clear global goals. the international community values peace and justice and calls for stronger judicial systems that will enforce laws and work toward a more peaceful and just society. by 2017, the un could report progress on detecting victims of trafficking. more women and girls than men and boys were victimized, yet the share of women and girls has slowly declined (see also violence against women). in 2004, 84 percent of victims were females and by 2014 that number had dropped to 71 percent. sexual exploitation numbers have declined, but forced labor has increased. one target is to see the end to sex trafficking, forced labor, and all forms of violence against and torture of children. however, reliance on the indicator of "crimes reported" makes monitoring and achieving this goal challenging. for instance, 84 percent of countries have no or insufficient data on violent punishment of children. of the data available, it is clear that violence against children by their caregivers remains pervasive: nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 are subjected to violent discipline on a regular basis (regardless of income), and no country is on track to eliminate violent discipline by 2030. sdg 16 also targets universal legal identity and birth registration, ensuring the right to a name and nationality, civil rights, recognition before the law, and access to justice and social services. with more than a quarter of children under 5 unregistered worldwide as of 2015, about 1 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress to achieve universal birth registration by 2030. compassion and a strong moral compass is essential to every democratic society.yet, persecution, injustice and abuse still runs rampant and is tearing at the very fabric of civilization. we must ensure that we have strong institutions, global standards of justice, and a commitment to peace everywhere.
