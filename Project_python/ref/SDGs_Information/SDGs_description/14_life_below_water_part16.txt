marine pollution has reached shocking levels; each minute, 15 tons of plastic are released into the oceans. 20 percent of all coral reefs have been destroyed irreversibly, and another 24 percent are in immediate risk of collapse. approximately 1 million sea birds, 100 000 marine mammals, and an unknown number of fish are harmed or die annually due to marine pollution caused by humans. it has been found that 95 percent of fulmars in norway have plastic parts in their guts. microplastics are another form of marine pollution. individuals can help the oceans by reducing their energy consumption and their use of plastics. nations can also take action. in norway, for instance, citizens, working through a web page called finn.no, can earn money for picking up plastic on the beach. several countries, including kenya and tanzania, have banned the use of plastic bags for retail purchases. improving the oceans contributes to poverty reduction, as it gives low income families a source of income and healthy food. keeping beaches and ocean water clean in less developed countries can attract tourism, as stated in goal 8, and reduce poverty by providing more employment. characterized by extinctions, invasions, hybridizations and reductions in the abundance of species, marine biodiversity is currently in global decline. over the past decades, there has been an exponential increase in human activates in and near oceans, resulting in negative consequences to our marine environment. made evident by the degradation of habitats and changes in ecosystem processes, the declining health of the oceans has a negative effect on people, their livelihoods and entire economies, with local communities which rely on ocean resources being the most affected. poor decisions in resource management can compromise conservation, local livelihood, and resource sustainability goals.
