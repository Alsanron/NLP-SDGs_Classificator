recent statistics have shown that this is possible. between 2010 and 2016, in 60 out of 94 countries with data, the incomes of the poorest 40 per cent of the population grew faster than those of the entire population. what can we do? reducing inequality requires transformative change. greater efforts are needed to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, and invest more in health, education, social protection and decent jobs especially for young people, migrants and other vulnerable communities. within countries, it is important to empower and promote inclusive social and economic growth. we can ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of income if we eliminate discriminatory laws, policies and practices. among countries, we need to ensure that developing countries are better represented in decision making on global issues so that solutions can be more effective, credible and accountable. governments and other stakeholders can also promote safe, regular and responsible migration, including through planned and well managed policies, for the millions of people who have left their homes seeking better lives due to war, discrimination, poverty, lack of opportunity and other drivers of migration. inequality within and among nations continues to be a significant concern despite progress in and efforts at narrowing disparities of opportunity, income and power. income inequality continues to rise in many parts of the world, even as the bottom 40 per cent of the population in many countries has experienced positive growth rates. greater emphasis will need to be placed on reducing inequalities in income as well as those based on other factors.
