around 1.34 million deaths were attributed to hepatitis in 2015, including 0.9 million deaths owing to hepatitis b. hepatitis b can be prevented through vaccinations; global coverage of vaccinations for that disease among children 1 year of age increased from 29 per cent in 2000 to 84 per cent in 2015. a major risk factor for infectious diseases and mortality is the lack of safe water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) services, which disproportionately affects sub saharan africa and central/southern asia. death rates owing to the lack of wash services in those two regions were 46 and 23 per 100,000 people, respectively, compared to 12 per 100,000 people globally in 2012. non communicable diseases and mental health. premature deaths (before 70 years of age) owing to cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes totalled about 13 million in 2015, accounting for 43 per cent of all premature deaths globally. from 2000 to 2015, the risk of dying between 30 and 70 years of age from one of those four causes decreased from 23 per cent to 19 per cent, falling short of the rate required to meet the 2030 target of a one third reduction. such mental disorders as depression can lead to suicide. nearly 800,000 suicides occurred worldwide in 2015, with men about twice as likely to commit suicide as women. tobacco and alcohol use contributes to the burden of non communicable diseases. the world health organization (who) framework convention on tobacco control has been ratified by 180 parties, which represent 90 per cent of the global population. still, more than 1.1 billion people, mostly men, consumed tobacco in 2015.
