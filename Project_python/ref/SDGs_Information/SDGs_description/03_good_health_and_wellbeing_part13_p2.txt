according to estimates from 2012, around 38 million deaths per year, accounting for 68 per cent of all deaths worldwide, were attributable to non communicable diseases. of all deaths among persons under the age of 70, commonly referred to as premature deaths, an estimated 52 per cent were as a result of non communicable diseases. over three quarters of premature deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. globally, premature mortality from those four main categories of non communicable disease declined by 15 per cent between 2000 and 2012. reducing tobacco use will be critical for meeting the proposed target of reducing premature mortality from non communicable diseases by one third. in 2015, over 1.1 billion people consumed tobacco, with far more male (945 million) than female (180 million) smokers. unhealthy environmental conditions increase the risk of both non communicable and infectious diseases, which is reflected in the strong integrated nature of the goals. in 2012, an estimated 889,000 people died from infectious diseases caused largely by faecal contamination of water and soil and by inadequate hand washing facilities and practices resulting from poor or non existent sanitation services. in 2012, household and ambient air pollution resulted in some 6.5 million deaths. substance use and substance use disorders have also created a significant public health burden. worldwide, average alcohol consumption in 2015 was estimated at 6.3l of pure alcohol per person among those aged 15 or older, with wide variations across countries.
