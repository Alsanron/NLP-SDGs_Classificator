the most fundamental and irreversible human impact on nature is species extinction. the red list index  which measures the risk of extinction, in which a value of 1 indicates no threat to any species, and a value of 0 indicates that all species are extinct  has deteriorated from 0.82 in 1993 to 0.73 globally in 2019. the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization to the convention on biological diversity creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources and biodiversity. as at 1 february 2019, 116 countries had ratified the nagoya protocol (an increase of 46 since 2016) and 61 countries had shared information on their access and benefit sharing frameworks through the access and benefit sharing clearing house (representing an increase of 55 countries). in 2017, bilateral oda in support of biodiversity was $8.7 billion, an increase of 15 per cent in real terms over 2016. protection of forest and terrestrial ecosystems is on the rise, and forest loss has slowed. that said, other facets of terrestrial conservation continue to demand accelerated action to protect biodiversity, land productivity and genetic resources and to curtail the loss of species. the earths forest areas continue to shrink, down from 4.1 billion hectares in 2000 (or 31.2 per cent of total land area) to about 4 billion hectares (30.7 per cent of total land area) in 2015. however, the rate of forest loss has been cut by 25 per cent since 20002005. about one fifth of the earths land surface covered by vegetation showed persistent and declining trends in productivity from 1999 to 2013, threatening the livelihoods of over one billion people.
