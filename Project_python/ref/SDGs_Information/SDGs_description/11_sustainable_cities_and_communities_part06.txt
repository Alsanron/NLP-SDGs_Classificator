is it expensive to put sustainable practices in place? the cost is minimal in comparison with the benefits. for example, there is a cost to creating a functional public transport network, but the benefits are huge in terms of economic activity, quality of life, the environment, and the overall success of a networked city. what can i do to help achieve this goal? take an active interest in the governance and management of your city. advocate for the kind of city you believe you need. develop a vision for your building, street, and neighbourhood, and act on that vision. are there enough jobs? can your children walk to school safely? can you walk with your family at night? how far is the nearest public transport? whats the air quality like? what are your shared public spaces like? the better the conditions you create in your community, the greater the effect on quality of life. substantial progress has been made in reducing the proportion of the global urban population living in slums, though more than 1 billion people continue to live in such situations. urgent action is needed to reverse the current situation, which sees the vast majority of urban residents breathing poor quality air and having limited access to transport and open public spaces. with the areas occupied by cities growing faster than their populations, there are profound repercussions for sustainability.
