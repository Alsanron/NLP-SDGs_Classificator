even before the covid 19 pandemic, the number of people experiencing hunger globally and suffering from food insecurity had been rising gradually since 2014. the pandemic has increased the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems, potentially leaving hundreds of millions more people chronically undernourished and making the goal of ending hunger more difficult to achieve. between 83 and 132 million more people may already have been pushed into chronic hunger in 2020. in addition, countries and territories around the world continue to struggle with multiple forms of malnutrition. it is estimated that almost 690 million people around the world experienced hunger in 2019, equivalent to 8.9 per cent of the world population â€“ an increase of nearly 60 million in five years. updated estimates due for publication in july 2021 will provide a more recent picture of the effects of the pandemic on hunger. an estimated 2 billion people, 25.9 per cent of the world population, were affected by moderate or severe food insecurity in 2019, up from 22.4 per cent in 2015. the fastest rise was recorded in latin america and the caribbean, although the highest levels were registered in sub saharan africa. globally, 149.2 million children under the age of 5, some 22 per cent of all children, suffer from stunting (low height for age) according to the latest estimates available for 2020,2 a decrease from 24.4 per cent in 2015. however, these figures may rise as a result of continued constraints on access to nutritious food and essential nutrition services during the pandemic, the full impact of which may take years to manifest.
