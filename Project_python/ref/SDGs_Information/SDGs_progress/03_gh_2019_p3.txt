strong and steady domestic and international commitment and funding has fuelled an acceleration of evidence informed hiv prevention, testing and treatment programmes. as a result, the incidence of hiv in sub saharan africa (among adults aged 15 to 49) has declined by 37 per cent, from 3.39 infections per 1,000 uninfected people in 2010 to 2.49 in 2015 and 2.14 in 2017. however, the rate of global hiv incidence among adults aged 15 to 49 declined from 0.44 to 0.40 between 2015 and 2017 and overall by 22 per cent between 2010 and 2017, well short of the declines required to meet 2020 and 2030 targets. tuberculosis remains a leading cause of ill health and death. in 2017, an estimated 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis. the burden is falling globally: incidence of tuberculosis has continued to decline from 170 new and relapse cases per 100,000 people in 2000 to 140 in 2015, and 134 in 2017; and the tuberculosis mortality rate among hiv negative people fell by 42 per cent between 2000 and 2017. however, large gaps in detection and treatment persist and the current pace of progress is not fast enough to meet the sustainable development goal target, with drug resistant tuberculosis remaining a continuing threat. after more than a decade of steady advances in fighting malaria, progress has stalled. no significant gains were made in reducing the number of malaria cases worldwide in the period 2015â€“2017. sub saharan africa continues to carry the heaviest burden of disease, accounting for more than 90 per cent of the global malaria burden. worryingly, there were an estimated 3.5 million more malaria cases in the 10 highest burden african countries in 2017 compared with the previous year.
