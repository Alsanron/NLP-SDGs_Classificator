increasing labour productivity, reducing the unemployment rate, especially for young people, and improving access to financial services and benefits are essential components of sustained and inclusive economic growth. the average annual growth rate of real gdp per capita worldwide was 1.6 per cent from 2010 to 2015, compared to 0.9 per cent in 2005 2009. in the least developed countries, the per capita growth rate accelerated from 3.5 per cent in 2000 2004 to 4.6 per cent in 2005 2009, before slowing to 2.5 per cent in 2010 2015. overall average annual gdp growth in the least developed countries followed a similar trend, decelerating from 7.1 per cent in 2005  2009 to 4.9 per cent in 2010 2015, below the sustainable development goals target of 7 per cent. labour productivity (annual growth rate of real gdp per worker) globally has slowed from an average annual rate of 2.9 per cent from 2000 to 2008 to 1.9 per cent from 2009 to 2016. the slowdown represents a negative development for the global economy, with adverse effects on living standards and real wages. the global unemployment rate stood at 5.7 per cent in 2016, with women more likely to be unemployed than men across all age groups. youth were almost three times as likely as adults to be unemployed, with unemployment rates of 12.8 per cent and 4.4 per cent, respectively, in 2016. moreover, in more than 76 per cent of countries with data, more than 1 in 10 youth are neither in the educational system nor working. young women are more likely than young men to fall into that category in almost 70 per cent of countries with data.
