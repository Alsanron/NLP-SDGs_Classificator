advances in ending violence, promoting the rule of law, strengthening institutions and increasing access to justice are uneven and continue to deprive millions of their security, rights and opportunities and undermine the delivery of public services and broader economic development. attacks on civil society are also holding back development progress. renewed efforts are essential to move towards the achievement of sustainable development goal 16. the number of intentional homicides per 100,000 people increased from 6.0 in 2015 to 6.1 in 2017. this slight uptick was largely the result of an increase in the homicide rates in latin america and the caribbean and in some countries in sub saharan africa. various forms of violence against children persist. in 83 countries (mostly from developing regions) with recent data on the subject, nearly 8 in 10 children from 1 to 14 years of age were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home. in all but seven of these countries, at least half of children experienced violent disciplinary methods. sexual violence is perhaps the most disturbing of childrenâ€™s rights violations. based on the limited data available, in 14 of 46 countries with comparable data, at least 5 per cent of women between the ages of 18 and 29 experienced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts that were forced, physically or in other ways, for the first time before they were 18 years of age. despite recent progress, the births of more than 1 in 4 children under the age of 5 worldwide have not been recorded. in sub saharan africa, over half (54 per cent) of children have not been registered by their fifth birthday.
