globally, 47 million children under 5 years of age, or 6.9 per cent, were affected by acute undernutrition or wasting (low weight for one’s height) in 2019 conditions generally caused by limited nutrient intake and infection. more than half of the wasted children lived in central and southern asia. childhood overweight affected 38 million children under 5 years of age worldwide, or 5.6 per cent, in 2019. wasting and overweight may coexist at levels considered to be medium to high, the so called double burden of malnutrition. in northern africa and south eastern asia, the rate of wasting was 7.2 per cent and 8.2 per cent, respectively, while the rate of overweight was 11.3 per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively, in 2019. the share of government expenditure in the agricultural sector, measured by government expenditure in agriculture divided by the sector’s share of gdp, fell worldwide, from 0.42 to 0.31 to 0.28 per cent in 2001, 2015 and 2018, respectively. moreover, aid to agriculture in developing countries fell, from nearly 25 per cent of all donors’ sector allocable aid in the mid 1980s to only 5 per cent, in 2018. in 2019, sharp increases in food prices were concentrated largely in sub saharan africa, driven by production shocks and macroeconomic difficulties. the lingering impact of prolonged conflict and extreme weather conditions in some areas were additional factors.
