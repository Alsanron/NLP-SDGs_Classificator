more than half of children and adolescents worldwide are not meeting minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. refocused efforts are needed to improve the quality of education. disparities in education along the lines of gender, urban rural location and other dimensions still run deep, and more investments in education infrastructure are required, particularly in ldcs. at the global level, the participation rate in early childhood and primary education was 70 per cent in 2016, up from 63 per cent in 2010. the lowest rates are found in sub saharan africa (41 per cent) and northern africa and western asia (52 per cent). an estimated 617 million children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school age worldwide—58 per cent of that age group—are not achieving minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics. in 2016, an estimated 85 per cent of primary school teachers worldwide were trained; the proportion was only 71 per cent for southern asia and 61 per cent for sub saharan africa in 2016, only 34 per cent of primary schools in ldcs had electricity and less than 40 per cent were equipped with basic handwashing facilities. despite the considerable progress on education access and participation over the past years, 262 million children and youth aged 6 to 17 were still out of school in 2017, and more than half of children and adolescents are not meeting minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. rapid technological changes present opportunities and challenges, but the learning environment, the capacities of teachers and the quality of education have not kept pace.
