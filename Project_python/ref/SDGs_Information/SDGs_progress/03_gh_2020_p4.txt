Health systems and funding
Immunization is one of the world’s most successful and cost-effective health interventions. While vaccination coverage among infants increased, from 72 to 85 to 86 per cent in 2000, 2015 and 2018, respectively, an estimated 19.4 million children did not receive essential vaccines in their first year of life. In addition, global coverage levels of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which has the potential to reduce pneumonia significantly, have yet to reach 50 per cent coverage. Measles is a highly contagious disease, and the 69 per cent coverage of the two-dose vaccine in 2018 was insufficient to prevent a measles outbreak.
In 2017, only around one third to half of the global population was covered by essential health services. If current trends continue, only 39 to 63 per cent of the global population will be covered by essential health services by 2030.
The proportion of the population spending more than 10 per cent of its household budget on out-of-pocket payment for health services increased continuously, from 9.4 to 12.7 per cent (927 million persons), between 2000 and 2015. At current rates, the proportion will reach 12.9 per cent, equal to 1 billion persons, in 2020. Nearly 90 million persons were pushed into extreme poverty owing to out-of-pocket medical expenses.
Official development assistance (ODA) for basic health from all donors increased by 41 per cent in real terms since 2010, reaching $10 billion in 2018. In 2018, about $1.7 billion was spent on malaria control, $0.8 billion on tuberculosis control and $1.9 billion on other infectious diseases, excluding HIV/AIDS.
Based on data from the period 2013–2018, globally, women make up more than 76 per cent of medical doctors and nursing personnel combined, but compose only slightly more than 40 per cent of medical doctors and nearly 90 per cent of nursing personnel.
In 2019, 166 countries reported the status of their capacity to implement the International Health Regulations with regard to preparedness for detecting, reporting and responding to health emergencies such as COVID-19. Analysis shows that steady progress has been made in nearly every core capacity of the Regulations, except in human resources, compared with 2018.
