The probability of dying from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease at between 30 and 70 years of age decreased, from 19 per cent in 2010 to 18 per cent in 2016, a rate of decline that was insufficient to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target. Based on 2016 data, nearly 800,000 persons died every year by suicide, and 79 per cent of global suicides occurred in low- and middle-income countries. The number of persons dying of tobacco-related illnesses was estimated to be 8.1 million in 2017. The global prevalence of tobacco use among men was 38.6 per cent in 2018, compared with 8.5 per cent among women. In 2016, indoor (household) and outdoor (ambient) air pollution caused some 7 million deaths worldwide. Inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene led to a total of 870,000 deaths in the same year. Health systems and funding. Immunization is one of the worldâ€™s most successful and cost-effective health interventions. While vaccination coverage among infants increased, from 72 to 85 to 86 per cent in 2000, 2015 and 2018, respectively, an estimated 19.4 million children did not receive essential vaccines in their first year of life. In addition, global coverage levels of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which has the potential to reduce pneumonia significantly, have yet to reach 50 per cent coverage. Measles is a highly contagious disease, and the 69 per cent coverage of the two-dose vaccine in 2018 was insufficient to prevent a measles outbreak.
