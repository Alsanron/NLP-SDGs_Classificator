in developing countries, small scale industries accounted for an estimated 15 per cent to 20 per cent of value added and 25 per cent to 30 per cent of total industrial employment in 2015. however, access to financial services in those countries remains a problem. globally, the credit gap for small and medium enterprises (defined as having between 5 and 99 employees) was estimated at $3.2 trillion to $3.9 trillion in 2012. in emerging markets, between 45 per cent and 55 per cent of all small and medium enterprises are unserved or underserved by financial services. as the structure of world economies shifts to less energy intensive industries and countries implement policies for enhanced energy efficiency, almost all regions have shown a reduction in carbon intensity of gdp. global carbon dioxide emissions per unit of value added showed a steady decline between 1990 and 2013, a decrease of about 30 per cent. innovation and the creation of new and more sustainable industries are spurred by investments in research and development. global expenditure on research and development as a proportion of gdp stood at 1.7 per cent in 2013. however, this figure masks wide disparities. expenditure on research and development was 2.4 per cent of gdp for developed regions, 1.2 per cent for developing regions, and below 0.3 per cent for the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries. the number of researchers per 1 million inhabitants showed a similar pattern. while the global average was 1,083 researchers per 1 million inhabitants, the ratio ranged from 65 per 1 million in the least developed countries to 3,641 per 1 million in developed regions. total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing regions reached $59.5 billion in 2014. the main sectors receiving assistance were transport and energy.
