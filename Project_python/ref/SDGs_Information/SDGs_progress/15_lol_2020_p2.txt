species extinction, which threatens sustainable development and compromises global heritage, is driven primarily through habitat loss from unsustainable agriculture, harvest and trade; deforestation; and invasive alien species. globally, the species extinction risk has worsened by about 10 per cent over the past three decades, with the red list index (which measures the risk of extinction, whereby a value of 1 indicates no threat of extinction and a value of 0 indicates that all species are extinct) declining, from 0.82 in 1990 to 0.75 in 2015 to 0.73 in 2020. as at 1 february 2020, 122 countries and the european union had ratified the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization to the convention on biological diversity (an increase of 53 from 2019), and 63 countries and the european union had shared information on their access and benefit sharing frameworks. regarding the international treaty on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, there are now 146 contracting parties thereto, and 56 countries have provided information about their access and benefit sharing measures. only about a third of reporting parties are on track to achieving their national biodiversity targets as reported in national reports under the convention on biological diversity. as at january 2020, 129 parties, including the european union, had reported their sixth national report, and 113 parties had assessed progress towards their national targets related to aichi biodiversity target 2. about half the parties had made progress towards their targets, but not at a rate that will allow them to meet their goals.
