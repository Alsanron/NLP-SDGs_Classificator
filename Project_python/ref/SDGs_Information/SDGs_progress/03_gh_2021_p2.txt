reproductive, maternal and child health according to data from the period 2014–2020, 83 per cent of births worldwide were assisted by skilled health professionals, including medical doctors, nurses and midwives, an increase from 71 per cent in the period from 2007 to 2013. the covid 19 pandemic may reverse gains in skilled childbirth care coverage and disrupt maternity health services. the world has made substantial progress towards the goal of ending preventable child deaths, with the global under 5 mortality rate decreasing from 76 to 38 deaths per 1,000 live births between 2000 and 2019. the global neonatal mortality rate fell from 30 deaths to 17 per 1,000 live births in the same period. even with such progress, 5.2 million children died in 2019 before reaching their fifth birthday, with almost half of those deaths, 2.4 million, occurring in the first month of life. while the full impact of the pandemic on child survival is not yet known, significant disruption to the continued provision of life saving interventions could stall or even reverse the progress made. the proportion of women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) who have their family planning needs met by modern contraceptive methods has remained steady at around 77 per cent between 2015 and 2021, reaching only 56 per cent in sub  saharan africa and 52 per cent in oceania, excluding australia and new zealand. the ongoing pandemic may lead to reductions in these figures as a result of supply chain disruptions and decreased access to family planning services, while the fertility intentions and family planning needs among women of reproductive age may also change. the global adolescent birth rate has fallen from 56 births per 1,000 adolescent women 15 to 19 years of age in 2000 to 45 births per 1,000 adolescents in 2015 and 41 per 1,000 in 2020. the declines varied considerably across regions, with the largest decrease in central and southern asia from 70 births per 1,000 adolescents in 2000 to 24 births per 1,000 in 2020.
