the pandemic and the vast subsequent harm to human and economic well being have starkly illustrated the potential global impact of zoonotic diseases, for which wildlife trade – both legal and illegal – is a potential vector. while certain markets for illegal wildlife products are declining, such as the market for ivory, which has decreased 3.5 fold since 2013, other species are under increasing threat as offenders shift their focus to more lucrative products, such as pangolin scales. in 2018, for example, there was a tenfold increase in the number of whole pangolin equivalents seized since 2014. nearly all countries and territories (98 per cent) have adopted national legislation for the prevention or control of invasive alien species, although there is wide variation in its coverage across sectors. the proportion of countries and territories aligning their targets for invasive alien species with global targets has increased, from 74 per cent in 2016 to 84 per cent in 2020. as of march 2021, 89 countries and territories have implemented the system of environmental economic accounting, an increase of 29 per cent since 2017. of these, 62 countries and territories (70 per cent) have integrated the system of accounting into their regular statistical production methods, and compile and publish the accounts on a regular basis. in 2019, oda from development assistance committee members provided in support of biodiversity amounted to $6.6 billion, a decrease of 14 per cent in real terms compared to 2018. in 2021, a total of 232 biodiversity relevant taxes are in force across 62 countries and territories
