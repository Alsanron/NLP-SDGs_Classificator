forest areas continued to decline, protected areas were not concentrated in areas of key biodiversity and species remained threatened with extinction. however, efforts were gaining traction and having positive effects that could help to reverse those outcomes, such as increased progress towards sustainable forest management; gains in protected area coverage for terrestrial, freshwater and mountain areas; and progress in implementing programmes, legislation and accounting principles to protect biodiversity and ecosystems. the proportion of forest area fell, from 31.9 per cent of total land area in 2000 to 31.2 per cent in 2020, representing a net loss of nearly 100 million ha of the worldâ€™s forests. from 2000 to 2020, forest area increased in asia, europe and northern america, while significantly decreasing in latin america, sub saharan africa and south eastern asia, driven by land conversion to agriculture. not withstanding the overall loss, 2017 data showed that the proportion of forests in protected areas and under long term management plans, as well as certified forest area, increased or remained stable at the global level and in most regions of the world. in 2020, the average proportion of each key biodiversity area for terrestrial, freshwater and mountain biodiversity within protected areas was 44, 41 and 41 per cent, respectively, an increase of around 12 to 13 percentage points since 2000. however, most key biodiversity areas still have incomplete or no coverage by protected areas. as at 2019, 123 countries had committed themselves to setting their voluntary targets for achieving land degradation neutrality, and in 60 countries, governments had already officially endorsed those targets.
