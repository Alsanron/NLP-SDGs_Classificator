the proportion of prisoners held in detention without being sentenced for a crime remained almost constant in the last decade: from 32 per cent in 2003–2005 to 31 per cent in 2014–2016. almost one in five firms worldwide report receiving at least one bribery payment request when engaged in regulatory or utility transactions. globally, 73 per cent of children under 5 have had their births registered; the proportion is less than half (46 per cent) in sub saharan africa. at least 1,019 human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists have been killed in 61 countries since 2015. this is equivalent to one person killed every day while working to inform the public and build a world free from fear and want. freedom of information laws and policies have been adopted by 116 countries, with at least 25 countries doing so over the last five years. however, implementation remains a challenge. since 1998, more than half of countries (116 of 197) have established a national human rights institution that has been peer reviewed for compliance with internationally agreed standards (the paris principles). however, only 75 of these countries have institutions that are fully compliant.  by 2014, the figures had dropped to 18 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, but were still almost twice the levels recorded for 2004. sexual violence is one of the most unsettling of children’s rights violations. yet underreporting and the lack of comparable data limit understanding of the full extent of the problem.
