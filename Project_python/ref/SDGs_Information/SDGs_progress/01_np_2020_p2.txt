the pandemic is pushing millions of workers into unemployment, underemployment and working poverty. based on 2016 data, 55 per cent of the world’s population, about 4 billion persons, did not benefit from any form of social protection, which is critical to help the poorest and the most vulnerable in the current crisis. at least half of the world’s population still lacked full coverage of essential health services, and only 22 per cent of unemployed workers were covered by unemployment benefits. hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, wildfires and other extreme natural disasters exacerbate poverty. a total of 80 countries reported disaster related losses for 2018, including 23,458 deaths and 2,164 persons missing. more than 39 million persons were reported as affected, 29 million of whom saw their livelihood disrupted or destroyed. in terms of direct economic losses, $23.6 billion was reported by countries, 73 per cent of which was attributed to the agricultural sector. the slowdown in progress on poverty reduction since 2015 has been further set back by the covid 19 pandemic, with the global rate of extreme poverty rising in 2020 for the first time in over 20 years. the triple threat of covid 19, conflict and climate change makes the global goal of ending poverty by 2030 unachievable unless immediate and substantial policy actions are taken. the covid 19 crisis has demonstrated the importance of social protection systems for protecting health, employment and income, with many new social protection measures introduced in 2020 as a result.
