oceans, along with coastal and marine resources, play an essential role in human well being and social and economic development worldwide. they are particularly crucial for people living in coastal communities, who represented 37 per cent of the global population in 2010. oceans provide livelihoods and tourism benefits, as well as subsistence and income. they also help regulate the global ecosystem by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and protecting coastal areas from flooding and erosion. in fact, coastal and marine resources contribute an estimated $28 trillion to the global economy each year through ecosystem services. however, those resources are extremely vulnerable to environmental degradation, overfishing, climate change and pollution. the sustainable use and preservation of marine and coastal ecosystems and their biological diversity is essential to achieving the 2030 agenda, in particular for small island developing states. pollution of both land and seas is a threat in many coastal regions. in addition, since river basins, marine ecosystems and the atmosphere are all part of hydrological systems, the effects of such pollution are often felt far from their source. in many coastal communities, pollution and eutrophication, which is the presence of excessive nutrients in water, frequently owing to runoff from the land, causing dense plant growth and the death of animal life, are driving detrimental changes. the five large marine ecosystems most at risk from coastal eutrophication, according to a global comparative assessment undertaken in 2016 as part of the transboundary water assessment programme, are the bay of bengal, the east china sea, the gulf of mexico, the north brazil shelf and the south china sea.
