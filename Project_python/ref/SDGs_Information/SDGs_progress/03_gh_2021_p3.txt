Infectious diseases
While the rate of new HIV infections declined from 0.48 infections pe r 1,000 uninfected population among adults (15 to 49 years of age) to 0.37 per 1,000 between 2010 and 2019, it remained far higher than the global target for 2020. The largest decrease was in sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the highest numbers of people living with HIV. Major inequalities remain in access to HIV prevention, testing and treatment services across regions, countries, and sub-populations within countries. There is evidence to suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused considerable disruption to HIV services, including testing, initiation of treatment, voluntary medical male circumcision and pre-exposure prophylaxis.
In 2019, an estimated 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis, of whom 56 per cent were adult men, 32 per cent adult women, 12 per cent children and 8.2 per cent people living with HIV, making it the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. Globally, the incidence of tuberculosis fell from 174 new and relapse cases per 100,000 population in 2000 to 130 cases per 100,000 in 2019, a 25 per cent decline over the period, with the tuberculosis mortality rate among HIV-negative people falling by 45 per cent in the same period. Although the disease burden is decreasing, large gaps in detection and treatment persist, and the current pace of progress is not fast enough to meet the target of ending tuberculosis by 2030. Drug - resistant tuberculosis is a continuing threat: in 2019, there were 465,000 new cases with resistance to rifampicin, the most effective first-line drug, and 78 per cent of those infected with tuberculosis had a multidrug-resistant strain. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 1.4 million fewer people received necessary care for tuberculosis during 2020 compared with the previous year, a reduction in treatment levels of 21 per cent.
