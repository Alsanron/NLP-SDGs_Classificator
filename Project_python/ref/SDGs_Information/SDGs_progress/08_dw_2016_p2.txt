although the number of children engaged in child labour declined globally by one third from 2000 to 2012 (from 246 million to 168 million), more than half of child labourers in 2012 (85 million) were engaged in hazardous forms of work. the incidence of child labour was highest in sub saharan africa, where 21 per cent of children were employed as child labourers. of all child labourers worldwide, 59 per cent were engaged in agricultural activities in 2012. while economic growth and employment are important for economic security, access to financial services is an essential component of inclusive growth. between 2011 and 2014, the proportion of the worldâ€™s adult population with an account at a financial institution or a mobile money service provider increased from 51 per cent to 62 per cent, meaning that 700 million adults became account holders during this period. financial exclusion disproportionately affected women and the poor. the proportion of women who are account holders is 9 percentage points lower than the proportion of men who are account holders. moreover, the proportion of account holders among the poorest 40 per cent of households is 14 percentage points lower than among those living in the richest 60 per cent of households. in 2014, aid for trade assistance was $54.8 billion, an increase of almost 120 per cent over the period from 2002 to 2005. however, total commitments fell slightly (by $1 billion) in 2014 compared to 2013, driven mainly by a $4.7 billion drop in support for transport and storage. a total of 146 developing countries received aid for trade assistance in 2014, with lower middle income countries receiving 39.4 per cent of the total, the least developed countries receiving 26.3 per cent and upper middle income countries receiving 19 per cent. on a per capita basis, however, the least developed countries received $10 per capita, more than any other income group and more than twice the global average.
