there has been an overall increase in the detection of victims of trafficking in persons, which could reflect either a positive (enhanced efforts by authorities to identify victims) or negative (larger trafficking problem) development. in a departure from prior findings, recent data show that most trafficking victims were detected domestically: 58 per cent in 2016, up from 43 per cent in 2014. the vast majority (70 per cent) of detected victims of human trafficking were women and girls, most of whom were trafficked for sexual exploitation. the share of unsentenced detainees in the overall prison population has remained largely constant at 30 per cent in recent years. this occurred in a context where the total prison population grew in absolute values while remaining constant as a share of the total population. killings of human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists are on the rise. from 2017 to 2018, the united nations recorded and verified 431 killings across 41 countries. every passing week saw at least eight people murdered at the front lines of efforts to build more inclusive and equal societies â€“ a worrying increase from the previous average of one victim per day observed from 2015 to 2017. ninety nine journalists and bloggers were among the victims. one out of 10 countries had a deviation of more than plus or minus 15 per cent.  access to internationally recognized national human rights institutions, however, remains overdue in 78 countries, in particular in eastern and south eastern asia, latin america and the caribbean, oceania and sub saharan africa.
