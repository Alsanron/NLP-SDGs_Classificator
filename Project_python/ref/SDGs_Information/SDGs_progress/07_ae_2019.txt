in addition, if sustainable development goals 7, 13 and related goals are to be met, much higher levels of ambition are required with regard to renewable energy, including transportation and heating. the global electrification rate rose from 83 per cent in 2010 to 87 per cent in 2015, with the increase accelerating to reach 89 per cent in 2017. however, some 840 million people around the world are still without access to electricity. the global share of the population with access to clean cooking fuels and technologies reached 61 per cent in 2017, up from 57 per cent in 2010. despite this progress, close to 3 billion people still rely primarily on inefficient and polluting cooking systems. the renewable energy share of total final energy consumption gradually increased from 16.6 per cent in 2010 to 17.5 per cent in 2016, though much faster change is required to meet climate goals. even though the absolute level of renewable energy consumption has grown by more than 18 per cent since 2010, only since 2012 has the growth of renewables outpaced the growth of total energy consumption. e/2019/68 14/39 19 07404 global primary energy intensity (ratio of energy used per unit of gdp) improved from 5.9 in 2010 to 5.1 in 2016, a rate of improvement of 2.3 per cent, which is still short of the 2.7 per cent annual rate needed to reach target 3 of sustainable development goal 7. international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy reached $18.6 billion in 2016, almost doubling from $9.9 billion in 2010.
