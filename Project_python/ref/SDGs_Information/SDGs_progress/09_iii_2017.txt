despite steady improvements in manufacturing output and employment, renewed investment will be needed in the least developed countries to build needed infrastructure and ensure the doubling of industryâ€™s share of gdp in those countries by 2030. efficient transportation services generate employment and wealth and drive economic development. in 2015, the estimated global economic impact (both direct and indirect) of air transport was $2.7 trillion, equivalent to 3.5 per cent of global gdp. the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states represent far less air travel and freight volumes, with each country group accounting for only 1 per cent to 2.7 per cent of the global total. manufacturing is a principal driver of economic development, employment and social stability. globally, manufacturing value added as a share of gdp increased from 15.3 per cent in 2005 to 16.2 per cent in 2016. in 2016, manufacturing value added per capita amounted to $4,621 in europe and northern america, compared to about $100 in the least developed countries. as many countries move to more efficient and less energy intensive industries, their emissions of carbon dioxide per unit of manufacturing value added are generally declining. from 2000 to 2014, europe and northern america reduced their emissions intensity by 36 per cent. the least developed countries face particular challenges in industrializing. although those countries represent 13 per cent of the global population, they contribute less than 1 per cent of global manufacturing value added. worldwide, about 500 million people are employed in manufacturing. while manufacturing job numbers have fallen in industrialized countries, they have steadily increased in developing countries. in the least developed countries, agricultural and traditional sectors remain the main sources of employment.
