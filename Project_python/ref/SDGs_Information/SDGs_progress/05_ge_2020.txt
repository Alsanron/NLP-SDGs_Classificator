despite progress in implementing gender responsive budgeting globally, gaps remain in country efforts to establish comprehensive and transparent tracking systems. based on 2018 data from 69 countries, 13 countries fully met the criteria of having in place a tracking system that measures and makes publicly available gender budget data, and 41 countries approached the requirements. the commitment to advancing gender equality has brought about improvements in some areas, but the promise of a world in which every woman and girl enjoy full gender equality and all legal, social and economic barriers to their empowerment have been removed remains unfulfilled. the current pandemic is also hitting women and girls hard. globally, women make up three quarters of medical doctors and nursing personnel. women already spend three times as many hours as men on unpaid care work at home. the closure of school and day care centres requires parents, women in particular, to care more for children and facilitate their learning at home. reports from several countries suggest that domestic violence against women and children is also rising during the global lockdown. in 2019, one in five young women 20 to 24 years of age throughout the world was married in childhood, down from one in four in 2004 and with the highest figure in sub saharan africa, with more than one in three young women. at least 200 million girls and women have been subjected to female genital mutilation, according to recent data from the 31 countries where the practice is concentrated. the harmful practice is becoming less common, but progress is not fast enough to meet the global target of its elimination by 2030.
