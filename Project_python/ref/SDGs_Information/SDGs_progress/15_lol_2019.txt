there are some encouraging global trends in protecting terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity. forest loss is slowing down, more key biodiversity areas are protected and more financial assistance is flowing towards biodiversity protection. yet, the 2020 targets of sustainable development goal 15 are unlikely to be met, land degradation continues, biodiversity loss is occurring at an alarming rate, and invasive species and the illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife continue to thwart efforts to protect and restore vital ecosystems and species. protecting important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity is vital for ensuring long term and sustainable use of terrestrial and freshwater natural resources. the global mean percentage of each key biodiversity area covered by protected areas increased from 33.1 per cent in 2000 to 46.1 per cent in 2018 for terrestrial areas, from 30.5 per cent in 2000 to 43.2 per cent in 2018 for freshwater areas, and from 32.9 per cent in 2000 to 44.7 per cent in 2018 for mountain areas. healthy mountain ecosystems are fundamental to ensuring the provision of ecosystem services to upland communities as well as lowland peoples. as of 2017, 76 per cent of the worldâ€™s mountain areas were covered by a form of green coverage: 41 per cent by forests, 29 per cent by grassland/shrubland and only 6 per cent by cropland. in 2015, bilateral oda in support of biodiversity amounted to $8.8 billion, an increase of 39 per cent in real terms over 2014.
