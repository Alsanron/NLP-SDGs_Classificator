global holdings of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture in 2020 reached 5.7 million accessions conserved in 831 gene banks by 114 countries and territories and 17 regional and international research centres. although the total number of global holdings has risen, the growth rate decreased over the past 10 years, reaching its lowest level in 2020. the world is still far off target for maintaining the genetic diversity of farmed and domesticated animals, either in the field or in gene banks. the risk status of 61 per cent of local livestock breeds remains unknown. of the limited number surveyed, 74 per cent are deemed to be at risk of extinction, yet there is only sufficient material in gene banks for 203 out of a global total of 7,700 local livestock breeds to reconstitute the breed in the event of its extinction. while the share of agricultural aid has remained constant at about 5 percent, it has more than doubled in volume since 2002, with total disbursements amounting to $13 billion in 2019. a steady downward trend has been observed in export subsidy outlays notified to the world trade organization (wto). total notified annual outlays fell from a peak of $6.7 billion in 1999 to $138 million in 2018. in december 2015, wto members adopted the ministerial decision on export competition, formally agreeing to eliminate all forms of agricultural export subsidy entitlements. at the global level, the number of countries and territories afflicted by high food prices decreased from 2014 to 2019, with the notable exception of some countries in central, southern and western asia as well as northern africa, owing to the reduced domestic availability of staple foods and to currency depreciations.
