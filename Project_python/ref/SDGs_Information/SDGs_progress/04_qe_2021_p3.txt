disparities by urban/rural geographical location and household wealth are typically more extreme, with one third and one sixth of countries and territories achieving parity in primary completion, respectively, and no countries or territories with recent data achieving parity in tertiary attendance. the pandemic is expected to lead to a reversal in recent progress towards equity. with the shift towards remote learning, those from the poorest households and other vulnerable groups are less equipped to participate and more likely to drop out permanently or for extended periods. according to data for the period from 2017 to 2019, more than one fifth of primary schools worldwide do not have access to basic drinking water, and more than one third lack basic handwashing facilities. in the least developed countries, more than two thirds of primary schools do not have access to electricity, with even lower rates of internet access and computer availability for pedagogical purposes in schools. oda for scholarships amounted to $1.7 billion in 2019, up from $1.3 billion in 2017. the european union, france, japan, saudi arabia and turkey accounted for 55 per cent of this total. in 2019, 81 per cent of primary school teachers were trained, although that proportion was lower in sub saharan africa (65 per cent) and southern asia (74 per cent). with the unprecedented lockdown as a result of the pandemic leading to total or partial school closures in most countries and territories, the teaching workforce was severely affected.
