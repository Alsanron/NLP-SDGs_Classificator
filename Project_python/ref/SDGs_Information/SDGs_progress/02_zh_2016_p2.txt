ending hunger and malnutrition relies heavily on sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices. genetic diversity in livestock breeds is crucial for agriculture and food production since it allows for the raising of farm animals in a wide range of environments and provides the basis for diverse products and services. globally, 20 per cent of local livestock breeds, meaning breeds reported in only one country, are at risk of extinction. another 16 per cent of breeds are stable, and the status of the remaining local breeds is unknown owing to a lack of data. the figures exclude livestock breeds that have already become extinct. to increase the productive capacity of agriculture, more investment is needed, both public and private, from domestic and foreign sources. however, recent trends in government spending are not favourable. the agriculture orientation index, defined as agriculture’s share of government expenditures divided by the sector’s share of gross domestic product (gdp), fell globally from 0.37 to 0.25 between 2001 and 2013. the decline in the index was interrupted only temporarily during the food price crisis of 2006 to 2008, when governments increased agricultural spending. since the late 1990s, the percentage of aid for supporting agriculture in developing countries has been stable at around 8 per cent, when measured as a share of sector allocable aid from member countries of the development assistance committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd). this has decreased, from a peak of 20 per cent in the mid 1980s, as a result of donors beginning to focus more on improving governance, building social capital and bolstering fragile states. one of the targets for goal 2 calls for correcting and preventing distortions in world agricultural markets, including the elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies.
