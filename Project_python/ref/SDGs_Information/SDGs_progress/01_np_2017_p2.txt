social protection systems are fundamental to preventing and reducing poverty and inequality at every stage of people’s lives, through benefits for children, mothers with newborns, persons with disabilities, older persons and thoses persons who are poor and without jobs. preliminary data show that in 2016, only 45 per cent of the world’s population was effectively protected by a social protection system and that coverage varied widely across countries and regions. in 2016, 68 per cent of people above retirement age received a pension. however, that global average masks large regional differences. in oceania, excluding australia and new zealand, and in sub saharan africa, only 10 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, of people above retirement age received a pension in 2016. other vulnerable groups lack social protections as well. in 2016, only 28 per cent of people with severe disabilities collected disability benefits, only 22 per cent of unemployed individuals worldwide received unemployment benefits and only 41 per cent of women giving birth received maternity benefits. building the resilience of the poor and strengthening disaster risk reduction is a core development strategy for ending extreme poverty in the most afflicted countries. economic losses from disasters are now reaching an average of $250 billion to $300 billion a year. disaster risk globally is highly concentrated in low  and lower middle income countries. in relation to the size of their economies, small island developing states have borne a disproportionate impact.
