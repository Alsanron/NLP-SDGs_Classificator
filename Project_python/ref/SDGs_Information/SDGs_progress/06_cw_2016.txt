water and sanitation are at the very core of sustainable development, critical to the survival of people and the planet. goal 6 not only addresses the issues relating to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, but also the quality and sustainability of water resources worldwide. in 2015, 4.9 billion people globally used an improved sanitation facility; 2.4 billion did not. among those lacking adequate sanitation were 946 million people without any facilities at all, who continued to practise open defecation. in 2015, 68 per cent of the global population was using improved sanitation facilities compared to 59 per cent in 2000. nevertheless, the unsafe management of faecal waste and wastewater continues to present a major risk to public health and the environment. more progress has been made in access to drinking water. in 2015, 6.6 billion people, or 91 per cent of the global population, used an improved drinking water source, versus 82 per cent in 2000. despite that improvement, an estimated 663 million people were using unimproved water sources or surface water that year. while coverage was around 90 per cent or more in all regions except sub saharan africa and oceania, widespread inequalities persist within and among countries. moreover, not all improved sources are safe. for instance, in 2012 it was estimated that at least 1.8 billion people were exposed to drinking water sources contaminated with faecal matter. holistic management of the water cycle means taking into account the level of water stress, calculated as the ratio of total fresh water withdrawn by all major sectors to the total renewable fresh water resources in a particular country or region.
