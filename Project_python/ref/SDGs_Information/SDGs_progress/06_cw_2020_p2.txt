in 2017, central and southern asia and northern africa registered very high water stress â€“ defined as the ratio of fresh water withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resources â€“ of more than 70 per cent, followed by western asia and eastern asia, with high water stress of 54 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively. in 2018, 60 per cent of 172 countries reported very low, low and medium low levels of implementation of integrated water resources management and were unlikely to meet the implementation target by 2030. according to data from 67 countries, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was 59 per cent in the period 2017â€“2018. only 17 countries reported that all of their transboundary basins were covered by such arrangements. â· globally, in 2018, slightly more than 2.1 per cent of land was covered by freshwater bodies, although unevenly distributed, ranging from 3.5 per cent in developed countries to only 1.4 per cent in developing countries and 1.2 per cent and 1 per cent in least developed countries and small island developing states, respectively. the adverse effects of climate change can decrease the extent of freshwater bodies, thereby worsening ecosystems and livelihoods. oda disbursements to the water sector increased to $9 billion, or 6 per cent, in 2018, following a decrease in such disbursements in 2017. however, oda commitments fell by 9 per cent in 2018. because countries have signalled a funding gap of 61 per cent between what is needed to achieve national drinking water and sanitation targets and available funding, increasing donor commitments to the water sector will remain crucial to make progress towards goal 6.
