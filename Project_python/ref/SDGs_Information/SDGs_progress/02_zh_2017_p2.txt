in 2016, 4.7 million samples of seeds and other plant genetic material for food and agriculture were preserved in 602 gene banks throughout 82 countries and 14 regional and international centres — a 2 per cent increase since 2014. animal genetic material has been cryoconserved, but only for 15 per cent of national breed populations, according to information obtained from 128 countries. the stored genetic material is sufficient to reconstitute only 7 per cent of national breed populations should they become extinct. as of february 2017, 20 per cent of local breeds were classified as at risk. increased investments are needed to enhance capacity for agricultural productivity. however, the global agriculture orientation index — defined as agriculture’s share of government expenditure divided by the sector’s share of gross domestic product (gdp) — fell from 0.38 in 2001 to 0.24 in 2013 and to 0.21 in 2015. the share of sector allocable aid allocated to agriculture from member countries of the development assistance committee of the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) fell from nearly 20 per cent in the mid 1980s to 7 per cent in the late 1990s, where it remained through 2015. the decline reflects a shift away from aid for financing infrastructure and production towards a greater focus on social sectors. in 2016, 21 countries experienced high or moderately high domestic prices, relative to their historic levels, for one or more staple cereal food commodities. thirteen of those countries were in sub saharan africa. the main causes of high prices were declines in domestic output, currency depreciation and insecurity. localized increases in fuel prices also drove food prices higher.
