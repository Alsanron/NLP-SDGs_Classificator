some progress has been made in preventing distortions in world agricultural markets. the global agricultural export subsidies were reduced by 94 per cent from 2000 to 2014. in december 2015, members of the world trade organization adopted a ministerial decision on eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products and restraining export measures that have a similar effect. after a prolonged decline, world hunger appears to be on the rise again. conflict, drought and disasters linked to climate change are among the key factors causing this reversal in progress. the proportion of undernourished people worldwide increased from 10.6 per cent in 2015 to 11.0 per cent in 2016. this translates to 815 million people worldwide in 2016, up from 777 million in 2015. in 2017, 151 million children under age 5 suffered from stunting (low height for their age), 51 million suffered from wasting (low weight for height), and 38 million were overweight. aid to agriculture in developing countries totalled $12.5 billion in 2016, falling to 6 per cent of all donors’ sector allocable aid from nearly 20 per cent in the mid 1980s. progress has been made in reducing market distorting agricultural subsidies, which were more than halved in five years—from $491 million in 2010 to less than $200 million in 2015 in 2016, 26 countries experienced high or moderately high levels of general food prices, which may have negatively affected food security. hunger is on the rise again globally and undernutrition continues to affect millions of children. public investment in agriculture globally is declining, smallscale food producers and family farmers require much greater support and increased investment in infrastructure and technology for sustainable agriculture is urgently needed.
