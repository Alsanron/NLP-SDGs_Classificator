an assessment of rivers, lakes and aquifers of 89 countries and territories in 2020 indicates that the water quality of 72 per cent of the water bodies assessed is good. protection is easier than restoration, so efforts to protect these water bodies from pollution must be initiated now. improving water use efficiency is a key measure that can contribute to reducing water stress in a country. global efficiency increased from $17.30 per m3 in 2015 to $19 per m3 in 2018, a 10 per cent increase. all economic sectors have experienced an increase in water use efficiency since 2015, with increases of 15 per cent in the industrial sector, 8 per cent in the agricultural sector and 8 per cent in the services sector. in 2018, global water stress was estimated to be 18.4 per cent, an increase from 18.2 per cent in 2015. regions such as western and southern asia and northern africa present very high levels of water stress at more than 70 per cent, while southeastern asia, latin america and the caribbean, and sub saharan africa saw their water stress levels increase from 2017 to 2018. in 2020, 129 countries and territories were not on track to meet the target for implementing integrated water resources management by 2030, which includes financing and intersectoral coordination mechanisms, basin management and monitoring. the rate of implementation needs to double globally. in many countries and territories, the covid 19 pandemic has led to wider stakeholder engagement in water resources management through online consultations.
