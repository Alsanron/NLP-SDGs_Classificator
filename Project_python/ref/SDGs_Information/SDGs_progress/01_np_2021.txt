however, 4 billion people worldwide are still without any social protection, most of whom are poor and vulnerable. compounding the threats to poverty eradication posed by climate change and conflict, the pandemic is set to increase the number of poor people in 2020 by between 119 and 124 million, causing the extreme poverty rate to rise for the first time in a generation, from 8.4 per cent in 2019 to 9.5 per cent in 2020 according to nowcasts. of the new poor, 8 out of 10 are in middle income countries and territories. it is predicted that around 600 million people will still be living in extreme poverty by 2030. before the pandemic, global extreme poverty had fallen from 10.1 per cent in 2015 to 9.3 per cent in 2017, equivalent to 689 million people living on less than $1.90 a day. however, the rate of decrease had slowed to less than half a percentage point annually in that period, compared to around 1 percentage point annually between 1990 and 2015. the share of workers around the world living in extreme poverty fell from 14 per cent in 2010 to 7.8 per cent in 2015 and 6.6 per cent in 2019, although progress for young workers was less encouraging. however, the pandemic has severely affected the informal economy, in which the vast majority of the working poor are employed. the crisis also has had a disproportionate impact on the livelihoods of young and female workers, who are already much more likely to be living in poverty.
