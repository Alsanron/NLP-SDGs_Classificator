Rapid urbanization has resulted in a growing number of slum dwellers, inadequate and overburdened infrastructure and services and worsening air pollution. The pandemic will hit the hardest the more than 1 billion slum dwellers worldwide, who suffer from a lack of adequate housing, no running water at home, shared toilets, few or no waste management systems, overcrowded public transport and limited access to formal health-care facilities. Many in that population work in the informal sector and are at high risk of losing their livelihood as cities shut down. Urgent response plans are needed to prepare for and respond to outbreaks in informal settlements and slums.
The number of slum dwellers reached more than 1 billion in 2018, which represents 24 per cent of the urban population, up slightly from 23 per cent in 2014. The number of people living in urban slums is highest in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (370 million), sub-Saharan Africa (238 million) and Central and Southern Asia (226 million).
