the socioeconomic impacts of the covid 19 pandemic have adversely affected recent progress on gender equality: violence against women and girls has intensified, child marriage is expected to increase after declining in previous years, and increased care work at home is affecting women disproportionately. the pandemic has highlighted the need for swift action to address the gender inequality that remains pervasive globally and to get back on track for achieving gender equality. women have played a critical role in the response to the pandemic as front line health workers, caregivers, and managers and leaders of the response and recovery efforts. however, they remain underrepresented in critical leadership positions, and their rights and priorities are often not explicitly addressed in those efforts. the crisis presents an opportunity to reshape and rebuild systems, laws, policies and institutions in order to advance gender equality. discriminatory laws and legal gaps continue to prevent women from fully enjoying their human rights. according to data for 2020 from 95 countries and territories, more than half lacked quotas for women in the national parliament; 83 per cent included budgetary commitments to implement legislation addressing violence against women, although 63 per cent continued to lack rape laws based on the principle of consent; more than 90 per cent prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of gender, yet almost half continued to restrict women from working in certain jobs or industries; and almost one quarter did not grant women equal rights to men for entering into marriage and initiating divorce proceedings. new estimates based on surveys from the period 2000–2018 confirm that nearly 736 million women, or one in three, have been subjected to physical violence, sexual violence or both by a husband or intimate partner, or sexual violence by a non partner, at least once in their lifetime from 15 years of age – a figure that has remained largely unchanged over the past decade.
