advancing transboundary water cooperation plays a crucial role in preventing conflicts and supporting wider regional integration, peace and sustainable development. however, according to data from 2017 and 2020, only 24 of the 153 countries and territories that share transboundary rivers, lakes and aquifers have 100 per cent of their transboundary basin area covered by operational arrangements, and only another 22 countries and territories have more than 70 per cent covered. freshwater ecosystems and the multitude of resources that they provide are changing dramatically. one fifth of the worldâ€™s river basins are experiencing rapid increases or decreases in surface water area. this unprecedented situation is compounded by pollution in large lakes and the persistent loss and degradation of wetlands and freshwater biodiversity. between 1970 and 2015, the total area of inland and marine or coastal wetlands declined by approximately 35 per cent, three times the rate of forest loss. existing efforts to protect and restore water related ecosystems must be scaled up and accelerated urgently. from 2015 to 2019, oda disbursements to the water sector remained stable at around $8.8 billion, while oda commitments to the water sector rose by 9 per cent. in the same period, concessional lending for the least developed countries increased by 52 per cent to $2 billion, with oda grants to those countries increasing by only 8 per cent. in 2018 and 2019, two thirds of the 109 reporting countries and territories had procedures for the participation of local communities in water and sanitation management that were defined in laws or policies. however, only 14 countries and territories reported high levels of community and user participation in collaborative management and decision making.
