Worldwide, 81 per cent of births were assisted by skilled health professionals in the period 2014–2019, up from 64 per cent in the period 2000–2005, with Central Asia, Eastern Asia, Western Asia, Northern America and Europe nearly achieving universal coverage.
The concerted effort of the global community continues to reduce preventable child deaths, from a mortality rate of 76 deaths per 1,000 live births in children under 5 years of age in 2000 to 42 in 2015 to 39 in 2018. Notwithstanding the progress, some 5.3 million children died before reaching 5 years of age in 2018 alone, and nearly half of those deaths, or 2.5 million, occurred in the first month of life. Globally, the proportion of women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) whose family planning needs were met by modern contraceptive methods increased only slightly, from 75.7 per cent in 2010 to around 77 per cent from 2015 to 2020, reaching only 56 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa and 52 per cent in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand).
Worldwide, the adolescent birth rate fell steadily, from 45 births per 1,000 women 15 to 19 years of age in 2015 to 41 per 1,000 in 2020, with the highest rate, 101 per 1,000, in sub-Saharan Africa.
Infectious diseases. In 2018, there were an estimated 1.7 million new HIV infections, an incidence rate of 0.24 per 1,000 uninfected persons among the total population, almost unchanged from the level of 0.26 per 1,000 in 2015, putting the world off track in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal target. One in three of new HIV infections globally occurred among women 15 to 49 years of age in sub-Saharan Africa.
