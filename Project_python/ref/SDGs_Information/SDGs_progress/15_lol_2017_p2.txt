from 1998 to 2013, about one fifth of the earthâ€™s land surface covered by vegetation showed persistent and declining trends in productivity. south america and africa are most affected; in some cases, advanced stages of land degradation there are leading to desertification in dryland areas, particularly in the grasslands and rangelands. land and soil degradation undermine the security and development of all countries. reversing the effects of land degradation and desertification through sustainable land management is key to improving the lives and livelihoods of more than 1 billion people currently under threat. biodiversity loss continues at an alarming rate according to the red list index. the extinction risk for corals is increasing most rapidly among all assessed species groups owing to the growing threat from climate change and local impacts. chytrid fungal disease, another grave concern, is decimating many amphibian species and increasing their risk of extinction. wildlife poaching and trafficking continues to thwart conservation efforts. illicit wildlife markets are complex and subject to rapid fluctuations. demand for a given wildlife product can grow quickly, before the international community can react. in 2013, elephant ivory, rosewood and rhinoceros horn comprised over 60 per cent of total wildlife and timber product seizures. the global community is committed to conserving biodiversity. two international agreements aim at sharing the benefits from using genetic resources in a fair and equitable way. as of april 2017, 144 countries ratified the international treaty on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture and 96 countries ratified the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization.
