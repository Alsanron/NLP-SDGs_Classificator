the impact of the covid 19 pandemic on schooling is a generational catastrophe. before the pandemic, progress was already slow and insufficient to achieve the education targets in the goals. school closures caused by the pandemic have had devastating consequences for childrenâ€™s learning and well being. hundreds of millions of children and young people are falling behind in their learning, which will have long term impacts. one year into the covid 19 crisis, two thirds of students worldwide are still affected by full or partial school closures. the most vulnerable children and those unable to access remote learning are at increased risk of never returning to school and of being forced into child marriage or child labour. it is estimated that 101 million additional children and young people (from grades 1 to 8) fell below the minimum reading proficiency level in 2020 owing to the consequences of the pandemic, which wiped out the education gains achieved over the past 20 years. reading proficiency levels could recover by 2024, but only if exceptional efforts are devoted to the task through remedial and catch up strategies. just before the pandemic, 53 per cent of young people were completing secondary school globally, although the figure for sub saharan africa was only 29 per cent. the rise in school completion rates may slow or even reverse depending on the duration of school closures, which are resulting in learning losses and affecting the motivation to attend school, and on the extent to which poverty might increase, adding to the obstacles faced by disadvantaged children.
