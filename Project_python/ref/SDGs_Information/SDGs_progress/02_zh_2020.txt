the total number of persons suffering from severe food insecurity has been on the rise since 2015, and there are still millions of malnourished children. the economic slowdown and the disruption of food value chains caused by the pandemic are exacerbating hunger and food insecurity. in addition, the upsurge in desert locusts remains alarming in east africa and yemen, where 35 million persons already experience acute food insecurity. owing to the pandemic, some 370 million schoolchildren are missing the free school meals that they rely on. measures to strengthen food production and distribution systems must be taken immediately to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the pandemic. an estimated 26.4 per cent of the world population, about 2 billion persons, were affected by moderate or severe food insecurity in 2018, an increase from 23.2 per cent in 2014, owing mainly to increases in food insecurity in sub saharan africa and latin america. slightly more than 700 million persons, or 9.2 per cent of the world population, experienced severe food insecurity in 2018, implying reductions in the quantity of food consumed to the extent that they possibly experienced hunger. the proportion of children under 5 years of age suffering from chronic undernutrition, as well as stunting (being too short for oneâ€™s age), decreased, from 23.1 per cent in 2015 to 21.3 per cent in 2019. globally, 144 million children under 5 years of age were still affected by stunting in 2019. three quarters of them lived in central and southern asia or sub saharan africa.
