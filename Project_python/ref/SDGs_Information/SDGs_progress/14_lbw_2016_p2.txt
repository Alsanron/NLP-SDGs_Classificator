since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the ocean has absorbed about one third of the carbon dioxide released by human activities, thereby mitigating the full impact of climate change. however, this comes at a steep ecological price, as dissolved carbon dioxide in seawater lowers the ph level of oceans, thereby increasing acidity and changing the biogeochemical carbonate balance. concerns about ocean acidification, first expressed in the early 1980s, have now been confirmed, and the extent of its impact on marine ecosystems is being investigated. fisheries contribute significantly to global food security, livelihoods and the economy. however, if not sustainably managed, fishing can damage fish habitats. ultimately, overfishing impairs the functioning of ecosystems and reduces biodiversity, with negative repercussions for sustainable social and economic development. in order to achieve a healthy balance, fish stocks must be maintained within biologically sustainable limits, at or above the abundance level that can produce maximum sustainable yields. based on an analysis of assessed stocks, the percentage of world marine fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 69 per cent in 2013. fortunately, the downward trend has slowed and appears to have stabilized since 2008. biodiverse marine sites require safeguarding to ensure sustainable long term use of their precious natural resources. globally, in 2014, 8.4 per cent of the marine environment under national jurisdiction (up to 200 nautical miles from shore) and 0.25 per cent of the marine environment beyond national jurisdiction were under protection.
