even before the current crisis, the global economy was growing at a slower rate than in previous years notwithstanding improvements in labour productivity and unemployment. the pandemic has abruptly and profoundly disrupted it, pushing the world into a recession. the unprecedented shock to the world’s labour markets is expected to result in a decrease of around 10.5 per cent in aggregate working hours in the second quarter of 2020, equivalent to 305 million full time workers. small and medium enterprises, workers in informal employment, the self employed, daily wage earners and workers in sectors at the highest risk of disruption have been hit the hardest. in 2018, the rate of growth of global real gdp per capita was 2 per cent. in addition, the rate for least developed countries was 4.5 per cent in 2018, less than the 7 per cent growth rate targeted in the 2030 agenda. the pandemic is pushing the world into the worst global economic crisis since the great depression. after a brief interruption during the global economic downturn of 2008–2009, labour productivity has continued to grow; in 2019, it increased by 1.4 per cent from the previous year. globally, 61 per cent of workers were in informal employment in 2016. the need to rely on informal employment was more prevalent in sub saharan africa and central and southern asia, where 89 per cent and 86 per cent of workers, respectively, were in such employment. as young women were already twice as likely as young men not to be in employment, education or training, and as women have been forced into inactivity disproportionately during the pandemic, the covid 19 crisis is likely to worsen the gender gap among young people not in employment, education or training.
