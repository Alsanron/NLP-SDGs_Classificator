deforestation and forest degradation, continued biodiversity loss and the ongoing degradation of ecosystems are having profound consequences for human well being and survival. the world fell short on 2020 targets to halt biodiversity loss. the covid 19 pandemic has shown that, by threatening biodiversity, humanity threatens its own survival. while great efforts are being made to expand sustainable forest management, increase coverage of key biodiversity areas and sign up t o legislation and treaties for protecting biodiversity and ecosystems, much more needs to be done to put the health of the planet at the centre of all plans and policies. while the rate of deforestation in tropical regions has slowed in the past decad e, vigilance and targeted efforts are required to maintain this trend. the proportion of forest area fell from 31.9 per cent of total land area in 2000 to 31.2 per cent in 2020, representing a net loss of almost 100 million hectares of the worldâ€™s forests. from 2000 to 2020, forest area increased in asia, europe and northern america, but decreased significantly in latin america and sub saharan africa. despite the losses in forest cover, above ground forest biomass per hectare, the proportion of forest area in protected areas and under long term management plans, and certified forest area all increased or remained stable at the global level and in most of the regions of the world, demonstrating global progress towards sustainable forest management.
