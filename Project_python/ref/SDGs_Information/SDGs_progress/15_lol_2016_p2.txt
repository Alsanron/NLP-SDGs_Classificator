the focus in goal 15 on halting biodiversity loss comes at a critical time, since many species of amphibians, birds and mammals are sliding towards extinction. according to the international union for conservation of natureâ€™s red list index, amphibians are declining most rapidly in latin america and the caribbean, primarily as a result of the chytrid fungal disease, one of numerous wildlife diseases on the rise worldwide. the greatest extinction risks for birds and mammals are found in south eastern asia, mainly owing to the conversion of lowland forests. however, their decline is not inevitable, with extinction risks for vertebrate species having been reversed in five small island developing states (the cook islands, fiji, mauritius, seychelles and tonga) as a result of conservation actions over the past several decades. conservation efforts can also be thwarted by poaching and the trafficking of wildlife. since 1999, at least 7,000 species of animals and plants have been detected in illegal trade, and the list of species under international protection continues to grow. comparing the size of legal trade in wildlife products (about 900,000 transactions per year) to the quantity of wildlife seized (about 16,000 seizures per year) provides an indication of the scope of illicit wildlife trafficking. the value of legal and illicit wildlife products can also be compared. for example, the value of recorded seizures of crocodylus genus represents between 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent of the value of legal protected exports of this species between 2009 and 2013, with no clear trend discernible. in 2014, bilateral oda to support biodiversity amounted to $7 billion, an increase of 16 per cent in real terms over 2013. the two largest recipients of biodiversity assistance were the philippines and india, which together received about $1 billion of the total aid.
