improved regulation, together with effective monitoring and surveillance, has proved successful in restoring overfished stocks to biologically sustainable levels. however, the adoption of such measures has generally been slow, in many developing countries in particular. in 13 countries and territories that have active assessment and management systems in place, the proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels is higher than the world average of 65.8 per cent, according to data collected in 2019. between 2018 and 2020, the average degree of implementation of international instruments to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing improved around the world, with the global score measuring the implementation of the five principal instruments rising from 3 to 4 out of 5. almost 75 per cent of states scored highly in their degree of implementation in 2020, compared to 70 per cent percent of states in 2018. between 2018 and 2020, the world made progress in implementing regulatory and institutional frameworks that recognize and protect access rights for small scale fisheries, with the global score rising from 3 to 4. at the regional level, northern africa and western asia made this progress, while the regional score for central and southern asia fell from 3 to 2, highlighting the need for efforts there to be redoubled and demonstrating that there is no room for complacency. from 2000 to 2016, the share of marine sites around the world that are designated as key biodiversity areas and are completely covered by protected areas increased from 15 per cent to 19 per cent.
