peace, justice and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions are at the core of sustainable development. several regions have enjoyed increased and sustained levels of peace and security in recent decades. but many countries still face protracted armed conflict and violence, and far too many people struggle as a result of weak institutions and the lack of access to justice, information and other fundamental freedoms. the number of victims of intentional homicide worldwide remained relatively stable from 2008 to 2014. the worldwide number of victims of intentional homicide was estimated to be between 4.6 and 6.8 per 100,000 people in 2014, a slight decrease with respect to previous years. yet during that period, the homicide rate in developing countries was twice that in developed countries, and increased in the least developed countries. moreover, despite the lack of harmonized data, fatalities and injuries related to armed conflict appear to be increasing in some countries, causing unprecedented population displacements and enormous humanitarian needs. various forms of violence against children are pervasive, including discipline that relies on physical punishment and psychological aggression. in all but 7 of 73 countries and areas with available survey data from 2005 to 2015, more than half of children between the ages of 1 and 14 were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home. in northern africa, the share was more than 90 per cent. globally, the share of girls and boys among victims of human trafficking (21 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively) peaked in 2011.
