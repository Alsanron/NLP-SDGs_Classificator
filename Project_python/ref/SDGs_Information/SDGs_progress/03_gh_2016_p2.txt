preventing unintended pregnancy and reducing adolescent childbearing through universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services are critical to further advances in the health of women, children and adolescents. worldwide, in 2015, approximately 3 in 4 women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years of age) who were married or in union satisfied their need for family planning by using modern contraceptive methods; in sub saharan africa and oceania, however, the share was less than half. childbearing in adolescence has steadily declined in almost all regions, but wide disparities persist: in 2015, the birth rate among adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 ranged from 7 births per 1,000 girls in eastern asia to 102 births per 1,000 girls in sub saharan africa. the incidence of major infectious diseases, including hiv, tuberculosis and malaria, has declined globally since 2000. globally in 2015, the number of new hiv infections among all people was 0.3 new infections per 1,000 uninfected people; 2.1 million people became newly infected that year. the incidence of hiv was highest in sub saharan africa, with 1.5 new cases per 1,000 uninfected people. in 2014, 9.6 million new cases of tuberculosis (133 cases per 100,000 people) were reported worldwide, with 58 per cent of them in south eastern asia and the western pacific. unhealthy environmental conditions increase the risk of both non communicable and infectious diseases, which is reflected in the strong integrated nature of the goals.
