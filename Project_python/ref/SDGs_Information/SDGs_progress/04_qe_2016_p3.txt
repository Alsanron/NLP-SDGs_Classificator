goal 4 strongly supports the reduction of persistent disparities. worldwide, in 2013, two thirds of the 757 million adults (aged 15 and over) who were unable to read and write were women. globally, in 2013, 1 in 10 girls were out of school, compared to 1 in 12 boys. children from the poorest 20 per cent of households are nearly four times more likely to be out of school than their richest peers. out of school rates are also higher in rural areas and among children from households headed by someone with less than a primary education. to fulfil the promise of universal primary and secondary education, new primary school teachers are needed, with current estimates showing a need for nearly 26 million of them by 2030. africa faces the greatest challenges in this regard, with nearly 7 in 10 countries experiencing acute shortages of trained primary school teachers. in 2013, only 71 per cent of teachers in sub saharan africa and 84 per cent in northern africa were trained in accordance with national standards. official development assistance for educational scholarships amounted to around $1.1 billion annually from 2011 to 2013. it totalled $1.2 billion in 2014, with australia, france and japan being the largest contributors.  almost half of countries and territories with recent data did not achieve gender parity in primary completion, and only a handful of countries and territories demonstrate parity in tertiary enrolment ratios.
