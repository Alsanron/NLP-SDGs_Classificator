people who continue to live in extreme poverty face deep, entrenched deprivation often exacerbated by violent conflicts and vulnerability to disasters. strong social protection systems and government spending on key services often help those left behind get back on their feet and escape poverty, but these services need to be brought to scale. the share of the world population living in extreme poverty declined to 10 per cent in 2015, down from 16 per cent in 2010 and 36 per cent in 1990. however, the pace of poverty reduction is decelerating, with a nowcast of 8.6 per cent in 2018. moreover, baseline projections suggest that 6 per cent of the world population will still be living in extreme poverty in 2030, missing the target of ending poverty. despite having a job, 8 per cent of the world’s workers and their families still lived in extreme poverty in 2018. the situation remains particularly alarming in sub saharan africa, where the share of working poor stood at 38 per cent in 2018. social protection systems help prevent and reduce poverty and provide a safety net for the vulnerable. however, social protection is not a reality for a large majority of the world’s population. in 2016, 55 per cent – as many as 4 billion people – were not covered by any social protection cash benefits, with large variations across regions: from 87 per cent without coverage in sub saharan africa to 14 per cent in europe and northern america.
