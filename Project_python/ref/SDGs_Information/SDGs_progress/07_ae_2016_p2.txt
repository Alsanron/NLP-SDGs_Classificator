in absolute terms, about 72 per cent of the increase in energy consumption from modern renewable sources between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions, mostly from eastern asia. the technologies making the largest contribution have been hydropower, wind and solar energy; together they account for 73 per cent of the total increase in modern renewable energy between 2010 and 2012. energy intensity, calculated by dividing total primary energy supply by gdp, reveals how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. globally, energy intensity decreased by 1.7 per cent per year from 2010 to 2012. this represents a considerable improvement over the period from 1990 to 2010, when it decreased by 1.2 per cent a year. as a result, global energy intensity, which stood at 6.7 (millijoules (mj) per 2011 united states dollar ppp) in 2000 fell to 5.7 by 2012. the proportion of the worldâ€™s energy use covered by mandatory energy efficiency regulation, which has almost doubled over the past decade, from 14 per cent in 2005 to 27 per cent in 2014, was a factor. still, current progress is only about two thirds of the pace needed to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. among end use sectors, industry was the largest contributor to reduced energy intensity, followed closely by transportation. about 68 per cent of the savings in energy intensity between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions, with eastern asia as the largest contributor. progress in every area of sustainable energy falls short of what is needed to achieve energy access for all and to meet targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency.
