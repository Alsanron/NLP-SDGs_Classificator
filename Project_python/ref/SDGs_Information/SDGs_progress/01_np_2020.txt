even before the pandemic, the pace of global poverty reduction was decelerating, and it was projected that the global target of ending poverty by 2030 would be missed. the pandemic is pushing tens of millions of persons back into extreme poverty, undoing years of progress. while the pandemic has highlighted the need to strengthen social protection and emergency preparedness and response, those measures are insufficient to safeguard the poor and the vulnerable, who most need them. after a decline, from 15.7 per cent in 2010 to 10.0 per cent in 2015, the pace of reduction of extreme poverty slowed further, with a nowcast rate of 8.2 per cent in 2019. the pandemic is reversing the trend of poverty reduction. according to the most recent estimates, the global extreme poverty rate is projected to be 8.4 to 8.8 per cent in 2020, which is close to its level in 2017. consequently, an estimated 40 to 60 million persons will be pushed back into extreme poverty, the first increase in global poverty in more than 20 years. the share of the world’s workers living in extreme poverty fell, from 14.3 to 8.3 to 7.1 per cent in 2010, 2015 and 2019, respectively. progress in that regard was less encouraging for young workers: in 2019, 12.8 per cent of the world’s young workers lived in extreme poverty, compared with only 6 per cent of all adult workers.
