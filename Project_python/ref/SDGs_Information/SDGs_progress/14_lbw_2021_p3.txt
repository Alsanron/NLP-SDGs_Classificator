sustainable fisheries accounted for approximately 0.1 per cent of global gdp in 2017, while contributing more than 0.5 per cent of gdp in certain regions and the least developed countries. the sustainable management of fish stocks remains critical to ensuring that fisheries continue to generate economic growth and support equitable development. the long term impact of the covid 19 pandemic on fisheries poses significant challenges that threaten to undermine sustainable stock management and profitability. on average, only 1.2 per cent of national research budgets was allocated to ocean science between 2013 and 2017, with amounts ranging from 0.02 per cent to 9.5 per cent. this is a small proportion in view of the conservatively estimated $1.5 trillion contribution of the ocean to the global economy in 2010. many states have ratified or acceded to the united nations convention on the law of the sea (168 parties) and its implementing agreements (150 parties for the agreement relating to the implementation of part xi of the united nations convention on the law of the sea and 91 parties for the united nations fish stocks agreement). a number of states have implemented these instruments through legal, policy and institutional frameworks, but further progress is needed in some developing countries, in particular the least developed countries. when effectively managed and well resourced, marine protected areas are important mechanisms for safeguarding ocean life. in 2017, protected areas cover 13.2 per cent of the marine environment under national jurisdiction (up to 200 nautical miles from shore), 0.25 per cent of the marine environment beyond national jurisdiction and 5.3 per cent of the total global ocean area.
