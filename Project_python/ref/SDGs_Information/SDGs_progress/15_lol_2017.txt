progress in preserving and sustainably using the earth’s terrestrial species and ecosystems is uneven. the pace of forest loss has slowed and improvements continue to be made in managing forests sustainably and protecting areas important for biodiversity. however, declining trends in land productivity, biodiversity loss and poaching and trafficking of wildlife remain serious concerns. the net loss of forest continues to slow and forest biomass stock per hecta re is stable. more forests are being protected and areas under long term management plans and voluntary certification have increased. from 2010 to 2015, the annual net loss of forest area globally was less than half that of the 1990s. the proportion of land area covered by forest decreased from 31.6 per cent in 1990 to 30.8 per cent in 2010 and 30.6 per cent in 2015. fifteen per cent of land is currently under protection, but that does not cover all areas important for biodiversity. protecting key biodiversity areas is necessary to strengthen natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. from 2000 to 2017, average worldwide coverage of terrestrial, freshwater and mountain key biodiversity areas by protected areas increased from 35 per cent to 47 per cent, from 32 per cent to 43 per cent and from 39 per cent to 49 per cent, respectively. as of 2017, 76 per cent of the world’s mountain areas are covered by some form of green vegetation, including forests, shrubs, grasses and crops. green cover on mountains is lowest in central asia (31 per cent) and highest in oceania (excluding australia and new zealand) (98 per cent).
