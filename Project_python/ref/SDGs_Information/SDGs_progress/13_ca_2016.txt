climate change presents the single biggest threat to development, and its widespread, unprecedented impacts disproportionately burden the poorest and most vulnerable. urgent action to combat climate change and minimize its disruptions is integral to the successful implementation of the sustainable development goals. the global nature of climate change calls for broad international cooperation in building resilience and adaptive capacity to its adverse effects, developing sustainable low carbon pathways to the future, and accelerating the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. on 22 april 2016, 175 member states signed the paris agreement under the united nations framework convention on climate change. the new agreement aims to reduce the pace of climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low carbon future. climate change often exacerbates disasters. between 1990 and 2013, more than 1.6 million people died in internationally reported disasters, with annual deaths trending upwards. as a result, more countries are acting on the imperative to implement national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. in 2015, 83 countries had legislative and/or regulatory provisions in place for managing disaster risk. parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change are responsible for providing a range of national reports on their efforts to implement the agreement. as of 4 april 2016, 161 intended nationally determined contributions, from 189 of the 197 parties to the framework convention (the european commission submitted one joint intended determined contribution) had been recorded by the secretariat of the framework convention, providing insights into the efforts many countries are taking to integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning.
