before the start of the covid 19 pandemic in 2020, the average growth of the global economy had already slowed. the pandemic has caused the worst global economic recession since the great depression and has had a massive impact on working times and incomes. in 2020, 8.8 per cent of global working hours were lost compared to the figure for the fourth quarter of 2019, which is equivalent to 255 million full time jobs and approximately four times greater than the hours lost during the global financial crisis in 2009. young people and women in the workforce were hit particularly hard by the crisis in the labour market. the global economy is slowly recovering, although activity may remain below pre pandemic levels for a prolonged period. following average growth of about 2 per cent from 2014 to 2018, global real gdp per capita increased by only 1.3 per cent in 2019 and is estimated to have declined by 5.3 per cent in 2020 owing to the pandemic. global real gdp per capita is projected to increase again by 3.6 per cent in 2021 and 2.6 per cent in 2022. the real gdp of the least developed countries increased by 4.8 per cent in 2019 and is estimated to have fallen by 1.3 per cent in 2020 because of the disruption caused by the pandemic. before the onset of the pandemic, informal employment accounted for 60.2 per cent of global employment, equivalent to 2 billion people with informal jobs characterized by a lack of basic protection, including social protection coverage. more than three quarters, 1.6 billion informal workers, were significantly affected by the pandemic related lockdown measures or were working in the sectors hardest hit.
