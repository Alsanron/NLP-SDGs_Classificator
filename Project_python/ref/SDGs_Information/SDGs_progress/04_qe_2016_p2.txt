the end of lower secondary education often coincides with the end of compulsory education. by this stage, young people should be able to master subject related knowledge and skills and possess personal and social skills. data from 38 countries in the developed regions show that, in the majority of those countries, at least 75 per cent of young people achieved at least a minimum proficiency in reading and/or mathematics; the same was true for only 5 out of 22 countries, in developing regions, for which data were available. completion rates for both primary and lower secondary education has been rising steadily since 2000. completion rates for primary education in both developed and developing regions exceeded 90 per cent in 2013. at the lower secondary level, the gap between developed and developing regions has narrowed substantially, but still stood at nearly 20 percentage points in 2013 (91 per cent for developed regions and 72 per cent for developing regions). quality early education provides children with basic cognitive and language skills and fosters emotional development. in the majority of the 58 countries with available data for the period 2009 2015, more than half of children between the ages of 3 and 4 were developmentally on track in at least three of the following domains: literacy, numeracy, physical development, social emotional development and learning.
