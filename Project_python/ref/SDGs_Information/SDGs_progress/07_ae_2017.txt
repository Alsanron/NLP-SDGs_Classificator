meaningful improvements will require higher levels of financing and bolder policy commitments, together with the willingness of countries to embrace new technologies on a much wider scale. globally, 85.3 per cent of the population had access to electricity in 2014, an increase of only 0.3 percentage points since 2012. that means that 1.06 billion people, predominantly rural dwellers, still function without electricity. half of those people live in sub saharan africa. access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking climbed to 57.4 per cent in 2014, up slightly from 56.5 per cent in 2012. more than 3 billion people, the majority of them in asia and sub saharan africa, are still cooking without clean fuels and more efficient technologies. the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption grew modestly from 2012 to 2014, from 17.9 per cent to 18.3 per cent. most of the increase was from renewable electricity from water, solar and wind power. solar and wind power still make up a relatively minor share of energy consumption, despite their rapid growth in recent years. the challenge is to increase the share of renewable energy in the heat and transport sectors, which together account for 80 per cent of global energy consumption. from 2012 to 2014, three quarters of the world’s 20 largest energy consuming countries had reduced their energy intensity — the ratio of energy used per unit of gdp. the reduction was driven mainly by greater efficiencies in the industry and transport sectors. however, that progress is still not sufficient to meet the target of doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.
