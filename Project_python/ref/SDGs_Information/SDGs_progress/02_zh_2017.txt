those subsidies mask market signals, reduce competitiveness and can lead to environmental damage and the inequitable distribution of benefits. that said, some progress is being made, with members of the world trade organization adopting a ministerial decision, in december 2015, on eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products and restraining export measures that have an equivalent effect. efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition have advanced significantly since 2000. ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition for all, however, will require continued and focused efforts, especially in asia and africa. more investments in agriculture, including government spending and aid, are needed to increase capacity for agricultural productivity. the proportion of undernourished people worldwide declined from 15 per cent in 2000 2002 to 11 per cent in 2014 2016. about 793 million people are undernourished globally, down from 930 million people during the same period. in 2016, an estimated 155 million children under 5 years of age were stunted (too short for their age, a result of chronic malnutrition). globally, the stunting rate fell from 33 per cent in 2000 to 23 per cent in 2016. southern asia and sub saharan africa accounted for three quarters of all stunted children that year. in 2016, an estimated 52 million children under 5 years of age worldwide suffered from wasting (with a low weight for their height, usually the result of an acute and significant food shortage and/or disease). the global wasting rate in 2016 was 7.7 per cent, with the highest rate (15.4 per cent) in southern asia. at the other end of the spectrum, overweight and obesity affected 41 million children under 5 years of age worldwide (6 per cent) in 2016. ending hunger demands sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices. one aspect of that effort is maintaining the genetic diversity of plants and animals, which is crucial for agriculture and food production.
