integrated water resources management, one of the follow up actions to the plan of implementation of the world summit on sustainable development (johannesburg plan of implementation), aims to address this urgent situation. in 2012, 65 per cent of the 130 countries that responded to a survey question on integrated water resources management reported that management plans were in place at the national level. total official flows for water and sanitation were $10 billion in 2014, of which total aid flows from dac donors amounted to $8 billion. aid for water and sanitation nearly doubled as a share of oda during the international drinking water supply and sanitation decade (1981 1990). since that time, on average, it has remained at around 7 per cent of total aid flows. better targeting and tracking of water aid within the context of national situations is needed. for instance, numerous countries with limited access to water supply and/or sanitation have been receiving minimal external assistance (typically less than $2 per capita annually), while other countries with higher levels of access have received much more (at least $30 per capita a year). effective water and sanitation management also depends on the participation of stakeholders. according to a 2013 2014 global analysis and assessment of sanitation and drinking water survey, 83 per cent of the 94 countries surveyed reported that procedures for stakeholder participation were clearly defined in law or policy. in the sustainable development goals, the focus is being refined to also include the participation of local communities, which will be captured in the next cycle of global analysis and assessment of sanitation and drinking water monitoring
