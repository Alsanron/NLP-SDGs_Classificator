from 2000 to 2015, more than one fifth of the earth’s total land area was degraded, largely due to human induced processes, such as desertification, cropland expansion and urbanization. during the same period, there were significant productivity declines in land cover, with grasslands incurring some of the greatest losses. the most fundamental and irreversible human impact on nature is species extinction. the red list index – which measures the risk of extinction, in which a value of 1 indicates no threat to any species, and a value of 0 indicates that all species are extinct – has deteriorated from 0.82 in 1993 to 0.73 globally in 2019. the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization to the convention on biological diversity creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources and biodiversity. as at 1 february 2019, 116 countries had ratified the nagoya protocol (an increase of 46 since 2016) and 61 countries had shared information on their access and benefit sharing frameworks through the access and benefit sharing clearing house (representing an increase of 55 countries). in 2017, bilateral oda in support of biodiversity was $8.7 billion, an increase of 15 per cent in real terms over 2016. there are now 148 parties to the international treaty on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, and so far, 57 countries and territories have provided information about the measures that they have taken to implement the nagoya protocol.
