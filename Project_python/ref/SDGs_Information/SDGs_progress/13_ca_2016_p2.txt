among those countries, 137 parties included an adaptation component in their intended nationally determined contributions. some countries stressed that adaptation was their main climate change priority, with strong linkages to other aspects of national development, sustainability and security. in order to help countries move forward on climate action, a global stocktaking was established, in the context of the paris agreement, to assess collective progress every five years. the process will begin in 2018, with a facilitative dialogue to review the efforts of parties towards emissions reductions and to inform the preparation of final nationally determined contributions. as parties scale up climate change action, enhanced cooperation, capacity building and access to financial and technical support will be needed to help many countries realize their priorities, including those identified in intended nationally determined contributions and national adaptation plans. developed countries have committed to mobilizing, by 2020, $100 billion a year in climate financing from a wide variety of sources to help address the needs of developing countries. by 2025, parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change will set a new collective goal of at least $100 billion per year. the green climate fund, a mechanism within the framework convention created to assist developing countries in adaptation and mitigation practices, is an important delivery vehicle for this financing. as of may 2016, the green climate fund had mobilized $10.3 billion. climate change is already affecting the most vulnerable countries and populations, in particular the least developed countries and the small island developing states.
