efforts are under way to make national and international institutions more effective, inclusive and transparent. over the past 10 years, nearly two thirds of 144 countries with available data were able to plan their national budgets effectively (where final expenses remained within 10 per cent of original budgets). voting rights assigned to various groups of countries in international institutions is one indication of inclusivity at the international level. for example, while developing countries account for 63 per cent of voting rights in the african development bank, this figure is only 35 per cent in the international monetary fund and 38 per cent in the international bank for reconstruction and development of the world bank group. a free press is closely linked to access to information and the protection of human rights, but the trend in this regard is discouraging. the number of journalists killed increased from 65 in 2010 to 114 in 2015, despite the fact that, by 2013, 90 states had adopted laws on freedom of and/or access to information. the proportion of countries with national human rights institutions has doubled over the past 15 years, reaching 35.5 per cent by the end of 2015. the share of such institutions that are compliant with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (paris principles) (adopted by the general assembly in its resolution 48/134) was highest in developed regions (46 per cent) and in latin america and the caribbean (41 per cent).
