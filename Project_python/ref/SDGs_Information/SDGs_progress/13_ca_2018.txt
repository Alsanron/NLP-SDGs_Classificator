the year 2017 was one of the three warmest on record and was 1.1 degrees celsius above the pre industrial period. an analysis by the world meteorological organization shows that the five year average global temperature from 2013 to 2017 was also the highest on record. the world continues to experience rising sea levels, extreme weather conditions (the north atlantic hurricane season was the costliest ever recorded) and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. this calls for urgent and accelerated action by countries as they implement their commitments to the paris agreement on climate change. as of 9 april 2018, 175 parties had ratified the paris agreement and 168 parties (167 countries plus the european commission) had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the united nations framework convention on climate change secretariat. in addition, as of 9 april 2018, 10 developing countries had successfully completed and submitted the first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change. developed country parties continue to make progress towards the goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions. the number of deaths attributed to natural disasters continues to rise, despite progress in implementing disaster risk reduction strategies. from 1990 to 2015, more than 1.6 million people died in internationally reported natural disasters. many countries have begun implementing national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. in 2014 2015, most reporting countries indicated that environmental impact assessments, legislation on protected areas, climate change adaptation projects and programmes, and integrated planning played a major role in reducing underlying risk factors.
