the world is making good progress on increasing access to electricity and improving energy efficiency. however, millions of people throughout the world still lack such access, and progress on facilitating access to clean cooking fuels and technologies is too slow. the pandemic has highlighted the need for reliable and affordable electricity in health centres. in addition, a survey conducted in selected developing countries revealed that one quarter of the health facilities surveyed were not electrified, and another quarter had unscheduled outages, affecting their capacity to deliver essential health services. such deficiencies weaken the health system’s response to the current health crisis. the global electrification rate rose, from 83 per cent in 2010 to 90 per cent by 2018. latin america and the caribbean and eastern and south eastern asia maintained strong progress, exceeding 98 per cent access to electricity by 2018. however, the world’s deficit was increasingly concentrated in sub saharan africa, where some 548 million persons, or 53 per cent of the population, lacked access to electricity. access to clean cooking fuels and technologies increased to 63 per cent in 2018, from 60 per cent in 2015 and 56 per cent in 2010. still, 2.8 billion persons lacked such access and relied primarily on inefficient and polluting cooking systems. because of the stagnant rate and rapid population growth, in sub saharan africa, the number of people without access to clean fuels for cooking increased. the renewable energy share of total final energy consumption gradually increased, from 16.3 per cent in 2010 to 17.0 per cent in 2015 and 17.3 per cent in 2017. much faster growth is required to meet long term climate goals.
