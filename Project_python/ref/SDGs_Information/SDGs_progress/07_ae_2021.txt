global primary energy intensity (the energy used per unit of gdp) improved by 2.2 per cent annually, from 5.2 per cent in 2015 to 5.0 per cent in 2017, but was still short of the 2.7 per cent annual rate needed to reach target 7.3. international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy reached $21.4 billion in 2017, 13 per cent higher than in 2016 and a twofold increase from flows committed in 2010. hydropower projects received 46 per cent of 2017 flows, while solar projects received 19 per cent, wind 7 per cent and geothermal 6 per cent. despite significant progress over the past decade on improving access to electricity, increasing renewable energy use in the electricity sector and improving energy efficiency, the world is still falling short in providing affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. clean and sustainable energy should be at the heart of the covid 19 response and of efforts to combat climate change. global access to electricity increased from 83 per cent in 2010 to 90 per cent in 2019, with an increase in average annual electrification of 0.876 percentage points. the global access deficit decreased from 1.22 billion in 2010 to 759 million in 2019. despite the significant effort made, there may still be as many as 660 million people without access worldwide in 2030. in addition, the covid 19 pandemic will impede progress on future electrification. in 2019, 66 per cent of the global population had access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. for the period 2010â€“2019, most of the increases in such access occurred in the most populous low  and middle income countries and territories: brazil, china, india, indonesia and pakistan. people reliant on polluting fuels and technologies are exposed to high levels of household air pollution with serious consequences for their cardiovascular and respiratory systems, increasing their vulnerability to diseases including the covid 19 virus.
