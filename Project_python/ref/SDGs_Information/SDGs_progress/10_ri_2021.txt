before the pandemic, modest gains had been made in the reduction of inequality in certain areas, for example, reducing income inequality in some countries and territories, continuing preferential trade status for lower income countries and territories and decreasing transaction costs for remittances. however, inequality persists, whether in relation to income, wealth, opportunity or other dimensions. the pandemic is exacerbating existing inequalities within and among countries and territories and hitting the most vulnerable people and the poorest countries and territories hardest, and is likely to delay the progress of the poorest countries and territories on the goals by a full 10 years. globally, the number of refugees reached its highest level on record in 2020. even with strict covid 19 related restrictions on mobility around the world, thousands of migrants died on their migratory journey. according to estimates of the international monetary fund, the covid 19 pandemic would increase the average gini index for emerging market and developing economies by more than 6 per cent, with an even larger impact predicted for lowincome countries and territories. data from 44 countries and territories for the period 2014â€“2020 show that almost one in five people reported having personally experienced discrimination on at least one of the grounds prohibited under international human rights law. moreover, women were more likely to be victims of discrimination than men. the health and socioeconomic situations of many groups already experiencing higher levels of discrimination have been further affected by the pandemic.
