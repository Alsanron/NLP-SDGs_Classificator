after three years of stability, global carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion started to rise again in 2017, reaching 32.8 billion tons, underpinned by economic growth and a slowdown in efficiency improvements. however, the intensity of global carbon dioxide emissions has declined by nearly one quarter since 2000, showing a general decoupling of carbon dioxide emissions from gdp growth. the same trend was visible in manufacturing industries after 2010, with global manufacturing intensity falling at an average annual rate of 3 per cent until 2017. globally, investment in research and development as a proportion of gdp increased, from 1.5 per cent in 2000 to 1.7 per cent in 2015, and remained almost unchanged in 2017, but was only less than 1 per cent in developing regions. the number of researchers per 1 million inhabitants increased, from 1,018 in 2010 to 1,198 in 2017, ranging widely, from 3,707 in europe and northern america to only 99 in sub saharan africa. in addition, women represented only 30 per cent of global researchers. total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing countries reached $61 billion in 2018, an increase of 32.6 per cent in real terms from 2010. the main sectors assisted were transport ($22.8 billion) and energy ($20.3 billion). the share of medium high and high technology goods in world manufacturing production reached nearly 45 per cent in 2017. medium high and high technology products continued to dominate manufacturing production in developed regions, reaching 49 per cent in 2017, compared with 9 per cent in least developed countries. nearly the entire world population lives in an area covered by a mobile network. it is estimated that, in 2019, 96.5 per cent thereof was covered by at least a 2g network, with 81.8 per cent covered by at least a long term evolution network.
