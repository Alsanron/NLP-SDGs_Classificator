small scale industries have been significantly affected by the pandemic, and many continue to face existential challenges. according to survey data for the period from 2006 to 2020, 29.3 per cent of small scale entrepreneurs benefited from loans or lines of credit before the crisis, with some regional differences. only 15.7 per cent of small scale industries in sub saharan africa received those forms of credit, compared to 44 per cent in latin america and the caribbean. global carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion declined slightly in 2019 from a historic high of 33.5 billion tons in 2018, owing mainly to changes in power sources in advanced economies and milder weather conditions across the continents. global carbon dioxide emissions from manufacturing continued their decline since 2014 and accounted for 5.9 billion tons in 2018. although the world experienced a remarkable drop in carbon dioxide emissions as a result of national lockdowns and travel restrictions in 2020, most economies are likely to resume their usual levels of carbon dioxide emissions as soon as the lockdown measures are lifted. the proportion of global gdp invested in research and development rose at a satisfactory pace, from 1.61 per cent in 2010 to 1.73 per cent in 2018. however, countries and territories in most of the developing regions fell short of the world average, some spending less than 1 per cent of gdp on research and development. steady progress has been made in the manufacturing industry. to achieve inclusive and sustainable industrialization, competitive economic forces need to be unleashed to generate employment and income, facilitate international trade and enable the efficient use of resources.
