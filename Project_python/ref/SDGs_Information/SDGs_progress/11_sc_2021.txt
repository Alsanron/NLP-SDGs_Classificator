rapid urbanization has resulted in a growing number of slum dwellers, inadequate and overburdened infrastructure and services and worsening air pollution. the pandemic will hit the hardest the more than 1 billion slum dwellers worldwide, who suffer from a lack of adequate housing, no running water at home, shared toilets, few or no waste management systems, overcrowded public transport and limited access to formal health care facilities. many in that population work in the informal sector and are at high risk of losing their livelihood as cities shut down. before the pandemic, cities had rising numbers of slum dwellers, worsening air pollution, minimal open public spaces and limited convenient access to public transport. the direct and indirect impacts of the covid 19 pandemic are making it even more unlikely that this goal will be achieved, with more people forced to live in slums, where quality of life is deteriorating and vulnerability increasing. the number of slum dwellers has continued to grow over the years, exceeding 1 billion in 2018. slum dwellers are most prevalent in the three regions of eastern and south eastern asia (370 million), sub saharan africa (238 million) and central and southern asia (226 million). according to data from 2019 for 610 cities in 95 countries and territories, about half of the urban population has convenient access to public transport, defined as living within a walking distance of 500 metres to low capacity transport systems, such as buses or trams, and 1,000 metres to high capacity systems, such as trains and ferries. as a result of the covid 19 response measures imposed in countries and territories throughout 2020, access to public transport in cities worldwide was significantly disrupted, from partial closures and reduced capacities to total closure of networks.
