despite progress, the world failed to meet the millennium development goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015. in 2013, the latest year for which data are available, 59 million children of primary school age were out of school. estimates show that, among those 59 million children, 1 in 5 of those children had dropped out and recent trends suggest that 2 in 5 of out of school children will never set foot in a classroom. the sustainable development goals clearly recognize that this gap must be closed, even as the international community more explicitly addresses the challenges of quality and equity. measuring learning achievement, starting in the early grades, will help to identify where schools are failing to meet their commitments to children and to formulate appropriate remedial action. for example, data for 2013 from 15 latin american countries show that in six countries, fewer than 50 per cent of third graders had a minimum level of proficiency in mathematics; in three countries, fewer than half were proficient in reading. at the end of primary school, children should be able to read and write and to understand and use basic concepts in mathematics. however, in 2014, between 40 per cent and 90 per cent of children failed to achieve even minimum levels of proficiency in reading, in 10 african countries, and in nine of those countries, between 40 per cent and 90 per cent of children failed to achieve minimum levels of proficiency in mathematics.
