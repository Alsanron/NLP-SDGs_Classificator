Progress in reducing inequality within and among countries has been mixed. The voices of developing countries still need to be strengthened in decisio n-making forums of international economic and financial institutions. Moreover, while remittances can be a lifeline for families and communities of international migrant workers in their countries of origin, the high cost of transferring money continues to reduce such benefits. From 2008 to 2013, the per capita income or consumption of the poorest 40 per cent of the population improved more rapidly than the national average in 49 of 83 countries (accounting for three quarters of the world’s population) with data. The International Monetary Fund, through its recent quota reform, has increased the share of developing countries’ vote (defined as countries in developing regions, according to the M49 classification) to 37 per cent in 2016, up from 33 per cent in 2010. That increase is still short of the 74 per cent they represent in the membership. While the World Bank reforms of 2010 are still being implemented, that effort has not changed the 38 per cent share of voting rights at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development that developing countries have held since 2000. The proportion of products exported by least developed countries, developing regions and small island developing States that could enter international markets free of duty increased, from 66 to 67.4 per cent, 51.1 to 52.1 per cent and 65.4 to 66.5 per cent, respectively, from 2017 to 2018. In 2018, total resource flows for development to developing countries from Development Assistance Committee donors, multilateral agencies and other key providers were $271 billion, of which $166 billion were ODA.
