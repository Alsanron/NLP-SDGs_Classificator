atmospheric concentrations of the major greenhouse gases continued to increase despite the temporary reduction in emissions in 2020 related to measures taken in response to the covid 19 pandemic. the six years from 2015 to 2020 are likely to be the warmest on record. climate change is making the achievement of many goals less likely. to limit global warming to 1.5â°c above pre industrial levels in accordance with the paris agreement, the world would need to achieve net zero carbon dioxide emissions by around 2050. as of april 2020, 118 countries and territories had reported the development and adoption of national or local disaster risk reduction strategies, an increase from 48 countries and territories in the first year of the sendai framework. as at 31 december 2020, 190 parties (189 countries and territories plus the european union) had communicated their first nationally determined contribution to the united nations framework convention on climate change, of which 44 were least developed countries and 40 were small island developing states. a further 48 countries and territories, of which one is a least developed country and five are small island developing states, have also communicated a second or updated nationally determined contribution. of these 48 countries and territories, 39 included adaptation information in their new or updated contribution. the nationally determined contributions demonstrate that countries and territories are articulating more quantified targets and indicators for adaptation and identifying links between adaptation, the goals and other frameworks.
