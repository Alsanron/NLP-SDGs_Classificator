unfortunately, a low value for this ratio is not necessarily an indication that urban dwellers are faring well, as this can indicate a prevalence of overcrowded slums. unplanned urban sprawl undermines other determinants of sustainable development. for example, for every 10 per cent increase in sprawl, there is a 5.7 per cent increase in per capita carbon dioxide emissions and a 9.6 per cent increase in per capita hazardous pollution. this illustrates the important interlinkages across the goals and targets. likewise, managing solid waste is often problematic in densely populated areas. in fact, in many developing regions, less than half of solid waste is safely disposed of. as per capita waste generation continues to rise, the collection and safe disposal of solid waste will continue to require serious attention. urban air pollution also challenged cities around the world, causing illness and millions of premature deaths annually. in 2014, around half the global urban population was exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times higher than maximum standards set by the world health organization. the quest for sustainable and coordinated urban development starts with national policies and regional development plans. as of 2015, 142 countries had a national urban policy in place or under development. those countries are home to 75 per cent of the worldâ€™s urban population.
