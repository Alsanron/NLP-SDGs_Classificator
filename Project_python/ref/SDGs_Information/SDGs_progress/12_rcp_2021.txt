global fossil fuel subsidies amounted to more than $400 billion in 2018. the continued prevalence of such subsidies, more than double the estimated subsidies for renewables, adversely affects the task of achieving an early peak in global carbon dioxide emissions. for decades, scientists have been explaining the ways in which humanity is driving the three planetary crises of climate, biodiversity and pollution, all of which are linked to unsustainable production and consumption. changes in consumption and production patterns can help to promote the decoupling of economic growth and human well being from resource use and environmental impact. they can also trigger the transformations envisaged in global commitments on biodiversity, the climate, and sustainable development in general. the covid 19 pandemic provides a window of opportunity for exploring more inclusive and equitable development models that are underpinned by sustainable consumption and production. from 2017 to 2020, 83 countries, territories and the european union shared information on their contribution to the implementation of the 10 year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production patterns. in 2020, 136 policies and 27 implementation activities were reported, bringing the total number to over 700. while specific actions have been taken to improve resource use efficiency in a specific industry or area, this has not resulted in their widespread adoption across sectors and industries. data indicate a rise of almost 40 per cent in the global material footprint per capita, from 8.8 metric tons in 2000 to 12.2 metric tons in 2017. similarly, domestic material consumption per capita increased by more than 40 per cent, from 8.7 metric tons in 2000 to 12.2 metric tons in 2017. although limited data are available, as of 2016, almost 14 per cent of food produced globally was lost before reaching the retail sector. estimates vary across regions, from 20.7 per cent in central and southern asia to 5.8 per cent in australia and new zealand.
