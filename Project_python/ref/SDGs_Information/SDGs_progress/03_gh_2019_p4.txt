The probability of dying from any of the four main non-communicable diseases – cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes – between the ages of 30 and 70 was 18 per cent in 2016. The risk remains markedly higher for men globally, at 21.6 per cent, compared with 15 per cent for women.
Progress has been made in reducing the global suicide rate (from 12.9 per 100,000 in 2000 to 10.6 per 100,000 in 2016). However, suicide remains the second-highest cause of death among people aged 15 to 29 globally, with 79 per cent of suicides found in low- and middle-income countries in 2016.
The prevalence of tobacco use declined from 27 per cent in 2000 to 20 per cent in 2016. Prevalence fell faster for women, from 11 per cent in 2000 to 6 per cent in 2016, compared with men: prevalence in men only fell from 43 per cent to 34 per cent. Despite the positive trends, the number of people dying from a tobacco-related illness was estimated to be more than 8.1 million in 2017.
The number of road traffic deaths climbed from 1.31 million in 2013 to 1.35 million in 2016. Road traffic injury is the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5 to 29.
Air pollution, both ambient and household, increases the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disease and, in 2016, led to some 7 million deaths worldwide. Sub-Saharan Africa and most of Asia and Oceania (excluding Australia/New Zealand) have the highest mortality rates associated with air pollution, as a large proportion of the population still rely on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking.
Inadequate and unsafe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene is linked to 60 per cent of the disease burden from diarrhoea, 100 per cent of the burden from infections with soil-transmitted helminths and 16 per cent of the burden from protein-energy malnutrition, leading to a total of 870,000 deaths in 2016 from the three conditions.
Health systems and funding
Official development assistance (ODA) for basic health from all donors increased by 61 per cent in real terms since 2010 and reached $10.7 billion in 2017. In 2017, some $2.0 billion was spent on malaria control, $1.0 billion on tuberculosis control and $2.3 billion on other infectious diseases, excluding HIV/AIDS.
Available data from 2013 to 2018 indicate that close to 40 per cent of all countries had fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10,000 people, and more than 55 per cent had fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000 people. All least developed countries had fewer than 10 medical doctors and fewer than 5 dentists and 5 pharmacists per 10,000 people, and 98 per cent had fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000 people.
