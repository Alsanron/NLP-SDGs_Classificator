the probability of dying from any of the four main non communicable diseases – cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes – between the ages of 30 and 70 was 18 per cent in 2016. the risk remains markedly higher for men globally, at 21.6 per cent, compared with 15 per cent for women. progress has been made in reducing the global suicide rate (from 12.9 per 100,000 in 2000 to 10.6 per 100,000 in 2016). however, suicide remains the second highest cause of death among people aged 15 to 29 globally, with 79 per cent of suicides found in low  and middle income countries in 2016. the prevalence of tobacco use declined from 27 per cent in 2000 to 20 per cent in 2016. prevalence fell faster for women, from 11 per cent in 2000 to 6 per cent in 2016, compared with men: prevalence in men only fell from 43 per cent to 34 per cent. despite the positive trends, the number of people dying from a tobacco related illness was estimated to be more than 8.1 million in 2017. the number of road traffic deaths climbed from 1.31 million in 2013 to 1.35 million in 2016. road traffic injury is the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5 to 29. air pollution, both ambient and household, increases the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disease and, in 2016, led to some 7 million deaths worldwide. sub saharan africa and most of asia and oceania (excluding australia/new zealand) have the highest mortality rates associated with air pollution, as a large proportion of the population still rely on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking.
