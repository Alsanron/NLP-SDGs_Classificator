in the most extreme cases, such violence can lead to death. in 2012, almost half of all women who were victims of intentional homicide worldwide were killed by an intimate partner or family member, compared to 6 per cent of male victims. child marriage is declining, but not fast enough. around 2000, nearly 1 in 3 women between 20 and 24 years of age reported that they were married before 18 years of age. around 2015, the ratio was just over 1 in 4. the decline is driven by an even steeper reduction in the marriage rate among girls under 15 years of age during that period. the harmful practice of female genital mutilation/cutting has declined by 24 per cent since around 2000. nevertheless, prevalence remains high in some of the 30 countries with representative data. in those countries, survey data from around 2015 indicate that more than 1 in 3 girls between 15 and 19 years of age have undergone the procedure compared to nearly 1 in 2 girls around 2000. the average amount of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is more than threefold higher for women than men, according to survey data from 83 countries and areas. available data indicate that time spent on domestic chores accounts for a large proportion of the gender gap in unpaid work. globally, women’s participation in single or lower houses of national parliaments reached 23.4 per cent in 2017, just 10 percentage points higher than in 2000. such slow progress suggests that stronger political commitment and more ambitious measures and quotas are needed to boost women’s political participation and empowerment.
