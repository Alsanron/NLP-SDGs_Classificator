social protections have expanded globally since 2000, as many developing countries adopted policies that afford protection for multiple contingencies. pension coverage in particular is expanding rapidly. over half (51 per cent) of people above retirement age received a pension according to data available for the period from 2010 to 2012. almost all countries have child or maternity benefit programmes, and cash transfer schemes are increasing. despite progress over the past decade, increasing social protection for those most in need remains a priority. globally, 18,000 children still die each day from poverty related causes, and only 28 per cent of employed women are effectively protected through contributory and non contributory maternity cash benefits. most poor people remain outside social protection systems, especially in low income countries. of the entire population, only 1 out of 5 receive any type of social protection in low income countries, compared with 2 out of 3 in upper middle income countries. the coverage gap is particularly acute in sub saharan africa and southern asia, where most of the worldâ€™s poorest people live. in sub saharan africa, only 15 per cent of those in the bottom income quintile have access to a social protection benefit. disaster risk reduction is essential to ending poverty and fostering sustainable development. disaster risk is disproportionally higher in poorer countries with weaker institutions. in low  and lower middle income countries experiencing rapid economic growth, the exposure of people and assets to natural hazards is increasing at a faster pace than that at which risk reducing capacities are being strengthened, leading to increased disaster risk.
