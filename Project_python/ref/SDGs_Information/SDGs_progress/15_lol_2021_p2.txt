in 2020, an average of 43 per cent of each terrestrial key biodiversity area, 42 per cent of each freshwater key biodiversity area, and 41 per cent of each mountain key biodiversity area were within protected areas, an increase of 13 to14 percentage points since 2000. as of february 2021, 127 countries and territories had committed to setting voluntary targets for achieving land degradation neutrality, and 68 countries and territories had already officially endorsed their targets. overall, commitments to la nd restoration are estimated to amount to 1 billion hectares, of which 450 million hectares are covered by commitments through land degradation neutrality targets. data based on satellite imagery reveal that green coverage (forests, grasslands, croplands and wetlands) of the worldâ€™s mountains remained steady at about 73 per cent between 2000 and 2018. green cover tends to be greater in mountain areas that are less than 2,500 metres above sea level. however, mountain green cover varies considerably across geographical regions, ranging from 100 per cent in oceania to 68 per cent in northern africa and western asia. globally, the risk of species extinction has increased by about 10 per cent over the past three decades. the red list index, which ranges from a value of 1 to indicate no risk of extinction to a value of 0 to indicate the extinction of all species, decreased from 0.81 in 1993 to 0.73 in 2021. as at 1 february 2021, 128 countries, territories and the european union had ratified the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization to the convention on biological diversity, which is an increase of 60 countries and territories since 2016, and 67 countries, territories and the european union have shared information on their nagoya protocol frameworks.
