Notwithstanding positive signs of reducing inequality in some dimensions, such as a reduction of relative income inequality in some countries and preferential trade status benefiting lower-income countries, inequality still persists in all forms. The COVID-19 crisis is hitting the poorest and most vulnerable people and countries the hardest and threatens to have a particularly damaging impact on the poorest countries. It is exposing the profound inequalities that exist within and among countries and is exacerbating those inequalities.
In 73 of the 90 countries with comparable data during the period 2012–2017, the bottom 40 per cent of the population saw its incomes grow. Moreover, in slightly more than half of those countries, the bottom 40 per cent experienced a growth rate in income that was higher than the overall national average. Still, in all countries with data, the bottom 40 per cent of the population received less than 25 per cent of the overall income or consumption, while the top 10 per cent received at least 20 per cent of the income.
Data from 31 countries over the period 2014–2019 show that one in five persons reported having personally experienced discrimination on at least one ground of discrimination prohibited by international human rights law. The pandemic risks exacerbating those patterns.
