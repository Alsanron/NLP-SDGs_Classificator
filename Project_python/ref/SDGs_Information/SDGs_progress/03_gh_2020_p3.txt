in 2018, an estimated 10 million persons fell ill with tuberculosis (89 per cent were adults, 63 per cent were men and 8.6 per cent were people living with hiv). the incidence of tuberculosis declined, from 141 new and relapse cases per 100,000 persons in 2015 to 132 in 2018. the tuberculosis mortality rate among hiv negative people fell by 8.3 per cent in the same period. however, large gaps in detection and treatment persist, and the current pace of progress is not fast enough to meet the target of ending the epidemic by 2030. drug resistant tuberculosis is also a continuing threat. after many years of impressive reductions in the global malaria burden, progress has stalled. globally, malaria incidence (the number of cases per 1,000 persons) fell, from 81 in 2000 to 57 in 2014, and remained at a similar level throughout 2018. the world is not on a trajectory to achieve the sustainable development goal target of ending malaria. the use of the hepatitis b vaccine in infants has reduced the incidence of new chronic hepatitis b virus infections considerably. the proportion of children under 5 years of age who became chronically infected fell, from 4.7 per cent in the pre vaccine era to 0.9 per cent in 2018. in 2018, 1.76 billion persons were reported to have required mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases, down from 1.80 billion in 2015 and 2.19 billion in 2010. the 530 million persons requiring treatment and care in least developed countries represented 52 per cent of the population of those countries, down from 78 per cent in 2010.
