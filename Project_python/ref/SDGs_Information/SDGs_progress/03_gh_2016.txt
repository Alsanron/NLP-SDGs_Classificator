goal 3 seeks to ensure health and well being for all, at every stage of life. the goal addresses all major health priorities, including reproductive, maternal and child health; communicable, non communicable and environmental diseases; universal health coverage; and access for all to safe, effective, quality and affordable medicines and vaccines. it also calls for more research and development, increased health financing, and strengthened capacity of all countries in health risk reduction and management. between 2000 and 2015, the global maternal mortality ratio, or number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, declined by 37 per cent, to an estimated ratio of 216 per 100,000 live births in 2015. almost all maternal deaths occur in low resource settings and can be prevented. globally, 3 out of 4 births were assisted by skilled health care personnel in 2015. under five mortality rates fell rapidly from 2000 to 2015, declining by 44 per cent globally. nevertheless, an estimated 5.9 million children under the age of 5 died in 2015, with a global under five mortality rate of 43 per 1,000 live births. the neonatal mortality rate, that is, the likelihood of dying in the first 28 days of life, declined from 31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 19 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. over that period, progress in the rate of child survival among children aged 1 to 59 months outpaced advances in reducing neonatal mortality; as a result, neonatal deaths now represent a larger share (45 per cent) of all under five deaths.
