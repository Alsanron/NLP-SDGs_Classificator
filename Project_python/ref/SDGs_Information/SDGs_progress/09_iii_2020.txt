global growth in manufacturing had already steadily declined even before the outbreak. the pandemic is hitting manufacturing industries hard and causing disruptions in global value chains and the supply of products. the air transport sector has been hit the hardest by the pandemic. it is forecasted that airlines will have 1.5 billion fewer international air travellers in 2020 and that international seat capacity could fall by almost three quarters, resulting in a $273 billion loss, compared with previously expected gross operating revenues. in 2019, manufacturing value added grew only 1.5 per cent since 2018, the slowest year on year growth rate since 2012, influenced primarily by tariff and trade tensions affecting all regions. manufacturing activities are at high risk of disruption during the current crisis, which will have an impact on the sector’s employment levels. the share of manufacturing in gdp in least developed countries increased, from 10 per cent in 2010 to 12.4 per cent in 2019, but the growth rate was too slow for the target, doubling the industry’s share in gdp by 2030, to be reached. in 2019, 14 per cent of the world’s workers were employed in manufacturing activities, a figure that has not changed much since 2000. the share of manufacturing employment was the largest in eastern and south eastern asia (18 per cent) and the smallest in sub saharan africa (6 per cent). according to surveys covering the period from 2010 to the present, in developing countries, 34 per cent of small scale industries benefit from loans or lines of credit, which enable them to integrate into local and global value chains. however, only 22 per cent of small scale industries in sub saharan africa received loans or lines of credit, compared with 48 per cent in latin america and the caribbean.
