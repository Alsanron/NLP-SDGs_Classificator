economic losses from internationally reported disasters, principally large scale disasters, have grown steadily since 1990, reaching an estimated annual average of $200 billion in 2013. reported damage to housing, schools and health care facilities, along with agricultural production, shows statistically significant upward trends from 1990 onwards. despite the fact that the global poverty rate has been halved since 2000, intensified efforts are required to boost the incomes, alleviate the suffering and build the resilience of those individuals still living in extreme poverty, in particular in sub saharan africa. social protection systems need to be expanded and risks need to be mitigated for disaster prone countries, which also tend to be the most impoverished. in 2013, an estimated 767 million people lived below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day — down from 1.7 billion people in 1999. that figure reflects a decrease in the global poverty rate from 28 per cent in 1999 to 11 per cent in 2013. the most significant progress was seen in eastern and southeastern asia, where the rate declined from 35 per cent in 1999 to 3 per cent in 2013. in contrast, 42 per cent of people in sub saharan africa continued to subsist in conditions of extreme poverty in 2013. in 2016, just under 10 per cent of the world’s workers were living with their families on less than $1.90 per person per day, down from 28 per cent in 2000. in the least developed countries, nearly 38 per cent of workers in 2016 were living below the poverty line.
