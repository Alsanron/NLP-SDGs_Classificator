today, in the 30 countries, for which data were available, around 1 in 3 girls aged 15 to 19 have undergone the practice, versus 1 in 2 in the mid 1980s. in every region, women and girls do the bulk of unpaid work, including caregiving and such household tasks as cooking and cleaning. on average, women report that they spend 19 per cent of their time each day in unpaid activities, versus 8 per cent for men. the responsibilities of unpaid care and domestic work, combined with paid work, means greater total work burdens for women and girls and less time for rest, self care, learning and other activities. globally, womenâ€™s participation in parliament rose to 23 per cent in 2016, representing an increase by 6 percentage points over a decade. slow progress in this area is in contrast with more women in parliamentary leadership positions. in 2016, the number of women speakers of national parliaments jumped from 43 to 49 (out of the 273 posts globally); women accounted for 18 per cent of all speakers of parliament in january 2016. gender inequality persists worldwide, depriving women and girls of their basic rights and opportunities. achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls will require more vigorous efforts, including legal frameworks, to counter deeply rooted gender based discrimination that often results from patriarchal attitudes and related social norms. on the basis of data from 2005 to 2016 for 87 countries, 19 per cent of women between 15 and 49 years of age said they had experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner in the 12 months prior to the survey.
