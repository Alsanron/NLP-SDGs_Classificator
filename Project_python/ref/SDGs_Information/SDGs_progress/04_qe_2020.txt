at the end of 2019, millions of children and young people were still out of school, and more than half of those in school were not meeting minimum proficiency standards in reading and numeracy. the closure of schools to slow the spread of covid 19 is having an adverse impact on learning outcomes and the social and behavioural development of children and young people. it has affected more than 90 per cent of the world’s student population, 1.5 billion children and young people. although remote learning is provided to many students, children and young people in vulnerable and disadvantaged communities, such as those living in remote areas, extreme poverty, fragile states and refugee camps, do not have the same access thereto. the digital divide will widen existing gaps in equality with regard to education. in 74 countries with comparable data for the 2011–2019 period, around 7 in 10 children 3 and 4 years of age were on track developmentally in at least three of the following domains: literacy numeracy, physical development, social emotional development and learning. participation in organized learning one year before the official primary age of entry grew steadily, from 62 per cent in 2010 to 67 per cent in 2018. however, variation among countries is still wide, with values ranging from 9 to nearly 100 per cent. the primary school completion rate reached 84 per cent in 2018, up from 70 per cent in 2000.
