the year 2019 was the second warmest on record and the end of the warmest decade, 2010 to 2019. in addition, with a global average temperature of 1.1â°c above estimated pre industrial levels, the global community is far off track to meet either the 1.5 or 2â°c targets called for in the paris agreement. although greenhouse gas emissions are projected to drop by 6 per cent in 2020, and air quality has improved as a result of travel bans and the economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic, the improvement is only temporary. governments and businesses should utilize the lessons learned to accelerate the transitions needed to achieve the paris agreement, redefine the relationship with the environment and make systemic shifts and transformational changes to lower greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilient economies and societies. a total of 85 countries have reported having a national disaster risk reduction strategy aligned with the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 2015â€“2030 to some extent since its adoption in 2015. in 2018, 55 countries reported that at least some of their local governments had a local disaster risk reduction strategy aimed at contributing to sustainable development and strengthening socioeconomic health and environmental resilience by focusing on poverty eradication, urban resilience and climate change adaptation. the preparation of national adaptation programmes of action under the united nations framework convention on climate change is helping the least developed countries address urgent and immediate needs, with support from the least developed countries fund and the least developed countries expert group. in addition, the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action will help the least developed countries prepare and seek funding for comprehensive national adaptation plans, thereby reducing their risk of being left behind.
