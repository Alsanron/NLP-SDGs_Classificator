the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal, the rotterdam convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade and the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants established international frameworks to achieve the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes, chemicals and persistent organic pollutants. with six exceptions, all member states are party to at least one of those conventions. the number of parties to those conventions rose significantly from 2005 to 2015, particularly in africa and oceania. there are now 183 parties to the basel convention, 180 to the stockholm convention and 155 to the rotterdam convention. decoupling economic growth from resource use is one of the most critical and complex challenges facing humanity today. doing so effectively will require policies that create a conducive environment for such change, social and physical infrastructure and markets, and a profound transformation of business practices along global value chains. the per capita material footprint of developing countries grew from 5 metric tons in 2000 to 9 metric tons in 2017, representing a significant improvement in the material standard of living. most of the increase is attributed to a rise in the use of non metallic minerals, pointing to growth in the areas of infrastructure and construction. for all types of materials, developed countries have at least double the per capita footprint of developing countries. in particular, the material footprint for fossil fuels is more than four times higher for developed than developing countries.
