0,five peptides containing tyrosine were converted to the aminotyrosyl peptides by nitration with TNM and subseuqent reduction of the nitro groups to amino groups the fluorescence of these aminotyrosyl residues was found to be quite similar to that of aminotyrosine and it is concluded that the fluorescence is not CS to incorporation of the CAA into the peptide chain fluorescence of aminotyrosine derivatives was sensitive however to the nature of the solvent as the dielectric constant decreased fluorescence was enhanced ten fold and the emission maximum shifted from the nm value in AQ solution to nm it is predicted that similar differences might be expected for exposed and buried aminotyrosyl residues in a protein exposed tyrosyl residues on the helical protein tropomyosin and a helical segment of paramyosin were aminated in part and of the total tyrosyl residues respectively the fluorescence of the aminated tyrosyl residues on these proteins was similar to that of the aminotyrosyl MMP in an aqueous medium although the fluorescence efficiency of an aminotyrosyl residue was much lower than that of a tyrosyl residue it was easy to distinguish the fluorescence of the aminotyrosyl residues nm on the protein from that arising from unmodified tyrosyl residues nm
1,this T0 has investigated the relationship between duodenogastric reflux gastritis and certain PS months T3 three operations for uncomplicated duodenal ulcer the operations studied were proximal gastric vagotomy pgv cases TV and pyloroplasty tvp cases and TV and antrectomy tva cases duodenogastric reflux was assessed both by a radiological technique and by measuring the concentration of bilirubin in the gastric aspirate before and after operation incidence and severity of postoperative gastritis were determined by endoscopic biopsy PS were assessed by symptomatic score and visick grading there was a significant correlation between duodenal reflux and histological evidence of both severe SG and glandular atrophy p less than there was also a close association between the degree of reflux and the presence of severe heartburn epigastric pain and bile vomiting after operation the amount of reflux did not differ before T0 there was significantly less reflux following pgv than after either tvp p less than or tva p less than the results indicate that an operation which preserves an innervated and IN antrum and pylorus will protect against postoperative duodenogastric reflux gastritis and symptoms

3,the ionization and phase behavior of dipalmitoylsnglycerophosphoserine have been investigated under a variety of condtions by several different methods as measured by turbidity changes the temperature of the crystalliquid crystal phase transition of this lipid is influenced by ph and mono and divalent cation concentrations the phtransition temperature curve is congruent with the curve relating temperature to the degree of ionization of the carboxyl group of the crystalline form the transition temperature falls from an upper plateau of degrees c at low ph values where the carboxyl group is fully protonated to a lower plateau of degrees c at high ph values where this group is fully ionized the apparent pk ph at ionization of the crystalline form shifts from to to with an increase of nacl concentration from to to l m respectively these observations are in accord with a simple theoretical analysis that utilizes diffuse double SL theory and the influence of surface potential on surface concentration of protons in qualitative terms an increase in electrolyte concentration reduces the surface potential the result of which is a diminution of the surfacebulk ph difference and a lowering of the apparent pk assuming an area of amolecule the intrinsic pka apparent pk corrected for surface ph of the carboxyl group is a fold change of nacl concentration produces a very C1 change in surface potential without influencing the transition temperature of the ionized form of the lipid
4,the Pyr carboxylase of pseudonomas fluorescens was purified fold from cells grown on gl at degrees c the activity of this purified enzyme was not affected by acetylcoenzyme a or laspartate but was strongly inhibited by adp which was competitive towards atp pyruvate gave a broken double reciprocal plot from which two apparent km values could be determined namely and mm from the lower and the higher concentration ranges respectively the apparent km for hco at ph in the presence of the manganese atp ion mnatp was mm the enzyme reaction had an optimum ph value of or depending on the use of mnatp or mgatp respectively as ATP free mg was an activator at ph values below the enzyme was strongly activated by monovalent cations nh and k were the better activators with apparent ka values of and mm respectively partially purified enzymes from cells grown on glucose at or degrees c had the same properties including the thermal stability in both cases of the CEA was lost after preincubation for min at degrees c the molecular weight was estimated to be about daltons by GF on sephadex g the regulatory properties and molecular weight are thus similar to those determined for the pyruvate carboxylases from pseudomonas citronellolis and azotobacter vinelandii
5,a label for the bilirubin binding sites of human serum albumin was synthesized by reacting mol of woodwards reagent k nethylphenylisoxazoliumsulfonate with mol of bilirubin this yielded a watersoluble derivative in which both carboxyl groups of bilirubin were converted to reactive enol esters covalent labeling was achieved by reacting the label with human SS Al under nitrogen at ph and degrees under the same conditions no CB to the monomers of several proteins could be demonstrated the number of binding CS for bilirubin and the label were found to be the same and competition experiments with bilirubin showed inhibition of covalent labeling the absorption fluorescence and cd spectra of the label in a complex with human serum albumin were similar to those of the bilirubin human SS albumin complex however following covalent attachment to the spectral properties were changed indicating loss of conformational freedom of the chromophore labeling ratios were selected to result in the incorporation of less than mol of labelmol of human serum albumin under these conditions labeling is thought to occur primarily at the high affinity binding site
6,"purified bovine hepatic fructosediphosphatase which exhibits maximal activity at neutral ph is competitively inhibited by several analogs of its ATP fructose diphosphate these include gl diphosphate ki x m hexitol diphosphate ki x m and anhydrodmannitol diphosphate ki x m and 1,5-AG diphosphate ki x m the ki values for both anhydrodmannitol diphosphate and anhydrodglucitol diphosphate are lower than the km of x m for fructose diphosphate since anhydrodmannitol diphosphate is an analog of the beta anomer of fructose diphosphate and anhydrodglucitol diphosphate is an analog of the alpha anomer the lower ki for the mannitol analog may indicate that the beta anomer of fructose diphosphate which predominates in solution is the true substrate the substrate analog pentanediol diphosphate inhibits slightly k x m but cyclohexyldiol diphosphate does not the ki for product inhibition by sodium phosphate is x m anhydrodmannitol diphosphate and alphadglucose diphosphate are substrates at ph but not at ph"
7,the addition of spermine or of spermidine to rat CL CA systems produced marked changes in a number of microsomal drug oxidations the hydroxylation of aniline and the ndemethylation of ethylmorphine were both enhanced with concentrations of mm spermine or of spermidine the results with putrescine on ethylmorphine metabolism were less dramatic and no effect could be observed with putrescine in studies with other drug substrates in contrast to the enhancing effects inhibition was observed when spermine or SD was added to pnitroanisole odemethylation CA mixtures and no effect was observed in assays for acetanilide hydroxylation the inhibiting and enhancing effects of the polyamines can be observed in assays containing liver S9 from both male and female rats and those from rats pretreated with phenobarbital or methylcholanthrene in all studies the alterations were kinetically noncompetitive the effects were shown to be independent of the nadphgenerating system and the cation requirements and were not mediated through an interaction with nadphcytochrome c reductase the possibility is considered that the enhancing and inhibiting effects may be related to the ability of these polycations to bind to microsomal membranes and cause alterations at different sites of substrate interaction
8,the synergistic effects of four SU substitutes polysorbate and five artificial sweeteners were studied in vitro on growth pattern and acid production of seven glucosegrown streptococcus mutans strains representing the five serological groups after bratthall four distinct growth patterns during glucose fermentation were observed high rate of growth with low acid production moderate growth rate with moderate acid production moderate growth rate with high acid production and slow rate of growth with moderate acid production depending on the strain used the final od at nm ranged from to and the final ph of the medium varied between and while added sucrose substitutes with exceptions usually enhanced growth rate most artificial sweeteners suppressed or at higher concentrations even inhibited growth of s mutans addition of polysorbate to the medium always increased growth rate of s mutans significantly the presence of sucrose substitutes during glucose fermentation had no effect on final ph of the medium but addition of artificial sweeteners especially sodium saccharin elevated final ph up to units the observed physiological patterns and differences within the several strains of s mutans during glucose fermentation in vitro do not necessarily relate to the five serological groups of the species
9,the clinical usefulness of propranolol as the sole drug in the preoperative treatment of thyrotoxicosis has been investigated the effect of the drug on the serum levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine has also been studied eight consecutive patients were treated four of these showed good clinical response to propranolol and both pre and postoperative periods were uneventful two patients also showed a good clinical response but developed accentuated thyrotoxic PS in the immediate postoperative period one patient showed no clinical response to propranolol therapy and in one further patient the treatment was discontinued because of discomfort all glands were resected without technical difficulty they were more vascular and friable after this therapy than T3 pretreatment with antithyroid drugs and thyroxine the serum levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine decreased during propranolol treatment it is concluded that treatment with propranolol as a sole preoperative drug might be used as an alternative only in cases where conventional therapy is not suitable
10,a doubleblind study with intraindividual comparisons was carried out to investigate the effects of mg of ralphahydroxyisopropylalphahtropanium bromidetropate sch mg sch mg OX mg oxazepam and PL with p.o. in randomized sequence on gastric juice volume amount of acid concentration and ph values in healthy volunteers the secretion parameters were measured during a h basal period and a h stimulation period the gastric juice was obtained in min portions via stomach tube stimulation was effected by mugkgh PG via drip infusion the friedman test was used for the comparative statistical DUE and individual comparisons were carried out by means of the wilcoxon test pairdifferences rank the results show that sch and sch oxazepam were equal in effect on basal and stimulated secretion volume as compared with placebo it was not possible to establish an effect on secretion volume for oxazepam alone sch and sch OX were found to be equipotent in reducing the amount of basal acid while OX reduced this quantity only during the first min of basal secretion none of the three active preparations was capable of inhibiting the stimulated acid although both sch preparations produced a clear trend towards lowered mean values during the basal secretion period all three test S9 had an inhibiting action on acid concentration but none of them had a significant effect during the stimulation period the ph value was savely increased only by sch and sch oxazepam and this even only during the basal period the results are discussed
11,this paper presents the first study of conformational changes in the subfractions of CT h h was fractionated by the method of kincade and cole kincade j m and cole rd j biol chem using a very shallow gdnhc gradient a possible new h subfraction about of the h has been found and characterized by amino acid analysis and electrophoresis the effects of salt concentration and ph on the conformation of each of the four major subfractions have been studied by measuring the fluorescence anisotropy of the tyrosine emission and the circular dichroism cd of the peptide bond upon the addition of salt to aqueous solutions at neutral ph all four subfractions show an instantaneous change in fluorescence anisotropy fluorescence intensity tyrosine absorbance and cd the folding associated with this instantaneous change is highly cooperative and involves the region of the molecule containing the lone tyrosine which becomes buried in the folded form the folding of subfraction a is more sensitive to salt than the other L1 subfractions upon folding approximately of the residues of subfractions b and form alpha and beta structure a and b have approximately of the residues in alpha and beta structures there is no evidence for interactions between the subfractions in saltfree solutions each of the four major subfractions show very little change in conformation in going from low to neutral ph but each shows a very sharp transition near ph this transition gives rise to a marked increase in fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence intensity and involves the formation of both alpha and beta strucute in a manner similar to that of the saltinduced state
12,the effect of somatic afferent c fiber stimulation on regional CBF blood flow rcbf and cerebral tissue available oxygen ao was studied in dogs under chloralose anesthesia mean arterial blood pressure arterial pco and ph were stabilized before and during the min stimulation of the sciatic SN v ms hz combined goldplatinum electrodes were chronically implanted into the VPL of the TH ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and into the VWM tissue ao and rcbf of these regions were measured polarographically the latter by the hgas clearance technique blood flow changed from to ml g per min CVR cvr from to resistance units ru in the TH from to ml g per min cvr from to ru in the hypothalamus and from to ml g per min cvr from to ru in the VWM during ipsilateral stimulation contralateral stimulation of the sciatic nerves caused a more moderate but likewise significant drop in rcbf and an increase in cvr except in the VWM parallel to these changes tissue ao decreased by in the thalamic and by in the Thy area relative to the prestimulation level
13,in acute and chronic experiments investigations were made concerning the effect of clozapine haloperidol sulpiride and carpipramine on mhpg hva and hiaa in rat brain and on motor activity of the animals the activity of the rats treated with clozapine and haloperidol was reduced on the first day after days of treatment this effected of clozapine was significantly diminished the mhpg level increased slightly on the first day of treatment with all four drugs this elevation was maintained after chronic treatment with carpipramine and sulpiride whereas clozapine and haloperidol decreased the mhpg content hiaa values did not show significant changes in acute experiments whereas in chronic ones there was an increase haloperidol and clozapine induced a strong increase of hva which decreased T3 days in those animals treated with haloperidol in comparison to haloperidol T3 clozapine application the percentage of hvaincrease was higher in the limbic system than in the nigrostriatum
14,two forms of bakers yease valyltrna synthetase have been purified to apparent homogeneity by CP methods it was demonstrated that one of the two forms of the enzyme originates from the other by proteolysis the respective amounts of each form depending on the physiological state of the yeast the species mainly isolated from exponential growing yeast cells is a monomer of daltons molecular weight in stationary phase cells or in commercial yeast the major species is a degraded monomer of daltons molecular weight however when the purification is carried out in the presence of phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride or diisopropylfluorophosphate large amounts of the not degreded monomer can be obtained of great practical usefulness is the fact that large amounts of the native enzyme can be obtained pure after only two chromatographic steps on deaecellulose and hydroxylapatite the kinetic constants for valine atp and trnaval were determined as well as the optimum aminoacylation conditions it was found that the TPS activity of the nondegraded valyltrna synthetase is higher than that of the proteolysed enzyme for the aminoacylation reaction on the contrary both forms have the same atppyroposphate exchange activity the amino acids composition of the native enzyme was established the tryptic fingerprints of the two valyltrna synthetases were studied essentially similar maps were obtained the number of the spots in the fingerprints indicates that the enzymes contain a high proportion of RS
15,a cytochrome c derivative from which iron is removed has been prepared and characterized several lines of evidence indicate that native and porphyrin cytochrome c have similar conformations they have similar elution characteristics on sephadex gel chromatography in both proteins the tryptophan fluorescence is quenched and the pk values of protonation of the porphyrin are identical porphyrin cytochrome c does not substitute for native cytochrome c in either the oxidase reaction or in restoring electron transport in cytochromecdepleted mitochondria it does however competitively inhibit native cytochrome c in these reactions the ki for inhibition being larger than the km for reaction the absorption and emission spectra and the polarized excitation spectrum of the porphyrin cytochrome c are characteristic of free base porphyrin the absence of fluorescence quenching of porphyrin cytochrome c when the protein is bound to cytochrome oxidase suggests that heme to heme distance between these proteins is larger than to nm depending upon orientation binding of the porphyrin cytochrome c to phospholipids or to mitochondria increases the FP of a positively polarized absorption band which indicates that the bound form of the protein does not rotate freely within the time scale of relaxation from the excited state
16,it has been shown that particles of vi bacteriophage iii catalyse deacetylation of oacetyl pectic polygalacturonic acid a structural analogue of vi polysaccharide vi antigen using this ATP and determining the acetic acid liberated by gasliquid chromatogrphy a method for the estimation of vi phage deacetylase activity has been developed purified particles of vi phage iii were exposed to a variety of mildly dissociative reagents and conditions and then tested for plaqueforming and for deacetylase activity they have also been inspected under the electron microscope osmotic shock and incubation in the presence of EDTA greater than or equil m or of larginine m were found to cause disintegration of the virions into empty head capsids deoxyribonucleic acid and base plates still carrying the spikes the mixtures of viral fragments exhibited an increased deacetylase activity using zonal sedimentation and ion exchange chromatography the phage fragments obtained by treatment with EDTA have been fractionated and the base plates isolated amongst the viral components these structures showed the highest TPS deacetylase activity they had the shape of sixpointed stars about nm inner and nm outer diam with a central hole or plug approximately nm carrying six spikes roughly cylindrical organelles of approx x nm one at each of the points of the polypeptides of six sizes p about daltons p p p p detected in whole vi phage iii virions by sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis only two p and p were found in the base plates
17,the hepatic disposition of four chlorinated biphenyls was studied in isolated perfused rat CL preparations perfused with rat blood biliary excretion of clabeled chlorobiphenyl cb dichlorobiphenyl cb pentachlorobiphenyl cb and hexachlorobiphenyl cb appeared to be inversely related to increased chlorination each of the EDC was rapidly taken up by the liver from the circulating perfusate T3 hr of perfusion biliary excretion of c from B6 cb B6 and cb was and of total dose respectively for cb this rate of biliary beta represents a maximum perfusatebile ratio of about of the label in the bile from B6 experiments was in the form of metabolites biliary excretion of B6 was biphasic an initial rapid phase t min was followed by a slower second phase t min when the metabolites of cb were added to the perfusate biliary excretion of these metabolites was monophasic t min which corresponded to the slower phase observed when the parent compound was presented to the liver cb disappeared from the perfusate via a biphasic process metabolites of B6 effused into the perfusate immediately after the initial rapid uptake of cb by the CL and the recirculating pool of metabolites was eliminated in the bile by the slow postsynthetic phase of biliary elimination less than of cb was present as the parent compound in the perfusion system after hr of perfusion these findings indicate that the metabolism of B6 is not the limiting factor in the hepatic disposition of B6 and that the circulating metabolites of cb effusing from the CL might be the major source for urinary excretion
18,the cardiovascular effects of halothanenitrous oxide anesthesia and betareceptor blockade with either propranolol or practolol were studied in dogs in which severe myocardial infarction had been induced ten days earlier the hemodynamic responses to blood loss amounting to per cent of estimated blood volume and its subsequent replacement were studied before and after induction of betareceptor blockade in terms of cardiac SO and aortic blood flow acceleration cardiac performance in the absence of betablockade was markedly impaired during steadystate anesthesia compared with corresponding values in normal dogs practolol mgkg administered during anesthesia induced no significant circulatory change other than a per cent decrease in heart rate and a per cent increase in strode volum propranolol mgkg caused a comparable reduction of heart rate but significantly reduced cardiac output per cent aortic blood flow acceleration per cent and peak lv SP per cent and increased systemic V1 resistance per cent the two drugs caused comparable shifts of the isoproterenol doseresponse curve during anesthesia graduated blood loss during anesthesia to a total of per cent of blood volume caused consistent circulatory changes decreased mean arterial pressure cardiac output peak lv power lv minute work that were essentially similar before and T3 betareceptor blockade with either propranolol or practolol the positive inotropic effect of calcium gluconate during HAL anesthesia was significantly reduced following either propranolol or practolol but the hemodynamic responses to changes of systemic V1 resistance induced with acetylcholine or phenylephrine were not modified by betareceptor blockade
19,fiftyeight human isolates of bacteroides melaninogenicus from a variety of clinical infections and the rest from normal flora were studied for pigment production and ultraviolet light fluorescence and by forty biochemical and other tests including endproduct analysis by gasliquid chromatography in a number of instances tests were repeated several times and the results were reproducible agar plate dilution susceptibility tests were also performed to antimicrobial agents these strains could be reliably placed into three groups corresponding to the three subspecies described based on seven characteristics these included acid production in peptoneyeastglucose medium production of nbutyric acid from peptoneyeastglucose medium esculin hydrolysis ST hydrolysis indole production effect on milk and lipase production production of hydrogen gas in peptoneyeastfructose medium may be another distinguishing characteristic in GA there was not much difference in the susceptibility of the three groups to the various antimicrobial agents tested two strains had a MICs of penicillin g of and uml respectively three strains did not produce a black pigment in spite of prolonged incubation on bloodcontaining media
20,the nature of riboflavin precursors was studied in the yeast pichia guilliermondii by means of mutants with blocked gmpsynthetase the purine precursors of riboflavin were shown to belong to guanylic compounds accumulation of triaminooxypyrimidine diaminooxyribitylaminopyrimidine dioxyaminoribitylaminopyrimidine doarap and dimethylribityllumasine occurs in the riboflavindeficient mutants divided into five biochemical groups this fact evidences for identity of riboflavin precursors in the yeast p guilliermondii and saccharomyces cerevisiae synthesis of doarap by the washed off cells of the mutants with the blocked lumasine synthetase is strongly inhibited by riboflavin cycloheximide in the absence of riboflavin has no effect on this process consequently flavinogenesis in p guilliermondii is regulated according to the type of negative feedback by means of retroinhibition mechanism a change in the content of flavins in the cells has no effect on synthesis of riboflavin synthetase at the same time iron deficiency in the cells evokes derepression of this enzyme incubation of the cells rich in iron with ophenantroline or alpha alphadipyridyl also causes derepression of riboflavin synthetase which is inhibited by cycloheximide a deficiency of hem in the mutants which need epsilonaminolevulinic acid does not affect the riboflavinsynthetase activity of the cells evidently in p guilliermondii a certain form of nonheminic iron might take part in regulating synthesis of riboflavin synthetase and other enzymes participating in riboflavin biosynthesis riboflavin overproduction is established to require formation of purines de novo with the absence of flavinogenesis enzymes derepression a genetic disturbance in regulation of purinic nucleotides biosynthesis results in stimulation of flavinogenesis the properties were studied for time purified riboflavinkinase from cells of p guilliermondii as well as for three phosphatases possessing the optimum of the activity at ph and which are able of hydrolysing fmn a NC in the content of flavins and iron in the cells has no effect on the activity of riboflavinkinase in this species evidently the mechanisms of riboflavin and flavin nucleotides biosynthesis regulation would be different in p guilliermondii
21,human adenylate cyclase atp pyrophosphatelyase cyclizing ec has been studied in S9 of fat cell membranes ghosts as reported earlier under ordinary CA conditions mm atp mm mg degrees c min incubation the enzyme was activated fold by epinephrine in the presence of the gtp analog guanylylimidodiphosphate gmppnhp cooper b et al j clin invest basal activity was highest during the first min of incubation then slowed and was linear for at least the next min EN added CT was often without effect but sometimes maintained the initial high rate of basal activity gmppnhp alone produced inhibition lag of basal enzyme early in the incubation periods augmentation of epinephrine effect by gmppnhp which also proceeded after a brief min lag period was noted over a wide range of ATP atp concentrations gtp inhibited basal levels of the enzyme by about gtp also allowed expression of an EN effect but only in the sense that the hormone abolished the inhibition by gtp occasionally a slight stimulatory effect on epinephrine action was seen with gtp at high mg concentration greater than mm or elevated temperatures greater than degrees c gmppnhp CT G1 the enzyme maximal activity of human fat cell adenylate cyclase was seen at mm mg mm atp ph and degrees c in the presence of m gmppnhp under these conditions addition of epinephrine did not further enhance activity human fat cell adenylate cyclase of adults was insensitive to acth and glucagon even in the presence of gmppnhp
22,calf skin collagen was solubilized by incubating acidextracted calf skin with pepsin at ph and degrees c conditions that did not cause degradation of the triple helical region of collagen type iii collagen was separated from type i collagen by differential salt precipitation at ph the isolated type iii collagen contained mainly gamma and higher molecular weight components crosslinked by reducible andor nonreducible bonds the isolated alpha iii chains had an CAA composition characteristic of type iii collagen denatured but unreduced type iii collagen chromatographed on carboxymethylcellulose eluted in the alpha region while T3 reduction and alkylation the alpha iii chains eluted between the positions of alpha i and alpha the midpoint melting temperature temperature tm of type iii collagen degrees c in a citrate buffer at ph was somewhat lower than that of type i collagen degrees c renaturation experiments at degrees c showed that denatured type iii collagen molecules with intact intramolecular disulfide bridges gamma components reform the triple helical structure of collagen much faster than reduced and carboxymethylated alpha iii chains
23,it has been previously reported that fasting may result in decreased lung surfactant production in order to investigate this relationship and the role of nutrition in lung phospholipid synthesis dayold rats were exposed for h to one of five dietary regimens standard rat chow controls fasting pure glucose pure fat or pure protein after the period of fasting there was a decrease in lung protein content but there was no change in dna content exposure to any of the exp diets resulted in a decrease in tissue total phospholipid and phosphatidylcholine content per lung but not per unit lung protein similarly lung lavage phospholipid and phosphatidylcholine content was decreased by after fasting when expressed per lung or per unit dna but not per unit protein pulmonary cholinephosphotransferase ec activity was decreased in the fasted animals and those fed the HP but not in the glucose or fatfed animals the activities of acetylcoa carboxylase ec and microsomal fatty acid elongation were decreased in all the experimental groups except for the glucosefed group it is concluded that fasting results in a decrease in lung cell size but not in lung cell number total phospholipid and phosphatidylcholine content in lung tissue and lung lavage is decreased per cell but not per unit cell mass
24,residues and of the pentapeptide moiety raladglulysdaladala of peptidoglycan play an important role in the donor phase of crosslinked glycan synthesis to assess the role of these residues in this phase a series of udpmurnacpeptides were biosynthesized with residues and replaced singly by either dalphaaminonbutyric acid dnorvaline or dvaline the six nucleotides were compared with udpmurnacaladglulysdaladala REF in nascent penicillininsensitive PGN synthesis and in penicillinsensitive peptidoglycan synthesis the synthesis of penicillinsensitive peptidoglycan is catalyzed by membranewalls isolated from gaffkya homari and would appear to require the concerted action of transglycosylase and transpeptidase the membranewall system shows a high degree of discrimination for the steric substituents ch and chch in residue for example for udpmurnacaladglylysdabudala and aladglulysdaladabu vmaxkm is and and vmax is and respectively of the value for the reference nucleotide in contrast for the synthesis of nascent PGN with these nucleotides vmaxkm is and and vmax is and respectively of the value for the reference nucleotide this trend was also illustrated with the other nucleotides in the time course experiments these results indicate that the penicillinsensitive enzymes presumably the transpeptidase has a higher degree of specificity in the donor phase for dalanine in residue than for dalanine in residue in the crosslinking stage of peptidoglycan synthesis
25,by quantitative stimulation of the vagus SN of isolated rabbit atria frequencyresponse relations were obtained for both the electrotropic effect reduction of the area of the monophasic action potential and the inotropic response an addition of hexamethonium in a final concentration of gml resulted in a diminution of vagal effectivity in the range of lower and medium frequencies of stimulation and was connected with a shift of the frequencyresponse characteristic to the right at higher frequencies vagal effectivity was increased in contrast to the inhibitory effect of hexamethonium the facilitating action is irreversible by raising the concentration up to gml the vagal effects were reduced to a C1 extent and the frequency dependence of the response was abolished at medium frequencies in the range of sec to sec this dependence was reestablished and may be considered as a part of a normal frequencyresponse relation extremely shifted to the RA the time courses of both types of effect are characterized by a steep rise and a decay of the response during the stimulation period a mathematical handling of the frequencyresponse characteristics provides quantitative evidence for the extent of the hexamethonium blockade of vagal ganglion cells in the atria furthermore it leads to the conception of these cells to act as a distributing system for a homogeneous innervation by a widespread divergency of postganglionic fibres
26,reported here are studies on the copperacetylgylcylglycine system as a function of ph and the molar ratio between the ligand and the paramagnetic ion applying potentiometric titration magnetic resonances esr and nmr and spectrophotometric techniques the results indicate that depending on the ph of the solutions there are three distinct regions characterized by their different species and behavior in region i ph less than the copper is bound to the carboxylate group of the ligand molecule the blue complex precipitation of copper occurs in region ii ph in region iii ph greater than in the presence of excess of ligand the copper redissolves forming complexes in which the central copper ion binds to the peptide molecule through the nitrogens of the deprotonated peptide groups and to hydroxyl ions the mutual replacement of the peptide CG of chelated acglygly by oh and the changes in the structures of the complexes are discussed
27,lipid peroxide formation was initiated by the addition of either adpcomplexed fe or cumene hydroperoxide to a suspension of isolated hepatocytes the reaction was monitored by malonaldehyde measurements upon the addition of iron malonaldehyde production in the cells started immediately but ceased within min and the response was doserelated with iron concentrations ranging from to mum malonaldehyde formation was associated with increased oxygen uptake and conjugated diene production the addition in vitro of nnnntetramethylpphenylenediamine menadione or pbenzoquinone inhibited the ironinduced malonaldehyde production it was also possible to demonstrate an apparent disappearance of malonaldehyde from fresh cells by addition of adequate amounts of nnnntetramethylpphenylenediamine mum the attenuation of the ironinduced malonaldehyde production was found to be correlated with an increased binding of iron to an intracellular ferritin fraction further malonaldehyde formation was also associated with a conversion of reduced glutathione to the Ox form which in turn revealed a faster permeation out of the cells into the surrounding medium of the oxidized than of the reduced thiol so concomitant with the redox alterations there was also an overall loss of glutathione from the cells cumene hydroperoxideinduced malonaldehyde production could be initiated by the addition of this peroxide in concentrations ranging from mum to the liver cell incubate with concentrations below mum a lag phase was present which seemed to be glutathionedependent it is concluded that iron enters the cell then is probably reduced inside the cell by nadph via the nadphcytochrome p reductase and in the reduced state initiates lipid peroxidation the reaction is inhibited by intracellular mechanisms the glutathione redox system being of principal importance and possibly terminated by the ironapoferritin complex formation
28,the differences between the results of controlled clinical research and the experiences of the practitioners can be attributed to a certain extent to the artificiality of the setting in which controlled studies are performed the system developed in the wards of the department of psychopharmacology of the institute of psychiatry in prague is an attempt to overcome some of these difficulties certain similarities exist between this system called continuous controlled trial and silent trial proposed by ross et al the main characteristics of the system are all patients admitted to the ward are assigned to the trial without exception the trial goes on continuously without interruption for more than years except that the patients do not know the quality of drugs administered they do not realize any difference between this research setting and the usual routine treatment the advantages of this system are reduction of artificiality the possibility to perform early PCTs in controlled conditions and to shorten the usual threephase testing of a new drug the possibility to perform longterm longitudinal studies with individual patients admitted several times in doubleblind conditions
29,the hr ld of colchicine in newborn rats is mgkg which is about that observed in the AD the hr ld of colchicine was relatively constant in rats over days of age in an attempt to determine the mechanism of the increased sensitivity of the newborn rat to the toxic action of colchicine the distribution of h after the administration of hcolchicine mgkg was measured in and dayold rats the concentration of h was higher in all tissues of the newborn than the AD after ip administration suggesting an immaturity in the pathway for colchicine beta after iv administration radioactivity disappeared much more slowly from the plasma of the newborn rat than from the adult this was due to a lower capacity of the CL of the newborn to concentrate colchicine and to excrete it into the bile development of the hepatic excretory mechanism responsible for excretion of colchicine occurred at the same age as did the increase in ld these results suggest that colchicine is more toxic in the P0 because the drug remains in the body for a longer time due to immaturity of the liver excretory process
30,thirteen alpha omegaalkanedicarboxylic acids cc c and c and their dimethyl esters were tested against aspergillus niger trichoderma viride and myrothecium verrucaria in sabourauc dextrose agar at ph and toxicity to canadida albicans trichophyton mentagrophytes and mucor mucedo was determined in the same medium at ph and in the absence and presence of beef SS the dicarboxylic acids possessed very poor to no antifungal activity against all six fungi the fungitoxicity of the dimethyl esters to a niger t viride and m verrucaria was c c greater than c greater than c c greater than c greater than c greater than c and to c albicans t mentagrophytes and m mucedo c greater than c greater than c greater than c c greater than c greater than c greater than c greater than c greater than c the fungitoxicity of the esters of fatty acids and alphaomegaalkanedicarboxylic acids was influenced by chain length and not by the ph of the medium or the absence or presence of beef serum
31,a simple MM is developed to explain the activation of rat liver plasma membrane adenylate cyclase atp pyrophosphatelyase cyclizing ec by guanosine nucleotides and glucagon and the dependence of the catalytic rate on mg h and ATP concentrations the basic model proposes that the adenylate cyclase system can exist in two states a and b that activating ligands bind preferentially to the b state and that only the b state is active kinetic data are quantitatively fit to this model and the binding constants for the interaction of the a and b states with glucagon gtp and guanylylimidodiphosphate are obtinaed the substrates atp and adenylylimidodiphosphate appear to show little preference between the a and b states and simple michaelismenten kinetics are sufficient to describe the dependence of the catalytic rate on substrate concentration under optimal conditions the dependence of the rate on ph can be explained by postulating that one ionizable group in its acid form and one ionizable group in its basic form must be present at the AS site in order for catalysis to occur the activation and inhibition of the activity by mg can be explained by a similar mechanism with mg binding to activating and inhibiting CS glucagon and guanosine nucleotides appear to influence the dependence of the rate on mg and glucagon the mg also may display some preference for the b state a comparison of this model with others that have been proposed is given the proposed model appears to provide a simple conceptual framework that is applicable to many adenylate cyclase systems
32,under relatively mild conditions nucleic acids and their constituents were trinitrophenylated with trinitrobenzenesulfonate tnbs in AQ solution ph yielding reddishorange TNP tnp derivatives guanine residues were trinitrophenylated on the base residues at the amino group ntnp derivatives and in addition and hydroxyl groups of the ribose moieties of nucleosides or nucleotides were trinitrophenylated to form meisenheimer complexes the preparation of tnp derivatives ntnpguanine guanosine n obistnpguanosine otnpguanosine adenosine cytidine and uridine their rates of formation absorption spectra uv visible and infrared molar extinction coefficients rf value electrophoretic mobilities and stability in acid or alkaline solution are presented trinitrophenylation of several kinds of nucleic acid was investigated CT dna and yeast transfer rna showed a resistance to trinitrophenylation compared to guanosine phosphate yeast rna or denatured calf thymus dna tnprna showed resistance to the action of ribonucleases t and t ec and trinitrophenylation reactions using trinitrochlorobenzene and trinitrofluorobenzene were compared with that using tnbs as regards specificity and reaction rate
33,the effect of nadp on lightinduced steadystate redox changes of MB cytochromes was investigated in membrane fragements prepared from the bluegreen algae nostoc muscorum CS that had high rates of electron transport from water to nadp and from an artificial electron donor reduced dichlorophenolindophenol dciph to ndap the membrane fragments contained very little PC and had excellent optical properties for spectrophotometric assays with dciph as the electron donor nadp had no effect on the lightinduced redox changes of cytochromes with or without nadp or nm illumination resulted mainly in the oxidation of cytochrome f and of other components which may include a ctype cytochrome with an alpha peak at nm with nm illumination and water as the electron donor nadp had a pronounced effect on the redox state of cytochromes causing a shift toward oxidation of a component with a peak at nm possibly a ctype cytochrome cytochrome f and particularly cytochrome b cytochrome b appeared to be a component of the main noncyclic electron transport chain and was photooxidized at physiological temperatures by PS ii this photooxidation was apparent only in the presence of a terminal acceptor nadp for the electron flow from water
34,a survey of polyarteritis nodosa in domestic animals is presented including a description of the pathomorphological lesions and a discussion on the causal AF this vascular disease occurs in domestic animals in association with both viral infections infectious plasmacytosis in mink bacterial infections erysipelas in swine and protozoan infections nosematosis in blue foxes the conclusion is drawn that the observations in domestic animals support the view that immunological disturbances are involved as pathogenetic mechanisms nosematosis is dealt with in more detail the infecting agent fig nosema cuniculi encephalitozoon cuniculi is a widespread mamalian parasite which causes cerebral and renal lesions in blue foxes of the same type as in animals of other species in addition the vascular system throughout the body is affected resulting in pathomorphological alterations corresponding to classical polyarteritis nodosa fig in the early stages of involvement masses of parasitic organisms are regularly found within the walls of affected arteries fig this disease is frequently lethal and always accompanied by elevated values of gamma globulins both the hypergammaglobulinemia and the tissue lesions seem at times at least in part to be reversible
35,a soluble acetylcoa carboxylase in homogenates of leaves from wildtype barley seedlings was studied centrifuging the homogenate at x g did not reduce the total activity but raised the specific activity during chloroplast OD in lightgrown seedlings or during lightdependent greening of leaves grown in the dark both the total activity of the carboxylase per plant and the specific activity per mg of protein in homogenates of the seedlings increased rapidly the soluble leaf acetylcoa carboxylase was studied in a number of barley mutants with lesions in cp development in a group of three mutants light elicited an increase in acetylcoa carboxylase activity as in the wildtype in two mutants CS caused a decrease in activity darkgrown leaves of mutant albinaf contained C2 of soluble acetylcoa carboxylase reached only in the light by the wildtype whereas lightgrown albinaf seedlings lacked carboxylase activities the possibility is discussed that leaf cells contain two forms of acetylcoa carboxylase one soluble with unknown location and a dissociable form located in the cp
36,mediators of hormone and neurotransmitter action may exert negative control on the accumulation of one another adenosine cyclic monophosphate or conversely a MM in which one agonist stimulates the formation of two mediators which inhibit each others accumulation has been simulated three types of agonistreceptor interaction five mechanisms of inhibition and three types of basal activity have been considered which lead to a set of descriptions of the general cross inhibition model for these submodels DP of the relation of agonist to mediator concentrations at Css conditions have been defined some patterns are complex with mediator curves exhibiting extrema one a maximum and the other a minimum the complexity of the DP depends on the submodel and on the degree of asymmetry between the parameters of each of the mediator pathways egaffinities for the agonist strength of the inhibitions etc this simple model can thus account for complex experimental results without requiring the postulation of elaborate molecular models of agonistreceptor interaction the simulations presented emphasize the necessity of investigating a wide range of agonist concentrations
37,the effects of ph and ionic strength on the Tm reduction potential emp of clostridium acidiurici ferredoxin were determined using hydrogen gas and hydrogenase the emp of native ferredoxin at degrees in m trischloride buffer ph is v in the ph range examined the emp becomes approximately mv more negative per each ph unit increase a plot of the log of ionic strength versus the apparent emp of ferredoxin in m trischloride buffer ph was linear over the range of to ionic strength with emp values of and v respectively at these extremes this effect is the same with sodium chloride sodium bromide or ammonium sulfate potassium phosphate buffer caused a similar NC but the absolute values of emp differed from those obtained in the presence of the other salts this effect of ph and ionic strength on emp may be general for clostridialtype fesferredoxins since the apparent emp of clostridium pasteurianum ferredoxin is affected in a similar manner by these two variables the emp of this ferredoxin in m trischloride buffer ph is v since the nhterminal amino acid residue ala and tyr of c acidi urici ferredoxin are near an fescluster in the protein the apparent emp of derivatives that contained amino acid replacements in these two positions were determined under similar conditions the emp of most of the derivatives examined including those of leu andnhtyrferredoxin is approximately the same as that of native ferredoxin however the emp of hisferredoxin is approximately mv more positive whereas that of trpferredoxin is mv more negative than that of native c acidiurici ferredoxin variations in sodium chloride concentration and ph also affected the apparent emp of the derivatives it is suggested that the changes observed in the emp of c acidiurici ferredoxin are caused by protein conformational changes
38,originally many of the initiators of the world population conference which took place in bucharest in had hoped that the conference would imply a final breakthrough for the view that family planning measures should be given top priority in all lessdeveloped countries in fact however the plan of action passed by the conference contains very little relating to population and family planning instead the document is dominated by wordy phrases about the necessity of attaining social and economic development in those countries will the insight that family planning programs work efficiently only if they are an integral part of programs for the social and economic development of a country lead to such programs being realized there is every reason to doubt that the plan of action will have any such effect the reasons for the underdevelopment of third world countries cannot be removed through such UN resolutions in the peoples republic of china family planning is widely accepted especially in the towns and now also among the rural population limiting the number of children is considered part of chinas OD effort china is a lessdeveloped country that is in the process of rapid social and economic development the issue at stake in other third world countries is how to achieve a similar OD as soon as this goal is achieved FP efforts are meaningful and have a chance of success the experience of china demonstrates that even there it took time before the efforts succeeded there are many third world countries that could without much difficulty support a population considerably larger than the present one but there are no doubt also a number of countries where the population is already so large that a continued population increase would be harmful the need to achieve rapid development becomes increasingly urgent not in the least to make it possible to attain a reduced population growth the sad truth is that so little development takes place in those countries without social and economic development the present rapid population increase will continue in those countries where there is already an overly dense population
39,the relationship between respiratory insufficiency expressed by gas tensions in blood and bone marrow and haematologic adaptation has been studied in men with CB and persistent breathlessness for at least one year for the group as a whole and for various subgroups a linear correlation was demonstrated between arterial hypoxia and hb concentration haematocrit blood volume hb mass and erythrocyte volume respectively the increase in hb concentration compensated for the fall in arterial oxygen saturation only for one subgroup with a ph difference between arterial and venous blood larger than or equal to was no correlation found between the degree of hypoxia and hb concentration the haematologic parameters correlated significantly better with arterial oxygen tensions than with oxygen tensions in the bone marrow there was no indication that decreased oxygen supply to the bone marrow led to the increased erythrocyte and hb production in patients with arterial hypoxia caused by chronic bronchitis
40,f nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy has been used to T0 a fully AS e coli fluorotyrosine alkaline phosphatase the fluorotyrosine resonances provide sensitive probes of the conformational states of the protein they were used to follow the addition of zinc or cobalt to the apoprotein and the titration of the protein with inorganic phosphate or the inhibitor hydroxynitrobenzylphosphonate the results indicate that molecules of inorganic phosphate per dimer of alkaline phosphatase are required to CR a GA conformational NC in the protein involving perturbations to the environment of several tyrosines spectra of the cobalt enzyme indicate that on specific tyrosine per subunit may be near the metal site the f nmr results combined with the p nmr results in the accompanying paper lead directly to the conclusion that dissociation of noncovalently bound inorganic phosphate from the enzyme is the ratelimiting process in enzyme catalysis at high ph the local environment of the individual fluorotyrosines is also discussed
41,the lightdependent uptake of triphenylmethylphosphonium tpmp and of dimethyloxazolidinedione dmo by starved purple cells of halobacterium halobium was investigated dmo uptake was used to calculate the ph difference deltaph across the membrane and tpmp was used as an index of the electrical potential difference deltapsi under most conditions both in the CS and in the dark the cells are more alkaline than the medium in the CS at ph deltaph amounts to ph unit its value can be increased to by either incubating the cells with tpmp m or at low external ph deltaph can be lowered by uncoupler or by nigericin the tpmp uptake by the cells indicates a large deltapsi across the membrane negative inside it was estimated that in the light at ph deltapsi might reach a value of about mv and that consequently the electrical equivalent of the proton electrochemical potential difference deltamuhf amounts under these conditions to about mv the effects of different ionophores on the lightdrive proton extrusion by the cells were in agreement with the effects of these compounds on deltaph
42,volatiles of which nh is a major component were evolved from decomposing immature corn tissue cn and affected r solani in culture two ways they supplied additional nitrogen to the growth medium so that fungal mycelial growth increased and they raised ATP ph from to which induced melanization of mycelium volatiles increased fungus growth and pigmentation within weeks of amendment addition to soil increases were concomitant with nh production from corn tissue more nh evolved from decomposing corn tissues of cn and than from those of cn and more growth and pigmentation occurred in flasks through which volatiles from decomposing corn cn were passed than in flasks through which volatiles from nonamended soil or decomposing corn cn were passed carbon dioxide from decomposing tissues did not affect growth or pigmentation twice as much nh evolved from corn tissue cn which decomposed in saturated soil than from tissue which decomposed in soil at of its waterholding capacity pigment production doubled under saturated conditions
43,rabbit aorta and rat fundus do not display tachyphylaxis to angiotensin ii aspangiotensin ii at degrees c these tissues do however display tachyphylaxis to sarangiotensin ii nmethylglycine angiotensin ii and dimethylglycine angiotensin ii respectively at this temperature at degrees c both tissues displayed rapid tachyphylaxis to aspangiotensin ii which was reversed on prolonged incubation in peptidefree medium at degrees c but at a lower than normal ph ph instead of the rabbit aorta developed rapid tachyphylaxis to aspangiotensin ii this effect also was reversed on prolonged incubation in peptidefree medium the rat uterus at degrees c displayed tachyphylaxis to aspangiotensin ii and analogs in order of rate of onset sarangiotensin ii greater than aspangiotensin ii greater than desaspangiotensin ii over half of the individual uterine strips tested displayed no tachyphylaxis to desaspangiotensin ii however at degrees c tachyphylaxis to all three EDC was rapid on onset and was reversed on prolonged incubation the results indicate a correlation between affinity of the peptide analog for angiotensin receptor and its ability to induce tachyphylaxis a possible involvement of membranebound enzymes in the onset and duration of tachyphylaxis is suggested
44,the substance dihydromethylpiperidylideneanthrol wa was examined for its antagonistic effects against histamine and serotonin for its atropinelike properties as well as for a series of other qualities in comparison with cyproheptadine and pimethixene the antihistamine and antiserotonin MICs of compound wa on the smooth muscle and the capillary do not only exceed that of cyproheptadine but also that of pimethixene wa shows an extremely strong binding to histamine and serotonin receptors in the dose range in which it causes already an antamine effect its oral absorption is very good the antianaphylactic effect is much stronger than that of cyproheptadine like pimethixene and cyproheptadine wa has no distinct antagonistic qualities against bradykinin the anticholinergic effects of wa are dependent on the test object in examinations on the bronchus of the guinea pig and the pupil of the mouse the atropinelike efficiency corresponds to that of cyproheptadine it is stronger on the stimulated vagus of the cat and less efficient than cyproheptadine on the stomach of the rat wa has distinct CE atropinelike properties it possesses a strong surface anesthetic activity the effects of wa on circulation are dependent on species in contrast to pimethixene compound wa like cyproheptadine potentiates the effects of norepinephrine in cats the reduction of the carotid sinus reflex in the cat is more distinct after wa than after pimethixene and corresponds to that produced by cyproheptadine higher doses of wa than are necessary to demonstrate antaminic effects are needed to provoke central nervous effects wa shows no analgesic potency in mice the influence on body temperature in the rat is similar to that of cyproheptadine wa is equally efficient as pimethixene with regard to the inhibition of spontaneous motility and prolongation of barbiturate sleep in mice and shows the same antiemetic activity as does chlorpromazine in dogs in contrast to chlorpromazine the behaviour of dogs and cats is distinctly altered already by doses of wa which cause a slight sedation
45,total body potassium has been estimated in hypertensive patients who were hypokalaemic as a result of longterm chlorthalidone treatment mean months while they were on chlorthalidone and weeks after this had been discontinued the mean difference amounted to only meq not significant in additional patients not previously treated with chlorthalidone serial total body potassium estimations revealed a mean potassium deficiency of meq T3 days and of meq T3 days these results suggest that the mechanism causing the initial potassium loss is partly reversed or compensated later on in patients with uncomplicated hypertension no significant potassium deficiency was detected during longterm treatment eighteen of our patients received meq potassium chloride supplements daily for weeks this caused a mean rise in SK from meql to meql not significant TB potassium did not NC at all we conclude that potassium chloride supplements are not an ERP treatment of hypokalaemia in this condition correction of the extracellular ph by ammonium chloride in patients on chlorthalidone who demonstrated a slight metabolic alkalosis gave rise to a mean increase in plasma potassium from meql to meql not significant the hypokalaemia in HT on LT chlorthalidone treatment cannot be explained by either a potassium deficiency or the change in extracellular ph
46,the interaction between TS direct Hly produced by vibrio parahaemolyticus wp and human erythrocytes was studied the lysis of human erythrocytes by the Hly was dependent of temperature and no hemolysis occurred at LT c but the Hly was adsorbed on human erythrocytes even at low temperature no hemolysis was observed when antihemolysin AS was mixed with the Hly and human erythrocytes at zero time on the other hand lysis of the cells by hemolysin was not completely inhibited when the antiserum was added during the lag time and the inhibitory effect decreased with delay in the time of addition of antiserum the inhibitory effect of the AS decreased with increase in the incubation temperature increase in the concentration of divalent cations and decrease in ph these results suggest that lysis of human erythrocytes by the Hly is at least a twostep process consisting of adsorption of the hemolysin to human erythrocytes and the steps following adsorption
47,sera from men from infertile couples were tested for sperm agglutinins and spermatozoal antibodies detectable by the indirect immunofluorescense technique ift and the results were correlated to the clinical examinations of the couples sperm agglutinins were found in spontaneous agglutination of the ejaculated spermatozoa was observed only among these men most commonly among those with high serum titres ifantibodies against the four spermatozoal antigens located beneath the cell membrane occurred in of the patients antibodies against the front part of the acrosome and the postnuclear cap were mainly igm antibodies against the equatorial segment of the acrosome were predominantly igg and in a few cases iga whereas straining of the main tail piece was caused by EA considering the clinical fertility status of the couples sperm agglutinins in high titres greater than or equal to against the equatorial segment and the main tail piece of the spermatozoa were found significantly more often among men from couples with UI than among clinically normal men from couples where the findings in the women could be assumed to cause infertility these results support the view that sperm agglutinins can cause infertility whereas the significance of the ifantibodies is still unclarified as in some cases these can be found even in high titres in men with proven fertility the possible mechanism of autosensitization were evaluated by means of an anamnestic study
48,influence of the preparations of bacterial proteinases protorisine and prototerrisine was studied on the stability of the mature collagen of beef skin the chemical composition of the tissue has been shown to be changed by these enzymes inconsiderably the tissue treated by orisine and terrisine is CR dissolved in m acetic acid solubilized collagen when the solutions of such collagen are heated to degrees within the ph range from to at the ionic strength of fibrils are formed under electron TSM fibres are crossstriated that is typical of native collagen fibres with periodicity of about a T3 chilling to degrees a part of fibrils is dissolved again nephlometry was used to study the rate of fibril formation as a function of ph and temperature values a conclusion has been drawn that the mature collagne dissolved after incubation with bacterial proteinases is close to the acidsoluble collagen fraction in the ability to produce MF upon heating
49,the weakly acidic fraction waf of CS particulate matter was fractioned by Si get chromatography we assayed the various primary subfractions for potential tumorpromoting activity by measuring the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into mouse epidermal dna as induced by these subfractions based on these results and on chemical composition the primary subfractions were then combined into four major subfractions and tested on initiated mouse skin for tumorpromoting activity by longterm application two of these subfractions of waf were inactive whereas the other two and of waf showed tumorpromoting activity the two active portions were then further chromatographed and tested by the ST bioassay some major components of the resulting active fractions included alkylcyclopentenolones catechols hydroquinone fatty acids and hydroxypyridines among these components catechol hydroquinone hydroxypyridine methylhydroxypyridine linolenic acid and LA acid were inactive as tumor promoters in the exp animal the activity of the alkylcyclopentenolones is unknown other components remain to be identified
50,leucomalacia or white matter necrosis is one of the L1 aspects of neonatal encephalopathies especially in the premature baby these necroses are found mainly in the deep PV WG matter of the semioval centre characteristically they are ischaemic and their anatomical and histological progress is rapid coagulation CN with rapid axonal fragmentation followed by polymorphic cellular reaction with glial cells and macrophages regeneration in the minor forms consists of glyosis process in severe forms multiple cavities appear in a few weeks physiopathogenic hypotheses put forward are related to the very anatomic aite special tissue and terminal arteries onset of myelinization process associated clinical and biological lesions such as hypoxia acidosis and hypotention these lesions are symptomfree during the neonatal period one of us suggested in that these could be the anatomical basis of spastic monoplegia or diplegia littles disease all motor cerebral sequelae have disappeared since years this is particularly significant mainly in the case of spastic diplegia of the former premature baby under g this decrease coincides with improvement in neonatal care especially correction of hypoxia acidosis and cardiovascular collapse these findings seem to support the pathogenic hypotheses
51,MPN mpn and membrane filtration mf techniques were evaluated with respect to selectivity sensitivity and efficiency in recovering pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in hospital fluids and extramural water environments known numbers of cells of a naturally occurring CS of p aeruginosa maintained in DW or cells subcultured on standard methods agar were added to test samples containing various types and levels of BG microbial contamiants environmental samples containing unknown numbers of p aeruginosa strains also were tested asparagine and acetamide broths were employed as presumptive media in mpn tests and mpa and pseudosel agars were used in mf assays statistical analyses of data showed the superiority and comparability of the asparaginempn and mpamf systems greater precision and accuracy were consistently obtained in either assay technique by the use of naturally occurring cells as test organisms the type of filter and nature of diluents employed as well as ph of assay media were found to greatly influence both recovery and developemnt of characteristic colonial morphology in the mpamf system
52,the extracellular proteinase of staphylococcus aureus strain v was used to digest the nadpspecific glutamate dehydrogenase of neurospora crassa of nonoverlapping MMP expected from the glutamate content of the polypeptide chain were isolated and substantially sequenced the sequences obtained were valuable in providing overlaps for the alignment of about twothirds of the sequences found in tryptic peptides wootton j c taylor j g jackson a a chambers g k fincham j r s biochem j the blocked nterminal peptide of the protein was isolated this peptide was sequenced by mass spectrometry and found to have NT nacetylserine by howard r morris and anne dell whose results are presented as an appendix to the main paper the staphylococcal proteinase showed very high specificity for glutamyl bonds in the nhhco buffer used partial splits of two aspartyl bonds both aspile were probably attributable to the proteinase no cleavage of glutaminyl or scarboxymethylcysteinyl bonds was found additional exp detail has been deposited as supplementary publication sup pages with the british library lending division boston spa wetherby w yorkshire ls bq uk from whom copies may be obtained under the terms given in biochem j
53,a hitherto undescribed sphingomyelinase sphase of human brain has been studied in crude and partially purified to fold extracts of grey matter and compared to the known sphingomyelinase with an acid ph optimum sphase its specificity for sphingomyelin as substrate is similar to that of sphase but it differs from sphase in its ph optimum vs and in a requirement for mg for optimal activity other properties of sphase that distinguish it from sphase include a its lack of appreciable CMS during dialysis of crude homogenates b a more marked concentrations in grey matter than in WG matter to fold vs to fold for sphase c inhibition by ca and cd ions and by edta d stimulation by dithiothreitol and inhibition by cysteine nethylmaleimide and phydroxymercuribenzoate e lack of inhibition by nucleotides ampadp and atp and by nad plus nadh and f relative instability to storage or manipulation between degrees c and degrees c these differences indicate the sphase is a different enzyme protein from sphase unlike sphase which is widely distributed in mammalian tissues sphase occurs predominantly in grey matter and little activity was observed is SP CL or leukocytes the high C2 of this enzyme in BB suggest a role related to the TPS functions of this organ or to the need for a more stringent control of sphingomyelin catabolism in brain as compared to other organs
54,properties of Ah hydroxylase in the microsomes were compared between morris hepatoma d and the host CL from rats bearing this RT requirement of nadph for the assay of the enzyme activity was observed compared to that of nadh and also the additive effect of nadh on the requirement of nadph was found in the tumor and liver curve of ph optimum of the enzyme activity in tumor and liver differed between the rats treated with corn oil and those with methylcholanthrene indicating a slight shift of the peak value to alkaline ph in the latter the same values of the apparent km for nadph and nadh were shown for the enzyme from the liver and tumor even hr T3 the treatment with methylcholanthrene but a difference in the apparent km for BP was demonstrated between the tumor and the host liver showing approximately mum in the former and approximately mum in the latter by the addition of or benzoflavone to the assay medium for the tumor the induced enzyme was inhibited noncompetitively and the constitutive enzyme was enhanced as demonstrated in the host liver as observed in the induced enzyme in both tissues CHO and trichloropropane oxide slightly increased the activity of the constitutive enzyme in the tumor in contrast to its inhibition in the host CL
55,the principal component of normal AD HbA ao was equilibrated under various conditions with co in addition derivatives containing specifically carbamylated nhterinal groups in alpha or beta chains or both were prepared by treatment with cyanate and equilibrated likewise to allow the identification of TPS resonances observed by c nuclear magnetic resonance in deoxyhemoglobin a resonanance at ppm upfield of external cs was assigned to the alpha chain terminal adduct and one at ppm to the beta chain terminal adduct in the liganded state as the co derivative the terminal adduct on both chains showed a common resonance position at ppm small effects of ph on the resonance positions were observed under certain conditions a resonance was observed at ppm probably not ascribable to a carbamino compound a carbamino resonance that became prominent at higher ph was found at ppm and is tentatively ascribed to one or more adducts on epsilon amino groups the beta chain resonances in particular are minimized by the presence of Ins hexaphosphate or diphosphoglycerate quantitative analysis of the resonance intensities shows that the effects of conversion from the deoxy to the liganded state in reducing the degree of carbamino adduct is much more pronounced for the beta than for the alpha chains
56,phallolysin from the toadstool amanita phalloides is a basic protein that causes direct haemolysis of red cells the DR curve is steep the ph optimum is in the weakly acid range the rate of haemolysis increases with the concentration of the lysin the optimal temperature is degrees c the percentage haemolysistime curves are sshaped haemolysis is of the nonosmotic type ca is not required but inhibits haemolysis in a concentrationdependent fashion as do mg and zn the red cell sensitivity of various animal species decreases in the following sequencemouse greater than rabbit guniea pig greater than rat greater than man greater than dog approximately or equal to pig greater than sheep cattle CRC of cattle and sheep are largely resistant phallolysin is virtually not consumed on haemalysis the amount of haemoglobin released increases with the number of red cells applied on repeated addition of fresh red cells the haemolysate retains its full activity phallolysin is not inhibited by SS albumin cholesterol lecithin cephalin or sphingomyelin inhibition by red cell ghosts of phallolysin haemolysis is considerably less than that of digitonin haemolysis at sublytic concentrations phallolysin unlike benzalkonium chloride liberates practically no membrane lipids from human red cells surface activity of phallolysin does not exceed that of bovine SS albumina saponinlike interaction with cholesterol as the basic mechanism of haemolysis can be disregarded there is also no evidence suggesting a detergentlike effect
57,amino acid concentrations were determined in plasma whole blood CSF fluid and brain tissue of patients with grade or coma due to fulminant hepatic failure the concentration of of the amino acids determined were significantly increased in blood and the increases were greatest for the amino acids concerned with neurotransmitter metabolism there was no rho however between the plasma concentration of these amino acids and changes in the grade of hepatic coma the plasma concentrations of the branched chain amino acids were normal except in those patients who subsequently recovered in whom levels were slightly decreased phenylalanine tyrosine and methionine were among the out of amino acids which were significantly increased in cerebrospinal fluid and among the out of amino acids which were significantly increased in the BB the increase in tryptophan was associated with a significant elevation in brain hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration suggesting an increase in hydroxytryptamine turnover in hepatic coma BB to plasma ratios of most amino acids in hepatic coma patients were similar to control subjects suggesting that plasma concentration is the main factor controlling the cerebral concentration however for the branched chain amino acids CSF fluid and brain concentrations were increased when plasma concentrations were normal suggesting an increase in BB uptake
58,in adults of both sexes the influence on the basal and the maximal by means of PG stimulated gastric secretion of a single i.v. of mg to mgkg oxyfedrine or of two intramuscular i.v. of mg to mgkg or of mg to mgkg in each case isoproterenol consecutively administered at an interval of minutes was studied at a dose which evokes cardiovascular responses isoproterenol does not produce a significant NC of the sec rates of h c na k ca and mg or of the ionic composition of gastric juice both during basal and maximal acid output oxyfedrine shows only during maximal acid stimulation some effects on gastric secretion a significant rise of the concentration and sec rate of h and of the secretory rate of c and a significant decline of the concentration of na and of both the concentration and secretory rate of mg betaadrenergic receptors seem not to play any part in the regulation of the production of gastric juice possibly the action of oxyfedrine on the stimulated GM may be mediated by a stimulation of alphaadrenergic receptors or by inhibition of the activity of ampphosphodiesterase
59,average po and pco local blood flow and ph values in the cerebral cortex of the cat were measured during passive hyperventilation arterial pco below mm hg at defined intervals tissue samples were taken for metabolite analysis the object of the study was to correlate the data obtained on the brain surface with metabolic responses immediately T3 the start of hyperventilation blood flow decreased average cortical tissue pressures of o and co fell and there was a simultaneous rise in cortical ph at a later stage in the experiment the local blood supply reverted to its resting level despite a fivefold rise in tissue lactate level during HV and a decrease in local o pressure on the BB surface to mm hg the degree of phosphorylation of energy rich phosphates was not less than under normal conditions of oxygenation our investigations showed no evidence of energy lack in cerebral SC cells during hyperventilation cellular hypoxia and its characteristics are defined the possible causes of raised tissue lactate levels during hyperventilation despite the lack of evidence of cellular hypoxia are discussed
60,conditions are described in which the pneumococcal mutant strain sulrc resistant to the drug sulfanilamide gives rise to sensitive segregants resistant to nitrobenzoic acid at a frequency constant with time this segregant frequency is markedly enhanced upon SE of the cells to doses of ultraviolet light or MMC c that permit survival of to of the cells treatment with AO diminishes the segregant frequency from the known influences of these three agents on genetic recombination we propose that a recombination event is necessary in the generation of segregantsduring a period of incubation following treatment with ultraviolet light or mitomycin c cell division resumes and the original segregant frequency is restored thus potential segregants are either unable to replicate in the absence of selection or they are underrepresented among the cells dividing soon after treatmentif the sulrc mutation is introduced into a mutant pneumococcal strain lacking an atpdependent exonuclease activity and deficient in recombination with transforming dna segregant frequencies are unaffected this fact may indicate limits upon the type of recombination event responsible for segregation
61,some properties of the pure soluble phospholipase d phosphatidycholine phosphatido hydrolase ec interactions with DSPC diacylsnglycerolphosphoryl choline in a system also containing dodecylsulfate and ca ions were studied concentrations of ca greater than mm were necessary both for activity and adsorption of the enzyme to the supersubstrate EDTA caused inhibition of activity greater than one would expect from its chelating capacity a nonlinear increase in activity with the increase of enzyme protein was observed suggesting a S1 aggregation into a higher mol wt protein catalytically more active upon centrifugation of the supersubstrateenzyme complex at x gmin at c most of the ATP molecules sedimented regardless of the ph the reverse was true when centrifugation was done at c phospholipase d hydrolyzed phosphatidylcholine molecules present in the supersubstrate at temperatures around c at a rate that of a maximal value measured at c the arrhenius plot was linear in the range from to c and at that temperature the curve broke with a smaller Mw activation energy of kcalmol below c was calculated adsorption of the enzyme to the sedimentable supersubstrate occurred at ph regardless of temperature at ph a considerable portion of phosphatidylcholine was degraded at c thus minimizing the capacity of the supersubstrate to adsorb the enzyme although mg could replace ca in the formation of sedimentable supersubstrate it neither assists in adsorption of the enzyme nor in activation of the phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis
62,a newly developed dualfunction ph and pco sensor was evaluated in this study the sensors were placed in the femoral arteries of dogs anesthetized with SP comparisons were made between systemic arterial ph and pco measured using the sensor and those measured from blood samples drawn at min intervals over a h period using a bench instrument the mean ph of the bench instrument measurements was the mean difference of the sensor measurements from the bench instrument measurements for comparisons was ph sd the mean pco of the bench instrument measurements was mmhg the mean difference of the sensor measurements from those of the bench instrument for comparisons was mmhg sd the sensors performed equally well in the presence of metabolic or respiratory acidosis and alkalosis the dualfunction sensors evaluated in this T0 are useful for trend monitoring of ph and pco over at least a h period without recalibration with improvement in the consistency of sensor construction these sensors will be reliable in vivo sensing devices for blood ph and pco and thus valuable research and clinical instruments
63,we have already reported that bucolome bcp a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent potentiates significantly the analgesic and antipyretic effects of pyrazolones which are substituted by alkylamino group at position of the pyrazolone ring physical and quantum chemistry were applied to the mechanism of this synergistic action the solubility of bcp was markedly increased in proportion to elevation of aminopyrine am concentration but not by a combination with isopropylantipyrine ip the IB of bcp to bovine SS albumin was slightly inhibited by am but not by ip the mixture of am and bcp in aqueous media generated optical absorption in the ultraviolet differential spectrum due to the charge transfer interaction the results of the infrared or nmr spectrum demonstrated the formation of a hydrogen binding in nonaqueous media between bcp and am from the calculation of the charge on an atom the SE of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the frontier electron density bcp is considered to be a good electron acceptor the betaunits of mho of pyrazolones were found to correlate with the potentiation coefficient of analgesic activity in combination drugs these results suggest that the complex formation between bcp and pyrazolones is an important factor for the synergism of action and is due to the charge transfer interaction and the hydrogen binding of both molecules
64,the effect of insulininduced hypoglycemia on the blood levels of catecholamines and renin activity has been studied in five patients with moderate hypertension before and after treatment for months with penbutolol pen mg twice daily penbutolol caused no NC in fasting blood glucose level insulin o iu per kg body weight iv reduced blood gl concentration by approximately per cent after min both before and during treatment with penbutolol hypoglycemia prior to medication was accompanied by a marked increase in the production of adrenaline and a minor increase of noradrenaline in all five patients during treatment the response of adrenaline to hypoglycemia was reduced in four patients and the data was inconclusive in one basal renin activity was rather low in three patients within the normal range in one and relatively high in one before penbutolol the hypoglycemiainduced increase in catecholamine production caused no change in plasma renin activity in the three patients with low basal levels whereas a marked increase was observed in the other two during medication plasma renin activity remained unchanged on induction of hypoglycemia regardless of the catecholamine response despite the marked increase in plasma adrenaline following insulininduced hypoglycemia no statistically significant increase in pulse rate was recorded
65,the kinetics and cellular characteristics of immunosuppression in cbap x cblf mice during graftversushost gvh reaction induced with SP cells from either parental strain have been investigated effects on pfc responses to thymusdependent chicken red blood cells and independent levan antigens have been compared the unresponsive state which developed in gvh mice was expressed to comparable extent by their spleen cells following transfer to irradiated recipients furthermore gvh spleen cells suppressed normal spleen cells in a mixed transfer system but this effect was lost CR by day whereas the original donors or their cells were still totally refractory after days this active suppressor effect was found to be mediated by t cells of perental origin based on cell fractionation analysis and selective deletion of donor or host cells by alloimmune attack the delayed transfer of gvh cells to irradiated repopulated recipients challenged with antigen indicated that suppressor t cells exert an antimitotic influence on antigenstimulated bcell proliferation supplementation of macrophagedepleted antithetatreated gvh spleen cells with purified normal TA demonstrated that b cells in gvh mice are normally reactive even when active suppression by t cells is no longer demonstrable the likelihood that this later phase of immunosuppression is attributable to another mechanism is discussed
66,the thermophilic fungus malbranchea pulchella produces a single extracellular alkaline serine protease when grown at degrees c on casein as sole carbon source the growthassociated production of protease in submerged cultures was inhibited by addition of glucose amino acids or yeast extract a simple fourstep purification which yields homogeneous protease in yield is described the protease has an isoelectric point of a ph optimum of and is completely inhibited by serine protease inhibitors a specificity study with small synthetic ester substrates indicated that the protease preferentially hydrolyzed bonds situated on the carboxyl side of aromatic or apolar CAA residues which are not betabranched positively charged or of the d configuration peptidase substrates and others such as nacetylltyrosineethyl ester were not hydrolyzed the protease was SD over a broad range of ph at degrees c h and was particularly thermostable t min at degrees c ph in the presence of ca mm macromolecules and ca also provide protection against the significant autolysis which occurs at pure protease concentrations greater than mgmo as well as against surface denaturation which is enhanced by the presence of a silicone antifoam agent hence the stability of protease in submerged cultures is rationalized
67,mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome mcls is a newly recognized disease characterized by fever persisting for more than days an erythematous skin eruption conjunctival congestion dry red fissured lips reddened tongue palms and soles nonpurulent lymphadenopathy and sometines diarrhea arthralgia and aseptic meningitis additional features may include carditis pericarditis aneurysmal dilation and thrombosis of coronary arteries and sudden death there is a striking similarity of fatal cases to infantile polyarteritis nodosa a disease recently reported to be associated with elevated levels of serium ige indeed it is likely that mcls represents a disease which can progress to polyarteritis nodosa in infants and young children the paired acute and convalescent serum ige C2 of subjects with acute nonfatal mcls were studied along with nearage unaffected controls from the same communities in japan the results indicate that most if not all subjects with mcls in the study had an elevation of total SS ige during the acute phase of the disease geometric mean iuml compared with the control value of iuml p the level appeared to reach a peak weeks T3 ON and declined over the ensuing months
68,the kinetics of vascular smooth musclw activity was studied by means of afterloaded isotonic contractions of the tetanized rat portal vein at varied ph pca and during noradrenaline incubation mugml under control conditions ph pca the following parameters of the force velocity relation were calculated a of hills equation relating to the isometric peak tension b relating to the actual ML mls vm trelating to the actual muscle length mls within the range of pca between and the amount of force generation delta p depended on the extracellular calcium level whereas the extrapolated velocity of shortening of the unloaded preparation vm did not also ph changes between and as well as noradrenaline incubation at a ph of affected delta p quite considerably but vm only scarcely at a ph of however vm was distinctly diminished and a reduced calcium sensitivity of the atpase was inferred from the shift of ed of extracellular calcium from mm ca at a ph of to mm ca at a ph of p less than it is concluded from these results that the experimental conditionspca between and ph between and and noradrenaline added at a ph of obviously NC the intracellular calcium concentration which influences the number of activated interaction CS rather than the velocity of crossbridge movement
69,the reflex ART elicited by rapid intravenous infusions of a blood substitute was studied in chronic cats with spinal sections at c all animals could breath spontaneously the day T3 section the average RHR hr and arterial pressure ap were beatsmin and mmhg respectively vagal blockade with atropine mgkg iv was performed prior to each infusion increasing the average hr to beatsmin in infusions in cats the average increase in hr was beatsmin range from to beatsmin a tachycardia was observed in all but five trials four of which were obtained in two cats that subsequently responded with a tachycardia in seven animals the neural circuit mediating the response was partially or totally interrupted by section of several thoracic dorsal roots tt or tt and of the spinal cord at the inferior level of these sections between t and t the tachycardia response was progressively reduced and finally abolished by these procedures these experiments indicate that spinal neural mechanisms are likely to contribute to the phenomenon first described by bainbridge
70,phosphoglycerate mutase has been purified from methanolgrown hyphomicrobium x and pseudomonas ami by acid precipitation heat treatment ammonium sulphate fractionation sephadex g gel filtration and deaecellulose column chromatography the purification attained using the hyphomicrobium x extract was fold and using the pseudomonas ami extract fold the enzyme purity as shown by analytical polyacrylamide gel PACE was from hyphomicrobium x and from pseudomonas ami the enzyme activity was associated with one band the purified preparations did not contain detectable amounts of phosphoglycerate kinase phosphopyruvate hydratase phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase or glycerate kinase activity the molecular weight of the enzymic preparation was the enzyme from both organisms was SD at low temperatures and in the presence of diphosphoglyceric acid could withstand exposure to high temperatures the enzyme from pseudomonas ami has a broad ph optimum at to whilst the enzyme from hyphomicrobium x has an optimal activity at ph the cofactor diphosphoglyceric acid was required for maximum enzyme activity and high concentrations of phosphoglyceric acid were GABA the km values for the hyphomicrobium x enzyme were phosphoglyceric acid x m phosphoglyceric acid x m diphosphoglyceric acid x m and for the pseudomonas ami enzyme x m x m and x m respectively the equilibrium constant for the reaction was in the direction of phosphoglyceric acid to phosphoglyceric acid and in the reverse direction the standard free SE for the reaction proceeding from phosphoglyceric acid to phosphoglyceric acid was kj mol and in the reverse direction kj mol
71,studied were bacteriologically a total of birds affected with acute mareks disease broilers growing layers and adult layers as well as healthy control birds of the same three categories a chemical analysis was performed of the red and white meat of of the diseased pullets and of the diseased AD layers as well as of of the affected broilers the investigation included the same numbers of the control birds extractions of the sampled meat were studied in terms of catalase number ph value and peroxydase activity it was found that enterobacteria in the viscera of the diseased birds were three to nine times more frequently encountered than in the same organs of the controls in two cases salmonella bacteria were also isolated from the affected chickens in three cases there were enterobacteria in the red musculature of these birds the meat of the diseased birds had higher water content higher catalase number and ph value with lower contents of proteins fats and mineral matter the only exception was the red meat of these birds which had higher content of crude protein as compared with the red meat of the normal birds
72,in HS the EA diphosphoglycerate dpg concentration which modifies the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin decreased by more than per cent within minutes of the beginning of a fructose infusion gkg body weighth in contrast erythrocyte adenosine triphosphate atp concentration was unchanged in spite of the diminished dpg concentrations the P50 of whole blood actually measured remained unaltered however at the same time both the arterial and the venous blood ph had fallen by or more in vitro experiments indicated that this fall of EA dpg was not due to a direct effect of fructose on the intraerythrocytic regulation of dpg or to changes indirectly related to the intravenous administration of fructose in vivo ie an increase of the blood lactatepyruvate ratio or a decrease of plasma inorganic phosphate it is suggested that two opposing effects on the oxygen transport system of blood are induced by fructose infusions a displacement of the oxygen dissociation curve to the right due to the bohr effect a virtually counterbalancing shift of the oxygen dissociation curve to the left due to decreased erythrocyte dpg concentrations
73,boys and years with unilateral or BL undescended testes or anorchia were studied retention was severe canalicular or IA in and moderate in of the cases in unilateral retention the volume of the scrotal testis was usually normal throughout childhood whereas pubertal testicular growth was delayed in unilateral anorchia the scrotal testis showed compensatory hypertrophy in all age groups examined the mean volume of the undescended testes was abnormally small undescended testes were accompanied by abnormalities of the epididymis in of cases of the ductus deferens in and of the spermatic vessels in in anorchia such abnormalities were found regularly inguinal hernia accompanied of the undescended testes and was most frequent in severe cases patients aged years with unilateral undescended testis had T3 BA cytogenic investigations of patients revealed one case of klinefelters syndrome xxy gonadotrophin treatment was tried in patients and was succesful in surgical results were satisfactory in of the operated testes
74,angus and hereford sperm motility was evaluated by an objective spectrophotometric procedure and by a conventional subjective ranking system semen was collected by electroejaculation and divided so that one group contained angus samples and one group contained HH samples objective procedures indicated that angus sperm was twice motile as HH sperm in sodium citrate this objective procedure depends on the orientation of sperm in a flowing liquid and then spectrophotometrically measuring the sperms ability to return to randomness when the flow is stopped during preparation for freezing with liquid nitrogen microscopic subjective ranking of sperm motility was carried out three conditions were studied subjectively i arrival at the laboratory ii prefreeze and iii thawed samples no significant differences in subjective evaluation of sperm motility was found between conditions or breeds preliminary results indicate that this objective procedure can distinguish between the sperm motility in sodium citrate from two breeds of cattle use of this objective procedure for studies relating to fertilization and artificial insemination is evident and there is no theoretical reason why the procedure can not be used with other species
75,comparative studies of protein structure and function can be quite interesting by themselves and even more interesting when interpreted with respect to an animals physiology in the case of fish hemoglobins some success in the latter has been achieved but there are still many unsolved problems it appears that comparative physiology and biochemistry have entered an era where results from comparative studies can shed a great deal of light on biochemical mechanisms in GA the trout hemoglobin system is an example distinctive hemoglobins in this system are presently being used as high resolution probes of the ligandbinding mechanism characterization of the multiple structurally distinct subunits of the s limulus hemocyanin molecule may similarly aid in understanding its CF our studies suggest the possibility of using limulus hemocyanin and other hemocyanins as structural homologs and analogs of more complex macromolecular arrays the rapid development of molecular structural data from xray crystallographers combined with the vast data of comparative physiology and biochemistry makes this one of the most exciting areas in present day science
76,a study has been made of the formation of synapses in developing reinnervated and crossreinnervated amphibian twitch muscles which receive either a focal iliofibularis or a distributed sartorius innervation from en plaque nerve terminals using histological ultrastructural and electrophysiological techniques during the development of the tadpole through metamorphosis to the adult frog the sartorius myofibres increased in length at about twice the rate of the iliofibularis myofibres due to a fast rate of growth at their insertions on to the pelvic tendon the short iliofibularis and sartorius myofibres of young tadpoles mum long possessed only a single synapse and the iliofibularis myofibres did not receive any further innervation during development however the sartorius myofibres received further transient innervation on the new muscle laid down during development at the fast growing pelvic insertion until the distance between the original synapse formed on the myofibres and the synapse at the pelvic end of the muscle was about mm during OD synapses possessed either skewed multimodal or unimodal mepp amplitudefrequency distributions the intervals between mepps were not distributed randomly according to a poisson process as mepps of similar amplitudes tended to be separated by very short intervals the unitsize epp had a similar amplitudefrequency distribution as the mepps if these had a unimodal distribution reinnervation or crossreinnervation of the sartorius and the iliofibularis muscles in adults or at a late stage of development simply reconstituted the normal focal and distributed innervation patterns of the muscles as found in the control muscles of the CL and unoperated legs these observations on synapse formation in amphibia are consistent with the hypothesis that during OD the axon making the initial synaptic contact on the muscle cells induces a property over a length of muscle membrane adjacent to this site which makes it refractory to synapse formation thus during reinnervation or crossreinnervation of AD muscles this refractory property constrains synapse formation to these sites
77,the isolated cremaster muscle preparation and spermatic nervecremaster muscle preparation of the guineapig were studied in vitro to determine their suitability as pharmacological test models the preparation was contracted by acetylcholine carbachol succinylcholine and decamethonium pd values and respectively through an action on a curaresensitive cholinoceptor lobeline and dmpp were ineffective nicotine contracted the muscle but there was tachyphylaxis TC and hexamethonium presumably competitively antagonized acetylcholine pa values and lobeline was a noncompetitive antagonist pd value atropine and mecamylamine exerted a dualistic action against acetylcholine final pd values and respectively TC succinylcholine and C10 exhibited their typical action when tested with spermatic nervecremaster muscle preparation the latter two drugs also produced muscle spasm hexamethonium was a weak blocker of NMT atropine mecamylamine lobeline and dmpp exhibited NM blocking activity however directly evoked muscle twitches were also notably affected the cremaster muscle preparations seem to add usefully to the list of currently used in vitro tests with the added advantage that a mammalian skeletal muscle model is used for simultaneous quantitative studies
78,two adrenergic aerosols were compared in a double blind matchedpair study of months duration in adult patients with chronic bronchial asthma and in a double blind crossover shortterm study in children with severe asthma in the adult T0 one member of each pair was given either mug of isoproterenol or mug of carbuterol times per day by inhalation for months in the childhood study children to years of age with moderate to severe asthma were studied in a double blind crossover therapeutic trial in which high or low doses of aerosolized carbuterol or isoproterenol were given times daily for days each treatment results were evaluated by measuring forced vital capacity sec forced expiratory volume and maximal midexpiratory flow fef at regulat intervals before and C2 of the respective test drugs in the adult T0 there was a significant difference between carbuterol and isoproterenol for forced vital capacity p less than for sec forced expiratory volume p less than and for fef p less than in favor of carbuterol in the pediatric study the difference between carbuterol and isoproterenol was significant p less than only for the fef on the fifth day of treatment with the high dose administration of carbuterol there was no associated toxicity of either drug with respect to electrocardiogram blood chemistry or subjective complaints tachyphylaxis tolerance with time to isoproterenol appeared to develop in one patient
79,nitration of tyrosine has been investigated as a means for chemically introducing lanthanide chelating CS at known positions in proteins the lowfield portions of the mhz and mhz h nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of native and chemically modified bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor have been studied in the presence of lanthanide ions comparisons of spectral changes observed with native mononitro tryosine and dinitro tyrosines and derivatives enable these changes to be separately attributed to metal bound at nitrotyrosine nitrotyrosine or the set of five carboxyl groups the ph dependence of priii and euiii induced chemical shifts yields stability constants of and m for the association between lanthanides and nitrotyrosines and respectively rho times for the interactions with gdiii bound to TPS nitrotyrosines are estimated from the induced L1 broadening of resonances of the nitrotyrosine ring protons these stability constants and correlation times are used to determine the distances from the different metal binding CS to buried backbone nh protons having resolved resonances comparisons with distances in the xray crystal structure give assignments of the nh resonances to a small set of buried backbone nhs
80,in the uk contribution to the ha human adaptibility section of ibp genetic and anthropological studies have focused on three concerns first attempts have been made in a number of investigation to gain additional descriptive information about the genetic compostition of the worlds populations concentrating on blood groups blood enzymes serum proteins and other polmorphic markers important gaps have been filled in our knowledge of the geographical paterns of human R2 and of the affinities of populations wig and characterizing populations which were being studied for other purposes for example it was of critical concern in interpreting results to know in the investigations of climatic physiology and nutrition in ethiopia and israel whether the various groups studied in different environments were genetically the same or not finally attention was focused in a number of investigations especially those in new guinea tristan da cunha tanzania and the orkneys on the factors which determine the genetic structure of populations in these the effects of such phenomena as inbreeding genetic drift founder effects migration and gene flow and the relation between genetic variety and health were examined and much attention was given to the interaction between demographic forces and genetics
81,several alkylating agents of widely varying reported carcinogenicity dimethylsulfate diethylsulfate ethylmethanesulfonate methylnitrosourea ethylnitrosourea and ethylnitrosoguanidine were reacted with polyu at ph values ranging from to all nucleophilic centers internal phosphate groups ribose hydroxyls and o n and o CS of the uracil base were found reactive though to different extents at neutrality and in slightly acid solution the distribution of products is a CF of the alkylating agent and ph the nitroso EDC are more reactive toward oxygens than are dialkylsulfates and alkylalkanesulfonates the ratio of n o alkyl products is strongly ph dependent primarily due to the n being most reactive at the higher ph values while the diester is most reactive at the lower ph values the extent of reaction of the o o or o or ribose is not greatly affected over the ph range tested at ph alkyl ribophosphotriesters mainly lose alchol to reform a SD phosphodiester with increasing oh concentration the favored reaction is chain scission at the op bond
82,effective renal plasma flow glomerular filtration rate and cardiac output were measured in osmotically loaded dogs before and during comparable acute respiratory and MA urine SO increased in control dogs and in animals with metabolic acidosis but declined with respiratory acidosis effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate declined with respiratory and metabolic acidosis when respiratory acidosis was buffered with sodium bicarbonate urine volume increased and glomerular filtration rate and ERP renal plasma flow were unchanged with trihydroxymethylaminomethane urine volume increased but glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow fell when metabolic acidosis was buffered with sodium bicarbonate urine volume increased with trihydroxymethylaminomethane urine volume increased but glomerular filtration rate fell cardiac output declined only during MA both buffered and unbuffered these studies demonstrate that even with osmotic loading respiratory acidosis caused a decrease in glomerular filtration rate effective renal plasma flow and urine volume metabolic acidosis depresses glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow but does not change UV even though cardiac output falls sodium bicarbonate is mor effective than trihydroxymethylaminomethane in preserving renal CF during respiratory and metabolic acidosis
83,three forms of alphadmannosidase have previously been identified in rat liver and each is localized in a different subcellular fraction lysosomes golgi membranes and cytosol this communication reports the purification and characterization the cytosolic form the enzyme was purified fold in good yield to approximately purity with the aid of the competitive inhibitor mannosylamine and dithioerythritol as stabilizers the molecular weight of the enzyme is in the range of to depending on the method used since the subunit molecular weight is by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide PACE the enzyme is probably a tetramer the ph optimum was shown to be between and in the presence of mm cocl with the substrate pnitrophenylalphadmannoside normal MM kinetics were observed with a km of mm mannosylamine was a competitive inhibitor with a ki of mm the purified enzyme stabilized by co mn and fe under some conditions was unstable at low protein concentrations since an electrophoresed sample showed a positive periodic acidschiff stain the enzyme may contain carbohydrate the availability of purified cytosolic alphadmannosidase should now make it possible to carry out ATP specificity immunological and structural studies which may shed light on the biological role of this enzyme
84,pulmonary and cutaneous o consumption vo and co production vco were measured simultaneously in bullfrogs rana catesbeiana at degrees c the lungs were responsible for of the total vo and of the total vco the distribution of the total exchange between the lungs and skin depended on VO2 frogs with higher rates relied more heavily on the pulmonary mode for both vo and vco when prevented from ventilating their lungs in an orich environment bullfrogs developed severe respiratory acidosis demonstrating the importance of lung exchange in normal acidbase balance when frogs were totally submerged in an osaturated medium skin vco increased linearly to a steadystate value which approximated the preapneic total vco in these same animals arterial pco increased proportionately to the increase in skin vco indicating that skin DWI capacity for co was unaffected we conclude that the control of breathing in the bullfrog in response to changes in metabolic rate relies predominantly on changes in lung ventilation while the skin plays a more passive role
85,a CF protein synthesis system employing ribosomes from wi human 2C fibroblasts was developed and its optimum mgc and kc levels and ph value found the rate at which ribosomes are able to incorporate radioactive leucine into proteins cleucine incorporation min mug rrna and the number of growing peptide chains hpuromycinpeptides formed mug rrna was determined when confluent monolayers of wi cells were stimulated to proliferate by serum a transient increase in the rate of peptide elongation by ribosomes was observed at min after stimulation this increase was not affected by the presence of actinomycin d mugml in the stimulating medium a change in the relative amount of certain ribosomeassociated proteins accompanied the increased elongation rate of peptide growth the alteration in associated proteins could not be accounted for by an increased synthesis of protein finally the early activation of ribosomes in stimulated wi cells appears to result from the removal of an inhibitors of ribosome function
86,proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was employed to study the solution conformations of the neutral protonated and dissociated forms of the therapeutically active betadarabinofuranosyladenine araa in particular in strongly basic medium increasing alkalinity led to pronounced changes in chemical shifts and coupling constants of some pentose protons due to ionization of the pentose hydroxyls especially the oh the neutral form of araa may be characterized as approx cendo and approx gauchegauche hence somewhat different from that of the therapeutically active betadarabinofuranosylcytosine arac by contrast the conformations of the anionic forms of both of these are identical predominantly greater than cendo and gauchegauche with the aid of the omethyl derivatives of araa and arac where only the oh ionizes and the accompanying conformational changes are similar it follows that the conformation cendo and gauchegauche for all the foregoing is constrained to this form via a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond viz oho the influence of the foregoing hydrogen bond on the chemical shifts of the adenine h in the araa anion points to the existence of the latter in the form anti a similar effect of the doubly ionized phosphate group on h in araamp shows the nucleotide to also prefer the form anti as previously demonstrated for amp the conformations of the sugar rings of the neutral forms of araa and adenosine in aqueous medium differ appreciably whereas in the solid state they are very similar pmr spectroscopy is shown to be an effective method for following sugar hydroxyl dissociation the extent of ionization of a given hydroxyl is provided by the resulting chemical shifts of neighbouring geminal and vicinal protons when ionization is accompanied by a NC in conformation the process may be followed also by changes in protonproton vicinal coupling constants
87,the potencies of reference morphine antagonists have been compared in a modified version of the mouse jumping test mice were each implanted subcutaneously with one mg pellet of morphine antagonist challenge took place h later and the incidence of repetitive verticaljumping was monitored over h a high pearson correlation coefficient r was found between quantitative assays based on the total number of jumps per mouse and quantal assays based on mice jumping at least times a comparison of relative potencies obtained with the mouse test and with nonwithdrawn morphinedependent monkeys gave a spearman rank order coefficient of while a similar comparison with values obtained with the guineapig isolated ileum preparation also gave a high rho coefficient r whereas it is difficult to assess the antagonistic component of buprenorphine and cyclorphan with the ileum preparation both compounds can be satisfactorily assayed in the mouse jumping test the reported antagonistic properties of ketocyclazocine and profadol could not be confirmed in the mouse model
88,the properties of the hyperpolarizationactivated sarcolemmal slow conductance increase in frog sartorius muscle fibers have been investigated using EDTA disodium salt edta and propionate ringer solution more than sec was required for maximum activation of the sarcolemmal slwo conductance increase it is suggested that although the sarcolemmal slow conductance increase was affected by deterioration the conductance increase is not a direct product of deterioration but it represents a property of the sarcolemma which is encountered in physiological range the sarcolemmal conductance increase was rather insensitive to the NC in ph of ringer solution it is inferred that the absence of bellying in newly penetrated intact fibers at neutral and alkaline phs is caused mainly by the shunting effect of C1 parallel conductance apparent augmentation with edta of the sarcolemmal conductance increase infers that ca ions affect the conductance increase the conductance increase occurred also in the edtacontaining cldeficient solution the sarcolemmal slow conductance increase has been compared with the NC in GCl reported by hutter and warner and warner
89,the jumping apparatus of the flea which includes highly modified direct and indirect flight muscles is described attention is drawn to the various specializations of the exoskeleton which stiffen the thorax and also provide the click mechanism triggering takeoff a fingerlike invagination of tall cells within the cavity of the developing pleural arch of the pharate AD secretes the resilin pad this is illustrated with coloured photographs it is suggested that winglessness of a mecopteranlike ancestor preadapted fleas to a parasitic lifestyle and that a jumping mode of progression was a primitive feature of the whole order scattered throughout the siphonaptera today are species which have secondarily lost the pleural arch and with it the power to execute large jumps these are usually found among fleas parasitizing mammals inhabiting caves subterranean burrows and runs high aerial nests and snow or icebound habitats large pleural arches are associated with fleas infesting large mobile hosts
90,exposure of isolated cell envelopes from purified infectious elementary eb of chlamydia psittaci to sodium carbonatebicarbonate buffer at ph plus ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta results in partial solubilization of the total protein the released materials represent of the dry weight of the total protein of the total carbohydrate and of the total lipid of the cell envelopes sucrose density gradient centrifugation and sephadex g sepharose b or diethylaminoethylcellulose column chromatography reveal a proteincarbohydratelipid complex of several hundred thousand molecular weight that contains protein sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the isolated eb cell envelopes reveals two major protein bands a and b with estimated molecular masses of approximately and respectively both of which also stain for the presence of carbohydrate and lipid gel electrophoresis of the proteincarbohydratelipid complex reveals two protein bands c and d with estimated molecular weights of approximately and respectively which contain lipid and a small amount of carbohydrate bands a and b are not present in the complex gel electrophoresis of the cell envelope residues after extraction of the complex with alkali and edta shows a single main band corresponding to the position of band b which contains protein carbohydrate and lipid band a is CR missing b and a is believed to be a component of the complex which is split into two subunits on alkali CMS
91,the effect of mum cortisol on cell proliferation in rat glioma strain c ML cultures was investigated cell density measurements showed that cortisoltreated c cells continued to proliferate at maximum log phase rates for to days then cell proliferation ceased as growth in control cultures continued into stationary phase a day period of growth inhibition followed during which cell densities were to lower relative to controls growth resumed subsequently and final cell densities were similar to those of controls the presence of epicortisol the biologically inactive isomer of cortisol in the culture medium did not alter the rate of log phase growth relative to controls during the initial period of continued growth after SE to cortisol the ph of the medium decreased at the same rate in control and treated cultures during the growthinhibitory period erythrosin b dye was excluded equally well greater than by control and treated cells and no morphological differences were detected by phase contrast microscopy when the SC medium was replaced daily the control cells at elevated densities continued to proliferate at a reduced rate in cortisoltreated cultures the period of growth inhibition commenced days after the cells were exposed initially to cortisol a day period of growth inhibition followed during which the ph of the dayold media from both control and treated cultures decreased from to growth resumed subsequently in the treated cultures to produce elevated cell densities similar to those of controls these results demonstrate that cortisol at concentrations considered chemotherapeutic in vivo exerts a transient GABA effect on c glioma cell proliferation
92,the selfassociation of the antiacetylcholine drugs propantheline bromide methantheline bromide and methixene hydrochloride in aqueous solution has been examined by surface tension CS scattering and conductimetric methods surface tension graphs were similar to those of conventional surfactants showing apparent critical micelle concentrations cmc at distinct inflection points surface tension measurements in the presence of increasing amounts of electrolyte indicated a decrease in the apparent cmc with increase in electrolyte concentration for propantheline bromide light scattering curves for propantheline bromide in electrolyte solution showed no significant discontinuity attributable to a cmc a mode of self association involving aggregate growth by the stepwise addition of monomers was assumed and equilibrium constants for the initial stages of the association were evaluated an increase in the magnitude of the stepwise association constants with increase in electrolyte concentration was noted integration of the light scattering data according to n x oo mmapp dln c where m and m app are the monomer and apparent aggregate weights respectively and x is the weight fraction of monomers showed an asymptotic increase in monomer concentration towards a limiting concentration as the solution concentration c was increased limiting monomer concentrations determined by this method were in reasonable agreement with the apparent cmcs from surface tension studies it was not possible to detect a cmc for methantheline or propantheline bromide from conductivity measurements
93,pulmonary edema due to disorders in alveolocapillary permeability or lesional are differentiated from hemodynamic pulmonary edema by the fact that they arise in spite of normal pulmonary capillary pressure pcp a hemodynamic study was carried out in cases of lesional pe the pcp was normal whatever the date of the examination and the gravity of the pe PAH was only found in the presence of frank hypoxemia and disappeared with the correction of the latter if there was no hemodynamic profile due to pe itself its etiology sometimes induced a hyperkinetic or hypovolemic syndrome finally it was apparent that pcp was significantly higher although normal at the initial stage than T3 hours of pe that an elevation in pcp of only a few mm hg by the perfusion of colloids aggravated the pe that despite the normal value for the pcp dehydration evidently improved hematosis thus this T0 confirms that numerous cases of pe can occur while the pcp remains normal it also confirms the noxious nature of too abundant perfusions in these cases and the effectiveness of dehydration
94,the kinetic inhibition of the gelation of hemoglobin s is compared to the change in HbS soulbility when the solubility is altered by carbon monoxide ph or urea by means of a new technique the delay time and the extent of gelation are measured on the same sample they delay time td is found to be proportional to a high power of the hemoglobin s solubility togehter with the previously reported concentration dependence this result demonstrates that the rate is proportional to a high power of the SS s defined as the ratio of the total HbS concentration to the equilibrium solubility the results obey the SS equation td gammasn where gamma is an empirical constant about sec and n is about the supersaturation equation can successfully account for observations on the kinetics of cell sickling and is therefore used to estimate the increase in the delay time for sickling necessary to produce significant clinical benefit to patients with sickle cell disease
95,the degradation of neoagarotetraose and neoagarobiose by cytophaga flevensis was investigated the organism possesses an enzyme that hydrolyzes the tetramer by cleavage of its central betagalactosidic linkage the product of this reaction neoagarobiose is further hydrolyzed enzymatically to dgalactose and anhydrolgalactose both enzyme activities were localized in the cytoplasm attempts were made to partially purify the respective enzymes and although a foldpurification was achieved the final preparation contained both neoagarotetraase and neoagarobiase activities evidence was obtained that these MICs were due to different enzymes neoagarotetraase is highly specific for oligosaccharides containing neoagarobiose units the rate of hydrolysis is greatest with neoagarotetraose it cannot hydrolyze pyruvated neoagarotetraose optimal conditions for its activity were ph and c neoagarobiase hydrolyzes only neoagarobiose and neoagarobiitol and optimal conditions for activity were ph and c both enzymes were inhibited by ag hg and zn ions and by pcmb which indicates that thiol groups are present in their active centres both enzymes were induced by neoagarooligosaccharides and melibiose and were repressed when glucose was added to the medium neoagarobiase was also induced by dgalacturonic acid in continuous culture the rate of enzyme production was maximal at a dilution rate of h
96,in rat liver cells isolated by perfusion in the perfusion in the presence of MMP-8 the L1 portion of cytochrome p is present in the oxidized nonsubstratebound low spin state drug addition to a suspension of CL cells results in the rapid formation of the cytochrome p fesubstrate complex which in turn is followed by the appearance of other species with different spectral characteristics before steady state drug monooxygenation is achieved cytochrome plinked metabolism of various tested drugs and carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons by isolated rat liver cells is as fast or faster as with rat liver microsomes supplemented with a nadph generating system both experimental models respond similarily to phenobarbital or methylcholanthrene i.c.v. of the animals and to various of the wellknown inhibitors of drug metabolism except with liver cells isolated from fasted phenobarbitaltreated rats generation of cytosolic nadph seems sufficient to support optimal drug metabolism even in the absence of added substrates of intermediary metabolism in isolated CL cells oxidized drug metabolites undergo subsequent metabolic conversion most often to form the corresponding glucuronides and sulphates these are readily excreted whereas nonconjugated products eg free phenols tend to accumulate intracellularly cellular glucuronide formation is strongly inhibited by ethanolpresumably due to an unfavorable effect of the increased nadhnad ratio on the synthesis of uridinediphosphoglucuronic acid udpga in contrast low concentrations of ethanol have no or only a slight stimulatory effect on the cytochrome plinked step of drug metabolism and there are indications that the oxidation of low concentrations of ethanol is in fact stimulated by a facilitated reoxidation of cytosolic nadh occuring during drug monooxygenation
97,the surface potentials of mixed monolayers of synthetic phospholipids with lipids that are fusogenic for hen erythrocytes were investigated at ph and but not at ph mixed monolayers of the fusogenic lipid GMO with phosphatidylcholine exhibited negative deviations from the ideality rule in surface potential per molecule which were accompanied by negative deviations in mean molecular area interactions of this type were not seen with chemically related but nonfusogenic lipids nor were they found in mixed monolayers of any of the lipids with phosphatidylethanolamine experiments with dihexadecyl phosphate and hexadecyltrimethylammonium indicated that the complete head group of phosphatidylcholine is required for its observed behaviour with fusogenic lipids bivalent cations ca uo or zn in the subphase at ph significantly modified the behaviour of mixed monolayers of fusogenic lipids with phospholipids there was a parallel perturbing effect of fusogenic lipids on interactions between monolayers of phospholipids and bivalent cations possible molecular interactions of fusogenic lipids with membrane phospholipids and the role of ca are discussed which may be relevant to cell fusion in erythrocytes induced by lowmelting lipids in the presence of ca
98,when plasma proteins are diluted with buffer the ionic strength and ionic composition of that buffer affects the interactions between thyroxine t and its plasma proteinbinding sites increases in phosphate chloride or barbiturate ion concentration from to mmoll caused a significant decrease in the affinity of plasma proteins for t and a concurrent increase in the concentration of unbound t these results cannot be completely accounted for by changes in ionic strength since at the same ionic strength different anions caused quantitatively different effects on unbound t concentration the degree of depression of t IB by the three anions studied was in the order barbiturate greater than chloride greater than phosphate the results of a systematic study on the composition of diluent buffer systems indicated that when a mmsodium phosphate mmnacl buffer ph was used as a plasma diluent there were unlikely to be gross changes in the tbinding properties of plasma proteins with dilution
99,two new doubleheaded protease inhibitors from blackeyed peas have amino acid compositions typical of the low molecular weight protease inhibitors from legume seeds blackeyed pea chymotrypsin and trypsin inhibitor bepci contains no tryptophan tyrosine and halfcystines out of amino acid residues per monomer blackeyed pea trypsin inhibitor bepti contains no tryptophan tyrosine and halfcystines out of residues per monomer the molar extinctions at nm are for bepci and for bepti the single tyrosyl residue is very inaccessible to solvent in native bepci and bepti at neutral ph and titrates anomalously with an apparent pk ionization of tyrosine is CR in hours above ph no heterogeneity of the local environment of the tyrosyl residues in different subunits can be detected spectrophotometrically the large number of cystine residues leads to an intense and complex nearultraviolet cd spectrum with cystine contributions in the regions of and nm and tyrosine contributions at and nm an intact disulfide structure is required for appearance of the tyrosyl cd bands the inhibitors are unusually resistant to denaturation when compared with similar low molecular weight proteins of high disulfide content all observations are consistent with a far more rigid structure for bepci and bepti than for a typical protein
100,in this inestigation a determination of the isoenzyme contents of ldh and hbd MICs in lactate dehydrogenase preparations and the differences in the interaction of these preparations with nad analogues were examined the results obtained were as follows the activity ratio between oxidation and reduction in ldh reaction is shown to be similar in both h and m preparations whereas for hbd activity the ratio seems to be lower in the m preparation than in hhm nad and its analogues nxd tnad and tnxd are shown to be useful coenzymes for the ldh reaction while acetyl derivatives appear to be unsuitable for this purpose because of their lower activity hbd activity with acetyl nxd is shown to be higher than with tnad or tnxd among these nad analogues acetyl nxd gives the highest hbd activity especially in the m preparation the ldh activity of h relative to m preparations has been shown to be maximal when mm lactic acid with nad or mm lactic acid with tnxd are used under these conditions the contents of ldh subunits can be estimated with considerable reliability as to hbd activity the content of ldh S1 having hbd activity has been estimated by determing the enzyme activity under conditions in which either mm hydroxybutyrate with acetyl nxd or mm hydroxybutyrate with nad are employed
101,the intracellular ph was measured in growing clostridium pasteurianum with and acidbase equilibrium distribution method cdimethyloxazolidinedione methylamine and cacetic acid were used as deltaphindicators during growth the extracellular ph decreased from to simultaneously the intracellular ph changed from to thus the intracellular ph was more alkaline than the extracellular ph by to phunits this ph gradient interior alkaline was abolished by the proton conductor carbonylcyanide mchlorophenylhydrazone and the atpase inhibitor nndicyclohexylcarbodiimide the ph gradient could not be demonstrated in cells depleted of an energy ATP these results suggest that the ph gradient is formed by an atpasedriven extrusion of protons from the cells rather than by a donnan potential growth of the organism was inhibited by low concentrations of both carbonylcyanide mchlorophenylhydrazone mum and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide mum this finding suggests that the ph gradient is essential for the growing cell as it may be required for ATP accumulation and other types of transport processes
102,the potencies relative to isoprenaline of isoetharine tertiary butyl noradrenaline salbutamol orciprenaline me rimiterol fenoterol carbuterol and terbutaline on isolated preparations of guineapig trachea and blood vessels perfused hind limb were determined all the compounds were selective for tr and selectivity values ie RP on trachea divided by relative potency on hind limb ranged from to responses to isoprenaline the REF compound tertiary butyl noradrenaline and isoetharine were potentiated on trachea by mum phenoxybenzamine phb and by other inhibitors of extraneuronal uptake enu under these conditions the selectivity values of all the EDC was close to unity selectivity values were also close to unity if they were calculated from data obtained without enu inhibition provided that only those compounds not potentiated by phb on trachea were used it is proposed that the tracheablood vessel selectivity shown by betaadrenoceptor stimulants can be caused by the influence of enu upon them rather than by their ability to distinguish between two betaadrenoceptors the suggestion that differences exist between betaadrenoceptors in respiratory and vascular smooth muscle is not supported by the in vitro experiments described
103,the metabolism of cgriseofulvin has been compared in rat liver microsomes isolated perfused rat livers and rats with bile duct cannulas in all three preparations desmethylgriseofulvin and desmethylgriseofulvin were the major metabolites the ratio of total desmethylgriseofulvin to desmethylgriseofulvin formed was and in liver microsomes isolated perfused livers and rats with bile duct cannulas respectively T3 a min incubation with liver microsomes most of the GF remained unchanged only small amounts of desmethylgriseofulvin of dose and desmethylgriseofulvin of dose were formed in isolated perfused CL most of the drug of dose was excreted into bile within hr primarily as desmethylgriseofulvin of dose and methylgriseofulvin of dose in animals with bile duct cannulas of the dose was excreted into bile and of the dose into urine within hours in bile of the dose was excreted as desmethylgriseofulvin and of the dose as desmethylgriseofulvin whereas in urine the drug was excreated predominantly as desmethylgriseofulvin of dose with only a small amount of desmethylgriseofulvin of dose during the first hr these results show that there is good rho in the metabolic fate of cgriseofulvin in the liver microsomes isolated perfused liver and rats with bile duct cannulas in addition to the similar ratio of desmethylgriseofulvin to desmethylgriseofulvin there is also an PA in the extent of metabolism and biliary excretion in isolated perfused CL and in rats with bile duct cannulas which suggests that the IPL is an important technique for studying drug metabolism in animals
104,a method for measuring bidirectional cl fluxes has been used to estimate net cl movements in shortcircuited frog skin and to compare these with the shortcircuit current isc and na fluxes in some experiments bidirectional fluxes of both na and cl were measured simultaneously it was found that the algebraic sum of the net fluxes of these two ions did not differ significantly from the values of isc either in UT or catecholaminetreated skins except for the halfhour period immediately after catecholamine addition the net effluxes of cl produced by noradrenaline x m isoprenaline x m and adrenaline and x m were of similar magnitude for each catecholamine the magnitude of the cl response measured as a flux ratio was related to a certain extent to the precatecholamine GCl the net na influx was increased by isoprenaline and reduced by noradrenaline addition of the betaadrenergic blocking agent oxprenolol x m to skins stimulated by catecholamine resulted in the disappearance of the net cl movement and fall in skin conductance and isc this fall was similar in magnitude to and correlated with the mean rise in isc produced by isoprenaline but of significantly greater magnitude in the case of noradrenaline the changes in na influx were strongly associated with the changes in isc following catecholamine addition similarly the changes in na efflux and cl efflux were correlated suggesting the na fluxes to be dissociated influx and efflux changes perhaps taking place at different loci acetazolamide x m added either before or during the noradrenaline stimulation had no effect on the cl efflux response the tissue exchange of cl from the outside bathing medium T3 hr was greater in catecholaminestimulated skins than in those in which the response had been blocked by oxprenolol these findings were taken to support a MM entailing a neutral nacl pump resident in the mucous glands and an epithelial na pump enhanced by beta and inhibited by alphaadrenergic stimulation
105,seven healthy males were studied during cycle ergometer exercise at and of vo max on three occasions when nhc nahco or caco as a control substance were administered in gelatin capsules double blind and in randomized order plasma growth hormone hgh LA and hydrogen ion concentration h were measured at frequent intervals ammonium chloride produced highest blood h and nahco the lowest these differences were maintained during exercise and in recovery plasma lactic acid concentrations were similar at rest at vo max and recovery LA was highest with nahco and lowest with nhc exercise stimulated hgh secretion in all studies and the elevation was proportional to the intensity of the exercise nhc caused a VL elevation of hgh at rest and vo max at vo max plasma hgh was significantly elevated to similar concentrations in all studies and at vo max hgh was highest with nahco an infusion of sodium llactate producing plasma lactate concentrations of mmoll did not influence hgh secretion exercise is a physiological stimulus to hgh secretion and the mechanism is independent of blood h and lactate concentrations
106,EP techniques have been employed to examine the nature of the response observed in the ectodermal slowconduction system ssi when dissolved food substances contact the column of tealia felina the response seems to consist entirely of sensory activity which may continue for periods of many T2 provided that the stimulatory chemicals remain contacting the column the interval between each evoked pulse gradually increases as the sensory response progresses this does not result from fatigue in the conduction system but involves a genuine process of sensory adaptation this may occur over a period of several minutes which is much longer than comparable adaptation in higher animals physiological evidence suggests that the chemoreceptors involved are dispersed throughout the column ectoderm and are absent from the pedal disc oral disc tentacles and pharynx the basic role of the ssi in coordinating behavioural activity in sea anemones is reviewed it is concluded that it functions primarily as a single diffuseconducting unit responsible for transmitting frequencycoded sensory information from ectodermal chemoreceptors to ectodermal and perhaps endodermal effectors
107,the kinetics of the action of local anesthetics upon firefly luciferin and luciferase systems is presented clinical concentrations of local anesthetics inhibited this atpinduced luminescence in a dosedependent manner from the effects of temperature and ph upon the inhibitory action of the local anesthetics it is concluded that hydrophobic ligandenzyme interaction is the predominant cause of the inhibition but hydrophilic interaction also contributes to the inhibition to a lesser degree a molecular theory of anesthesia is outlined which postulates that release of electrostricted water molecules from the hydrophilic parts of the enzyme due to the protein conformational changes induced by anesthetics is the cause of the decreased luminescence a similar mechanism is expected to occur at the CM which probably dehydrates the sodium channel and suppresses the conductance of this ion across the membrane these events lead to a volume expansion of the total system and the system becomes reactive to a pressure which reverses the anesthesia by shifting the equilibrium to the nonanesthetized original volume the pressure antagonism of anesthesia can be explained by this overall volume expansion and not by a mere swelling of the cell membrane
108,different neuroleptics caused dopamine receptor blockade antagonism against methylphenidateinduced compulsive gnawing for varying lengths of time when the receptor blockade had expired supersensitivity to dopamine agonists occurrence of apomorphineinduced compulsive gnawing and enhancement of methylphenidateinduced gnawing developed and persisted for varying periods of time the degree and duration of supersensitivity was related to the degree and duration of the preceding ARB inhibition of catecholamine or ht synthesis had no influence on development of supersensitivity stimulation with a dopamine agonist apomorphine during the period of the development of supersensitivity did not modify the enhanced receptor supersensitivity a cholinergicdopaminergic balance was shown to be involved in the manifestation of compulsive behavior during the supersensitivity phase tolerance to the dopamine antagonistic effect of a neuroleptic also developed after a single neuroleptic treatment most likely due to increased sensitivity of the receptors for the dopamine agonist it is concluded that the dopamine receptor blockade induced by a single dose of a neuroleptic agent is a dynamic phenomenon which in the course of time is replaced by an increased sensitivity of the receptors to dopamine agonists NE or ht neuron systems do not seem to be involved in the neurolepticinduced supersensitivity whereas a dopaminergiccholinergic balance is operative in the supersensitivity situation
109,in the presence of mm external ca the k permeability of human red cell ghosts increases provided k is also present in the medium this increase does not represent kk exchange but a stimulation of net k efflux the stimulation is halfmaximal at mm n at concentrations above mm external k inhibits net k efflux similar stimulatory and GABA effects of external k were also observed in intact cells T3 exposure to pb or to ca in the presence of fluoride iodoacetate plus adenosine or propranolol suggesting that a common k G1 k TPS transfer system may be involved under all of these various circumstances internal k also stimulates net k efflux from ghosts but it is uncertain whether internal k is an absolute requirement for the k permeability increase in contrast to external na which slightly stimulates k efflux internal na inhibits the inhibition by internal na is abolished by sufficiently high concentrations of external k showing that k binding to the outer membrane surface and na binding to the internal surface are mutually interdependent in red cell ghosts the ca k stimulated net k efflux increases with increasing ph until a plateau is reached between ph and in fluoridepoisoned intact cells the cak stimulated flux passes through a maximum around ph neither internal nor external mg interferes with the combined effects of ca and k similarly external edta has no influence at concentrations which are far lower than the ca concentration required to produce a maximal response in contrast low concentrations of internal edta prevent the permeability change
110,in order to throw light on the problems related to the magnitude and the possibility of maintaining pressor response in the case of bilateral carotid occlusion bco acute experiments were carried out on heparinized cats in chloraloseurethane narcosis and spontaneous respiration the perfusion pressure in a hind leg autoperfused with a RP with a constant flow and the arterial blood pressure were recorded electromanometrically a T0 was made of the changes taking place under the effect of bco in the normal animal in animals in a haemorrhagic state after pharmacological alphaadrenergic blockade haemorrhage after alphaadrenergic blockade retransfusion of blood alphaadrenergic blocking agent and after local application of papaverine it was established that some of the AF determining the haemodynamic state of the organism such as blood volume arterial pressure vascular resistance cardiac SO etc are of great significance for the realization of the pressor response to bco but the haemodynamic state of the animal before the occlusion and the interactions between the abovementioned AF are decisive for the form magnitude and maintenance of the pressor response in bco
111,four extracellular proteolytic enzymes iiv ec were identified in static cultures of chromobacterium lividum ncib by agar gel PACE and isoelectric focusing proteinases iiii were freed of nonenzymic protein by chromatography on teaecellulose and cmcellulose the enzyme mixture was then fractionated in a ph gradient by isoelectric focusing all three enzymes were shown to be heatlabile metalloenzymes optimal activity occurred at ph for enzyme i and at ph for enzymes ii and iii remazolbrilliant bluehide powder was a sensitive substrate for these enzymes proteinase i was also shown to degrade haemoglobin and casein effectively but not myoglobin ovalbumin or bovine serum albumin proteinases iiii exhibited molecular weight values of and by exclusion chromatography and and by sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamidegel electrophoresis for enzyme i and ii respectively the amino acid compositions of enzymes i and ii were somewhat similar proteinase i was inhibited by edta diaminoethoxyethanennnntetraacetic activity mg could substitute for ca or mn for co the interrelationship of proteinases iiii is discussed
112,polymers synthesized by heterotrophically growing gl as carbon source cultures of aphanocapsa were compared with polymers synthesized in photosynthetically grown cultures loss of photosystem ii by dark incubation or inhibition of lightgrown cells with the PS iispecific inhibitor dichlorophenylmethylurea caused an to reduction in the rate of lipid and total ribonucleic acid synthesis and more than a reduction in the rate of protein synthesis in contrast glycogen synthesis was reduced only about in dark cells and less than in dichlorphenylmethylureainhibited cells after longer heterotrophic growth glycogen became the major component whereas in photosynthetically grown cultures protein was the major constituent c from co andor cglucose assimilated into protein by heterotrophically grown cells was found in amino acids in nearly the same proportions as in photosynthetically grown cells thus routes of biosynthesis available to autotropic cells were also available to heterotrophic cultures but the supply of carbon precursors to those pathways was greatly reduced the limited biosynthesis in heterotrophic cells was not due to a limitation for cellular energy the adenylates were maintained at nearly the same concentrations and hence the energy charge also as in photosynthetic cells the concentration of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate was higher in heterotrophic dark cells than in photosynthetic cells from rates of co fixation andor glycogen biosynthesis it was determined that stationaryphase cells expended approximately and less than nmol of adenosine triphosphate per mg dry weight of algae per min during photosynthetic photoheterotrophic and chemoheterotrophic metabolism respectively analysis of the soluble metabolite pools in dark heterotrophic cultures by doublelabeling experiments revealed rapid equilibration of c through the monophosphate pools but much slower movement of label into the diphosphate pools of fructosediphosphate and sedoheptulosediphosphate carbon did flow into phosphoglycerate in the dark however the initial rate was low and the concentration of this metabolite soon fell to an undetectable level in photosynthetic cells c quickly equilibrated throughout all the intermediates of the reductive pentose cycle in particular into phosphoglycerate analysis of glucosephosphate dehydrogenase in cell extracts showed that the enzyme was very sensitive to product inhibition by reduced nicotinamide adenine CpG
113,the ph dependence ph of the hydrolysis of seven hippuric acid esters chconhchcocrrcoh a r r h b r r ch c r h r pclch d r h r ch e r h r chchch f r h r ch g r h r chch by bovine carboxypeptidase a has been investigated and the ph dependence of the ATP activation of ac and the substrate inhibition of dg have been compared for all seven esters the catalytically productive binding of the first ATP molecule depends on enzymatic pka values of and for d e and g the rate of hydrolysis kapp of this complex is ph independent whereas for f kapp depends on a pka of the rate of hydrolysis kapp of the enzymesubstrate complex es is ph independent for dg but for ac kapp depends on the following pka values a and b c the ph dependences of kapp for f and kapp for c are rationalized by the presence of catalytically nonproductive species equivalent es species are believed to be productive for cg however the productive es species for b must be quite different
114,target cell lysis by sensitized cytolytic t lymphocytes ctl may be conveniently quantitated by cr release by fitting to the formula p specfic release enat one obtains alpha the relative frequency of ctl in n lymphoid cells using a microassay and murine sarcoma target cells we observed an unexpected decrease in lysis whenever effectors obtained from a graftvshost reaction were tested at high concentrations this inhibition was not observed with ctl generated by an mlc reaction inhibition could not be explained by nonspecific mechanical crowding reutilization of released isotope suppression of release from dead target cells or the particular strain combination and target used by modifying the formula to allow suppression of ctl by a stochastic cellcell interaction with suppessor cell we found that p enatengamma adequately fitted the data where ngamma is proportional to inhibitor content an to hr incubation at degrees c but not degrees c allowed selective depletion or enrichment of inhibitors in mixing experiments both parameters nalpha t and ngamma behaved stoichiometrically as independent cellular properties the inhibitor was resistant to concentrations of antit cell ramg SS complement which killed tl a similar inhibitor arose in vivo during an antitumour allograft response the ability to quantitate ctl and inhibitor activities from titration curves provides a technique for studying the identity and mechanism of suppressor cells acting at the effector stage of cellmediated immunity
115,our efforts have been directed towards characterizing CAA uptake metabolism and PR in bulkisolated glia and neuronal perikarya studied in parallel with nerveendings especially as it concerns the transmitter amino acids and the participation of glia in the clearing of the synpatic space during impulse conduction a possible neuromodulator role for the glia at the synapse is also suggested by kstimulated release our most definitive conclusions have been based so far on studies with gaba although we are also beginning to accumulate data for glutamate related to glutamateglutamine compartmentation glia preferentially accumulate potassium and amino acids compared to neuronal perikarya have higher nakatpase activity possess highaffinity sodiumdependent uptake systems for gaba and glu similar to the ones in synaptosomes and PR amino acid in response to a potassium pulse by a calciumindependent process low neuronal uptake could be due to loss of dendrites unidirectional gabaflux from the synaptosomal to glial compartment is supported by high gad in nerve endings compared to high gabat in glia glutamine may be a transmitter glutamateprecursor in nerveendings since GA activity is high in nerveendings but low in glia where glutamine is presumably made glutamine uptake in both glia and synaptosomes obeys lowaffinity kinetics in contrast to glutamate consistent with the inability of glutamine to excite the neuronal membrane the studies with gaba which are considerably more extensive are supported by related work using glia in tissueculture and autoradiography there appears to be a suggested difference in the behavior of amines which were poorly taken up by the glial system glia synaptosomes and neuronal perikarya in GA behaved similarly with respect to requirements for uptake and release except in the case of ca which exerted opposite effects on glial and synaptosomal uptake of gaba we believe that work along these lines tends to firmly establish a direct role for glial cells as modulators of neuronal excitability and represents a convergence between transmitter CAA neuropharmacology and cellular biochemistry this not only deepens and enlarges the vocabulary of synaptic biochemistry but also undoubtedly will have L1 clinical applications in the fields of epilepsy and SMB
116,two enzyme MICs which release nucleotides preferentially from the termini of dna were found in tinfected escherichia coli since no corresponding activities were found in uninfected cells the MICs appeared to be induced by t both MICs are capable of excising pyrimidine dimers from ultravioletirradiated dna which has been treated with t endonuclease v one of the activities referred to as t exonuclease b was purified fold from an extract of tv infected cells the enzyme initiates hydrolysis of dna specifically at the termini to yield products which are mainly oligonucleotides of varying length the hydrolysis reaction proceeds in a limited manner the enzyme shows optimal activity at ph and absolutely requires mg the molecular weight of the enzyme as estimated by gel filtration is approximately another activity referred to as t exonuclease c was purified fold from the extract this activity also excises pyrimidine dimers from ultravioletirradiated incised dna and releases nucleotides at termini it has a ph optimum at and requires mg the molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately
117,the action of a number of compounds able to react with thiols was tested on guineapig NF perfused at constant pressure the sh reagents used were nano oxidized glutathione cystamine diamide difluorodinitrobenzene nitroglycerol sodium nitroferricyanide and hgcl dithiodinicotinic acid an sh reagent that does not penetrate the cell produced no effect all the other sh reagents produced an increase in coronary flow all except Ox glutathione and nitroglycerol increased the HR rate the increase in heart rate and oxygen consumption could be completely blocked by dichloroisoproterenol the increase in coronary flow was not affected difluorodinitrobenzene diamide cystamine and nano significantly decreased the acidsoluble thiol content of the heart for these compounds there was a significant correlation between the decrease in coronary flow and the decrease in thiols we conclude that in the isolated heart most sh reagents if used at the appropriate concentration will increase the HR rate probably by relaasing catecholamines they will also decrease the coronary resistance probably by a direct effect on the coronary vessels
118,the amounts of orthophosphate bicarbonate and tris hydroxymethylaminomethane found inside the thylakoid are almost exactly the amounts predicted by assuming that the buffers equilibrate across the membrane since imidazole and pyridine delay the development of postillumination atp formation while increasing the maximum amount of atp formed it follows that such relatively permeant buffers must also enter the inner aqueous space of the thylakoid photophosphorylation begins abruptly at full steadystate efficiency and full steadystate rate as soon as the illumination time exceeds about ms when permeant ions are absent or as soon as the time exceeds about ms if valinomycin and kc are present in either case permeant buffers have little or no effect on the time of illumination required to initiate phosphorylation a concentration of bicarbonate which would delay acidification of the bulk of the inner aqueous phase for at least ms has no effect at all on the time of initiation of phosphorylation in somewhat swollen chloroplasts the combined buffering by the trishydroxymethyl aminomethane and orthophosphate inside would delay acidification of the inside by ms but even in the presence of valinomycin and kc the total delay in the initiation of phosphorylation is then only ms similar discrepancies occur with all of the other buffers mentioned since these discrepancies between internal acidification and phosphorylation are found in the presence of saturating amounts of valinomycin and kc it seems that photophosphorylation can occur when there are no proton concentration gradients and no electrical potential differences across the membranes which separate the medium from the greater part of the internal AQ phase we suggest that the protons produced by electron transport may be used directly for phosphorylation without even entering the bulk of the inner aqueous phase of the lamellar system if so phosphorylation could proceed long before the internal ph reflected the proton activity gradients within the membrane
119,respiratory hypersensitivity and systemic effects after local application of ascaris suum extract on the segmental bronchus and after its intravenous infusion are studied on four boxer dogs influence of ipsilateral vagus blockade on the respiratory hyperreactivity T3 intrabronchial application of ascaris was also investigated on the same dogs ascaris extract was applied in liquid form directly through a catheter into the RA segmental bronchus egg albumin was applied in the same way for control local application of ascaris was repeated T3 ipsilateral central vagus blockade and once more after recovering vagus effect by lavage at the end of the experiments ascaris extract was infused intravenously the parameters studied were deltapoes mm hg ml tv as a measurement of flow resistance in the airways respiratory rates arterial blood gases and ph heart frequency systemic blood pressure and histamine concentration per milliliter of plasma all the animals presented a remarkable respiratory distress with local ascaris application which could be clearly avoided with ipsilateral central vagus blockade this respiratory hyperreactivity was not observed after intravenous infusion of ascaris extract but a significant systemic effect which was not the case after local application could be observed
120,we have recently shown that co o in the serosal bathing solution with o in the mucosal solution results in codiffusion limitation of acid secretion in bullfrog gastric mucosa changing to co on both surfaces doubles the acid sec rate we calculate that were the rate of oxygen consumption to increase significantly as a result of secretory stimulation the tissue would now be oxygen limited this prediction is tested by raising the p by increasing the total pressure in a hyperbaric chamber since no NC in acid sec rate or potential difference was observed upon changing from po to po atm we conclude that the tissue is not o limited at normal pressure decreasing po below atm by contrast decreases the acid secretory rate and raises both pd and resistance we infer that the rate of oxygen consumption did not rise significantly when acid secretion was increased by supplying sufficient co
121,the relative rates of sterol synthesis in the liver ileum and lung of the guinea pig have been studied by measuring the incorporation by tissue slices of clabeled acetate into digitoninprecipitable sterols the liver showed maximum incorporation of acetate at ph the ileum at ph and the lung at ph the incorporation of acetate approached the maximum rate at a concentration of mm with the CL and lung and mm with the ileum using these conditions of assay sterol synthesis was measured in the liver ileum and lung of four CG of guinea pigs killed at hourly intervals depending on the time of day the rate of sterol synthesis in the ileum was from to times that in the liver while in the lung the rate was up to times that shown by the liver additional studies showed that all regions of the small intestine synthesized sterol at a higher rate than the CL with the highest rate of synthesis occurring in the ileum the rates observed in the adrenal testis muscle adipose tissue and skin indicated that these tissues are not quantitatively important sites of sterol synthesis in the guinea pig
122,administration of imipramine plus serotonin ht to rats has been proposed as an rat of duchenne muscular dystrophy we studied the skeletal muscle CN produced in male rats given ht after pretreatment with imipramine other tricyclic antidepressants or antihistamines which like the tricyclic antidepressants can block neuronal reuptake of ht following one of these agents plus ht mgkg subcutaneously sc necrosis was more severe in the SOL than the quadriceps there was no significant difference in the incidence of necrosis in the soleus and quadriceps muscles following one of these agents plus ht mgkg intraperitoneally ip after one of these agents plus ht ip but not ht sc extensive CN was significantly more frequent and severe in the quadriceps muscle than after ht sc chlorpheniramine cp plus ht mgkg intravenously produced less muscle necrosis than cp plus ht sc or ip the necrosis produced by cp plus ht sc was comparable ipsilateral and CL to the injection site the necrosis following cp plus ht ip was maximal at hr and remained fairly constant until days regeneration was prominent by days the muscle CN produced by cp plus ht is blocked by some ht blockers eg methiotepin and methysergide it is also partially blocked by denervation the capacity of tricyclic ADs and antihistamines to block neuronal ht reuptake tended to be negatively correlated with the capacity to potentiate the muscle necrosis they produced with ht which suggests that blockade of ht uptake is not the mechanism of the pathology produced by the combined treatment the TCAs and the antihistamines are membrane stabilizerslabilizers other drugs which are membrane stabilizerslabilizers such as THP and procaine also promoted skeletal muscle necrosis when given prior to ht it is proposed that the effects of imipramine plus ht on skeletal muscle are not due to the blockade of neuronal uptake of ht and subsequent vascularinduced ischemia but reflect direct toxic effects of these agents on skeletal muscle
123,a method of isolation of alphaantitrypsin alphaat in good yield from normal HP is described a key step was affinity chromatography employing an antiserum which had been depleted of alphaat antibodies the final preparations were homogeneous by immunological and physicochemical criteria the specific activity of the purified alphaat was mg of active bovine TR inhibited per mg of inhibitor polyacrylamide gel patterns at both alkaline and acid ph of highly pure S9 frequently but not invariably showed multiple hands molecular weight studies by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation in AQ buffer and in m guanidine as well as sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggest that alphaat is a single polypeptide chain having a molecular weight of other PCS and chemical properties of the inhibitor are described a limited nterminal sequence gluaspproglnglyasxalaala was obtained it was found that alphaat easily forms polymers and higher aggregates when exposed to denaturing agents such as m urea and m DTG the results suggest that aggregation is determined by both covalent and noncovalent forces
124,the CSD of arabinosylcytosine arac and its metabolites has been measured in the liver small intestine SP and kidney of mice inoculated ip days earlier with l leukemia cells two L1 metabolites were found in the tissuesthe nucleotides and the deaminated inactive product arabinosyluracil arau the decay curve of arac in most of these tissues was curvilinear the arac halflives estimated from the terminal phases were and hr for SP kidney intestine and liver tissues respectively the arac halflife was not correlated with the deoxycytidine deaminase activity in the tissues however the deaminase activity in vitro correlated well with the amount of arau present in vivo similar analyses were made for l leukemic cells and ascites fluid a high nucleotide level was found in the cells and a significant amount of nucleotides was also identifiable in the ascites fluid the activities of deoxycytidine kinase but not of deoxycytidine deaminase in host tissues of mice inoculated with l leukemic cells CS to arac were greater than in those of normal mice the phosphorylating activities in vitro correlated with the amount of nucleotide present in vivo in mice bearing l leukemic cells however the infiltration of leukemic cells containing high kinase activities into the host tissues accounted for most if not all of the nucleotide level in these tissues this is further evidenced by the fact that inoculating mice with l leukemic cells resistant to arac did not alter the kinase activity or nucleotide levels of the host tissues these resistant cells contain negligible amounts of arac phosphorylating activities
125,washed cells of salmonella enteritidis harvested from a defined medium during logarithmic growth were subjected to starvation in ph PB at c viability was measured by slide cultures and plate counts the survival of cell suspensions equivalent to to mg dry wtml was influenced by cryptic growth the rate of cryptic growth assessed by SP counts increased with cell density and could not be alleviated by starvation with dialysis dialysis of the starving SC did retard the onset of cryptic growth but did not eliminate it indicating that the L1 substrates for regrowth were relatively C1 cellular components in phosphate buffer homologous HK cells allowed for the doubling of one s enteritidis cell cryptic growth was not observed when cells were starved on the surface of membrane filters or in suspensions equivalent to mug dry wtml cellsml similar halflife survival times were calculated for both these populations but the shape of their survival curves differed significantly these differences were attributed to stress factors encountered during cell preparation and during starvation the halflife survival time of s enteritidis starved at mug dry wtml was h in phosphate buffer h in endomethylenetetrahydrophthalic acid buffer and h in trishydroxymethylaminomethane buffer
126,a method is described to study the effect of successively changing incubation conditions on the release of rapidly labeled rna from isolated nuclei nuclear columns containing immobilized rat CL nuclei isolated after in vivo application of labeled orotic acid are perfused with different nonradioactive media within the course of one perfusion the rate of rna PR can be repeatedly altered by variation of temperature acidity and concentrations of nucleoside triphosphates complexing agents sodium chloride and manganese chloride rna PR can be started and stopped indicating that the reaction does not result from damage to nuclei during min perfusion the same product labeled ribonucleoprotein sigma gcm in cscl is released high release rates depend on the ratio of nucleoside triphosphate to divalent cation concentration not on the concentration of the agents per se ribonucleoside and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates exert the same effect as atp the sh reagents iodoacetamide and IAA only slightly affect the atpinduced reaction in contrast pchloromercuribenzoate after an initial stimulation causes inhibition of rna release
127,supernatant fluids from murine spleen cell cultures incubated with concanavalin a for hr contain a factors soluble immune response suppressor sirs which suppresses plaqueforming cell responses to sheep erythrocytes by murine spleen cells in vitro in the present studies some of the biochemical and biophysical properties of sirs were investigated sirs was nondialysable the suppressive activity was SD at degrees c for min but was destroyed by treatment at degrees c for min degrees c for min or at ph the suppressive activity was not absorbed by the stimulating antigen srbc or antisera against murine igg or muchain suggesting that sirs does not contain immunoglobulin determinants murine spleen and thymus but not kidney cells however absorbed sirs activity enzyme treatments revealed that sirs was resistant to dnase and rnase but was destroyed by trypsin and chymotrypsin in gel filtration with sephadex g sirs activity eluted in the fraction corresponding to mw in the range between and with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sirs activity migrated in the region cathodal to albumin isopycnic centrifugation in a cesium chloride gradient suggested that sirs is a glycoprotein these supernatant fluids with sirs activity were also found to contain macrophage migration inhibitory factor mif in the experiments using gel filtration PAGE and isopycnic centrifugation to fractionate supernatant fluids sirs and mif activity were found in the same fractions and to date we have been unable to dissociate definitively sirs activity from mif activity
128,photosystem i fragments were prepared by digitonin treatment of spinach chloroplasts the Tm potential of cytochrome b in the fragments is close to v showing a one electron transition no cytochrome b was detectable neither in difference absorption spectra nor in lightinduced absorbance changes in the absence of added cofactors only cytochrome b photoreduction can be observed this photoreduction is stimulated by ferredoxin ferredoxinnadp reductase appears not to be involved in cytochrome b reduction photooxidation of cytochrome b is dependent on plastocyanin addition and inhibited by dbmib a plastoquinone antagonist addition of plastocyanin restores cytochrome f photooxidation as well reacting quite specifically in about equimolar concentrations to bound cytochrome f the stimulation of cytochrome f oxidation is abolished by an antibody prepared against plastocyanin indicating a surface location of PC in digitonin treated membranes biphasic kinetics of darkreduction of cytochrome f by ascorbate indicate that part of this cytochrome f is relatively inaccessible in the membrane T3 preillumination a monophasic reduction is observed and the slowly oxidized component is absent illumination in the presence of plastocyanin causes a fast and CR reduction of cytochrome f suggesting equilibration of cytochrome f with added plastocyanin residing in the membrane surface it appears that actinic light causes conformation andor structural changes in the membrane of these digitonin fragments influencing cytochrome f asseccibility
129,this paper reviews the history of understanding how biological systems can discriminate so strikingly among physically similar ions especially alkali cations appreciation of qualitative regularities permitted sequences and quantitative regularities selectivity isotherms in ion selectivity grew first from studies of ion exchangers and glass electrodes then of biological systems such as enzymes and cell membranes and most recently of lipid bilayers doped with MM pores and carriers discrimination of ions depends on both electrostatic and steric forces blackbox studies on IN biological membranes have in some cases yielded molecular clues to the structure of the actual biological pores and carriers L1 current problems involve the extraction of these molecules how to do it what to do when it is achieved and how and if it is relevant to the CE problems of membrane function further advances are expected soon from studies of rate barriers within membranes of voltagedependent excitable conducting channels and of increasingly complex model systems and biological membranes
130,enzymes must not only be extremely ERP catalysts but must also be the operating components of very CS and sophisticated regulatory systems appropriate evolutionary adjustment of the properties of different enzymes causes the sites that bind typical metabolic intermediates to be only partially saturated in vivo thus allowing flexibility for control by variation in ligand concentration in contrast CS that bind such coupling agents as the pyridine and adenine nucleotides seem to be virtually saturated thus the ratios rather than the absolute concentrations of these compounds are important in metabolic regulation this type of response is esstial to the function of these EDC simultaneously as thermodynamic energy transducers and modifiers in the kinetics RII system reaction orders of two to four are frequently encountered they appear to be essenital to biochemical homoeostasis which is the maintenance of nearly constant substrate concentrations at the expense of wide variation in flux rates the strategies of enzyme adaptation are general but the actual adaptations of enzymes are highly specific reflecting the place of the enzyme in a metabolic CS the place of the CS in the metabolism of the cell and in complex organisms the function of the cell and of the organ or tissue of which it is a part in the organism patterns of adaptation must be almost infinitely varied a few are presently known in outline but probably none as yet in detail several examples are discussed
131,the effect of ligands including substrates and allosteric effectors on the phdependent inactivation and reactivation of rb muscle phosphofructokinase has been examined in terms of the mechanism proposed previously bock pe and fireden c j biol chem it is concluded thatt many ligands exert their effect by IB preferentially to either protonated or unprotonated forms of the enzyme and thus shifting an apparent pk for the inactivation or reactivation process atp and fructose phosphate influence the apparent pk to different extents and in different directions with atp IB preferentially to the protonated forms and fructose phosphate to the unprotonated forms enzyme inactivated by atp can be reactivated by the addition of fructose phosphate the experiments indicate that inactivation and reactivation in the presence of these ligands can occur by kinetically different pathways as has been found for these processes in the absence of ligands the results are discussed in relation to what might be expected for ligand IB properties of the enzyme as a CF of ph temperature and enzyme concentration the effect of atp and mgatp is complex perhaps representing more than one site of binding citrate appears to bind preferentially to protonated forms of the enzyme while fructose bisphosphate and amp bind preferentially to the unprotonated forms adp k and nh appear to have little or no preference in binding to different enzyme forms
132,the effect of heat on the conformation of bovine betalactoglobulin has been studied using intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy changes in the intensity wavelength of maximum emission and emission peak width at half height of tryptophan fluorescence over the range degrees c at ph has allowed the environments of the two tryptophans in the molecule to be discriminated at degrees c both tryptophans are in hydrophobic environments as the temperature is raised the conformation changes such that at about degrees c one of the tryptophans is transferred to a more polar environment accessible to solvent conformational changes appear to be reversible if the protein is cooled to degrees c T3 heat treatments up to degrees c above degrees c the second tryptophan residue becomes exposed to solvent complete exposure of one residue occurs at degrees c while the other is still partially buried even at degrees c when the protein is then cooled to degrees c the conformational changes appear to be irreversible with only one tryptophan residue returning to the hydrophobic interior of the molecule
133,suspensions of isolated cell envelopes of infectious elementary HB eb of CT psittaci at alkaline ph showed a rapid extensive decrease in absorbance accompanied by the release of a cell envelope component in a sedimentable form this phenomenon was observed both at c and with envelopes which had been previously heated to c monovalent and divalent cations effectively inhibited the turbidity loss whereas ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta caused an accelerated decrease in turbidity the turbidity loss observed T3 incubation of the envelopes at alkaline ph could be reversed to the level of the initial value by dialysis against DW containing mg thinsection electron photomicrographs of purified eb exposed to alkaline buffer with edta revealed the loss of the internal contents of cells but these cells still maintained their round shapes the cell surface of treated eb appeared pitted in negatively stained preparations whereas intact eb had a smooth surface electron microscopic studies on negatively stained preparations of the clear supernatant obtained after the treatment of the envelope with ALP buffer containing edta demonstrated the presence of spherical particles approximately to nm in diameter and rodlike particles which appeared to be made up of two or more spherical particles
134,the cell envelope of sporillum sp strain ordal possibly a variety of s anulus demonstrated multiple superficial wall layers which were diverse in their macromolecular arrays negative staining and freezeetching techniques revealed an outer hexagonally packed SL and an inner tetragonally packed SL however both thin sections and freezeetched cleavages of the wall showed that each of these regular structures rested upon a backing SL and that there was a delicate amorphous SL overlying the outer hexagonal array rotary integration optical deffraction and reconstruction of image were used to clarify measurements of each array and to verify the validity of a diagrammatic model of the outer hexagonal system the integrity of these layers required suitable cations ca appeared essential and ph ph less than or equal to dissociated most superficial layers these observations aided in the development of a lowph cationicsubstitution technique in which na replaced essential ca for SE of the layers from the cell surface dialysis to remove na and restoration of ca initiated in vitro reassembly of the superficial layer components until regularly structured assembly products were formed
135,it was demonstrated that an enzyme systems extracted from etiolated seedlings of stizolobium hassjoo catalyzed the conversion of ldihydroxyphenylalanine into stizolobinic acid alphaaminocarboxyoxohpyranpropionic acid and stizolobic acid alphaaminocarboxyoxohpyranpropionic acid in the presence of nadp or nad under aerobic conditions enzymically synthesized radioactive stizolobinic acid and stizolobic acid isolated from the reaction mixtures were purified and confirmed to have constant specific radioactivities by cocrystallization with authentic samples maximal activity of the enzyme preparation was obtained by using an insoluble polyphenol adsorbent polyclar at and a reducing agent araboascorbic acid in the SE medium and by subsequent fractionation of the extract with ammonium sulfate followed by sephadex g GF catalytic activity of the enzyme preparation was more unstable under aerobic condition than anaerobic attempts to stabilise the enzyme activity were made by the use of many substances which are known to stabilise other enzymes or expected to arrest the inactivation evidence is provided in this paper that the previously proposed biosynthetic pathways of stizolobinic acid and stizolobic acid from dihydroxyphenylalanine proceeded in the cellfree system from etiolated seedlings of s hassjoo
136,glucose dehydrogenase from bacillus megaterium has been purified to a specific activity of u per mg protein the homogeneity of the purified enzyme was demonstrated by gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing the amino acid composition has been determined the molecular weight of the native enzyme was found to be by gel permeation chromatography in good agreement with the values of and which were ascertained electrophoretically according to the method of hedrick and smith and by density gradient centrifugation respectively in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate and m urea the enzyme dissociates into subunits with a molecular weight of as determined by dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis these values indicate that the native enzyme is composed of four polypeptide chains each probably possessing one coenzyme binding site which can be concluded from fluorescent titration of the nadh IB CS in polyacrylamide disc PACE samples of the purified enzyme exhibit three bands of activity which present the native tetrameric form of glucose dehydrogenase and two monomeric forms molecular weight arising under the conditions of ph and ionic strength of this method the enzyme shows a sharp ph optimum at ph in trishcl buffer and a shift of the ph optimum to ph in acetateborate buffer the limiting michaelis constant at ph for nad is mm and mm for glucose the dissociation constant for nad is mm dglucose dehydrogenase is highly specific for betadglucose and is capable of using either nad or nadp the enzyme is insensitive to sulfhydryl group inhibitors heavy metal ions and chelating agents
137,in recent years increased attention has been given to the degree of acidity of fetal blood during the course of labor or immediately after delivery as it is not always possible to measure the blood ph immediately after sampling it is important to know whether or not the ph is likely to change if the blood sample is stored for some time heparinized whole blood samples were collected from the umbilical artery of P0 infants immediately after delivery and were stored at room temperature ph measurements were made every minutes up to T2 in a second group the same number of samples were stored in a refrigator phmeasurements were performed after minutes and then every hour for up to hours and finally after hours the phactvalues did not change at RT about degrees c for up to minutes phquvalues decreased initially more rapidly but at minutes the decrease was the same as in phactvalues namely units afterwards the phactvalues decreased at a mena rate of about units per hour and phquvalues at a mean rate of about units per hour if the storage temperature was lowered by refrigeration about degrees c the phactvalues remained between and units for hours and phquvalues for hours from these experiments it can be concluded that fetal blood samples must be kept in a refrigerator in order to inhibit autoxidation if they have to be stored for longer than minutes
138,the kinetics of Pyr transport across the isolated red blood cell membrane were studied by a simple and precise spectrophotometric method following the oxidation of nadh via lactate dehydrogenase trapped within resealed ghosts the initial rate of Pyr entry was linear influx was limited by saturation at high Pyr concentration pyruvate influx was greatly stimulated by increasing ionic strength in the outer but not the inner aqueous compartment the km ranged from mm at mu to mm at mu while the v went from to mol min ghost ionic strength was shown to affect the translocation step and not pyruvate IB the energy of activation of pyruvate flux into resealed ghosts was kcalmol similar to that found in IN red blood cells inhibitors of pyruvate influx included such anions as thiocyanate chloride bicarbonate alphacyanocinnamate salicylate and ketomalonate but not acetate NCIs were phloretin fluorodinitrobenzene acetamidoisothiocyanatestilbenedisulfonic acid and ophenanthrolinecuso mixtures the last reagent known to induce disulfide links in certain membrane proteins blocked the ionic strength stimulation of pyruvate influx in this study
139,cerebral hemispheric blood flow and metabolism were measured before and after therapy with intracarotid infusion of combined pbz and ppl in patients with recent cerebral infarction hbf was unaltered despite decrease in rCBF pressure cerebral hemispheric oxygen comsumption and carbon dioxide production decreased while CBF hemispheric lactate production increased biphasic cerebral uptake of tyrosine was observed during and immediately after pbz and ppl infusion csf hva increased indicating altered da turnover csf hiaa levels also increased suggesting altered ht turnover after pbz and ppl release of cAMP from ischemic BB into cerebral venous blood seen in the Css was abolished after therapy cerebral hemodynamic studies suggest a functional balance between monaminergic neurogenic influences in the control of cerebral circulation imbalance of such controlling factors in ICM brain may lead to paradoxical V1 responses to induced hypertension and hypotension pbz and ppl enhance such responses perhaps by increasing central neurotransmitter turnover and PR further shift toward cerebral anaerobic metabolism may occur in ischemic brain following the use of phenoxybenzamine and propranolol worsening of neurological deficit occurred in four cases combined therapy with pbz and ppl does not appear beneficial in the therapy of patients with recent stroke
140,a new very sensitive rapid and reliable assay for guanylate cyclase has been established based on conversion of pgtp to pguanosine monophosphate and its separation on dowex and aluminium oxide columns the optimum conditions for the assay of mouse parotid guanylate cyclase have been established and using this procedure the properties of the enzyme have been investigated the enzyme was found in both the particulate and supernatant fractions the particulate enzyme was activated fold by triton x and the supernatant enzyme activity increased fold in the presence of detergent guanylate cyclase activity was distributed in the particulate and in the supernatant fractions respectively the particulate activity was localised in a plasma membrane fraction guanylate cyclase activity was also assayed in a wide variety of other tissues in all cases enzymatic activity was found in both the particulate and supernatant fractions the distribution varied with the tissue but only the intestinal mucosa had a greater proportion of total guanylate cyclase activity in the particulate fraction than the parotid the two enzymes showed some similar properties their ph optima were ph both enzymes were inhibited by atp datp dgtp and itp required mn for activity and plots of activity versus mn concentration were sigmoidal however in many properties the enzymes were dissimilar the ratios of mn to gtp for optimum activity were and for the supernatant and plasmabound enzymes respectively the Mw of hill plots for the supernatant enzyme with varying mn was the particulate enzyme plots also had a Mw of at low mn concentration but at higher concentrations above mm the hill coefficient shifted abruptly to calcium ions reduced sigmoidicity of the kinetics lowering the hill coefficient G1 the enzyme at all mn concentrations but had no effect on the mngtp ratio with the supernatant enzyme while with the plasma membrane enzyme ca had no effect on the sigmoid form of the kinetics at low mn but prevented the shift to a greater hill coefficient at higher mn inhibited the activity at low mn and shifted the mngtp optimum ratio to for the particulate enzyme plots of activity versus gtp concentration were sigmoid n while the supernatant enzyme exhibited hyperbolic kinetics
141,the antibody response to type iii pneumococcal polysaccharide ssii was significantly increased in mice treated with antilymphocyte SS als balgc mice given ml of als on days and relative to the days of immunization with mug of sssii had a fold increment increased to in the number of splenic plaqueforming cells enumerated on day compared with untreated immunized controls this effect has been attributed to the beta of subpopulation of thymusderived lymphocytes t cells that has suppressor function the present series of experiments relate the augmented antibody response to sssii in mice treated with als to increased host resistance after infection with streptococcus pneumoniae type iii pnii the lethal dose of pniii in niminnunized mice was and the lethal dose was organisms mice immunized with mug of sssiii and challenged days later with pniii were completely protected against a dose of up to organisms mice treated with ml of als on days and immunized with sssiii on day and challenged with x pniii on day had a mean survival time of greater than h compared with h for immunized nonserumtreated controls animals given a single injection of als before immunization showed no increase in resistance whereas mice treated T3 immunization had significant prolongation of survival times UT immunized mice challenged with x x x pnii survived to h whereas alstreated animals had mean survival times of and h respectively these findings suggest that immunoregulatory TA may have a biologically significant effect in a narrow zone in which the normal host immune response is insufficient but still potentially capable of providing some additional degree of protection if suppressor cells are elimated
142,in the socalled cryptonephric condition of the excretory system in insects the distal ends of the malpighian tubules are closely applied to the rectum and enclosed with it in a special chamber the perinephric space separated from the rest of the body cavity by the perinephric membrane the term rectal complex refers to this association of tubules and rectum which is found in the larvae but not in the adults of most lepidoptera in the mealworm coleoptera the rectal complex has notable ability to remove water from the faeces but this ability is not conspicuously developed in the larvae of the two species of lepidoptera here studied pieris brassicae and manduca sexta on the other hand these larvae have notable ability to maintain salt balance under heavy dietary loading and in this the rectal complex plays an important part a study of salt balance in more detail has shown that more sodium can be eliminated in the faeces than enters the rectal complex from the intestine consideration of other possible routes of entry points strongly to the MT superimposed upon a new flow of tubule fluid out of the rectal complex there is a tidal flow brought about by the rectal musculature and amplified by dilatations of the cryptonephric tubules which could bring in fluid from the free tubules and afford opportunity for the uptake of salts evidence is presented in support of this view this tidal flow of tubule fluid and uptake of salts could be the basis of the buildup of high osmolarity in the perinephric fluid and could contribute to the removal of water from the faeces it could also be the basic mechanism in the mealworm the leptophragmal mechanism being superimposed upon it
143,the properties of two purified peptidases derived from the intestinal brush border membrane of the rat have been investigated the ph optima heat stabilities substrate specificities and metal ion requirements of the two enzymes and the effects of inhibitors on their activities were nearly identical the isoenzymes catalyzed the hydrolysis of a wide range of peptides containing from to amino acid residues the enzymes are aminopeptidases no evidence for carboxypeptidase or endopeptidase activity was found for hydrolysis there appears to be an absolute requirement for an lamino acid at the nhterminus of the peptide substrate there was a similar but less absolute requirement for the penultimate nhterminal amino acid thus although peptides of the type laminoacyllproline laminoacyllprolyllamino acidn or laminoacyldamino acid were not hydrolyzed lleucylbetanaphthylamide could be utilized as a ATP the enzymes appeared to be metalloenzymes in that metal ionchelating agents could inhibit their activities co partially restored the activities lost by chelation immunodiffusion studies showed that the two enzymes were immunologically identical the antipeptidase antisera were specific for the enzymes and did not react with other constituents of the intestinal cell both enzymes have IB sites for the lectin phytohemagglutinin which recognizes GalNAc residues located at or near the terminal positions of glycoprotein carbohydrate chains both the lectin and the antibodies inhibited enzyme activities but the mechanisms of inhibition appeared to be different
144,this report describes macromolecules that bind desaspartic acidangiotensin ii the des aspartic acid derivative of angiotensin i and several biologically active and inactive analogues of these polypeptides the macromolecules were found in the plasma of approximately per cent of ambulatory adults and hospitalized children and per cent of the patients at two institutions for the mentally retarded the binding properties of these macromolecules were studied by incubating with peptides labeled with iodine and separating bound from free labeled peptide using small gel filtration columns the peptidebinding macromolecules from several patients were compared they showed very similar specificity for a group of arginyl peptides of the desaspartylangiotensin sequence the plasma binders differed from one another in their optimum ph and their mobility in electrophoretic fields those with more acid ph optima displayed more rapid electrophoretic mobility the binders fell into two classes based on apparent molecular weight approximately and those with the higher apparent molecular weight contained a large proportion of binder that could be precipitated with AS to human iga kinetic measurements showed that the plasma binders were somewhat heterogeneous with respect to affinity for desaspangiotensin with apparent association constants ranging from to m binding activity was labile to heat and to treatment with pepsin or TR it was inhibited by calcium protamine streptomycin and some other cationic EDC the plasma peptide binder differed in specificity and molecular weight from soluble angiotensinbinding molecules extracted from tissues and from properties expected of a receptor for angiotensin these macromolecules may be useful reagents for measuring desaspangiotensins their presence in plasma samples may interfere with angiotensin assays in some circumstances
145,low C2 of digoxin were noted in a patient receiving digoxin and sulfasalazine ssa discontinuation of ssa resulted in a significant increase in serum digoxin levels to determine whether or not ssa consistently interfered with the therapeutic effect of digoxin both drugs were administered to normal subjects in a crossover study each received doses of digoxin mg elixir one dose given alone and a second dose after days of treatment with ssa when digoxin was given with ssa the average area under the serum digoxin curve fell from the control value of nghrml to nghrml p less than fell and total urinary excretion decreased from mcg days to mcg days p less than these changes suggest interference with the BA of digoxin by ssa studies were conducted to determine whether ssa inhibited digoxin absorption by physically absorbing the glycoside from solution in vitro tests failed to reveal any significant adsorptive properties for ssa
146,the CSD and classification of histamine receptors in mammalian and avian tissues have been summarized in tables it is evident that histamine receptors are present on a number of morphologically distinct cell types and the proportion of cells bearing h and hreceptors varies not only with the species but also with the cell source the pharmacological receptors mediating mepyraminesensitive histamine responses have been defined as hreceptors receptors mediating mepyramineresistant but burimamide or metiamidesensitive histamine responses have been classified as hreceptors histamine responses mediated via hreceptors seem to involve the adenylcyclase system resulting in elevation of intracellular cyclicamp level which is susceptible to burimamide blockade but insensitive to betaadrenergic blocking agents this mode of action of histamine involving hreceptors and the adenyl cyclase system has been shown to stimulate the mammalian heart promote GAS inhibit antigeninduced HR from leucocytes and inhibit LMC it can further be concluded that both h and hreceptors are widely distributed throughout the animal body in the gastrointestinal reproductive respiratory and cardiovascular systems nervous system and on mast cells and blood leucocytes in these tissues histamine receptors play an important role in physiological immunological and immunopathological processes interaction of histamine with both h and hreceptors in varying proportions modulates the overall manifestation of cardiovascular and respiratory syndromes during certain immunopathological conditions eg inflammation allergy and anaphylaxis histamine receptors also appear to play and important role in the OD of immunocompetence and immunity
147,the effects of several narcotics narcotic antagonistsanalgesics and narcotic antagonists on the synthesis of dopamine and norepinephrine in mouse brain were estimated and related to their activity in the tailflick test catecholamine synthesis was estimated by measuring the accumulation of hdopamine and hnorepinephrine formed from an injection of htyrosine morphine produced doserelated increases in both tailflick activity and catecholamine synthesis each of the narcotic analgesics produced a significant increase in catecholamine synthesis T2 after the subcutaneous injection of an antinociceptive dose ed under these same conditions drugs which are inactive in the tailflick test such as pentazocine produced a decrease in catecholamine synthesis and cyclazocine naloxone and naltrexone were without significant effect however cyclazocine which was inactive in the tailflick test and did not alter catecholamine synthesis T2 after administration demonstrated tailflick activity and produced increased catecholamine synthesis minutes after its administration morphine was devoid of either activity minutes C2 similarly at hours T3 the administration of a dose of morphine mgkg that was AS in the tailflick test and increased catecholamine synthesis at minutes neither tailflick activity nor increased catecholamine synthesis was observed naloxone blocked both the antinociceptive action and the increased catecholamine synthesis produced by both morphine and methadone the results of these studies indicate that a correlation exists between tailflick activity of narcoticlike drugs and their ability to increase catecholamine synthesis these data support the hypothesis that BB catecholamines may be involved in the central mediation of the tailflick response and other actions of the narcotic analgesics
148,the longterm regulation of fatty acid synthetase and acetylcoa carboxylase and of fatty acid and sterol synthesis was studied in c glial cells in SC when theophylline m was added to the culture medium of these cells rates of lipid synthesis from acetate and activities of synthetase and carboxylase became distinctly lower than in cells that were UT this effect appeared T3 approximately h and T3 h enzymatic activities were reduced approx fold and rates of lipid synthesis from acetate to fold the likelihood that the decrease in fatty acid synthesis from acetate was caused by the decrease in activities of fatty acid synthetase and acetylcoa carboxylase was established by several observations these indicated that the locus of the effect probably did not reside at the level of acetate uptake into the cell alterations in acetate pool sizes or conversion of acetate to acetylcoa moreover de novo fatty acid synthesis was found to be the predominant pathway in these glial cells whether treated with theophylline or not the mechanism of the effect of theophylline on FAS was shown by immunochemical techniques to involve an alteration in content of enzyme rather than in catalytic efficiency the change in content of HFA synthetase was shown by isotopicimmunochemical experiments to involve a decrease in synthesis of the enzyme the mechanism whereby theophylline leads to a decrease in lipogenesis and in the synthesis of FAS may not be mediated entirely by inhibition of phosphodiesterase and an increase in cyclic amp levels because dibutyryl cAMP m only partially reproduced the effect
149,bone marrow biopsy specimens from patients with myeloma were cultured in either of thinfilm culture systems a controlled environment steady state system or a rocker tube configuration of the system for periods up to days both functional and morphological characteristics of the myeloma cells were wellmaintained in these systems cytocentrifuge S9 of the culture media disclosed hematopoietic cells that included from to almost plasma cells histological examination of the cultured specimens disclosed infiltration of the marrow with myeloma cells myeloma proteins were released at a steady rate throughout the period of culture T3 the st days BRA was demonstrated in the SC media in of myeloma culture media and was well maintained particularly during the st week of SC this activity was associated with severe osteolytic lesions in the donor patient and marked infiltration of the cultured specimen by myeloma cells the potential use of these organ culture systems for the further definitive ID of the factor responsible for bone destruction in myeloma is discussed
150,the optimal conditions are selected for electroncytochemical PCD of the atpase activity in nuclei of the skeletal muscles of rabbits and nuclei of vicia faba l meristem it is shown that the previous fixation of nuclei in the rb skeletal muscle for min in a mixture of the buffer solutions of glutaric dialdehyde and neutral formalin causes a decrease in their atpase activity by in the medium containing mg and by in the medium containing ca in nuclei of horse bean seedlings meristem it lowers respectively by and ions of lead in a concentration of mm evoke a decrease in the atpase activity in the medium containing mg in nuclei of the rabbit skeletal muscles by and in nuclei of horse bean meristem by in the medium containing ca the vaule of the residual activity is sufficient for detection of the product of atp enzymic hydrolysis reaction by activity is sufficient for PCD of the product of atp enzymic hydrolysis reaction by the method of electronic cytochemistry an increase in the pb concentration higher than mm evokes nonenzymic hydrolysis of atp the atpase activity under the electroncytochemical study is found within the range of ph the product of reaction forms most intensively at ph in the medium with both mg and ca
151,experiments were conducted in anesthetized dogs to determine the nature of receptors mediating vascular actions of histamine in the perfused gracilis muscle histamine caused vasodilatation that was attenuated in part by mepyramine an hreceptor blocker metiamide an h blocker given alone had no effect on dilatation however the combination of MEP and metiamide resulted in a large attenuation of dilatation histamine caused constriction of the perfused saphenous vein that was totally blocked by MEP suggesting that venoconstriction by histamine involves only h receptors histamine infusion caused a fall in arterial pressure and a large reduction in IP resistance mepyramine attenuated the fall in pressure but not the reduction in resistance combined h and hreceptor blockade largely eliminated the effects of histamine infusion further documenting the existence of h and h receptors the effects of h and h antihistamines on a variety of physiological vasodilator responses were examined evidence was obtained to indicate that h and hhistamine receptors are involved in the AS component of baroreceptormediated reflex vasodilatation poststimulation vasodilatation sympathetic vasodilatation in the guanethidinetreated dog and vasodilator responses following compound no evidence for the participation of either h or hhistamine receptors in reactive hyperemia or the dilatation accompanying exercise was found it is concluded that in the dog both endogenouslyreleased and exogenous histamine exert V1 effects by activation of both h and h receptors
152,weightaverage elution volumes of sulphatase a an arylsulphate sulphohydrolase ec from sephadex g have been determined as functions of protein concentration ph ionic strength and temperature the results are used to calculate the apparent association equilibrium constants for tetramer formation and the associated standardstate thermodynamic parameters while the apparent association constant decreased from to m on increasing the ph from to at ionic strength at any particular ph value studied it was relatively insensitive to temperature R2 so that deltah is close to zero and tetramer formation in solution is associated with a positive entropy change at ph increasing the ionic strength from to decreased the association constant by a factor of methylumbelliferone sulphate has no effect on the association of sulphatase a the equilibrium results are used to define the degree of association of sulphatase a likely to encountered in experiments designed to elucidate its kinetic properties in the liver lysosome the tetramer is probably the dominant species the monomer and tetramer of sulphatase a have similar or identical specific activities with nitrocatechol sulphate and methylumbelliferone sulphate as substrates with nitrocatechol sulphate sulphatase a shows michaelis kinetics under conditions where the monomer is the dominant species and nonmichaelis kinetics where the tetramer is dominant there is apparently a negative cooperativity between the monomer units in the tetramer in mm sodium taurodeoxycholate and m mncl but not in m nacl the tetramer shows michaelis kinetics this is not due to dissociation of the tetramer the critical micellar concentration of sodium TDC is about mm in both m nacl and m mccl but the aggregation number is greater in the latter
153,formate inhibits cytochrome c oxidase activity both in IN mitochondria and submitochondrial particles and in isolated cytochrome aa the inhibition increases with decreasing ph indicating that hcooh may be the inhibitory species formate induces a blue shift in the absorption spectrum of oxidized cytochrome aa a a and in the halfreduced species a a comparison with cyanideinduced spectral shifts towards the red indicates that formate and cyanide have opposite effects on the aa spectrum both in the fully oxidized and the halfreduced states the formate spectra provide a new method of obtaining the difference spectrum of a minus a free of the difficulties with cyanide which induces marked high leads to low spin spectral shifts in cytochrome a and azide which induces peak shifts of cytochrome a towards the blue in both alpha and soret regions the rate of formate dissociation from cytochrome a a hcooh is faster than its rate of dissociation from a a hcooh especially in the presence of cytochrome c the ki for formate inhibition of respiration is a CF of the reduction state of the system varying from mm reduction to mm oxidation at ph degrees c succinatecytochrome c reductase activity is also inhibited by formate in a reaction competitive with succinate and dependent on formate formate inhibition of ascorbate plus n n n ntetramethylpphenylenediamine oxidation by intact rat liver mitochondria is partially released by uncoupler addition formate is permeable through the inner mitochondrial membrane and no differences in on or off inhibition rates were observed when intact mitochondria were compared with submitochondrial particles nadhcytochrome c reductase activity is unaffected by formate in submitochondrial particles but mitochondrial oxidation of glutamate plus malate is subject both to terminal inhibition at the cytochrome aa level and to a slow extra inhibition by formate following uncoupler addition indicating a third site of formate action in the intact mitochondrion
154,rabbit liver purine nucleoside phosphorylase purine nucleoside orthophosphate ribosyltransferase ec was purified to homogeneity by column chromatography and AS fractionation homogeneity was established by disc gel electrophoresis in presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and isoelectric focusing molecular weights of and were determined respectively by gel filtration and by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide disc gel PACE product inhibition was observed with guanine and hypoxanthine as strong competitive inhibitors for the enzymatic phosphorolysis of guanosine respective kis calculated were x m for guanine and x m for hypoxanthine ribose phosphate another product of the reaction gave MK-801 inhibition with guanosine as variable substrate and an inhibition constant of x m was calculated the protection of essential sh CG on the enzyme by mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol was necessary for the maintenance of enzyme activity MK-801 inhibition was observed for pchloromercuribenzoate with an inhibition constant of x m complete reversal of this inhibition by an excess of mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol was demonstrated in the presence of methylene blue the enzyme showed a high sensitivity to photooxidation and a dependence of photoinactivation on ph strongly implicating histidine as the susceptible group at the active site of the enzyme the pka values determined for ionizable CG of the active site of the enzyme were near ph and ph the chemical and kinetic evidences suggest that histidine and cysteine may be essential for catalysis inorganic orthophosphate km x m was an obligatory anion requirement and arsenate substituted for phosphate with comparable results guanosine km x m deoxyguanosine km x m and inosine km x m were substrates for enzymatic phosphorolysis xanthosine was an extremely poor substrate and adenosine was not phosphorylyzed at fold excess of the homogeneous enzyme guanine km x mribose phosphate km x m and hypoxanthine were substrates for the reverse reaction namely the enzymatic synthesis of nucleosides the initial velocity studies of the saturation of the enzyme with guanosine at various fixed concentrations of Pi suggest a sequential bireactant catalytic mechanism for the enzyme
155,to study the significance of trh in the hypothalamopituitarythyroid axis measurement of trh in body fluid are needed we previously reported trh radioimmunoassay for urine trh radioimmunoassay for SS has not established yet because trh immunoreactivity is inactivated with serum we investigated effects of various AF on this inactivation and method for prevention of this inactivation synthetic trh was added to normal human serum at degrees c and incubated at degrees c degrees c degrees c degrees c or degrees c for various intervals after incubation REC of trh was measured after one hour incubation recovery of trh was at degrees c at degrees c at degrees c or degrees c incubation of trh serum mixtures at degrees c after incubation at degrees c resulted in some recovery of trh T3 one hour incubation at degrees c recovery of trh was at serum ph at serum ph to or REC of trh was increased in accordance with stepwisely increase of SS dilution concentrations of SS thyroid hormone did not affect recovery of trh smaller quantities of trh were more rapidly inactivated inactivation of trh immunoreactivity could be prevented addition of bal over mgml or mixture of hydroxyquinoline hq and tween t over mgml of hq and lmgml of t duration of effectiveness of bal was short effectiveness of hqt continued for weeks if hqt treated serum was stored at degrees c from above data it was suggested that trh immunoreactivity might be inactivated with enzyme system and other AF and trh levels in the serum might be able to measure with addition of hqt to serum
156,pig HR nadspecific isocitrate dehydrogenase is inactivated by reaction with IAA at ph loss of activity can be attributed to the formation of mol of carboxymethylcysteine per peptide chain the rate of inactivation is markedly decreased by the combined addition of mn and isocitrate but not by alphaketoglutarate the coenzyme nad or the allosteric activator adp the substrate concentration dependence of the decreased rate of inactivation yields a dissociation constant of mm for the enzymemanganousdibasic isocitrate complex a value that is times higher than the km for this substrate this result suggests that in protecting the enzyme against IAA isocitrate may bind to a region distinct from the catalytic site isocitrate and mn also prevent thermal denaturation with an affinity for the enzyme close to that observed for the iodoacetatesensitive site the alkylatable cysteine residues may contribute to a manganousisocitrate binding site which is responsible for stabilizing an active conformation of the enzyme
157,the influence of expectancy set with regard to therapy outcome on the effectiveness of systematic desensitization sd for reducing public speaking anxiety was investigated the ss given a high expectancy set for favorable therapy outcome were informed about psychological research that indicates that sd is ERP to reduce public speaking fears sd was po with the standard instructions to the ss given a neutral expectancy set this expectancy manipulation did not require deception and perhaps could be used with actual sd therapy clients as in previous research by woy and efran the expectancy set manipulation significantly modified ss selfreport of subjective perceptions of anxiety from pretreatment to PT speeches but did not affect overt behavioral or physiological indices of anxiety since subjective perceptions of anxiety responses are psychologically significant behaviors these data suggest the importance of conveying a high expectation of improvement to sd and perhaps also to other types of therapy clients sd sessions administered to small CG of clients on consecutive days as in this study appeared to be as effective to reduce speech anxiety as sd sessions administered to each client individually at week intervals as in the woy and efran study
158,subcoma doses of fatty acids and ammonium salts injected intraperitoneally at the same time into rats or cats act synergistically to produce coma under these circumstances the blood ammonia is more than double that when the nh is given CT after these observations a rat liver TH system was utilized to study the effect of fatty acids on ammonia utilization in urea glutamate and glutamine synthesis in vitro acetylglutamatecatalyzed urea synthesis was completely inhibited by mm octanoate and was depressed by mm octanoate citrulline synthesis was similarly inhibited and respectively the concentration of liver octanoate at the moment of occurrence of coma after an in vivo i.t. was approximately mm the GABA effect of fatty acids on the utilization of nh in the urea cycle was greater the longer the fatty acid chain the critical step in this interference with ammonia metabolism was the inhibition of carbamyl phosphate synthetase argininosuccinate synthetase activity was also inhibited to a lesser degree but ornithine transcarbamylase argininosuccinate lyase and arginase were unaffected glutamate dehydrogenase was likewise inhibited in liver and brain by mm octanoate whereas glutamine synthetase was unaffected thus the two main processes whereby ammonia is metabolized were inhibited by fatty acids at concentrations that exist pathologically which accounts at least in part for the rise in blood ammonia in vivo
159,the first apparent dissociation constant of carbonic acid pk of plasma and red cells was determined on venous blood of ten healthy AD male human subjects ph and pco of plasma and red cells were analyzed electrometrically and a micromanometric method was used for the determination of total carbon dioxide content erythrocyte carbamino HbA1c were estimated and used for the correction of erythrocyte pk each blood sample was subjected to the following regimen before centrifugation as drawn from the antecubital vein oxygenated with a co o balance gas mixture and reduced with a co n balance gas mixture pk of plasma and red cells are presented see article the consistently larger values for red cell pk than the respective plasma data may be attributed to the greater amount of carbamino hemoglobin concentration present in the erythrocytes a simplified method for the calculation of erythrocyte bicarbonate concentration using the experimentally determined red cell pk value has been formulated the method involves the use of a regression equation relating plasma and red cell ph the equivalence of plasma and red cell pco along with the experimentally determined red cell pk
160,two transaminases exist for IMT and phenylalanine synthesis in Bs one enzyme is also responsible for the transamination of imidazole acetol phosphate to histidinol phosphate an obligatory reaction in the synthesis of histidine the gene involved in the synthesis of this enzyme lies in the middle of a cluster of genes all of which are concerned with the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids the other gene has not yet been mapped mutants have been isolated that lack one or the other enzyme activity these mutants are prototrophic for IMT and phenylalanine however both classes of mutants are more sensitive than the wildtype strain to the phenylalanine analogue fluorophenylalanine suggesting that each of these mutants synthesizes less phenylalanine than does the wildtype CS the two enzymes can be separated from one another by IEC and glycerolgradient centrifugation the significance of the observation that an enzyme of histidine synthesis also plays a role in the synthesis of the aromatic acids is considered in light of crosspathways regulation between the two pathways
161,the past years have firmly established the role of betaadrenoceptor blocking agents in the treatment of hypertension they have been shown to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the lying and standing position in mild moderate and severe hypertension precise indications for betablockade have not yet been CR defined some authorities regard them as the drug of first choice in the management of most grades of idiopathic hypertension there are in addition certain situations where betablockade seems especially suitable these include the presence of associated coronary heart disease manifest either as AP or dysrhythmia these agents can be introduced when side effects from other drugs are severe or intolerable and are valuable in the management of hypertensive young males since betablocking drugs do not interfere with SF compared with NT stress has been shown to produce excessive rise of blood pressure in those with labile or sustained idiopathic hypertension after therapy with betablocking agents the rise in blood pressure after stress is reduced if labile andor mild hypertension are the precursors of subsequently more severe sustained hypertension then long term betablockade may help to control this response
162,rhodopseudomonas spheroides can grow in a defined medium with either CS or oxygen as an energy source cells grown anaerobically or at very low oxygen tensions are rich in the photosynthetic pigment bacteriochlorophyll whereas this pigment is virtually absent in cells grown under high oxygen tensions aminolaevulinate synthetase the first enzyme on the pathway to bacteriochlorophyll appears to play an important role in the control of bacteriochlorophyll synthesis thus the enzyme has a high activity in extracts of pigmented cells and a low activity in extracts of nonpigmented cells further oxygenation of a pigmented culture causes immediate cessation of pigment synthesis and produces a rapid fall in the activity of aminolaevulinate synthetase this loss of activity appears to be due to the loss of an endogenous activator of the enzyme thus pigmented cells contain cystine trisulphide which at mum concentrations is an activator of aminolaevulinate synthetase while oxygenation causes a rapid fall in the cellular content of this trisulphide cystathionase ec extracted from pigmented cells can catalyse the formation of cystine trisulphide from cystine while rhodanese ec extracted from the same cells can catalyse the Kd of cystine trisulphide in the presence of sulphite to form cystine and thiosulphate it is proposed that the cellular content of cystine trisulphide is controlled by changes in the levels of substrates for cystathionase and possibly rhodanese rather than changes in the amounts of these enzymes cystine trisulphide controls the activity of aminolaevulinate synthetase by converting a lowactivity form of the enzyme bform into a highactivity form aform the fall in aminolaevulinate synthetase activity on oxygenation appears to be the result of cessation of conversion of bform into aform along with a conversion of aform into bform factors affecting the equilibrium between the forms and the possible mechanisms for their interconversion are discussed
163,the CFI cfi isolated from human serum contains a kininase activity that causes extensive hydrolysis of bradykinin the highly chemotactic synthetic peptide metleuphe was completely hydrolyzed by cfi preparations the PR of the constituent amino acids from this peptide coincided with a loss of its chemotactic activity the nformyl but not the NH derivative of the leukotactic peptide metleuphe was resistant to the action of cfi as evidenced by chemotactic and biochemical assays examination of the specificity of cfi proteolysis revealed that short polypeptide substrates are degraded sequentially from the amino terminus larger peptides are less extensively hydrolyzed and the patterns of hydrolysis are more complex inactivation of the bacterial chemotactic factors by cfi was overcome by the addition of high concentrations of MMP which were substrated for cfi cfi preparations readily hydrolyzed the peptide argpheala the constituent amino acids were conveniently identified by thinlayer chromatography method this procedure afforded a rapid assay for measuring cfi activity in the whole human SS as well as in fractions throughout the purification steps moreover cfi also hydrolyzed lleucylbetanapthylamide at rates comparable to peptides thus lleucylbetanapthylamide served as a useful substrate for estimating cfi activity in preparations at various stages of purification this substrate was also useful in kinetic studies the results from these studies indicate an aminopeptidase activity is the mechanism whereby cfi inhibits the activity of chemotactic substrates
164,we determined the incidence of pneumothorax in infants mean birthweight gm with the RDS rds treated according to the same protocol fiftyfive infants mean birthweight gm developed pneumothorax incidence incidence varied with severity of rds and intensity of respiratory assistance pneumothorax occurred in of of infants who received no assisted ventilation and in of of infants who received continuous positive airway pressure cpap as the only form of assisted ventilation the difference between these two groups is not significant fortynine infants initially treated with cpap later required mechanical ventilation with positive endexpiratory pressure peep pneumothorax occurred in of the and in of of those infants initially treated with peep the incidence of PTX for both these groups was significantly higher than for those treated with no AV or cpap only to assess the value of frequent measurement of vital signs blood gas tensions and ph in the recognition of PTX we analyzed these variables by the cumulative sum statistical technique we noted the following significant changes associated with pneumothorax arterial blood pressure heart rate and respiratory rate decreased in of cases PP narrowed in of cases po decreased in of cases in which ventilatory settings were constant for at least three hours prior to PTX however ph and pco showed consistent changes frequent measurements of vital signs and po aid in the early diagnosis of pneumothorax
165,the isolation is described of pure cultures of three nonmethaneutilizing methylotrophic bacteria which together with the previously described bacillus pm have a very limited range of growth substrates these organisms are designated restricted facultative methylotrophs two of these isolates wa and wa grow only on gl out of nonc compounds tested whereas the third isolate sa and bacillus pm grow on betaine gl gluconate alanine glutamate citrate and nutrient agar but not on any of a further nonc compounds crude sonic extracts of trimethylaminegrown and glucosegrown wa and wa isolates and of trimethylaminegrown ca an obligate methylotroph contain i no detectable oxogltarate dehydrogenase activity ii very low or zero TPS activities of succinate dehydrogenase and SCS and iii naddependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity extracts of trimethylaminegrown pm and sa methylotrophs have i very low oxoglutarate dehydrogenase specific activities ii comparatively high TPS MICs of succinate dehydrogenase malate dehydrogenase and SCS and iii nadpdependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity but no naddependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity the activities of most of these enzymes are increased during growth on glucose alanine glutamate or citrate but only very low oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activities are present under all growth conditions the restricted facultative methylotrophs grow on certain nonc EDC in the absence of oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and in some cases of other enzymes of the TCA cycle these lesions cannot therefore be the sole cause of obligate methylotrophy
166,the levels of plasma carotenoids were markedly reduced in broiler cockerels infected with eimeria acervulina or e tenella the mechanisms of this depigmentation differed between the two species being primarily associated with interference of absorption of xanthophyll carotenoids from the intestinal lumen with e acervulina infection and with leakage through the damaged wall of the cecum with e tenella infection chicks reared on an essentially carotenoidfree diet and inoculated with e acervulina showed no detectable C2 of carotenoids in the blood hours after being changed to a diet containing mg of xanthophyllkg conversely uninoculated chicks and chicks inoculated with e tenella showed significant and similar increases in plasma levels of carotenoids chicks reared on a diet containing xanthophyll and inoculated with e tenella showed a more rapid decrease in plasma carotenoids than did uninoculated controls when changed to a xanthophyllfree diet in chicks fed high xanthophyll diets containing chromic oxide no indication of malabsorption was seen in chicks infected with e tenella compared with uninoculated controls whereas chicks inoculated with e acervulina showed significantly less xanthophyll absorption conversely a marked increase in the xanthophyll cro ratio was observed in the cecal contents of chicks inoculated with e tenella compared with uninuoculated controls or those inoculated with e acervulina studies of uninoculated chicks pairfed with chicks inoculated with e acervulina or e tenella indicated that the decrease in plasma carotenoids and increases in intestinal ph are not associated with the reduced intake of feed associated with infection the studies involving uninoculated birds with reciprocal chagnes between high and low xanthophyll diets indicated that plasma carotenoids are a more rapid and sensitive means of measuring changes in pigmentation levels than are visual skin scores carotenoid levels from the skin
167,the role of calcium and magnesiumatp on the structure and contractility in motile extracts of amoeba proteus and plasmalemmaectoplasm ghosts of chaos carolinensis has been investigated by correlating CS and electron microscope observations with turbidity and birefringence measurements the extract is nonmotile and contains very few factin filaments and myosin aggregates when prepared in the presence of both low calcium ion and atp concentrations at an ionic strength of i ph the addition of mm magnesium chloride mm atp in the presence of a low calcium ion concentration relaxation solution induced the formation of some fibrous bundles of actin without contracting whereas the addition of a micromolar concentration of calcium in addition to mm magnesiumatp contraction solution taylor d l j s condeelis p l moore and r d allen j cell biol initiated the formation of large arrays of factin filaments followed by contractions furthermore plasmalemmaectoplasm ghosts prepared in the relaxation solution exhibited very few straight factin filaments and myosin aggregates in contrast plasmalemmaectoplasm ghosts treated with the contraction solution contained many straight factin filaments and myosin aggregates the increase in the structure of ameba cytoplasm at the endoplasmectoplasm interface can be explained by a combination of the transformation of actin from a less filamentous to a more structured filamentous state possibly involving the crosslinking of actin to form fibrillar arrays see abovementioned reference followed by contractions of the actin and S1 along an undetermined distance of the endoplasm andor ectoplasm
168,twentyfour couples facing longstanding primary or secondary infertility underwent semen analysis pct PET evaluation of MC hysterosalpingography and laparscopy all clinical findings were normal with the exception of pct which was positive in and negative in all the women underwent a multiple RPA investigation of local and circulating antibodies production as well as cellmediated immunity against live spermatozoa sperm immobilization test sit and spermatotoxicity tests stt were performed in a single experimental design on cervical mucus and blood serum leucocyte migration inhibition test in presence of sperms lmit was done on peripheral leucocytes local antispermatic activity in the C2 mucus was negative in all pct positive cases and positive in six out of pct negative cases sit and stt were both positive in CM and in blood in one case only no correlation could be found between pct and SS sit stt or lmit the fertility DP expressed by the number of pregnancies per years of exposure already low in the whole group was even lower in the subgroups with positive immunological factors positive immunological factors do not exclude the possibility of conception but appear to be associated with a reduced rate of conception
169,five chronically instrumented healthy dogs were exposed to a day period of breathing oxygen in a chamber the response to hypoxia was found to be time dependent during the first h of hypoxia the circulatory response was characterized by increases in cardiac output HR rate pulmonary and SVR arterial blood pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance SVR vascular resistance increased left atrial pressure decreased during the early part of hypoxia the animals became hypocapnic the pHa rose significantly during the rest of the hypoxic period cardiac output HR rate and arterial blood ph returned to the control values pulmonary and systemic arterial pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance remained significantly elevated systemic V1 resistance rose left atrial pressure remained below control this response to hypoxia was not substantially modified when the experiment was repeated during the administration of the antihistamine promethazine an hreceptor blocking agent in a dose which blocked the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to small doses of exogenous histamine the circulatory response to acute hypoxia in five anesthetized dogs was not modified by intravenous administration of metiamide an hreceptor blocking agent
170,we previously found that mouse t lymphocytes sensitized in vitro against allo or syngeneic fibroblasts upon i.t. into syngeneic recipients do not themselves differentiate into effector cells but recruit effector t lymphocytes within the draining CL nodes as a result of sensitization these Inr lymphocytes acquire a trypsinsensitive membrane property which is necessary for recruitment we now report studies on the in vivo migratory SMB of initiator lymphocytes following sensitization we injected crlabeled Inr lymphocytes into recipient footpads and found significantly increased migration of sensitized cells to the draining popliteal lymph node pln during the first day by amputation of the foot at various times we showed that migration during the first hours was critical for subsequent recruitment trypsin treatment of initiator lymphocytes abolished this accelerated migration lymphocytes triggered nonspecifically by con a migrated to the pln like antigensensitized cells we also compared the migration of injected lymphocytes from the footpad to the pln in graftversushost and hostversusgraft reactions and found these reactions to differ both from each other and from recruitment in terms of lymphocyte migration these findings are discussed in terms of the physiology of the CMI response and the notion of peripheral sensitization
171,the hepatic nuclear fraction isolated from methylcholanthrene mctreated rats contained enhanced levels of cytochrome p and AHH BP bp monooxygenase whereas the activities of epoxide hydrase and NADH phosphatecytochrome c reductase and the concentration of cytochrome b were not altered the metabolite pattern of bp was investigated by using highpressure liquid chromatography and was found to be similar in nuclei and microsomes from mctreated rats after incubation of the nuclear fraction with hbp and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinculeotide phosphate radioactivity was found to be associated with nuclear dna and the extent of binding was markedly enhanced by pretreatment of the animals with mc binding was strongly inhibited by anapthoflavone but was not influenced by trichloropropeneoxide an inhibitor of epoxide hydrase in the presence of microsomes from mctreated rats increased binding of bp to dna was observed in nuclei from both control and mctreated rats moreover when the nuclear dna was replaced by a corresponding amount of calf thymus dna the extent of binding was severalfold enhanced in contrast to nuclei from control rats the nuclear fraction from mctreated rats showed an increase in bound radioactivity when incubated with a microsomefree supernatant obtained by incubating microsomes from mctreated rats with hbp the increase in extent of binding was eliminated in the presence of menadione or alphanaphthoflavone it is suggested that under the conditions used here the following different processes may have contributed to the total incorporation of bp products into nuclear dna a formation of dnabinding products derived from bp by nuclear aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase b formation of dnabinding products from microsomal bp metabolites by nuclear aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and c direct transfer of reactive microsomal metabolites to nuclear dna
172,the effects of the compounds and aminopyridine and sparteine on membrane conductance changes were examined using both voltageclamped myxicola axons and the lobster NM junction in myxicola axons the aminopyridines very specifically inhibited the potassium conductance when applied at concentrations of mm to mm without any apparent effect of resting membrane potential concentrations in excess of mm were needed to inhibit noticeably the sodium conductance potassium conductancevoltage curves were shifted in the depolarized direction along the voltage axis with no significant NC in shape there were only minor changes in the kinetics of potassium activation in high potassium solutions both inward and outward potassium currents were equally CS to the aminopyridines sparteine was in general found to be a more potent but somewhat less specific inhibitor of the potassium conductance in contrast to the aminopyridines sparteine was more effective when applied at basic ph and in addition tended to produce a noticeable degree of potassium inactivation when applied to the lobster NM junction aminopyridine and sparteine dramatically increased the amplitude of both excitatory and inhibitory postjunctional potentials with little or no NC in resting potential resting input conductance reversal potential or miniature end plate potential amplitude or frequency quantal content per fiber was increased by approximately a factor of for the excitatory responses
173,the alphaglucan phosphorylase alphaglucan orthophosphate glucosyltransferase ec associated with the particulate cell fraction of streptococcus mitior strain s was compared with the soluble maltodextrin phosphorylase that had been previously isolated from the same organism walker et al the particulate enzyme was more sensitive to the glycogen content of the cell than the soluble euzyme its activity was highest when the cells were grown under conditions favoring high glycogen storage substrate specificities of the two high activity towards endogenous glycogen whereas lowmolecularweight maltodextrins were the preferred substrates for the soluble phosphorylase the purification of the particulate phosphorylase included incubation of the particulate fraction in mm sodium phosphate mm sodium citrate wtvol triton x buffer ph and ionexchange chromatography on diethylaminoethyl sephadex a the purified enzyme was fully soluble the value for the purification factor was variable and depended on i the substrate used and ii whether the synthetic or the degradative reaction was being measured the solubilization resulted in considerable changes in the properties of the phosphorylase the ph optimum for activity was raised from to and the ATP specificity was altered consequently the purified enzyme bore greater similarity to the soluble maltodextrin phosphorylase the reported results are best explained in terms of a single phosphorylase the specificity which is determind by its binding state in the cell the enzyme acts as a glycogen phosphorylase in the particulate state and as a maltodextrin phosphorylase when soluble the equilibrium between the two forms is related to the glycogen content of the cells
174,the relationship between ph and fluoride uptake in IN enamel of permanent premolars was investigated by using a sodium fluoride dentifrice a KF manganese chloride dentifrice and a sodium fluoride solution of the same fluoride concentration the first part of this paper deals with the in vitro uptake of fluoride from dentifrice slurries and from sodium fluoride solutions of different ph ranging from to this investigation showed that there was no significant difference between the agents but that the effect of the ph was significant the uptake of fluoride in the form of fluorapatite was more than five times larger at the lower ph level the second part of the paper deals with the rate of fluoride uptake increase in fluoride content from dentifrices in the same ph range it was shown that the three agents gave the same initial rate of fluoride uptake about partsmin at ph and that the rate of fluoride uptake in the outer layer of the enamel was proportional to the hydrogen ion activity
175,a type c hexokinase atpdhexosephosphotransferase ec was partially purified from the CL of the frog calyptocephalella caudiverbera the enzyme is inhibited by glucose C2 in the range of normal BS concentrations the extent of the inhibition by gl depends on the concentration of atp being most marked between and mm atp fructose although a ATP was not inhibitory of its own phosphorylation the GABA effect of HG levels exhibited a strong reversible ph dependence being most marked at ph at ph the inhibition by high glucose levels was a function of the enzyme concentration the effect being stronger at high enzyme concentrations whereas no inhibition was observed when assaying very diluted preparations at all enzyme concentrations studied high levels of gl caused no inhibition at ph whereas at ph strong inhibition was always observed short times of photooxidation of hexokinase c as well as incubation with low concentrations of pchloromercuribenzoate resulted in the loss of the inhibition by excess of gl glucosephosphate was found to be a strong inhibitor of hexokinase c but only at high glucose levels the inhibitory effect of glucosep follows sigmoidal kinetics at low about mm glucose concentrations the hill coefficient being the kinetics of the inhibition became hyperbolic at high greater than mm glucose levels these results suggest that the inhibition of hexokinase c by excess glucose is due to the interaction of glucose with a second aldosespecific RII site on the enzyme the modification of the inhibitory effect by atp glucosep enzyme concentration and ph all of them at physiological levels indicates a major role for hexokinase c in the regulation of glucose utilization by the CL
176,in four dogs provided with special gastroduodenal fistulas allowing for the complete separation of stomach and duodenum without interrupting the vagal connections between them the magnitude of the gastric and intestinal phases was compared and their contribution to the total gastric response to a meal was established a liver extract le meal confined to the stomach and maintained at ph by an i.g. titration technique produced acid output reaching of the maximal response to histamine mrh perfusion of the le meal into the duodenum resulted in acid secretion amounting to of mrh the combination of the gastric and intestinal phases caused the highest acid output amounting to about of mrh gastric and intestinal phases induced separately were accompanied by a significant elevation in serum gastrin concentrations which reached the highest values when both phases were evoked simultaneously acidification of the intestinal meal resulted in phdependent inhibition of gastric secretion falling to the basal values at ph these secretory changes were mimicked by exogenous secretin SS gastrin C2 remained essentially unaffected by the acidification of the intestinal meal while exogenous secretin significantly lowered them in conclusion in the intact stomach with undisturbed nervous connections between the stomach and duodenum a peptone meal in the intestine is capable of evoking a potent gastric acid and pepsin stimulation by a mechanism involving the release of antral hormone
177,the CSD of labeled lymph node cells causing an acute gvh reaction in lethally irradiated allogeneic recipients was studied lymph node cells of cbl mice were labeled with cr and injected into lethally irradiated a B6 mice b cba mice c cba mice sensitized to cbl antigens prior to irradiation d cba mice splenectomized before irradiation two more exp situations were studied in which cbl donors of lymph node cells were e presensitized to cba antigens or f deprived of tlymphocytes the amount of radioactivity was determined in the whole body blood liver spleen subcutaneous lymph nodes lungs femora and kidneys of the irradiated recipient at regular intervals from the time of i.t. to the th hour after it we found that living cells lodged predominantly in the spleen and the CL nodes while dead and dying cells accumulated in the CL other organs contained very small amounts of radioactivity all the results point to the primary role of the spleen in the acute graftversushost reaction
178,the myeloma iga protein produced by plasmacytoma xrpc was isolated by AC on dinitrophenyllysinesepharose the affinity constant of the intact protein or its fab toward dinitrophenylllysine dnp was found to be x m in order to prepare an fv fragment hochman j inbar d and givol d biochemistry from this protein the heavy and light chains were separated and the light chain was digested with trypsin at ph to yield half a light chain this digest was reassociated with the heavy chain and the recombinant was digested with papain at ph fractionation of this digest on a sephadex g column and dnplysinesepharose resulted in the isolation of an fv fragment which possesses one binding site for dnplysine ka x m the active fv fragment has a molecular weight of and is composed of two peptide chains each having a molecular weight of approximately the nterminal residues of these chains are aspartic and glutamic acids which are also nterminal in the heavy and light chains indicating that the fv is composed of vl and vh
179,unconjugated sulfobromophthalein bsp inhibits state iii respiration of rat CL mitochondria it competitively inhibits the translocation into mitochondria of citrate malate phosphate and adenosine diphosphate as studied by the inhibitor stop method a doublebeam spectrophotometric study strongly suggests that glutamate translocation is similarly inhibited T3 perfusion of mumolhr g for minutes bile flow is inhibited by and liver adenosine triphosphate atp falls by the amount of mitochondrial bsp can be computed form the amount of s bsp still bound to mitochondria that are prepared at the end of such experiments the amount of bsp lost during the isolation procedure is estimated from parallel experiments following binding of bsp in vitro comparison of the kinetic constants of mitochondrial transport and of their inhibition by bsp on the one hand and of CL concentration of substrates and bsp on the other gives rise to the conclusion that a strong inhibition of transports mainly of phosphate occurs in vivo and is responsible for the concomitant decrease in bile flow
180,a method has been developed for the quantitative determination of heptabarbital cycloheptenylethylbarbituric acid in human plasma after administration of single therapeutic doses of the drug it involves a single SE step followed by gas chromatography with alkali FID and the results were linear in the concentration range mugml plasma the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of heptabarbital and heptabarbital sodium were studied in a crossover design in healthy volunteers after oral administration of tablets containing mg heptabarbital and hard gelatine capsules containing an equivalent amount of its sodium salt heptabarbital concentrations in plasma were determined at regular intervals the absorption of heptabarbital from the tablets absorbed more rapidly and peak concentrations occurred between and h in all cases the elimination of heptabarbital could be described by a single firstorder process with an average halflife of h range h the halflife of the drug in each individual was about the same in the two trials the relative BA in each volunteer was estimated by comparing the areas under the plasma concentration curves the sodium salt had an average bioavailability of relative to the free acid in some volunteers urinary excretion of unchanged heptabarbital was measured cumulative excretion amounted to of the po dose four volunteers received one tablet each night for eight or ten days but no accumulation was found in three volunteers the halflife of the drug prior to and after these experiments did not change whereas in the other volunteer the halflife decreased from to h the possibility of enzyme induction should be considered when heptabarbital is taken regularly it was concluded that heptabarbital was a suitable drug for the treatment of insomnia since its halflife was rather short heptabarbital sodium may be used for induction of sleep whereas medomin tablets ie heptabarbital free acid may be prescribed when the maintenance of sleep is the primary reason for treatment with a hypnotic drug
181,myocardial cell ph was measured with dimethyl oxazolidinedione dmo in IN anesthetized dogs by a transient indicator dilution technique bolus injections of labeled dmo V1 extracellular and water indicators were made into the left anterior descending coronary artery and blood samples were collected from the great cardiac vein the steady state distribution of dmo between cells and plasma was calculated from the mean transit times of the indicator normal myocardial cell ph averaged and changed by of the concomitant alterations in plasma ph after infusions of acid or alkali MI induced by inflation of a balloon tip catheter in the LAD artery resulted in progressive decreases in cell ph to by hour infusions of sodium carbonate diminished intracellular acidosis hemodynamic studies during hours of ischemia with blood ph at to indicated a significantly reduced left VVI enddiastolic pressure and increased stroke volume by comparison with findings in animals given infusions of saline solution ventriculograms revealed improved wall motion in the ICM segment after infusion of alkali precordial mapping showed a significant reduction in the number of leads with st segment elevation as well as in the sum of st segment elevations but r wave amplitudes did not differ from those in control studies calculations of extracellular space tissue water and cation content revealed a reduced gain of cell sodium ion and loss of cell potassium ion during ischemia T3 alkali treatment the latter may account for the st segment responses whereas enhanced ventricular performance may be related to reduced competition of hydrogen ion with calcium ion for binding sites on contractile protein
182,seven ponies were subjected to CBD cd and two ponies were sham operated s measurement of arterial blood gases and arterial blood and cerebrospinal fluid csf acidbase balance were made prior to and and wks after surgery in unanesthetized animals resting ventilation and ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia and nacn infusion were assessed prior to and and wks after surgery alveolar hypoventilation in the cd ponies was marked wk after surgery when ve and va were reduced and respectively from control and paco was mmhg above control however the effect was not nearly as great and wk T3 surgery when the paco stabilized at approximately mmhg above control paco arterial blood ph was normal in the hypercapnic cd ponies but csf ph remained acid relative to normal throughout the wk period changes in ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia and nacn tended to parallel changes in resting ventilation these findings suggest the CBs are essential in ponies to maintain normal ventilation in cd ponies IP chemosensitivity is partially regained at some unestablished locus and ph compensating mechanisms in chronically hypercapnic ponies function relatively better in blood than in csf
183,recognition of metal cations by biological systems can be compared with the geochemical criteria for isomorphous replacement biological systems are more highly selective and much more rapid methods of maintaining an optimum concentration including storage and transfer for the essential trace elements copper and iron used in some organisms are in part reproducible by coordination chemists while other features have not been reporduced in models poisoning can result from a foreign metal taking part in a reaction irreversibly so that the recognition site or molecule is not released for major nutrients sodium potassium magnesium and calcium there are similarities to the trace metals in selective uptake but differences qualitatively and quantitatively in biological activity compounds selective for potassium replace all the solvation sphere with a symmetrical arrangement of oxygen atoms those selective for sodium give an asymmetrical environment with retention of a solvent molecule experiments with naturally occurring antibiotics and synthetic MM compounds have shown that flexibility is an important feature of selectivity and that for transfer or carrier properties there is an optimum as opposed to a maximum metalligand stability constant thallium is taken up instead of potassium and will activate some enzymes it is suggested that the poisonous characteristics arise because the thallium ion may bind more strongly than potassium to part of a site and then fail to bind additional atoms as required for the biological activity criteria for the design of selective complexing agents are given with indications of those which might transfer more than one metal at once
184,during the wet seasons of and possibly sentinel horses became infected by venezuelan encephalitis ve virus in a temporally and geographically progressive manner inland from an enzootic marsh focus of virus on the pacific couast of southeastern guatemala during the wet seasons of and ve virus was detected by sentinel horses and a sentinel hamster in in a small woods km north of the marsh but virus was undetectable there during the dry seasons of and and the wet season of culex melanoconion mosquitoes were found in this woods and at the marsh during august these observations are compatible with movement of ve virus from the marsh habitat during some wet seasons however virus activity in this region adjacent to the marsh was quantitatively unpredictable on a yearly basis and occurred in only very focal habitats during to mechanisms of ve virus movement from the marsh are currently unknown but bats are under T0 as a likely possibility
185,the flashinduced oxidation kinetics of the primary acceptor of light reaction ii x and the reduction kinetics of chlorophyll ai p after farred preillumination have been studied with high time resolution in spinach chloroplasts the kinetics of chlorophyll ai exhibits a pronounced lag phase of ms at the ON of reduction as would be expected for the final product of consecutive reactions because the oxidation of the plastoquinone pool is the ratelimiting step for the electron transport between the two light reactions the lag indicates the maximal electron transfer time over all preceding reactions T3 light reaction ii the observation that the lag phase decreases with decreasing ph is evidence of an electron transfer step coupled to a proton uptake reaction protonation of x after reduction in the flash is excluded because a slight increase of the decay time is found at decreasing ph values the time course of plastohydroquinone formation is deduced from the first derivative of the reduction kinetics of chlorophyll ai this RPA covers those plastohydroquinone molecules being available to the electron carriers of system i via the ratelimiting step direct measurements of absorbance changes would not allow to discriminate between these and functionally different plastohydroquinone molecules the derived time course of plastohydroquinone at different ph gives evidence for an additional electron transfer step with a half time of about ms following the proton uptake and preceding the ratelimiting step it is tentatively attributed to the diffusion of neutral plastohydroquinone across the hydrophobic core of the thylkaloid membrane the lower limit of the rate constant for proton uptake by an electron carrier consistent with the lag of chlorophyll ai reduction is estimated as greater than ms the value is higher than that of the fastest diffusion controlled protonations of organic molecules in solution possible mechanisms of linear electron transport between light reaction ii and the ratelimiting oxidation of neutral plastohydroquinone are thoroughly discussed
186,solubilities of deoxygenated HbS deoxyhb s at varying ph and temperature over a range of concentrations encompassing those found in erythrocytes were measured the technique involved ultracentrifugation which gave values of the supernatant concentration and the mass of the sedimented material the data establish that the solubility of doexyhb s is the saturation concentration and is independent of initial concentration the mass of the pellet phase increases linearly with initial concentration moreover the saturation concentration represents the critical concentration above which monomers are in equilibrium with polymers these polymers are the putative cause of erythrocytes deformation associated with sickle cell anemia the solubilityph profiles of deoxyhb s at various temperatures unlike those of other proteins show no minima at the isoelectric ph but instead show a marked decrease in solubility below ph indicating the predominance of polymerization over the expected increase in solubility deoxyhb s within specified ranges of temperature and ph possesses a negative temperature coefficient of solubility a property characteristic of hydrophobic interactions the saturation concentration is however temperature independent at conditions close to physiological the enthalpy of polymerization kcalmol is temperature independent from degrees to degrees for all ph values between and in the range of degrees to degrees this parameter becomes less endothermic having a value of kcalmol at ph and a value of zero at ph such SMB of the system suggests a Tm near degreas within the range of conditions examined the polymerization is entropically driven

188,some S9 of both native aspartate transcarbamylase from escherichia coli and catalytic subunit have fewer tight IB sites per oligomer for carbamylp than the number of catalytic peptide chains in contrast the number of sites for the tightbinding inhibitor nphosphonacetyllaspartate does equal the number of catalytic chains in each case binding of the labile carbamylp was determined using rapid gel filtration with conversion to SD carbamyllaspartate during collection native enzyme six catalytic chains obtained from cells grown under the conditions of jc gerhart and h holoubek j biol chem has tight sites for carbamylp at ph kd mum whereas native enzyme from cells grown with higher concentrations of gl uracil and histidine to yield more enzyme NV of culture has only tight sites at ph kd mum and only tight sites at ph kd mum at ph catalytic S1 three catalytic chains obtained from the former native enzyme has tight sites for carbamylp kd mum and the number of sites is in the presence of mm succinate whereas catalytic subunit obtained from the latter native enzyme has tight sites kd mum in the absence of succinate and tight sites in its presence the number of tight binding sites is also less than the number of S1 peptide chains in f nuclear magnetic resonance experiments performed with catalytic subunit and two fluorinated analogs of carbamylp at comparable concentrations of analogs and active sites a model is proposed in which incomplete removal of formylmethionine from the nh termini of the enzyme under conditions of extreme depression affects affinity for ligands
189,as shown previously proteinases frequently associated with plasma albumin samples catalyze a very limited and specific cleavage of the albumin molecule when it exists in the f conformational state near ph the primary proteolytic product bpa has a molecular weight similar to or MZ with that of the parent protein but yields two large fragments of molecular weight approximately and on reduction evidence is presented here that cleavage occurs within the disulfide loop between cys and cys with no detectable loss of small MMP the amino acid composition of bpa being identical with that of the parent protein within experimental error cleavage exposes a new aminoterminal phenylalanine residue and may occur at the glxphe bond although the possibility exists that it occurs at another xphe bond in the unsequenced region of residues the damaged protein has a somewhat altered secondary structure as judged from ORD and circular dichroism measurements probably an approximate loss in helicity the hydrodynamic volume is increased by approximately however various PCS studies indicate the tertiary structure to be strikingly similar to that of the native protein of most significance is the fact that the protein still undergoes the nf and nb transitions although in both cases they occur at somewhat more moderate ph than in the parent protein moreover a sensitivity of the nb transition to ca is still seen and binding behavior toward the dye anilinonaphthalenesulfonic acid is essentially unaltered the results are best understood in terms of the concept of a multidomain structure which has been suggested frequently for plasma ablumin bond cleavage damages one domain but leaves the overall structure essentially unaltered except for some weakening of the interaction between domains
190,an endoribonuclease which cleaves trna F0 molecules has been partially purified from human kb tissue culture cells this activity is found in cytoplasmic fractions but is not detectable in the nucleoplasm trna precursor molecules from both e coli and kb cells are cleaved by this novel activity to produce phosphateterminated oligonucleotides e coli rnaase p and the kb cell nuclease both make a single endonucleolytic scission in e coli trnatyr precursor thereby separating the extra nucleotides on the end of the precursor molecule from the terminal sequence of the mature trnatyr molecule the cleavage products generated from other e coli trna precursors by the kb cell activity are identical in size to those produced by rnaase p the kb cell endoribonuclease requires mg and a monovalent cation na k or nh for function the enzymatic activity has a broad ph optimum centered near ph and the activity is inhibited by trna several kb cell rnas with long halflives in vivo including s and bulk s rna are not cleaved by this nuclease the kb cell endoribonuclease resembles e coli rnaase p in its substrate specificity ph optimum ion requirements and sensitivity to trna these properties and the cytoplasmic localization of the novel endoribonuclease indicate its involvement in the biosynthesis of kb cell trna
191,in patinets withstatus asthmaticus the authors have studied the acidbase balance the blood gas tensions and various humoral parameters the values were classified into two groups according to the paco level below or equal to torr GI higher than torr group ii in the cases of group ii there was a very close positive correlation between paco and h ions practically the same as that established by brackett et al in experimental acute hypercapnia in man on the contrary the correlation derived from cases of status asthmaticus in the literature showed in some cases a metabolic component in acidosis in the present work the mean value of lactates was close to normal there was a slow increase in protein content and hematocrit in the two groups the prognosis of the status asthmaticus depends on the degrees of hypercapnia when it reaches torr mechanical ventilation is urgently needed and is the main part of the treatment the use of additional drugs remains a matter of specific case
192,the oxidationreduction properties of the high potential ironsulfur protein hipip from chromatium vinosum have been investigated both equilibrium and kinetic measurements demonstrate electron transport by hipip is ph independent in the ph range the kinetics of reduction potassium ferrocyanide so so sodium ascorbate and rhodospirillum rubrum cytochrome c and oxidation potassium ferricyanide and rhodospirillium rubrum cytochrome c of hipip are reported based on the data obtained with different reactants and the influence of ionic strength ph and temperature on the kinetics of oxidation and reduction a number of conclusions can be drawn hipip undergoes rapid outersphere electron transfer with no evidence of kinetic complexity and no indication of complex formation with various reactants the site of oxidation of reduced hipip has an apparent negative charge while the site of reduction of Ox hipip is uncharged hipip appears to interact with a physiological reactant r rubrum cytochrome c at the same site as nonphysiological oxidants or reductants suggesting single minimum SE pathways for the oxidation and reduction processes based on a comparison of the rates of oxidation and reduction with different reactants it appears that steric restrictions and differences in oxidationreduction potential are less important than electrostatic attraction andor repulsion in determining the absolute rate constants the thermodynamic activation parameters indicate that both oxidation and reduction by the iron hexacyanides are driven entropically with the enthalpic terms making no contribution to hipip oxidation and a small contribution to hipip reduction based on the data reported here and available structural and physicalchemical information possible mechanisms of the oxidation and reduction of hipip are discussed and their relative merits analyzed the more likely mechanisms include electron transfer via a tyrosine residue electron transfer through a nonaqueous media to the ironsulfur chromophore and direct interaction between the ironsulfur chromophore and the different oxidants and reductants
193,after wistar male rats had been fed on a diet containing of ethyl pchlorophenoxyisobutyrate cpib for days changes in the enzyme activities and centrifugal behavior of rat liver peroxisomes were investigated compared with control rats fed on the basal diet the catalase ec activity of rat livers after the administration of cpib increased about fold while urate oxidase ec activity did not change significantly though damino acid oxidase ec activity markedly decreased to approximately onesixth of the control the activity of lalphahydroxy acid oxidase ec a flavin enzyme like damino acid oxidase was not affected significnatly T3 the administration of cpib when the hepatic cells of cpibtreated rats were fractionated by differential centrifugation most of the increase of catalase activity appeared in the supernatant fraction a decrease in the hepatic damino acid oxidase activity of cpibtreated rats was observed in all the fractions as for the subcellular CSD of the particlebound enzymes the TPS activities of both catalase and urate oxidase of cpibtreated rat livers were higher in the light mitochondrial fraction than in other fractions sedimentation patterns in a sucrose density gradient did not show any difference between normal peroxisomers and cpibtreated ones in the case of cpibtreated rats studies of their sedimentation patterns by ficoll density gradient centrifugation showed two main particulate peaks containing both catalase and urate oxidase although only a single peak was observed in the case of control rats
194,mechanisms producing hypertriglyceridemia during bacterial sepsis have not been well defined in this study lipid disposal mechanisms were assessed in infected and control male rhesus monkeys by the ability to dispose of triglycerides T3 oral lipid loading intravenous lipid loading and by lipolytic enzyme activity tests as measured by postheparin lipolytic activity phla studies were performed both before and hr T3 intravenous inoculation with either salmonella typhimurium or diplococcus pneumoniae when illness was uniformly severe and fasting serum triglyceride elevations were increased maximally s typhimuriuminfected monkeys demonstrated significant fasting hypertriglyceridemia p is less than reduced clearance of orally and intravenously administered lipid and markedly reduced phla during this GN sepsis mild lethargy slight diarrhea and a mortality were observed during d pneumoniae sepsis average fasting triglyceride concentrations were slightly but not significantly elevated while oral lipid clearance was impaired intravenous lipid clearance was unimpaired and phla was slightly reduced marked lethargy agitation and a mortality were present during this grampositive infection results of this study support the concept that an impairment of lipid disposal mechanisms particularly during GN sepsis with s typhimurium may significantly contribute to the observed HTG
195,dogfish were exposed to sudden changes of pco in inspired seawater during hypercapnia breathing frequency remained constant but gill ventilation was transiently increased to about of control levels in the st h VO2 was significantly increased also but returned to the initial level before nomalization of gill ventilation in contrast to the transient rise in gill ventilation and VO2 arterial po was increased for the whole period of hypercapnia hypercapnia results in a marked fall in pha which returned to the initial value in h even though hypercapnia is maintained this rise in pha with little NC in paco was associated with an increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration the increase of plasma bicarbonate was in part due to compensatory bicarbonate uptake from the seawater across the gills and in part was effected by transfer between intracellular tissue compartments and extracellular spaces the compensatory bicarbonate exchange mechanism in the gills seems to have a delay both after onset and termination of hypercapnia
196,four cultured mammalian cell lines differing in intrinsic resistance to methotrexate over a fold range have been compared with respect to several biochemical factors that might influence response to the drug cellular activity of the enzymes dihydrofolate reductase and TS and the total C2 of folate cofactors did not vary by more than a factor of among the cell lines all the cell types were able to transport extracellular methotrexate efficiently across the cell membrane and at comparable rates a kinetic study of HP dihydrofolate reductases from the four sources revealed small differences in the km values for DHF and NADH phosphate a study was made of the inhibition of the four dihydrofolate reductases by methotrexate and ki values were obtained by fitting the zone b equation of goldstein goldstein a j gen physiol to the resulting data values ki determined by this method correlated with intrinsic resistance of the cell lines and showed a fold range from the most sensitive to the most resistant line it is concluded that the response of a cell to methotrexate is significantly influenced by the dissociation constant of its dihydrofolate reductasemethotrexate complex
197,the interaction of riboflavin with a protein isolated from egg white has been studied spectrofluorimetrically at different ph values in m phosphate buffer ph complex formation occurs with the association constant ka m in the presence of SDS the complex dissociated with a rate constant of sec at degrees c the binding was sensitive to ph and to the antibodies produced against the protein on lowering the ph from to the binding affinity decreased approximately fold and below ph the binding could not be detected at all these data together with those obtained by measuring the fluorescence intensities of riboflavin in presence of nbromosuccinimide Ox and disulphide reduced apoprotein suggest that carboxyl functions tryptophan residues and disulphide bridges are essential for IB the emission spectra of the protein under different conditions upon excitation at and nm were analyzed to calculate the quantum yield q and the efficiency of energy transfer e from tyrosine to tryptophan residues from these data it was concluded that the SE transfer did not occur with equal efficiency under all conditions and that the tryptophan residues responsible for the riboflavin IB are more accessible to nbromosuccinimide oxidation than others
198,la ion behaves as a competitive inhibitor of ca ions on the calcium spike in the giant muscle fiber of the barnacle balanus nubilus latreated MF in which the rate of rise of the spike was diminished to a known degree have been examined with the electronmicroscope in such fibers dense particles are seen in association with the surface membrane and external lamina of the cell la particles are not seen in association with fibers that have been allowed to recover from la inhibition before fixation the number of la particles seen in association with the muscle fiber increases with increasing la concentration when the ca and mg concentrations are held constant and decreases with increasing ca and mg concentration when the la concentration is held constant the results suggest that the la visible in the electronmicroscope under the conditions of these experiments is bound to a class of sites similar to those involved in the ca spike
199,whatever the etiology of pulmonary edema ie increase in intrapulmonary water edema passes through three moreover intricate phases intracellular edema clearly visible in the type pneumocyte this intracellular edema appears at the same time as interstitial edema that which appears when numerous vesicules of pinocytosis and separation of the capillary endothelial cells account for it intraalveolar edema itself appears later and corresponds to the major clinical phase of pulmonary edema there is nothing surprising about this as the cellular functions of pneumocytes are impervious as can be shown for example by studies carried out with tracers this intracellular alveolar edema seems to have two different aspects depending on whether the exp conditions create an acute or subacute pathology in the acute form the edema is poor in lipids and in proteins in the subacute of chronic forms it is on the contrary very rich in them in the last phase a veritable desquamation of the pneumocytes then of the EC cells is produced which is very frequently lethal if survival occurs two sorts of lesions are found colonisation of the AM surface with type ii pneumocytes occurrence of possible intersitial fibrosis the remarkable fact is that such lesions are visible in a more or less MZ manner in all cases of pulmonary edema whether they be hemodynamic or lesional the morphology does not confirm this physiopathological distinction which is moreover questionable as all pulmonary edema become lesional sooner or later
200,the kinetic and molecular properties of a phosphofructokinase derived from a transplantable rat thyroid tumor lacking regulatory control on the glycolytic pathway were studied the properties of the nearpurified enzyme TPS activity unitsmg were compared with those of phosphofructokinase from normal rat thyroid specific activity unitsmg the electrophoretic mobilities and gel elution behavior of these two enzymes were almost similar the thyroid tumor phosphofructokinase showed however a greater degree of size andor shape heterogeneity in the presence of atp than the normal thyroid enzyme as determined by gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation kinetic studies below ph showed a sigmoid response curve for both enzymes when the velocity was determined at mm atp with varying levels of fructosep the interaction coefficient however was and for normal and tumor thyroid phosphofructokinase respectively ammonium sulfate decreased the cooperative interactions with the substrate fructosep in both enzymes the thyroid tumor enzyme however was less CS to the inhibition by atp and by citrate the reversal of citrate inhibition by cyclic adenosine monophosphate was also less effective with the thyroid tumor phosphofructokinase while the protective effect of fructosep was stronger the difference in citrate inhibition between RT and normal thyroid enzyme was not strongly affected by varying the mgcl concentration up to mm it is concluded that the complex allosteric regulation typical of the normal thyroid phosphofructokinase is still present in the enzyme isolated from the thyroid tumor tissue the latter however is more loosely controlled by its physiological effectors such as atp citrate and cyclic amp
201,two mitochondrial forms of acetoacetylcoa thiolases designated as enzyme a and enzyme b were crystallized from ox liver they could be shown to be homogenous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in direction of acetoacetylcoa cleavage enzyme a shows a double competitive ATP inhibition when acetoacetylcoa is varied at different fixed coa concentrations with enzyme b a parallel kinetic pattern is obtained when acetoacetylcoa is varied at different fixed coa concentrations in direction of acetoacetylcoa synthesis both enzymes show linear reciprocal plots of initial velocities against acetylcoa concentrations in absence of coa these initial velocity kinetics in the forward and in the reverse direction are in accordance with a pingpong mechanism of reaction for both enzymes involving an acetylsenzyme as intermediate under saturating concentrations of substrate the ratios of acetoacetylcoa synthesisacetoacetylcoa cleavage is for enzyme a and for enzyme b the maximum velocity in direction of acetoacetylcoa synthesis of enzymes a and b are mumol x min x unit thiolase and mumol x min x unit thiolase respectively both enzymes show nearly the same affinity for acetylcoa the km values are mum enzyme a and mum enzyme b coenzyme a and acetoacetylcoa both act as inhibitors in direction of acetoacetylcoa synthesis coenzyme a is a nonlinear competitive inhibitor of both enzymes acetoacetylcoa exerts a negative cooperativity on enzyme a nh and is a competitive inhibitor for enzyme b ki mum the catalytic and regulatory properties of the acetoacetylcoa thiolases a and b are discussed in terms of their proposed role in regulating ketogenesis intracellular fluctuations of acetoacetylcoahydroxybutyrylcoa ratios resulting in a suspension of inhibition of both enzymes at high nadhnad ratios are postulated as a control mechanism of ketogenesis in addition to mechanisms already known
202,semicarbazide reacted rapidly with dihydrocytidinesulfonate which was formed from cytidine by addition of bisulfite across the double bond the transaminated product dihydrosemicarbazidoketotopyrimidinesulfonate ribofuranoside was identified by comparison with that formed by treatment of semicarbazidoketopyrimidine ribofuranoside with bisulfite the progress of the transamination was monitored spectrophotometrically by use of a strong absorbance of the product in alkali the reaction between cytidine and the semicarbazidebisulfite mixture was optimal at ph complete transformation of cytidine into the product required only min with the use of m semicarbazidem sodium bisulfite ph at the reaction temperature degrees c the product was stable in unbuffered solution but in phosphate buffers it underwent elimination of bisulfite to give semicarbazidoketopyrimidine ribofuranoside the rate of the elimination at ph and degrees c increased proportionally with the increase of the phosphate concentration complete beta was obtained by treatment with m sodium phosphate for h when heatdenatured calfthymus dna was treated with m semicarbazide m bisulfite at degrees c and ph the transamination of reactive cytosine residues was completed by min of incubation at degrees c it required min of incubation cytosine residues in native dna did not react at all even by prolonged incubations the modified dna samples were further treated with a phosphate buffer at ph producing semicarbazidoketopyrimidine residues in the dna analysis of the base compositions of these samples by perchloric acid hydrolysis showed that the modification was selective to cytosine which had been expected from studies with monomers it also showed that the reactive cytosine residues in the denatured dna constitute about of the total cytosine which was consistent with the view that heatdenatured dna still contains a considerable amount of secondary structure the semicarbazidebisulfite modification is expected to be a sensitive method to locate cytosine residues in ssDNA regions of polynucleotides
203,twenty paid healthy students volunteered for a doubleblind crossover trial on the effects of two weeks treatment with placebo thioridazine and bromazepam on psychomotor skills the doses used were thioridazine mg tid during the first week and mg tid during the second week or mg of bromazepam tid during two weeks choice reaction test two coordination tests a divided attention test flicker F0 and proprioception tests were used the psychomotor skills were measured in the afternoon of the th and th day of each treatment and minutes after the second daily administration of the drug in combination with either an alcoholic or a placebo drink there were no significant differences between the test weeks thioridazine CT resembled PL and had no major combined effect with alcohol bromazepam impaired reactive and coordinative skills and attention deteriorated the combination of bromazepam and alcohol potentiated the deterious effects of the single agents and this effect was most remarkable at T2 the subjects also gave exaggerated responses in the proprioceptive tests no significant alterations were recorded in the flicker fusion frequency after any treatment
204,the radiological appearances of nonhemodynamic lesional edema are univoco interstitialtype pictures alveolartype pictures either successively or combined in terms of the intensity or duration of the alveolocapillary membrane lesions inflation of the interstitial medium is reflected by the appearance of kerley b lines haziness of the V1 contours and sometimes an axillary bordering L1 due to subpleural edema capillary congestion with increase in permeability especially to proteins and the tearing of connective tissue explains these pictures in the following stage edema is alveolar with hazy diffuse unorganised and confluent opacities these opacities can predominate in the bases or take on a butterflywing distribution at this stage atelectatic lesions can be superadded due to inactivation of surfactant finally in the later periods the appearance of interstitial PF with fibrinous deposits and fibroblastic proliferation can be noted the chest xray is the objective reflection of the disorders in enables the making of a diagnosis and the drawing up of a complete check of the lesions and supervision of its course
205,treatment of calf serum at degrees c and ph followed by chromatography on CM cm cellulose resulted in the separation of two major peaks of alkaline rnase activity one was eluted from cmcellulose at m kcl with an overall purification of fold and the other was eluted at m kcl with a fold purification the rnase eluted from cmcellulose at m kcl was almost completely inhibited by antirnase a SS and by the endogenous rnase inhibitor and a inhibition was observed in the presence of mm mgcl this enzyme seems to be similar or MZ to rnase a the other rnase eluted from cmcellulose at m kcl was not inhibited by antirnase a or mm mgcl and was much less CS to the endogenous inhibitor both enzymes degraded rna endonucleolytically and the nucleoside monophosphates obtained after partial hydrolysis of rna by the two serum rnaases were primarily or cmp and or ump polya native dna and denatured dna were degraded slowly or not at all the rnaase alike enzyme degraded polyc at a significantly faster rate and polyu at a slower rate than rna however the other serum rnaase was more active with polyu than with rna and almost inactive with polyc as the substrate
206,rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase spinlabelled at its most reactive thiol group has an electron spin resonance spectrum which is very sensitive to the IB of substrates and allosteric effectors the spectral changes have been interpreted in terms of a concerted allosteric transition between two conformational states with nonexclusive IB of effectors on this basis mgatp fructose phosphate plus atp and nhions behave as potent positive effectors inorganic phosphate sulphate amp fructose phosphate and fructose bisphosphate are less potent activators and free atp and hions are negative effectors in agreement with the kinetic behaviour but citrate behaves anomalously in addition the allosteric equilibrium can be displaced towards the inhibited state by selectively modifying two further thiol groups strong positive cooperativity occurs under suitable conditions with atp metalatp and fructose phosphate biphasic changes of conformation attributed to IB at the catalytic and inhibitory sites have been observed in titrations with atp the differentiation of the two atp binding CS arises in the presence of fructose phosphate because of a distinct concerted effect on conformation between the two substrates at the active site a similar effect occurs between atp and citrate other heterotropic effects are more consistent with simple models phosphates favour the binding and reduce the cooperativity of fructose phosphate and metalatp whereas excess atp and h ions antagonise the IB and increase the cooperativity of fructose phosphate the observations are related to existing kinetic and IB studies where possible anomalous features of the behaviour suggest that the model should be regarded only as a first approximation
207,insulin and glucagon Kd by rat kidney homogenates and subcellular fractions was examined under a variety of conditions including high and low substrate concentrations at ph and ph with and without glutathione at high insulin concentration m insulin degradation by the homogenate was greatest at ph but at low insulin concentration m insulin degradation was greatest at ph at either high or low glucagon concentration glucagon degradation by the homogenate was greatest at ph glutathione at ph stimulated insulin Kd at high insulin concentrations and inhibited insulin degradation at low concentrations glucagon Kd at ph was inhibited at both high and low concentrations of glucagon by glutathionemseparation of kidney into cortex and medulla prior to homogenation produced a pattern of insulin and glucagon degradation identical to the whole homogenate but glucagon degradation by the medulla was greater than by the cortex examination of degradation by subcellular fractions revealed that at high concentration at neutral ph most insulin was degraded by the x g pellet but at low insulin concentrations over of the activity was in the x g supernatant at ph at both high and low concentrations most glucagondegrading activity was in the x g pellet although the cytosol also had activity at ph most degradation occurred in the lysosomal fractions separation into cortex and medulla again showed similar distribution of activity as the whole gland with the medulla having more glucagondegrading activity than the cortex with low insulin concentrations the cortex x g supernatant had higher relative specific MICs than the medulla supernatant examination of recoveries of enzyme activity revealed that the subcellular fractions consistently had markedly less insulindegrading activity than the original TH this loss of activity was only discernible when insulin degradation was performed at ph at low substrate concentrations comparable losses of glucagondegrading activity were not seen
208,recent studies demonstrated that epinephrine causes significant pulmonary av shunting this study reports the effect of alpha and beta adrenergic blockade on this shunting sixtythree anesthetized mongrel dogs were ventilated with a mechanical respirator measurements of the pulmonary shunt cardiac output mean pulmonary artery PCW and systemic pressures and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances were obtained at and minute intervals during the first hour and hourly for hours fifteen dogs received no treatment all others received epinephrine hydrochloride mugkgmin for hours ten received epinephrine only ten were pretreated with propranolol hydrochloride mugkg with phenoxybenzamine mgkg and with phenoxybenzamine and propranolol propranolol significantly decreased the EN induced pulmonary shunt at all times and was the most effective drug phenoxybenzamine decreased the early shunting but less than propranolol and did not decrease the late shunting blockade with propranolol and phenoxybenzamine was less effective than propranolol CT based on the observed hemodynamic changes it was suggested that beta blockade is effective in reducing epinephrine induced pulmonary insufficiency by favorably altering the flow and distribution of pulmonary blood flow which in turn decreases epinephrine induced ventilationperfusion inequalities and capillary hypertension both of which result in shunting conversely phenoxybenzamine has an unfavorable effect on the pulmonary flow these studies support previous work in animals and man which showed that beta adrenergic stimulation is important in the pathogenesis of pulmonary insufficiency because the amounts of epinephrine used produce blood levels observed in critical illness these studies add support to a relationship between the increased catecholamine stimulation of critical illness and the associated and often unexplained pulmonary insufficiency
209,three metabolites of tritiumlabeled mazindol were isolated from rat urine by the inverse isotopedilution technique in which the labeled metabolites were synthesized by a second smaller group of rats these metabolites were isolated by amberlite xad chromatography and ODS column and preparative TLC the L1 metabolite ii was shown by mass spectrometry of its trimethylsilyl derivative nmr spectroscopy and degradation studies to be pchlorophenyldihydrohydroxyhimidazolaisoindolone a comparison of its mass spectrum with that of an authentic sample prepared from pchlorophenylethoxymethoxyhisoindole and glycine ethyl ester confirmed the assignment metabolite iii was shown by its mass spectrum nmr spectrum degradation and analogy with metabolite ii to be pchlorophenyldihydrodihydroxyhimidazo aisoindolone only a small amount of metabolite iv was isolated as an artifact pchlorophenylglycylmethoxyisoindolinone as shown by its mass spectrum and degradation to pchlorobenzoybenzoic acid the metabolite iv is believed to be the corresponding hydroxy compound synthesis of iv by basecatalyzed hydrolysis of metabolite ii supports the structural assignment in addition the facile conversion of synthetic iv into the corresponding methoxy derivative by acidic methanol was also observed
210,the active transport and internal binding of the ca analogue mn by RLM were monitored with electron paramagnetic resonance the IB of transported mn depended strongly on internal ph over the range gradients of free mn were compared with k gradients measured on valinomycintreated samples in the Css the EC mn activity was larger outside than inside the mitochondria the observed gradients of free mn and of h could not be explained by a single passive uniport or antiport mechanism of divalent cation transport this conclusion was further substantiated by observed changes in steadystate ca and mn distributions induced by la and ruthenium red ruthenium red reduced total ca or mn uptake and both inhibitors caused PR of divalent cation from preloaded mitochondria a model is proposed in which divalent cations are transported by at least two mechanisms a passive uniport and and active pump cation antiport or anion symport the former is more sensitive to la and ruthenium red under energized steadystate conditions the net flux of ca or mn is inward over and outward over the need for more than one transport system inregulating cytoplasmic ca is discussed
211,the subcellular distribution and properties of guanylate cyclase was examined in S9 of normal rat renal cortex and morris renal PT mk and mk in normal kidney cortex about twothirds of guanylate cyclase activity of homogenates was found in soluble fractions with renal tumors the homogenate activity was less and the enzyme was equally divided between particulate and soluble fractions the particulate enzyme in kidney SC and tumors was associated with all particulate fractions triton x increased the activity of all S9 all preparations preferred mn as the sole cation the stimulatory effects of ca on soluble enzyme and inhibitory effects on particulate activity were similar with preparations of renal cortex and tumors atp inhibited all S9 soluble and particulate GCs from renal cortex were activated severalfold with mm nan preparations of tumor enzymes did not respond to nan thus compared to normal renal SC the subcellular CSD of guanylate cyclase and some of its properties are altered in preparations of renal tumors
212,glucose phosphate dehydrogenase dglucose phosphatenadp oxidoreductase ec from bakers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae was immobilized on cnbractivated sepharose b with retention of about of CEA this uncharged preparation was stable for up to months when stored in borate buffer ph at degrees c SD enzyme preparations with negative or positive overall charge were made by adding valine or ethylenediamine to the cnbractivated sepharose b min T3 addition of the enzyme these three immobilized enzyme preparations retained of their activity after min at degrees c the soluble enzyme is inactivated by these conditions the soluble enzyme lost and of its activity on incubation for h at ph and respectively the three immobilizedenzyme S9 were completely SD over this entire ph range the ph optimum of the positively and negatively charged immobilizedenzyme preparations were about and respectively the soluble enzyme and the uncharged immobilized enzyme had an optimum ph at about glucose phosphate dehydrogenase immobilized on cnbractivated sephadex g was unstable as was enzyme attached to cnbractivated sepharose b to which glycine asparitic acid valine or ethylenediamine was added at the same time as the enzyme
213,plasma renin activity pra was measured in cases of aortitis syndrome the values of resting peripheral vein blood pra were se mmugml these values were times higher than those of normal subjects hypertension due to renal arterial stenosis was observed in cases their resting pra values were mmugml while in the remaining patients without renovascular hypertension those values were mmugml the patients belonging to aortic arch type or extensive type had times higher pra values than those of abdominal type the patients with stenosis or obstruction of common carotid arteries had significantly higher pra values than the patients without these lesions hyperresponse of renin secretion to upright posture was also observed in the same patients with i.c. stenosis abnormal RR in takayasus arteritis disappeared T3 denervation of the CSN nerve the present T0 suggests that the unstable state of carotid sinus reflex is the main cause for the hypersecretion of renin
214,tne ultrastructural and fluorescence histochemical characteristics of the mature rabbit substantia nigra and NS have been reviewed as a frame of REF for the developmental T0 PSA investigations were reported on neostriatal dopamine concentrations and the relative uptake and accumulation of hdopamine by this tissue from fetal to adult stages to provide quantitative data for rho with the fluorexcence information the development of the neurons of the substantia nigra and their axons which project to the neostriatum has been presented from their appearance at day of gestation to their maturation in early postnatal life the initial bipolar NBs which develop in the midline of the caudal mesencephalon are fluorescent as soon as they emerge from the ependymal zone their fluorescent axons which form the nigroneostriatal pathway reach the telencephalon at day of gestation and ramify extensively in the putamen by day but do not enter the caudate nucleus until several days later some of the early fluorescent axonal profiles in the putamen are extremely large electron microscopic T0 of theis stage suggests that the large FL profiles may correspond to axonal growth cones or early synapses a distinct substantia nigra pars compacta and reticulata can be recognized by fluorescence microscopy by day of gestation electron microscopy reveals that the young neurons are multipolar with numerous developing dendrites some of which exhibit early synaptic junctions the subsequent maturaition of these cells and the neuropil is described the fluorescent axons of the substantia nigra grow into the putamen and caudate nucleus in a nonuniform manner forming fluorescent islands throughout the neostriatum in late fetal life occasionally minute beaded fluorescent axons are found these profiles might correspond to some of the axons with varicosities en passage revealed by electron microscopy in an attempt to identify further the dopaminecontaining axon the ultratructure of AD neostriatum incubated in hydroxydopamine was reported axonal varicosities en passage containing a dense tag in the vesicles were found most of the tagged boutons did not exhibit synaptic contacts the possible significance of these finding s as related to dopamine secretion are discussed
215,a simple method was described for the preparation of ilabeled type iii neumococcal polysaccharide sssiii with a high specific radioactivity which retained the physical and immunologic properties of native sssiii sssiii was used to T0 the serum and tissue levels of antigen as well as its excretion T3 ip injection when an optimally immunogenic dose mug of antigen was given greater than of the injected antigen was excreted during the first days T3 injection however after day the sssiii which remained in each mouse was firmly bound to various tissues and less than ng sssiii was released into the circulation daily sssiii was also used in a farr test to measure serum antibody C2 the kinetics for the appearance of pfcspleen and serum antibody C2 were measured at hr intervals T3 immunization with mug of antigen maximum pfcspleen were observed on day T3 immunization whereas the peak SS antibody level was seen on day the decay of serum antibody level from its maximum value was much slower than that of the pfcspleen the data describing the distribution of sssiii in vivo and the measurement of SS antibody C2 indicated that treadmill NT was not a factor in determining the SS antibody levels after immunization with an optimally immunogenic dose of sssiii
216,the fluorescence decay kinetics at different ranges of the emission spectrum is reported for proteins out of eight proteins containing a single tryptophan residue per molecule seven proteins display multiexponential decay kinetics suggesting that variability in protein structure may exist for most proteins tryptophan residues whose fluorescence spectrum is red shifted may have lifetimes longer than ns such long lifetimes have not been detected in any of the denatured proteins studied indicating that in native proteins the tryptophans having a redshifted spectrum are affected by the tertiary structure of the protein the fluorescence decay kinetics of ten denatured proteins studied obey multiexponential decay functions it is therefore concluded that the tryptophan residues in denatured proteins can be grouped in two classes the first characterized by a relatively long lifetime of about ns and the second has a short lifetime of about ns the emission spectrum of the group which is characterized by the longer lifetime is red shifted relative to the emission spectrum of the group characterized by the shorter lifetime a comparison of the decay data with the quantum yield of the proteins raises the possibility that a subgroup of the tryptophan residues is fully quenched it is noteworthy that despite this heterogeneity in the environment of tryptophan residues in each denatured protein almost the same decay kinetics has been obtained for all the denatured proteins studied in spite of the vastly different primary structures it is therefore concluded that each tryptophan residue interacts in a moreorless random manner with other CG on the polypeptide chain and that on the average the different tryptophan residues in denatured proteins have a similar type of environment
217,an endocellulase ec of carboxymethylcellulase type f which was fractionated from culture filtrate of irpex lacetus and purified to electrophoretic and ultracentrifugal homogeneity was found to show xylanase ec activity the activity was not removed from any of the intermediate fractions during the purification of the initial fi peak and the radio of xylanase to cellulase activity remained almost unchanged through the purification processes the xylanase activity of fi showed not only the same optiomal ph heat stability and ph stability as its cellulase activity but also the same mobility as the cellulase activity upon cellulose acetate film and ST zone electrophoreses the overall rates of hydrolysis of mixtures of variouis concentrations of cmcellulose and xylan by f coincided well with those calculated from the MM treatment of two substances competing for the same AS site of the enzyme these results indicate that the xylanase activity of f is intrinsic to the cellulase itself
218,mucor pusillus acid protease was rapidly inactivated with stoichiometry by reaction with diazoacetyldlnorleucine methyl ester dan in the presence of cupric ions cupric ions were essential for this inactivation the rate of inactivation was maximal at around ph when the enzyme was mixed with dan and cupric ions without prior mixing of the reagents and at ph when dan and cupric ions were mixed and incubated before addition to the enzyme solution in both cases the rate of inactivation decreased as the ph was either increased or decreased the CAA composition of an acid hydrolysate of the danmodified enzyme was indistinguishable from that of the native enzyme except for the incorporation of about one norleucine residue per molecule of protein the enzyme was also inactivated by reaction with epoxypnitrophenoxypropane epnp at the stage of about inactivation residues of epnp were incorporated per molecule of protein and the rate of inactivation followed pseudofirst order kinetics the optimal ph for the inactivation was ph and the rate of inactivation decreased as the ph was either increased or decreased furthermore the enzyme was strongly inhibited by pepstatin and the reactions of dan and of epnp was also inhibited significantly by prior treatment of the enzyme with pepstatin these results suggest that the enzyme may have two essential carboxyl groups at the active site one reactive with dan in the presence of cupric ions and the other with epnp and that pepstatin binds part of the active site to inhibit the reactions with dan and epnp as well as the CEA
219,in vitro collagen and collagenlike material in gbm were demonstrated to have a particular high affinity for any dna tested mammalian bacterial viral and plant gbm fixed dna times more than hgg and bsa and times more than bacterial lps gbm has a higher affinity for ssdna than for dsdna this binding was inhibited at low ph low ionic strength and in the presence of anionic detergents indicating that the highly negatively charged dna may interact with the basic site on collagen or gbm by electrostatic forces this interaction was competitively interfered with by dnabinding proteins such as clq complexes formed of dna and antidna antibodies did not exhibit the same IB property as free dna however dna which was already bound to gbm or to collagen could very efficiently bind antidna antibodies and form immune complexes which would remain on these structures the biological significance of the IB of dna to gbm or to collagen should be particularly considered in relation to the pathogenesis of sle it is possible that dna released from disrupted or degenerating cells would bind to surrounding collagen SF or to basement CM and then act as an immunoabsorbant for circulating antidna antibodies some evidence for an in vivo binding of ssdna to renal structures was obtained in mice treated with bacterial lps days before the i.t. of ssdna
220,C2 of skf a to rats a portion of the cytochrome p in hepatic microsomes was found in the GSH as a stable complex absorbing at nm as much as of the total cytochrome p was bound in the complexed form T3 a single administration of skf a the addition of potassium ferricyanide mum to hepatic microsomes from skf atreated rats destroyed the complex and made the total cytochrome p available for carbon monoxide binding at early times C2 of skf a when the amount of complexed cytochrome p was maximum mixedfunction oxidase activities pnitroanisole odemethylase and norbenzphetamine nm complex formation were greatly inhibited later as the amount of complexed cytochrome p slowly decreased these mixedfunction oxidase MICs gradually returned and reached control values in about hr induction with daily doses of skf a for several days increased total cytochrome p content up to fold which was more than induction with phenobarbital but this was evident only T3 destruction of the complex with ferricyanide the maximum increase in uncomplexed cytochrome p was only fold treatment of these microsomal suspensions with ferricyanide enhanced ethylmorphine ndemethylase pnitroanisole odemethylase and norbenzphetamine nm complex formation
221,dibenamine db produced contraction due to influx and release of ca in normal medium whereas it produced EC50 of the kinduced contraction due to depression of the activity of the muscle CM db inhibited active influx passive influx and release of ca induced by ach in this order as the concentrations were increased and also inhibited the contraction by histamine selectively as compared with the contractions by ach k and ba the inhibition of the ach k and bacontractions being almost to the same degree in addition db inhibited to much the same degree the phasic contractionpc and tonic contractiontc by histamine whereas it inhibited tc in preference to pc induced by ach k and ba irreversible inhibition by db of ach k and bainduced contractions were protected by ca whereas those of histamineinduced contraction were selectively protected by histamine and antihistamine but not by ca these results indicate that the antagonism of db and its irreversibility against histamine may be due to blockade of the histaminergic receptor whereas those against ach k and ba may be due to inhibition of the casite evidence has been obtained suggesting that the irreversible parallel shift to the right of the log concentrationaction curve of histamine T3 washout of db may be due to spare receptors whereas that of ach k or ba may be due to inhibition of the casite
222,incubation of leucine aminopeptidase bovine lens ec with various concentrations of mg at various ph values in m kcl and m trimethylaminehcl at degrees confirms that mg competes with zn for binding only site per dalton S1 the ratio of the apparent association constants kznkmg kznmg at this site site was estimated to be at ph at ph at ph and at ph the decrease in values of kznmg with increasing ph in the activation of LAP by mg is attributed to the lowering of the free zn concentration relative to that of free mg caused by the formation of znoh and znoh complexes with increasing oh concentration when corrections are made for the binding of zn by oh ions the phindependent ratio of association constants kznkmg kznmg for the relative binding of zn and mg at site of leucine aminopeptidase in from the effect of ph on the relative binding constant a value beta for the product of the two stepwise association constants for the formation of znoh from zn and oh zn oh in equilibrium znoh znoh oh in equilibrium znoh was estimated to be x m at degrees values of km at ph and degrees with lleucine pnitroanilide as ATP in the presence of m nahco are and mm for the zinczinc and magnesiumzinc enzymes respectively values for vmax are and mumolminmg respectively
223,calcium transport into inverted LDV of escherichia coli was observed to occur without an exogenous energy source when an artificial proton gradient was used the orientation of the proton gradient was acid inside and ALP outside either phosphate or oxalate was necessary for transport as was found for respiratorydriven or atpdriven uptake tsuchiya t and rosen bp j biol chem phosphate accumulation was found to occur in conjunction with calcium accumulation calcium transport driven by an artificial proton gradient was stimulated by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide an inhibitor of the mgatpase ec valinomycin which catalyzes electrogenic potassium movement stimulated calcium accumulation while nigericin which catalyzes electroneutral exchange of potassium and protons inhibited both artificial proton gradientdriven transport and respiratorydriven transport other properties of the proton gradientdriven system and the previously reported energylinked calcium transport system are similar indicating that calcium is transported by the same carrier whether energy is supplied through an artificial proton gradient or an energized membrane state these results suggest the existence of a calciumproton antiport
224,functional digestive complaints are frequent in psychiatri patients simple constipation which cannot be explained solely by the loss of the sensation of rectal fullness occlusions occasionally hemorragies the late complication of dolichomegacolon bourgeois in subjects an attempt to understand the physiopathology were made by recording diurnal digestive MA using skin electrodes placed on the abdomen and extremities electrogastroenterography or egeg a hypoactive egeg was observed in of psychotic depressive patients in of schizophrenies the nocive effect of giving sedative PTZ and antiparkinsonian drugs trihexyphenidyl or ethybenzatropine during long periods is clear whereas non sedative phenothiazine and clotiapine gicen in small doses do not have an undesirable effect sulpiride has been used in GD dyskinesia the dyskinesia noted by the egeg sometimes found in the large intestin were found in of patients with caracter disorders they coincide with the VHF of electroencephalogram dysrythmies finally in hysterical patients one usually observes normal egeg tracings which confirms the clinical observation that hysterical and psychosomatic symptoms may succeed each other but do not appear at the same time in the same categories of patients no longer treated in a CP psychiatric environment but in a group with institutional objectives the same clinic results were obtained with fewer digestive disturbances this tends to show the inutility and nocivity of excessive doses of psychotropic drugs given alone or in complexe association
225,a fieldtrial on etofibrat was performed on patients suffering from primary and secondary hyperlipoproteinemia the results were proved statistically after a to weeks treatment the concentration of cholesterol as well as tryglicerides in the serum decreased significantly after to weeks treatment the lipidlowering effect was even stronger nearly of the patients investigated gave a positive response to the treatment part of the population had undergone a treatment with other lipidlowering agents beforemost likely without sufficient successin these cases a further lipidlowering effect due to etofibrat could be shown underdosage in premedication cannot be excluded the stratification of the patients in different CG of diagnosis showed a nearly similarity of both blood lipids independent of the diagnosis this could also be confirmed for the group of patients suffering from diabetes to prove the lipidlowering efficacy of etofibrat a population was withdrawn from treatment cholesterol as well as tryglicerides increased significantly during the interval without treatment during a longterm study both lipid fractions could be kept down without increasing of the daily etofibrat dose the tolerance of etofibrat was stated to be good up to very good objectively the measured enzymes sgot sgpt and gammagt showed a decrease of the means subjectively the occurrence of an often intermediate heat sensation andor rubedo was of relevance the low daily dose compared with other lipidlowering agents gives indication for a better pharmacocinetic behaviour of the drug
226,a phosphoprotein kinase ec kivb from rat CL nuclei was purified fold by phosphocellulose chromatography and gel filtration on sephadex g the enzyme which has an apparent molecular weight of phosphorylates casein and chromatinbound NHP more readily than histones or ribosomal proteins it exhibits an absolute requirement for divalent cation with optimum activity at mm mg maximal kinase activity is achieved at mm nacl the ph vs activity curve is biphasic with optima at ph and ph the km value for CS is mugml and the km for atp is m kinase kivb phosphorylates numerous nonhistone nuclear proteins as shown by electrophoretic analysis the addition of kinase kivb to reaction mixtures containing nonhistone proteins results in the phosphorylation of a spectrum of polypeptides similar to those that are phosphorylated by endogenous nuclear kinases nonhistone proteins bound to chromatin appear to be better substrates for kivb than nonhistones dissociated from chromatin a comparison of nuclear phosphoproteins phosphorylated either in the intact animal or in vitro by the addition of kinase kivb indicates some differences and some similarities in the patterns of phosphorylation
227,the effects of hydroxytriptamine ht ht blocking agents morphine narcoticantagonists and ganglionic blocking agents were tested in the dog intestine by close intraarterial injection morphine as ht induced an immediate increase in the intestinal tonus followed by phasic contractions when ht was injected immediately after cessation of morphine induced phasic contractions a significant potentiation of the ht induced intestinal contraction could be observed the potentiation could be demonstrated for other narcoticanalgesics like dextromoramide and it is specific for ht ht blocking agents like lsd bol and cyproheptadine did not block either ht or morphine however bufotenidine a neural tryptaminergic blocking agent blocked the effects of both ht and morphine the effects of ht and morphine upon intestinal motility were also diminished by ganglionic depolarizing agents such as NIC and dmpp this effect could however be prevented by the i.c.v. with hexamethonium these results seem to confirm the hypothesis of a ht mediator role in the intestinal contractile effect induced by the narcoticanalgesics on the other hand narcoticantagonists such as nalorphine and cyclazocine not only lacked the ht potentiation effect but also prevented the ht potentiation induced by morphine cyclazocine also showed a long lasting ht blocking effect these results seem to show that the ht potentiating effect of morphine in vivo is very TPS and characteristic of the narcotics and thus could be implicated in some of their central effects
228,a membrane preparation was obtained from rat striated muscle the preparation used has been shown to contain plasma CM by electron microscopy as well as by enrichment in TPS activity of both a BPM enzyme marker nucleotidase and cell surface iincorporated radioactivity the characteristics of iinsulin binding to this striated muscle preparation were studied and it was found that iinsulin readily and specifically binds to this membrane preparation the binding reaction was time ph and temperature dependent with optimal steadystate binding conditions occurring at degrees c and at ph under these conditions degrees c ph skeletal muscle PMs displayed little ability to degrade insulin binding of iinsulin was readily inhibited at physiologic concentrations of unlabeled insulin and the specificity of this receptor for insulin was demonstrated by finding that high concentrations of glucagon blh bfsh pprl hcg tsh and hgh were without effect on iinsulin binding and that insulin analogues inhibited binding in proportion to their biologic activity when membranes from older fatter rats were compared to CM from younger lean animals nucleotidase specific activity and insulin degrading activity were found to be comparable on the other hand insulin binding to membrane receptors was decreased in the older fatter animals thus these studies indicate that TPS insulin receptors exist in skeletal muscle plasma membranes and membranes from older fatter rats have fewer receptors than those from younger lean animals
229,to identify the functional CG that are involved in the conversion of betaglycerophosphate by alkaline phosphatase ec from pig kidney the kinetics of ALP phosphatase were investigated in the ph range at substrate concentrations of mum mm from the plots of log vh against ph and log vhkhm against ph one functional group with pk and two PET groups with pk were identified these groups are involved in substrate binding another group with pk was found which in its unprotonated form catalyses substrate conversion gsh inhibits the alkaline phosphatase reversibly and noncompetitively by attacking the bound znii the influence of the h concentration on the activation by mg ions of alkaline pig kidney phosphate was investigated between ph and the binding of ATP and activating mg ions occurs independently at all ph values between and the activation mechanism is not affected by the h concentration the mg ions are bound by a functional group with a pk of a scheme is proposed for the reaction between enzyme ATP mg and h and the overall rate equation is derived the mechanism of substrate binding and splitting by the functional groups of the active centre is discussed on the basis of a model mg seems to play a role as an autosteric effector
230,plasma of insulintreated diabetics and of newborn infants of insulintreated diabetic mothers contains insulin antibodies which invalidates the radioimmunoassay of insulin therefore the endogenous insulin antibody complex must be splitted at a ph lower than and the total iri tiri is separated by ethanol extraction it was investigated the recovery rate in dependence upon plasma volume used for SE by reduction of used plasma volume from to mul per extraction the recovery rate was increased from to mean sem the low plasma volume of mul for tiri extraction made it possible to determine tiri during glucose loads of newborn infants to eliminate different conditions of incubation for standard and unknown plasma samples the tiri levels were computed by means of socalled extracted standard curve obtained with extracted insulin from standard insulin dilution in insulinfree pooled HP using the described method a temporary regeneration of insulin secretion of a newly diagnosed juvenile diabetic after insulin treatment could be shown in contrast to P0 infants of healthy mothers a biphasicinsulin release was found during the intravenous glucose loads in newborn infants of insulintreated diabetic mothers
231,the glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferase ec which catalyzes the adenylylation and deadenylylation of glutamine synthetase in e coli has been stabilized and purified fold to apparent homogeneity sedimentation and PACE studies show that the native enzyme is a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight with an isoelectric ph pl of a sedimentation coefficient sw of s and a molar frictional coefficient ff of an alphahelical content of approximately equal to and approximately equal to betapleated sheet and approximately equal to random coil structures were estimated from circular dichroism measurements the amino acid composition of the protein has been determined the intrinsic tryptophanyl residue flourescence of adenylyltransferase is two fold greater than that of ltryptophan this property has been used to monitor ligandinduced conformational changes in the enzyme activators of the adenylylation reaction atp lglutamine or the e coli pii RII protein produced an enhancement of fluorescence alphaketoglutarate an inhibitor of adenylylation and an activator of deadenulylation caused a net decrease in fluorescence the adenylytransferase has separate interaction sites for lglutamine and the regulatory pii protein
232,the reversible unfolding of alphalactalbumin by DTG hydrochloride was studied at degrees c in a relatively low concentration range of the denaturant moll by means of difference spectra and phjump measurements the unfolding was shown to occur between two states n and d because apparent rateconstants of the unfolding and the refolding reactions depended only on ph all curves plotted as the logarithmical equilibrium constant log kd against ph could fall on the same base curve by shifting each curve along the log kd axis from the dependence of the logarithmic rate constant on ph master curves could also be made for the forward and the backward reactions the dependence of these master curves on ph indicates that the groups affecting the ph dependence of the unfolding are three residues with pkn and pka pkd one residue with pkn pka and pkd and one residue with pkn and pka pkd where a indicates the activated state on the other hand from the denaturant activity dependence of the shift AF required for making the master curves the value of the intrinsic binding constant of the denaturant to the protein was found to be similar to that obtained from previous measurements at ph differences between the numbers of the binding CS of the denaturant on the denaturated and the native proteins and between those on the activated and the native proteins were shown to be and respectively the free SE of stabilization in the nativelike environment also shows that the protein in the native state is more unstable than lysozyme
233,infections due to streptococcus pneumoniae and products from the organism have been associated with alterations in blood clotting and function of platelets pneumococci and pneumococcal polysaccharide shortened the clotting times of whole blood plateletrich plasma prp and plateletpoor plasma ppp in vitro clotting times of ppp and prp from cdeficient animals were likewise decreased the bacteria had no effect on the onestage prothrombin time or the partial thromboplastin time when the organisms were used as activating agents platelets aggregated in the presence of pneumococci but aggregation was prevented by the addition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp furthermore camp corrected the shortened clotting time of prp in the presence of pneumococci the clumping and release of polymorphonuclear coagulant that was induced by pneumococci was not prevented by camp thus pneumococci exert several dosedependent thromboplastic effects i PR of platelet thromboplastic substances ii a direct thromboplastic effect and iii release of polymorphonuclear coagulant
234,in the large granule fraction of rat liver the density CSD of inhibitorsensitive neutral ribonuclease is similar to that for acid hydrolases and its density distribution is similarly modified by triton wr accumulation in lysosomes particulate neutral ribonuclease is latent the enzyme is unmasked by very low digitonin concentrations or hypoosmotic shock these observations demonstrate that the bulk of CL neutral ribonuclease is associated with the lysosomal system in view of the neutral ph optimum of the enzyme and of some particularities of its CSD in fractionation experiments the possiblilty of an extrahepatic origin of neutral ribonuclease has been investigated after Px a significant decrease is observed in both plasma and liver neutral ribonuclease the effect is TPS for it does not occur for other lysosomal enzymes also labelled bovine pancreatic ribonuclease when injected intravenously is taken up by the CL the sedimentable labelled enzyme has a density distribution similar to the distribution of other foreign proteins horseradish peroxidase or yeast invertase these results are explained by the uptake of plasmatic neutral ribonuclease from pancreatic origin by the liver
235,pseudomonas citronellolis was shown to contain four different acylcoenzyme a carboxylases including acetyl propionyl methylcrotonyl and geranylcoa carboxylases when grown on the AGA carbon sources acetylcoa carboxylase activity in crude extracts was stimulated approximately fold by inclusion of m ammonium sulfate in the CA unexpectedly high levels of propionylcoa carboxylase activity also stimulated by ammonium sulfate were found in acetategrown cells that these acetyl and propionylcoa carboxylase activities were due to different enzymes was shown by their resolution during purification by a procedure that stabilized acetylcoa carboxylase as a complex and separated propionylcoa carboxylase into two required protein fractions propionate or valinegrown cells contained a propionylcoa carboxylase activity that was strongly inhibited by ammonium sulfate in the assay and which may represent an inducible form of the enzyme geranyl and methylcrotonylcoa carboxylases that catalyze the carboxylation of the methyl groups of rat acylcoa acceptors were induced by growth on the monoterpenes citronellic or geranoic acid only methylcrotonylcoa carboxylase was induced by growth on leucine or isovaleric acid induction of either carboxylase was associated with the appearance of similar MW biotincontaining proteins as measured by gel filtration these two carboxylases are probably distinct enzymes since MCC from isovalerategrown cells does not carboxylate geranylcoa while geranylcoa carboxylase will carboxylate both acylcoa homologues p citronellolis appears to be a useful system for studying the structural aspects of pairs of homologous acylcoa carboxylases
236,this T0 was designed to measure the response of key enzymes of ketone body metabolism in HR skeletal muscle and liver to diet and exercise two conditions known to influence ketone body utilization a diet control high fat or high carbohydrate x kill condition rested or exhausted x training TR or untrained factorial design was used to estimate main exp effects as well as identify significant interactions of the variables PT treadmill running was associated with a doubling of the activity of skeletal muscle oxoacid coa transferase a key enzyme in extrahepatic ketone body utilization the activity of the ratelimiting enzyme of CL ketone body production hydroxymethylglutaryl coa synthetase hmg coa synthetase was not greatly influenced by training or exhuastive exercise indicating that the metabolic control of the ketosis of exercise may more likely be a function of the supply of fatty acids to the liver rather than the activity of hmg coa synthetase feeding a HF diet on the other hand significantly increased the activity of liver hmg coa synthetase indicating that the ketosis of fat feeding may be of a different nature than that of exercise the results of this T0 indicate that physical training is associated with biochemical adaptations in ketone body metabolism as well as HFA oxidation and that trained individuals are metabolically better endowed to benefit from the ketosis of exercise than untrained individuals
237,the macromolecular breakdown products of fibrinogen are known mainly for their GABA effect on the clotting of fibrinogen by thrombin this inhibitory effect is due to interference with both the proteolytic action of thrombin and the polymerization of the fibrin monomers however the action of these products is not limited to these effects they can on the one hand inhibit the consumption of factors ii and xiii and promote the inactivation of factor viii by thrombin on the other hand they can potentiate the activation of prothrombin in purified systems via the intrinsic pathway the incidental observation was also made that factor ixa and or factor xa inactivate factor viii as substrates of both thrombin and plasmin the large fragments protect these two enzymes from spontaneous inactivation while at the same time they inhibit their respective proteolytic activities contradictory results were obtained regarding their effect on platelets the micromolecular dialyzable breakdown products prolong the thrombin prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times of plasma and retard the generation of the intrinsic prothrombin activator they can also potentiate the effects of biologically active peptides and amines on the smooth muscles and on V1 permeability
238,the internal ph of crab muscle MF was measured using recessedtip phsensitive microelectrodes immediately following electrode penetration the mean internal ph was se of mean and the mean membrane potential was mv se of mean if h ions were passively distributed across the fibre membrane the internal ph would have been the internal ph tended to rise before stabilizing at a mean value of se of mean the difference between immediate and stabilized values is highly significant and suggests acid injury on electrode penetration changing the membrane potential or external ph had only small slow effects on internal ph external co caused a large and rapid decrease in internal ph with low concentrations of co the effect was dependent on the initial ph as predicted by the law of mass action during a long exposure to co at ph the internal ph returned slowly to its previous value suggesting active transport of h or oh or hco ions across the fibre membrane the internal buffering power calculated from the response to co was slykes mequiv hph unit per l se of mean
239,the growth of pneumococcal phages at high cell and phage densities is enhanced strongly by the substitution of potassium for sodium in the medium initial titers of x to x pfuml are readily obtained and concentrated stocks are SD in a storage buffer described here the mechanism of the cation effect is obscure phages omega and omega each have linear dsDNA dna of x daltons per particle with an apparent GC content of to mol as determined by buoyancy and melting temperature but with an unusual absorbance spectrum efficiency of plating is high if sufficient time is allowed for a relatively slow adsorption which differs severalfold in rate between the two phages morphologically these and other pneumococcal phages are similar to coliphage lambda but with a longer tail and tail fiber upon uv inactivation omega and omega have d values of and jm respectively and each shows multiplicity reactivation a total of ts mutants have been isolated from the two phages representing only two complementation groups complementation and recombination occur between omega and omega mutants both phages provoke hightiter antisera with extensive crossreactivity against a number of newly isolated pneumococcal phages
240,the discriminative effects produced by morphine in the rat were evaluated using a twochoice discrete trial avoidance task stimulus control of behavior was attained with a dose of morphine onethird to onetenth of that used in previous studies morphine produced doserelated discriminative effects over a fold dose range the stimulus control produced by the discriminative effects of morphine met the following criteria for classification as a specific narcotic effect oxymorphone levorphanol methadone and meperidine narcotic analgesics from diverse chemical families also produced doserelated morphinelike discriminative effects dextrorphan and thebaine compounds structurally related to the narcotics but lacking narcotic activity failed to produce morphinelike discriminative effects effects were blocked by the narcotic antagonist naloxone and tolerance to the discriminative effects developed upon the repeated administration of morphine and crosstolerance extended to MTD the discriminative effects produced by morphine were further characterized by evaluating the capacity of prototypes of other classes of psychoactive drugs to produce morphinelike discriminative effects profadol and pentazocine euphorogenic analgesics with mixed agonist and narcotic antagonist properties produced doserelated morphinelike discriminative effects whereas cyclazocine a dysphorogenic analgesic with mixed agonist and narcoticantagonist properties did not in addition the nonopioid psychoactive drugs damphetamine pentobarbital and chlorpromazine also failed to produce morphinelike discriminative effects thus morphinelike discriminative effects were produced uniquely by the narcotic analgesics and euophorogenic analgesics with mixed agonist and narcotic antagonist properties these results suggest that the component of action of morphine that enables it to function as a discriminative stimulus in the rat is analogous to the component of action of morphine responsible for producing subjective effects in man
241,the extensional growth rate of wildtype a n crassa in the presence of various concentrations of amino acid analogs was measured seven analogs were not inhibitory at concentrations in the range of one to mm of the remaining analogs nine inhibited growth in a novel way the kinetics of growth in the presence of these analogs at degrees were characterized by seven sequential phases lag acceleration of growth rate steadystate growth rate exponential rate of decline of growth rate no growth or growth rate less than or equal to mm h accleration of growth rate and steady state at degrees phases and did not occur and irreparable death of the clones occurred the mechanism by which the clones acquired resistance at degrees appeared to involve a combination of physiological adaptation and cellular selection dietary application of either free radical scavengers or surfaceactive membrane stabilizers alleviated or prevented the inhibition and deterioration of growth rate which occurred in the presence of the nine amino acid analogs culture with either fluorophenylalanine or ethionine led to an increase of the MICs of antioxygenic enzymes glutathione peroxidase glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase the CAA analogs that cause senescence and death of growing cells are known to be incorporated into proteins and such proteins are generally abnormal because a substantial fraction of cellular protein occurs in CM and the proteins synthesized by mitochondria are exclusively intrinsic membrane proteins we suggest that a primary consequence of PE in protein synthesis is the production of faulty membranes the deterioration of such membranes with associated lipid autoxidation and free radical production proceeding as a chain reaction at an exponential rate may in itself contribute to the exponential rate of cellular deterioration which is characteristic of the ageing process according to this hypothesis dietary membrane stabilizers free radical scavengers and antioxygenic enzymes protect cells from error catastrophy arising from the chain of events leading from membrane deterioration
242,mitochondria may be isolated from various types of leukocyte PMNL polymorphs and lymphocytes from human blood PMNL polymorphs and macrophages from peritoneal exudates of the guinea pig after destruction by heparin of the CM this procedure is very simple and less traumatic for these subcellular structures than the usual mechanical procedures the enzyme activities of the RC and oxygen consumption may be measured in these mitochondrial preparations the oxygen consumption is determined using oxyhemoglobin which serves both as oxygen donor as in the respiratory system in vivo and as indicator of the reaction at nm the integrity of the mitochondria may be demonstrated by determination of the acceptor control index the existence of adp phosphorylation coupled with oxygen consumption phosphorylating oxidation was proved in all the cells studied even if the adpo ratio can only be calculated for certain of them lymphocytes macrophages in these cases the ratios obtained are close to theoretical values whatever the oxidation ATP used the mitochondria of leukemic cells have a higher oxidation activity than the corresponding reference cells determination of leukocyte coenzymes by enzyme cycling nad nadh nadp nadph showed the following facts generally the nad concentrations remain constant those of nadh increase whilst those of nadp and nadph fall during incubation of neutrophil polymorphs in dulbeccos medium the metabolic changes observed during s albi heatinduced endocytosis are in favour of simultaneous stimulation of nadh oxidase and nadph oxidase in human polymorphs and of nadph oxidase in the corresponding cells of peritoneal exudates in guinea pigs
243,the effects of manual compression of the upper lateral abdomen c of cases of obstructive airway disease were studied in respect to the change in minute ventilation v T2 after the procedure was performed a mean decrease of in v was found in the majority of cases of bronchial asthma or chronic bronchitis and patients with chronic obstructive lung disease the use of manual compression as a therapeutic measure depends largely on the abrupt reduction of lung volume in cases of obstructive airway disease in which overinflation of the lung is present as an acute or chronic disorder the degree and duration of clinical benefit ie relief of dyspnea depends on such factors as the volume of air trapped in the lungs BC through pathologic change or bronchospasm and impairment of elastic recoil of the pulmonary parenchyma the lowered v recorded minutes after c is performed suggests that decrease in dyspnea is associated with enhanced efficiency of ventilation in some subjects with obstructive airway disease including those with BA as well as cold a brief description is presented of patients with cold in whom manual compression and other features of a rehabilitation program were employed mean length of life of five living subjects is years after beginning of therapy the mean length of life of five who died was years T3 beginning of treatment
244,hemoglobin from an adult camel camelus dromedarius was prepared from the red cell lysate by cm and deaecellulose chromatography the purified hemoglobin showed a lesser mobility on starch gel electrophoresis at ph than that of HbA c native camel hemoglobin contains alkaliresistant hemoglobin and in soluble in m khpokhpo buffer different forms of camel hemoglobin show similar ammonium sulfate precipitation curves indirect evidence for the stability of camel hemoglobin solutions was obtained from several sources spontaneous methemoglobin formation is extremely slow and minimal quantities of Kd products appear on starch gel electrophoresis and on chromatographic separation the alpha and beta chains of camel hemoglobin a were separated on a cm column by the use of a pyridine formate gradient large peptide fragments were obtained by tryptic digestion of maleylated alpha and beta chains the NT structure of the alpha and beta chains and of tryptic maleylated MMP derived from alpha and beta chains are presented between AD camel hemoglobin and adult human hemoglobin six amino acid differences in the nterminal amino acid residues of the alpha chain at residues and eight CAA substitutions were found in the beta chain at positions and substitutions at alpha ala leads to lys and beta asn leads to lys increase the net positive charge of camel hemoglobin by two while other substitutions result in no charge differences the molecular basis of the stability of camel adult hemoglobin is discussed
245,mice administered haloperidol mgkgd in their drinking water for days displayed days after cessation of the haloperidoltreatment marked locomotor stimulation to clonidine or mugkg which lasted for about h mug clonidinekg was inactive premedication with fla mgkg blocked the difference in stimulation T3 clonidine between the haloperidol and vehicletreated animals but locomotor activity was still present in both CG haloperidoltreated animals displayed a supersensitive response to dexamphetamine the difference in stimulation produced by dexamphetamine in the two groups was CR blocked by phenoxybenzamine mgkg phentolamine mgkg which drugs did not however block the locomotor stimulation produced by dexamphetamine in vehicletreated animals pimozide mgkg blocked all locomotor stimulation produced by dexamphetamine in both vehicle and haloperidoltreated groups while mgkg CR blocked the dexamphetamine response in vehicletreated animals but not in haloperidoltreated animals fla mgkg blocked the difference in response between the haloperidol and vehicletreated groups to dexamphetamine but did not antagonise the stimulation in the vehicletreated animals the data suggest that LT haloperidol treatment leads to the OD of supersensitive adrenergic receptors in the CE nervous system which appropriately stimulated effect an increase in locomotor activity moreover the results indicate that a large component of the supersensitive response to dexamphetamine observed after longterm haloperidoltreatment is due to adrenergic receptor supersensitivity however the dopamine receptor which was shown to be supersensitive to apomorphine is of fundamental importance because phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine while blocking the supersensitive response to dexamphetamine failed to block the response to dexamphetamine in vehicletreated animals which was however blocked by PIM
246,a micromethod is presented which enables the fast and exact determination of acidhydrolyzed acylneuraminic acids in ghosts erythrocytes from ml of human and rabbit blood containing acd buffer are washed and hemolyzed on millipore filters of pore size mu acylneuraminic acids are released from the ghosts still on the filters under the optimal conditions of n hcl at degrees c for min a prerequisite for the determination of the true amount of acylneuraminic acids using the periodic acidthiobarbituric acid assay is the smallscale extraction of lipids from the hydrolysate and anionexchange chromatography of acylneuraminic acids the values thus obtained must be corrected as of acylneuraminic acids are destroyed during acid hydrolysis in samples of human blood from healthy individuals on an average nmol acylneuraminic acids per ml of packed erythrocytes were found and in the same amount of rabbit erythrocytes e method for a screening of the acylneuraminic acid content of erythrocyte CM in hemolytic diseases or of other cell CM is discussed
247,the isopropyl i cyclohexyl ii and phenyl iii analogs of the new antipsychotic drug butaclamol which contains a tertiary butyl group and their respective enantiomers but not enantiomers caused a dose related elevation of rat striatal homovanillic acid concentration indicative of an increased dopamine da turnover droperidol also exhibited this activity the order of activity of the enantiomers was butaclamol approximately ii greater than i greater than iii a decrease in striatal da was observed with i and iii at the highest dose used but not at onehalf the dose each analog antagonized the dainduced increase in cya ec activity of olfactory tubercle homogenates the order of activity of the racemates except for ii and enantiomers being butaclamol approximately i greater than iii greater than ii the enantiomers of butaclamol and analogs were two to four times more potent than their respective racemates with butaclamol and i displaying activity generally equivalent to fluphenazine the respective enantiomers were ineffective indicating a stereochemical specificity for dareceptor blockade such analogs presented should be of value in elucidating dopaminergic mechansims
248,the purification and some properties of the two inhibitors ia and ia of proteinase a from yeast have previously been described saheki et al eur j biochem an improved method for the preparation of ia which is less timeconsuming and leads to higher yields is presented based on amino acid analysis ia contains amino acids per molecule the molecular weight was the inhibitor contained no proline no arginine no cysteine and no tryptophan but did contain a C1 number of the polar amino acids glutamate glutamine aspartate asparagine and lysine neither by dansylation nor by edman Kd could an nterminal amino acid be detected changes in the circular dichroism upon transition from ph to suggest different tertiary structures at these ph values experiments on the kinetics of inhibition of proteinase a revealed an apparent ki value of x m for ia and x m for pepstatin a nonstoichiometric inhibition of a pseudoirreversible type is concluded from the kinetic data a hydrophobic type of binding of ia to yeast proteinase a is suggested from experiments demonstrating a C1 decrease in the percentage of inhibition caused by addition of m urea m guanidine hydrochloride triton or CA acid
249,the twophase extraction technique has been used to study the equilibrium between a metal cations and h under these conditions the ionophore forms charge neutral isostoichiometric complexes with divalent cations in which both carboxylate groups of the am complexes are deprotonated in ethanol however the methyl ester of a also binds divalent cations indicating that protonated complexes between a and cations should also exist with monovalent cations a forms two chargeneutral complexes of stoichiometries and relative stabilities ahm greater than am examination of energy utilization k and h movements and light scattering capacity of mitochondria in the presence of divalent cation chelators a and valinomycin demonstrates that a can act as a nigericin type k ionophore under AGA conditions formation constants for the ahm complexes with monovalent cations indicate that with appropriate conditions transport of li and na mediated by a would also be expected the IB constant data and associated free energies of complex formation are compared as a function of ionic radius and of cation charge the data indicate that lack of conformational mobility in a is responsible for the high cation size selectivity of this compound to explain the transport selectivity of a for divalent cations it is proposed that this ionophore forms a family of five complexes isostoichiometric between cations of different valence but of which only chargeneutral species are permeant to membranes the charge of a given complex is in turn determined by that of the cation the concept is consistent with the divalent cation transport specificity of a explains the observed monovalent cation transport and is useful in rationalizing the differences in charge selectivity between a and xa
250,a new protease was isolated from an extract of leaves of agave americana variegata the protease ec was purified fold with a yield of the mg enzyme had a TPS activity of unitsmg according to electrophoretic ultracentrifugal and other PCS characterizations the enzyme was homogeneous the enzyme had a mr of a swvalue of s a d wvalue of cmsec a stokes radius of nm a partial TPS volume of cmg a frictional ration of a molecular absorbancy index at nm of an isoelectric point of and contained carbohydrate the enzyme contained no cysteine agave protease could hydrolyze a variety of protein substrates although it did have a restricted specificity it is not a sulphhydryl protease but seems to be an alkaline serine protease with an optimum ph of agave protease had marked esterolytic activity and with cbztyronp had an apparent michaelis constant of m and a v of mol substratemol enzyme per sec the enzyme did not need metal ions for optimal activity monovalent cations did not influence its kinetic parameters but it was inhibited by cobalt pchgbzo and tosphechc with respect to its primary specificity as well as its phdependence there was a resemblance with chymotrypsin although the rate of hydrolysis of agave protease is much lower
251,the effects of lipolysis on the structure of chylomicrons were studied with the SEM TSM using rat CMs incubated with purified bovine milk lipoprotein lipase for minutes at ph since the amount of albumin added to the medium was limited some of the free fatty acids and partial glycerides formed by lipolysis accumulated in the chylomicrons lipolyzed CMs fixed with oso at ph appeared in SEM as spheres with multiply idented irregular surfaces while those fixed at ph as well as control chylomicrons fixed at both phs appeared as spheres with smooth surfaces sections of osofixed specimens viewed with the transmission electron microscope showed that the core of lipolyzed chylomicrons fixed at ph contained numerous circular electronlucent areas at the periphery thus accounting for the indented surfaces observed above while the core surfaces of the other specimens were circular and smooth these findings confirm an earlier report that aqueous spaces form in chylomicrons during lipolysis when albumin in the medium is limited and that the aqueous spaces disappear when specimens are prepared at ph for microscopy thin sections of specimens that had been prepared for scanning electron microscopy showed that the goldpalladium coating was desposited directly on the indented surface of the lipid core of lipolyzed chylomicrons fixed at ph it is concluded that vacuum dehydration during specimen preparation ruptures the outer wall of the aqueous spaces in lipolyzed chylomicrons and thereby exposes the interior of the spaces to goldpalladium coating and viewing with the scanning EM
252,a cationic protease has been purified from the granule fraction of blooddonor WBCs by a preparative method including precipitation by acetone and chromatography on biogel a m cmsephadex c and sephadex gg the ph optimum against denatured bovine hemoglobin is gel chromatography indicated a molecular weight close to this neutral protease ec is able to split the synthetic esters zalanph and acalaome its activity on the former substrate being times greater than that of pancreatic elastase on the latter the same it differs crucially from pancreatic elastase in having small elastinolytic activity in cationic disk electrophoresis neutral protease resolves into three protein bands with lower mobility than lysozyme all bands exhibit esterolytic activity against acetoxynaphthoic acid otoluidide strongly suggesting that they represent isoenzymes the enzyme is CR inhibited by iprpf partially so by soybean trypsin inhibitor and trasylol cysteine edta and toslyschcl have no effect during chromatography on cmsephadex c a more positively charged enzymes was identified this had hemoglobinolytic activity at ph but only a small esterolytic effect on zalanph it showed only traces of activity against acalaome
253,cba mice were exposed to a supralethal dose of whole body xirradiation and recieved transplants of graded small doses of bone marrow fetal liver or fetal CL plus fetal thymus cells obtained from h matched c or h mismatched a donors survival at days was used to evaluate the ability of the transplants to restore hematopoiesis following the acute radiation injury in the higher dose ranges of x and x cellskg body weight the fetal cells were as ERP as AD bone marrow in both the matched and mismatched strain combinations survival at days was used to evaluate the severity of chronic graftversushost disease produced by each of the transplants in the higher dose ranges cells from fetal donors promoted higher LTS rates than did comparable doses of bone marrow cells in both the matched and mismatched strain combinations in some exp CG the addition of FT cells to fetal liver cells resulted in higher ST and longterm survival rates than did fetal liver CT but this was inconsistent and generally fell short of statistical significance the most important finding was that cells from mismatched unrelated fetal donors using a cell dose per kilogram body weight comparable to the number of fetal CL and thymus cells which would be obtainable from one human fetus at weeks of embryonation promoted higher LTS rates than did bone marrow transplants from matched unrelated donors
254,several strains of thermophilic aerobic sporeforming bacilli synthesize betagalactosidase ec constitutively the constitutivity is apparently not the result of a temperaturesensitive repressor the betagalactosidase from one CS investigated in CF extracts has a ph optimum between and and a very sharp ph dependence on the acid side of its optimum the optimum temperature for this enzyme is degrees c and the arrhenius activation SE is about kcalmol below degrees c and kcalmol above that temperature at degrees c the km is m for lactose and x m for nitrophenylbetadgalactopyranoside the enzyme is strongly productinhibited by galactose ki equals x m it is relatively SD at degrees c losing only half of its activity after days at this temperature at degrees c more than of the activity is lost in min however the enzyme is protected somewhat against thermal inactivation by protein and in the presence of mgml of bovine serum Al the enzyme is only inactivated in min at degrees c its molecular weight estimated by disc gel PACE is
255,crystalline glutaminaseasparaginase which is ERP against solid as well as ascites PT was prepared from soil isolate organism pseudomonas a this enzyme has a ration of vmax for lglutamine and lasparagine of the presence of glu in the growth medium is essential for optimal enzyme production and glucose inhibits the production of glutaminaseasparaginase the purification procedure provides an overall yield of to from crude cell extract to homogeneous glutaminaseasparaginase and is adaptable to C1 scale production of the enzyme the specific activity of homogeneous enzyme is iumg of protein and the e is no disulfide or sulfhydryl CG appear to be present on the enzyme the isoelectric point of glutaminaseasparaginase by isoelectric focusing on ampholine polyacrylamide gel plates is the km values for lglutamine and lasparagine are and x m respectively the enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the d isomers of glutamine and asparagine at and the rate of the respective l isomers lglutamic acid gammamonohydroxamate is hydrolyzed at approximately the same rate as lglutamine the enzyme is not inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetate mm lglutamate mm or laspartate mm ammonium sulfate mm inhibits the enzymatic activity the plasma halflife of pseudomonas a glutaminaseasparaginase if hours in normal mice and hours in mice infected with the lactate dehydrogenaseelevating virus
256,the beige mouse is an animal model for the human chediakhigashi syndrome a disease characterized by giant lysosomes in most cell types in mice treatment with androgenic hormones causes a fold elevation in at least one kidney lysosomal enzyme betaglucuronidase beige mice treated with androgen had significantly higher kidney betaglucuronidase betagalactosidase and nacetylbetadglucosaminidase hexosaminidase levels than normal mice other androgeninducible enzymes and enzyme markers for the cytosol mitochondria and peroxisomes were not increased in kidney of beige mice no significant lysosomal enzyme elevation was observed in five other organs of beige mice with or without androgen treatment nor in kidneys of beige females not treated with androgen histochemical staining for glucuronidase together with subcellular fractionation showed that the higher glucuronidase content of beige mouse kidney is caused by a striking accumulation of giant glucuronidasecontaining lysosomes in tubule cells near the corticomedullary boundary in normal mice lysosomal enzymes are coordinately released into the lumen of the kidney tubules and appreciable amounts of lysosomal enzymes are present in the urine levels of urinary lysosomal enzymes are much lower in beige mice than in normal mice it appears that lysosomes may accumulate in beige mice because of defective exocytosis resulting either from decreased intracellular motility of lysosomes or from their improper F0 with the BPM a similar defect could account for characteristics of the CHS
257,data are presented which indicate that the mechanism of tension depression and subsequent recovery from dichlorodifluoromethane freon an aerosol gas recently described as a potent cardiac depressant agent differs from that of hypoxia to analyze these differences rat papillary muscles contracting isometrically in a myograph were studied during and subsequent to min interventions of of hypoxia freon with adequate oxygenation or freon combined with hypoxia during each of the three interventions the developed force f was markedly depressed while peak shortening velocity vpm was selectively more depressed by freon and freon combined with hypoxia than by hypoxia alone while hypoxia shortened the time to peak force ttp and onehalf EC50 time rt markedly freon with adequate oxygenation slightly shortened rt p is less than but failed to shorten ttp significantly in contrast freon po during hypoxia shortened ttp and rt significantly p is less than more than did hypoxia or freon alone posthypoxic prolongation of ttp and rt was not seen during REC from freon this prolongation was depressed during REC from freon given either during hypoxia or during recovery from hypoxia the results indicate that freon and hypoxia act synergically although the mechanisms through which they mediate their actions on myocardial tissue are not identical
258,the effects of several inhibitors atp adp amp udp and p and activators mg glucosep of rb muscle glycogen synthase udpglucoseglycogen alphaglucosyltransferase ec were studied in relation to the phosphorylation state of the purified enzyme all the modifiers had increasing effects with enzyme of increasing alkalilabile phosphate content in experiments where combinations of effectors were present it was apparent that a concentrations of modifiers in the physiological range could be significant in determining enzymic activity and b the sensitivity of the reaction rate to changes in phosphorylation state was critically dependent on the concentration of the small molecules changes in the phosphorylation of the enzyme corresponding to changes in the i activity reported in the literature for studies in vivo were capable of producing large alterations in glycogen synthase activity because the magnitudes of such changes were dependent on the effector concentrations there may be an integration of local cellular control through small molecule effects with hormonal control through the phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase
259,the molecular mechanism of the bohr effect is explained according to the molecular model proposed by perutz et al the bohr effect is due to changes in the pk of specific carboxyl and amino groups of the four globin chains following the transition between the deoxy and oxy conformations of the molecule carbon dioxide binds to the n terminal valine of the monomers to form carbamino EDC this carbaminoformation depends upon ph pco and predominates on deoxygenated haemoglobin it is lowered when o binds to the heme groups o linked carbamino compounds through the carbamino EDC carbon dioxide lowers both the affinity of haemoglobin for o and the bohr effect diphosphoglycerate also binds to the haemoglogin molecule this organophosphate lowers the affinity for o but increases the bohr effect in whole blood the bohr effect is therefore dependent upon ph o saturation pco and dpg concentration into the red blood cells
260,as part of a demonstration study male patients presenting to a walkin clinic with common genitourinary complaints were interviewed by health assistants guided by a protocol independent examination of patients by a health assistant and a physician formally demonstrated that the health assistants could collect the clinical data accurately fortyfour patients were then randomly chosen to be examined diagnosed and treated either by a health assistant guided by the protocol and supported by an available physician or only by a physician using medical records and a followup interview we assessed the thoroughness of the medical record adequacy of diagnosis and treatment symptom relief patient satisfaction and patient education the health assistantprotocol system proved as safe and effective as the mdonly system and the health assistants were able to manage of patients without involving the physician the study suggests that brieflytrained health assistants may help save physician and nurse time and that the development of protocols can help set standards for the medical management of defined problems while providing a mechanism for rapidly creating a CR medical record which can be easily audited for conformance with standards
261,the temperature dependence of the oxygen equilibrium of tadpole hemoglobin has been determined between degrees and degrees for the unfractionated but phosphatefree lysate and between degrees and degrees for each of the four isolated components between ph and in m cacodylate tris or glycine buffers containing m nacl and mm edta under these conditions the bohr effect defined as deltalog pdeltaph of the UF lysate is positive at low temperatures between ph and and is negative above ph to at any temperature as the temperature rises the bohr effect below ph changes greatly in the interval ph to the magnitude of the bohr effect decreases from at degrees to zero at about degrees and becomes negative as in mammalian hemoglobins above this temperature measurements with the isolated components show that the temperature dependence of oxygen binding for components i and ii and for components iii and iv is very similar for both sets of components the apparent overall enthalpy of oxygenation at ph is about kcalmol and kcalmol at ph the measured enthalpies include contributions from the AS bohr groups the buffer ions themselves the hemoglobin CG contributing buffering and any phdependent oxygenationdependent binding of ions such as chloride by the hemoglobin the apportioning of the total enthalpy among these various processes remains to be determined between ph and tadpole oxyhemoglobin undergoes a phdependent dissociation from tetramer to dimer the ph dependence of the apparent tetramerdimer dissociation constant indicates that at ph the dissociation of each tetramer is accompanied by the PR of approximately protons in this ph range the oxygen equilibrium measurements indicate that about proton is released for each oxygen molecule bound the results are consistent with the conclusion that one acid group per alphabeta dimer changes its pk from about to or below upon dissociation of the tetramer
262,the concentrations of noradrenaline and adrenaline in various organs arterial plasma and venous outflow from isolated hearts of AD chickens have been determined the relative adrenaline concentrations percentage of the sum of noradrenaline and adrenaline in the HR spleen and BB were higher than those found in mammalian organs chemical sympathectomy by i.c.v. with hydroxydopamine caused a decrease of the noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations in the HR to and and in the spleen to and respectively stimulation of the right sympathetic nerves infusion of tyramine or infusion of a modified tyrode solution containing mm k and mm na caused an output of both noradrenaline and adrenaline into the perfusate of isolated hearts the relative adrenaline concentration in the perfusate was not significantly different from the relative adrenaline concentration remaining in these NF in the individual experiments the noradrenaline adrenaline ratios of the stimulation perfusates were positively correlated with the ratios found in the hearts the effects of noradrenaline and adrenaline on cardiac rate and tension development were studied in spontaneously beating right atria and electrically driven LA respectively in addition the arterial pressure rise in response to noradrenaline or adrenaline wasmeasured in chickens it was found that the cardiovaseart rate cardiac tension development and arterial blood pressure was not significantly different from that of adrenaline it is concluded that in the chicken HR and spleen both noradrenaline and adrenaline act as sympathetic neutrotransmitters
263,the reversible thermal denaturation of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease a at ph in m nacl over the range degrees c as studied by raman spectroscopy proceeds in a gradual manner consistent with a stepwise unfolding process rather than as a transition between two states conversion of residues from helical or pleatedsheet geometry to some intermediate geometry as followed by means of the amide i and iii lines reveals that substantial amounts of the helical and pleatedsheet conformations remain at degrees c changes in the strength of hydrogen bonding by the tyrosyl residues are indicated by the intensity ratio of the doublet at cm and changes in the geometry of the disulfide bridges by the frequency and halfwidth of the raman line near cm due to the ss vibration vibrations of cs bonds in the methionines and cystines are used to monitor conformational changes in these residues while there are small quantitative differences in temperature dependence among these probes all agree in placing the malting temperature at or near degrees c the raman data are quantitatively consistent with the sixstage scheme of unfolding of aw burgess and ha scheraga j theor biol except that no NC in the environment of the tyrosines is seen until degrees c
264,flucloxacillin a recent addition to the group of isoxazolyl penicillins was studied in vitro and in normal volunteers the bactericidal activity of the drug against most strains of GP bacteria including penicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus was similar to that of oxacillin and approximately fourfold greater than that of cloxacillin each of the three penicillins was po orally to a group of ten volunteers for eight days in a dose of mg four times a day the mean concentrations of flucloxacillin in the SS were two to sixfold higher than those of the other two agents on the first fourth and eighth days of therapy the percentage of flucloxacillin bound by serum protein was per cent for cloxacillin and oxacillin the values were and per cent respectively using these data the concentrations of free flucloxacillin in serum were found to be twice as high as those of cloxacillin and oxacillin these findings suggest that when administered orally this new agent may offer some therapeutic advantage over oxacillin and cloxacillin
265,keeping the arterial ph at and paco at mmhg in eight anesthetized dogs we acutely raised PK from to meq then allowed it to decay back to control C2 the cerebrospinal fluid csfblood electrical potential difference pd increased mv per fold increase in plasma k again keeping arterial ph at and paco at mmhg we elevated plasma k in four dogs from to meq and maintained this level for h we found that the pd increased from a control value of to mv showing no tendency to decay over the h and that the NC in pd did not affect the distribution of na k h cl or hco between blood and csf over the h these results suggest that under these conditions the pd between csf and blood may play no ERP role in determining the distributions of these charged species by h these results are contrasted with recent findings which suggest that h and hco are distributed according to passive forces between csf and blood
266,adenylate guanylate cyclase and protein kinases in a fibrous sarcoma originating from rat prostate have been studied a decrease in levels of adenosine monophosphate cAMP and adenylate cyclase activities and an increase in levels of guanosine monophosphate cyclic gmp and guanylate cyclase MICs were observed in the RT tissue when compared with the normal prostatic tissue of rats protein kinases from the tumor and the prostate were both responsive to exogenous cyclic amp with an apparent ka of mum in the tumor and of mum in the prostate it is of interest that the protein kinases from the tumor responded to cyclic amp to the same extent as was observed in the enzyme preparation from the prostate the protein kinase from the tumor was more CS to cyclic gmp than that from the prostate showing an apparent ka of mum in the tumor and of mum in the prostate this RT has been characterized with an increase in guanylate cyclase MICs with a subsequent rise in cellular cyclic gmp and an increased sensitivity of the protein kinase to cyclic gmp
267,rabbit igm antibodies to denatured mammalian or t bacteriophage dna or polyapolyu irreversibly lost complementc fixation CR on exposure to low ph and reneutralization with a halving of the complementfixation titer occurring after treatment at about ph the titers of EA to denatured phage dna to polyapolyu or to hemocyanin were halved only after exposure to ph inactivation by acid was enhanced by low protein concentrations incubation at higher temperatures and by slow reneutralization under all these conditions it was more extensive with igm than with igg inactivation of igm cfixation activity at ph and room temperature was a first order reaction with a halftime of about min both classes retained Fab activity after exposure to ph in the alkaline range full cfixation reactivity was retained by both classes after reneutralization from ph some loss occurred at ph and total irreversible inactivation occurred by ph in the latter case Fab activity was also lost the cfixation inactivation curves in the alkaline range were similar for igg and igm antibodies
268,betahydroxysteroid oxidoreductase betahor activity in testicular tissue from a male pseudohermaphrodite mp who had elevated plasma lh and androstenedione a levels and normal dehydroepiandrosterone dha C2 was compared by in vitro studies to that of testicular tissue from a normal man the betahor activity from the mp was localized predominantly in the microsomal fraction as it is in normal testicular tissue with dha a and estrone as substrates the betahor activity of the mp was decreased in the presence of nadph but not nadh in comparison with the normal nadph was the preferred cofactor for betahor from the normal testes while betahor activity from the mp testes was less with nadph than with nadh as cofactor these results indicate that the inefficient testosterone production in the mp testes may be accounted for by a deficiency of nadphdependent betahor activity further studies suggested that betahydroxysteroid oxidoreductaseisomerase betahor was increased in the mp testes and was much greater than betahor activity with dha as substrate these findings largely explain the elevated plasma a levels with normal dha levels and suggest that dha leads to a leads to testosterone was the major route of testosterone biosynthesis in the mp testes
269,a repressible ALP phosphatase has been isolated from the extreme bacterial thermophile thermus aquaticus the enzyme can be derepressed more than fold by starving the cells for phosphate in derepressed cells nearly of the total protein in a cellfree enzyme preparation is alkaline phosphatase the enzyme was purified to homogeneity as judged by disc acrylamide electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate PACE by SU gradient centrifugation it was established that the enzyme has an approximate molecular weight of and consists of three subunits each with a molecular weight of tris buffer stimulates the activity of the enzyme which has a ph optimum of the enzyme has a broad temperature range with an optimum of degrees the enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of a wide variety of phosphorylated EDC as do many of the mesophilic ALP phosphatases the michaelis constantkm for the enzyme is x m amino acid analysis of the protein revealed little in the amino acid composition to separate it from other mesophilic enzymes which have been previously studied
270,graft versus host gvh reactivity of parental lymph node ln cells was assayed by measurements of hthymidine incorporation in vivo mitomycin mit treatment of parental cells abolished their proliferative activity but the combination of such mittreated parental cells with f ln cells resulted in much higher proliferation than either one population alone this recruitment into proliferation of f cells was prominent on days and after cell injection and amounted to to of the total activity seen T3 injection of untreated parental cells alone the f cell sensitive to recruitment was resistant to antithy treatment was not removed by carbonyl ironmagnet separation and was not present in thymus the parental cell inducing recruitment was however sensitive to antithy when spleen cells from hapten immune f donors were injected together with mittreated parental ln cells and boosted with hapten on another carrier a typical allogeneic effect was observed in the antihapten immune response it was concluded that mittreated parental TA exerted a mitogenic effect on f B1 resulting in extensive recruitment similar to that seen in murine MLRs
271,to clarify the role of fat maldigestion in the pathogenesis of steatorrhea in patients with ileal resection the total and AQ phase concentrations of bile acid and HFA were characterized in such patients patients with small ileal resection bile acid diarrhea and steatorrhea less than g per day patients with C1 ileal resection HFA diarrhea and steatorrhea greater than g per day as well as healthy control subjects after a morning and an afternoon liquid test meal the study was then repeated with cholestyramine g being administered before each meal to induce fat maldigestion after a conventional test meal patients with large resections and severe steatorrhea had significantly lower aqueous phase concentrations of bile acids and fatty acids than patients with smaller resections or control subjects explained in part by IL precipitation of about onehalf of the bile acids during digestion when cholestyramine was administered before the meal AQ phase bile acid concentrations decreased in all patients including the NCs the degree of fat maldigestion induced in the patients with small resections and the control subjects became similar to that present T3 the conventional test meal in the patients with large resections because steatorrhea increased little in the patients with small resections when cholestyramine was administered continuously the data suggest that fat maldigestion per se does not induce severe fat malabsorption in patients with sufficient anatomical reserve because such patients can absorb fat efficiently by utilizing the distal small intestine in patients with large ileal resections severe steatorrhea is explained in part by the combination of fat maldigestion and decreased surface area it is also speculated that the steatorrhea occurring in patients with small resections and relatively normal fat digestion during two test meals may be explained by impaired fat digestion which occurs during the final meal of the day which is often the largest meal
272,isolation of a protective subfraction of ribosomes from streptococcus pneumoniae has been achieved and the immune response it induces has been investigated mice immunized with pneumococcal ribosomes or purified protein extracted from the ribosomal preparation ce protein exhibit similar survival rates upon challenge by virulent s pneumoniae in contrast recipients of purified ribosomal ribonucleic acid were never protected against pneumococcal challenge serum from mice immunized with pneumococcal ribosomes or ce protein passively immunized syngeneic recipients against pneumococcal challenge whereas spleen cells from the same donors were unable to transfer immunity passive immunization with antiribosome serum could be abrogated by absorption with whole ribosomes ce protein or various serotypes of s pneumoniae capsular types and antiribosome SS significantly enhanced clearance of s pneumoniae from mouse blood in vivo and in vitro this required phagocytic cells since antiribosome SS CT with or without complement supported growth of s pneumoniae to an extent comparable to NS the data suggest that the primary immunogen of pneumococcal ribosomes resides in the protein fraction further the immunity induced by the protein fraction is mediated by antibody that appears to function as an opsonin for s pneumoniae
273,the clinical course of patients with polyarteritis was reviewed to determine prognostic AF and response to treatment the first three months were the most critical to survival survivorship was per cent at five years older AO involvement of skeletal muscle and presence of IP neuropathy weighted against a satisfactory outcome cutaneous vasculitis was associated with a more benign course myocardial disease central NS involvement or hypertension were not invariably poor prognostic factors muscle biopsies even in the absence of clinical involvement were a useful diagnostic procedure and renal angiograms were found to be a valuable alternative to renal biopsy an unequivocal distinction on clinical and histopathologic criteria could not be made among polyarteritis nodosa hypersentitivity angiitis and allergic granulomatosis australia antigenemia occurred in six per cent of patients although evaluation of therapy was difficult data from this T0 did not show a superiority of high vs low dosage of corticosteroids in suppressing active disease
274,porcine and ovine s thyroglobulins prepared from frozen glands in several buffers using slice extraction or homogenization ammonium sulfate precipitation and deaecellulose chromatography or sepharose b gel filtration were contaminated with protease activity of ph optima and as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel PACE optimum temperatures of autodigestion were degrees c at ph and degrees c at ph thyroglobulins prepared from unfrozen PG ph in m sodium phosphate using slice extraction ammonium sulfate precipitation and sepharose b gel filtration were devoid of acid proteolytic activity but still underwent autodigestion at ph diisopropylfluorophosphate was a potent inhibitor of the alkaline protease activity of ovine thyroglobulin S9 in contrast to thyroglobulin obtained from frozen PG the proteins purified from fresh unfrozen glands at ph only showed the s and the s species by PACE in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels very few bands migrating faster than s were visible T3 full reduction and salkylation of porcine and ovine thyroglobulins no qualitative changes were observed in the gel electrophoresis DP as compared to the unmodified proteins species of apparent mol wt corresponding to the native s were the major component strongly suggesting a mol wt of about for the elementary peptide chains of pig and sheep thyroglobulins
275,the autophosphorylation of rb and human erythrocyte CM has been studied under various experimental conditions the phosphopeptides of the erythocyte membranes were identified using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis followed by ratioautography the pattern of phosphorylatiion of membrane components differs with respect to the phosphoryl donor used atp or gtp and to the ph at which the reaction is carried out both species appear to contain at least two distinct membranebound protein kinases the human erythrocyte membrane contains a cyclic adenosine monophosphate cyclic ampdependent protein kinase and several substrates for this kinase only atp can be used as a phosphoryl donor for this kinase in contrast the rabbit erythrocyte membrane does not contain a cyclic amp dependent protein kinase but does contain a kinase which utilizes only atp as the phosphoryl donor and is specific for certain endogenous substrates at low ph both the human and rabbit erythrocyte membranes contain a kinase which utilizes gtp perhaps also atp as the phosphoryl donor the substrates of these kinases are similar in both species
276,the effects of ionic alterations on the accumulation distribution and movements of cnicotine in slices from rat brain striatum hypothalamus cortex and cerebellum were studied the uptake of cnicotone is not dependent upon na present in the incubation fluid because a ksubstituted ona solution increased the cnicotine tissue space a trissubstituted ona solution decreased the cnicotine tissue space and a sucrosesubstituted ona solution did not NC the amount of cnicotine taken up when compared to the cnicotine tissue space obtained in a normal incubation solution however all three nafree solutions elicited a sustained decrease in cnicotine efflux the increase in cnicotine space produced in a ksubstituted ona solution was present primarily in the slower component of a twocomponent washout whereas the decrease produced in a trissubstituted ona solution produced an equal percentage decrease in the size of both components most of the observed effects could be attributed to a linear relationship between the logarithm of the intracellular k concentration and the cnicotine tissue space in conclusion it appears that there is an intracellular binding site for nicotine and that the degree of binding is dependent upon the concentration of k
277,endogeneous fatty acid biosynthesis in the two yeast species saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida lipolytica is CR repressed by the addition of longchain fatty acids to the GM in candida lipolytica this repression is accompanied by a corresponding loss of fatty acid synthetase activity in the cell homogenate when the cells were grown on fatty acids as the sole carbon source the activity of the saccharomyces cerevisiae HFA synthetase however remains unaffected by the addition of fatty acids to a glucosecontaining GM from fattyacidgrown candida lipolytica cells no fatty acid synthetase complex can be isolated nor is there any immunologically crossreacting FAS protein detectable in the crude cell extract from this it is concluded that candida lipolytica but not saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to adapt to the growth on fatty acids either by repression of fatty acid synthetase biosynthesis or by a fattyacidinduced proteolytic degradation of the multienzyme complex similarly the HFA synthetase complex disappears rapidly from stationary phase candida lipolytica cells even after growth in fattyacidfree medium finally it was found that the HFA synthetase complexes from saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida lipolytica though very similar in size and subunit composition were immunologically different and had no common antigenic determinants
278,a survey in various countries revealed that the nfixing spirillum lipoferum beijerinck is a very common root and soil inhabitant in the tropics more than half of the grass root and soil samples collected in tropical countries four african countries and brazil contained abundant s lipoferum populations while less than of the samples collected in temperate south brazil kenya and the usa contained the organism there is a pronounced vegetation effect panicum maximum seems the most favorable among the forage grasses while few positive samples were found under virgin tropical forest legume roots contained less s lipoferum than adjacent soils more than of the samples from cereal roots maize sorghum wheat and rye grown in fields fertilized with pk and mo in RJ state were positive maize and sorghum grown under similar conditions in wisconsin contained less than of positive samples but when maize fields were inoculated of the root samples contained s lipoferum alluvial soils were more favorable than eroded hill soils occurrence in soil was strongly phdependent with a ph around being optimal correlation coefficient r sporadic occurrence was observed even in soils with ph surfacesterilized p maximum roots collected from soils with ph ranging from to contained high s lipoferum numbers which did not correlate with soil ph r amendment with malate of acid soils was not very ERP in increasing nitrogenase nase activity but in two soils with ph above high nase activity was obtained after to h of incubation in two soils from a temperate climate region inoculation with s lipoferum increased nase activity produced through malate amendment
279,midmyocardial and subendocardial EPM was used as an indirect method for continuous evaluation of regional canine myocardial ischemia left VVI midmyocardial ph phm at mm depth was monitored in dogs under resting conditions by means of a mm beckman ph probe phm was recorded at myocardial temperatures of to degrees c ischemia was then produced by snare occlusion of the PT left main coronary i.a. for minutes phm decreased to p less than at minute and p less than in minutes when flow was restored phm returned toward normal within minutes ph and at T2 had returned to control values ph in another dogs under similar conditions phm at mm and subendocardial ph phe at mm were measured baseline phm and phe levels were significantly different p less than after minutes of ischemia phm was whereas phe decreased to p less than five minutes after snare release phe remained at phm returned to control values both phm and phe levels were normal minutes T3 release of the snare the midmyocardium and subendocardium have different ph C2 which can be monitored ischemia produces different ph patterns in these layers phm returns to control values within T2 after minutes of ischemia whereas phe remains depressed for at least minutes EPM provides an accurate and simple method for online DUE of Endo ischemia
280,lactate oxidation catalysed by pig heart lactate dehydrogenase was studied in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of pyruvate experimental results show the presence of an intermediate which occurs immediately after the hydride transfer step but before the dissociation of pyruvate and the h produced by the reaction the rate constant for pyruvate dissociation and the dissociation constant for pyruvate from the ternary complex differ from those obtained in pyruvate reduction experiments in singleturnover Pyr reduction by pig heart lactate dehydrogenase at ph pyruvate can bind to the enzyme before a h is taken up and the subsequent uptake of a h is governed by a step that is also ratelimiting for singleturnover and steadystate nadh oxidation observation of various intermediates in the singleturnover pyruvate reduction experiments has made it possible to determine separately the dissociation constant and km value for pyruvate at ph and also the catalytic kcat and km for pyruvate under firstorder conditions at different ph values further studies on singleturnover pyruvate reduction carried out in ho or in water at low temperature show another step which under these conditions is slower than that controlling h uptake and ratelimiting for nadh oxidation a scheme is presented which explains these results
281,psoriatic scale proteases were found to be extracted effectively in salt solution moll containing triton x gl the extraction in dilute buffer or sucrose yielded low MICs the acid n hso and kscn moll solutions effectively extracted plasminogen activator fibrinolysin was most AS in salt moll kcl and in kscn moll extracts psoriatic scale proteases were fractionated by sephadex g gel filtration and further by deae cellulose chromatography five different enzyme preparations were obtained the first preparation resembling cat d effectively hydrolysed hemoglobin at ph and casein at ph and was insensitive to protease modifiers the second preparation effectively hydrolysed trypsin substrates aglme tame baee and bana and also histone and casein at ph and was inhibited by protease inhibitors tlck and e the third preparation hydrolysed histone and casein at ph and was effectively inhibited by e and partially by protease inhibitors and tpck the fourth preparation resembling cathepsin b hydrolysed bana and baee at ph and was activated by shreagents and edta the fifth enzyme preparation hydrolysed atee and was inhibited by e and tpck plasminogen activator was found mainly in the second enzyme preparation and fibrinolysin activity in the third and fifth enzyme preparations the second third and fifth enzyme preparations were different from the enzymes found in healthy human skin the proteases of psoriatic scale resemble those of tissue and cell cultures undergoing rapid cell division the possible role of proteases in the increased cell division in psoriasis PI is discussed
282,the recessive genes mi and gl in the homozygous state determine among other phenotypic effects osteopetrosis in the house mouse from a stock carrying mi derived from grÃ¼neberg the mi gene was bred into the standard cbah inbred strain microphthalmic mice of these two stocks and their hybrids were treated as newborn by intraperitoneal injection and at weaning or maturity by i.v. of cell suspensions containing hematopoietic stem cells from phenotypically normal mice resolution of much of the osteopetrosis but not the other phenotypic effects occurred within a few months in the majority of cases provided syngeneic or h compatible allogeneic cells were given it did not occur spontaneously or on giving h incompatible cells or on giving compatible material by an inappropriate route the results accord with hypotheses that osteoclasis of scaffoldtype woven bone is impaired in mi mi that osteoclastic cells are derived through circulating monocytes from hematopoietic stem cells and in mi mi this defect can be overcome by a transplant of normal hemopoietic stem cells
283,we studied the role of neural transmission from hypermetabolic IP tissues in the regulation of cardiac output and pulmonary ventilation in chloraloseanesthetized dogs crosscirculation techniques with femoralfemoral or femoralaortic anastomoses were used to produce a vascularly isolated but normally innervated hindlimb or lower halfbody dinitrophenol dnp was infused into the arterial side of the perfusion circuit to triple oxygen consumption and to increase lactate production by the crossperfused area after infusion of dnp cardiac output and mean SABP increased but neither heart rate nor pulmonary i.a. wedge pressure changed significantly pulmonary minute ventilation and arterial ph also increased while arterial pco fell these changes were abolished when the nerve connections between the perfused limb and its parent body were severed normal saline when administered in a similar manner did not increase either ventilation or cardiac output and simple denervation without previous infusions of dnp also had no effect these results indicate that there are receptors sensitive to metabolic changes in the tissue and that neural transmission is an important afferent link in regulating the cardiopulmonary responses to increased tissue metabolism
284,gastric acid responses to the test meals were measured in the heidenhain pouch gastric and pancreatic fistula dogs using the intragastric titration method and monitoring the rate at which a solution of nnaoh had to be added to maintain the ph of the gastric content constant at preselected values ranging from to in this way the ph profile of the gastric acid and pepsin responses to a liver extract meal kept in the heidenhain pouch or gastric fistula as well as to exogenous stimuli such as histamine PG or urecholine could be determined a liver extract meal adjusted to ph produced a potent and pressurerelated stimulation of acid secretion from the heidenhain pouch without any change in secretion from the main stomach and pancreas or in the serum concentration of immunoassayable gastrin graded decrease of the liver extract meal ph to below resulted in the phdependent inhibition of gastric acid output which at ph was only about of the value attained at ph acid secretion from the heidenhain pouch induced by exogenous stimuli such as histamine pentagastrin or urecholine also showed gradual decrease when the ph of the pouch content was decreased in sequential order from to this phdependent inhibition was accompanied by an increase in pepsin secretion the phdependent inhibition of the heidenhain pouch response to the CL extract meal was not altered by topical application of a local anaesthetic and atropine or by the intravenous infusion of large doses of atropine sec or metiamide which were shown to cause a marked inhibition of the main stomach response to the liver meal the results indicate that there is a local and gastrinindependent inhibition mechanism of GAS activated by an acidified meal making contact with the oxyntic gland area
285,samples of gastric juice were aspirated every minutes from normal subjects and patients with chronic gastric ulcers during a maximal histamine infusion test the known tendency of patients with gastric ulcers to secrete a less acid gastric juice than that of normal subjects was confirmed however the hypoacidity was related to the extent by which the total ionic concentration was less than the isotonic value of meql on the assumption that such hypoacidity was produced by the neutralisation of hydrogen ions by bicarbonate ions refluxing into the stomach from the duodenum the data were QTc and resulted in a normal estimate of the pH in the gastric ulcer group independent corrections according to the sodium content of refluxed DU juice yielded similar results for the volume of gastric juice aspirated it is concluded that while backdiffusion can explain the hypoacidity of gastric juice in patients with gastric ulcers DU reflux can explain both the hypoacidity and the hypotonicity and is therefore more likely to be the correct explanation
286,the mechanisms of glycolytic inhibition in ICM myocardium were investigated in the isolated perfused rat heart glycolysis was inhibited at the level of G3P dehydrogenase the major factors that accounted for the glycolytic inhibition in the ischemic heart compared with the anoxic heart appeared to be higher tissue levels of lactate and h in the ischemic tissue increased extracellular ph inhibited glycolysis in anoxic and hypoxic hearts much more readily than it did in aerobic hearts however maintenance of both extracellular and intracellular ph caused only a modest acceleration of glycolysis in ischemic hearts accumulation of tissue lactate and inhibition of glycolysis were directly proportional to the reduction in coronary bloow flow in both anoxic and ischemic hearts at intracellular lactate concentrations between and mm glycolysis was inhibited under both conditions addition of either or mm lactate to the perfusate inhibited glycolysis in aerobic anoxic and ischemic hearts the effect of lactate did not appear to be mediated through changes in intracellular ph it is concluded that accumulation of lactate represents a L1 factor in the inhibition of glycolysis that develops in ischemic hearts
287,raising dayold chicks on diets lacking copper severely depressed the activity of lysyl oxidase a copper metalloenzyme in connective tissue administration of cuso either through the diet or through intraperitoneal i.v. restored the lysyl oxidase activity in aortic tissue two hours after the chicks received cuso mgkg the activity of lysyl oxidase rose rapidly to attain within hr a new steadystate level which was five to times higher than the basal salineinjected activity twenty hours after copper administration activity was still higher in some experiments double that achieved at hr very low amounts of cycloheximide injected intraperitoneally min before and hr after copper suppressed the activation response by twothirds cycloheximide given or hr after the copper was only onehalf as effective actinomycin d caused only a inhibition of the copperinduced activation the data suggest that copper is a key regulator of lysyl oxidase activity in aorta and may in fact be a major determinant of the steadystate levels of the enzyme in that tissue
288,the kinetics region of seconds of the lightinduced nm absorbance changes and its dark reversal have been studied in detail in the wild type and in some pigment and photosynthetic mutants of scenedesmus obliquus the following lines of evidence led us to conclude that the signal is entirely due to the PS i reaction modified by electron flow from photosystem ii gradual blocking of the electron transport with dichlorophenyldimethylurea resulted in diminution and ultimate elimination of the biphasic nature of the signal without reducing the extent of the absorbance NC or of the dark kinetics on the contrary blocking electron flow at the oxidizing side of plastoquinone with dibromomethylisoprophylpbenzoquinone or inactivating the plastocyanin with kcn prolonged the dark reversal of the absorbance change apart from abolishing the biphasic nature of the signal action spectra clearly indicate that the main signal i is due to electron flow in photosystem i and that its modification signal ii is due to the action of photosystem ii signal i is ph independent whereas signal ii demonstrates a strong ph dependence parallel to the oevolving capacity of the cells chloroplast particles isolated from the wild type scenedesmus cells demonstrated in the absence of any added artificial electron donor or acceptor and also under nonphosphorylation conditions the nm absorbance change with approximately the same magnitude as whole cells the dark kinetics of the particles were comparatively slower removal of plastocyanin and other electron carriers by washing with triton x slowed down the kinetics of the dark RR to a greater extent a similar positive absorbance NC at nm and slow dark reversal was also observed in the photosystem i particles prepared by the triton method mutant ce which contains neither carotenoids nor chlorophyll b and lacks PS ii activity demonstrates a normal signal i of the nm absorbance change this latter result contradicts the postulate that carotenoids are the possible cause of the nm absorbance change
289,stationary phase cultures of a clonal line of rat astrocytes c were maintained at ph values ranging from to using media buffered with various combinations of organic buffers or graded concentrations of bicarbonate ion at a constant co tension the accumulation of a soluble Pa unique to the nervous system s in media buffered with organic buffers was optimal in the ph range to significantly more acid than that optimal for cell growth ph to cells maintained in cobicarbonatebuffered media exhibited a higher and less marked ph optimum for s protein accumulation and a lower efficiency of accumulation of the protein these data suggest that the organic buffer ions themselves apart from their function as buffers are influencing the accumulation of s the specific activity assayed at the enzymatic ph optimum of a MB enzyme enriched in glial cells and myelin cyclic nucleotide phosphohydrolase was markedly phdependent the optimal ph range was to in organic buffer controlled media in cobicarbonate controlled media the optimal ph range was only slightly higher ph to but the specific activities were reduced relative to organic buffergrown cells the structural relationship of some of the aminoethanesulfonic acid buffers used in these experiments to certain compounds of neurochemical interest such as taurine and alphaflupenthixol is noted
290,the activity of beef heart mitochondrial MAO-A towards hydroxytryptamine ht is inhibited by the selective inhibitors clorgyline pco phenylncyclopropylethylamineoxidiazole and deprenyl with a biphasic dependence on the inhibitor concentration the activities towards tyramine dopamine and tryptamine were also inhibited in a biphasic manner but the apparent proportions of the two enzyme species active on dopamine and tryptamine depended on the inhibitor used PEA oxidation was inhibited in a monophasic manner suggesting that only a single enzyme species was responsible for the oxidation of this substrate the biphasic response of ht oxidation to inhibition by clorgyline persisted when functionally competent mitochondria were used and was unaffected by the soluble amine oxidase inhibitors semicarbazine and aminoguanidine these results indicate that the behaviour of the beef heart enzyme towards selective inhibitors is considerably different from that of any preparations previously studied and suggest that the classification of monoamine oxidase activites into a and b types may be only of limited usefulness
291,the ability of the gut to inactivate various amines by oxidative deamination was tested with a fold purified amine oxidase preparation from dog small intestine of amines tested putrescine benzylamine cadaverine and serotonin were the most favourable substrates histamine was inactivated rapidly by this enzyme preparation too histamine derivatives methylated at the imidazole nucleus were also deaminated whereas nalphamethylhistamine was only a poor substrate and nalpha nalphadimethylhistamine was not a substrate at all using a second procedure for the purification of amine oxidases from gut the separation of a soluble monoamine oxidase from diamine oxidase was achieved by gel filtration on sephadex g the diamine oxidase deaminated putrescine km x m and histamine km x m but not serotonin and was inhibited by AMG but not by pargyline the soluble monoamine oxidase inactivated serotonin km x m but not histamine and putrescine and was inhibited by pargyline but not by aminoguanidine it was concluded that in dog small intestine as well as in rabbit small intestine only diamine oxidase was capable of inactivating histamine by oxidative deamination
292,transient extracellular ph changes accompany the exchange of chloride for sulfate across the erythrocyte membrane the direction of the extracellular ph change during chloride efflux and sulfate influx depends on experimental conditions when bicarbonate is present the extracellular ph drops sharply at the outset of the anion exchange and tends to follow the partial ionic equilibrium described by wilbrandt w wilbrandt pfluegers arch when bicarbonate is absent however the anion exchange causes the ph to rise indicating that protons are cotransported with sulfate during chloridesulfate exchange the ph rise can be reversed by the addition of hco mum or dinitrophenol mum this demonstrates that the protonsulfate cotransport can drive proton transport uphill the stoichiometry of the transport is that one chloride exchanges for one sulfate plus one proton these results support the titratable carrier model proposed by gunn gunn rb in oxygen affinity of hemoglobin and red cell acidbase status m rorth and p astrup editors p munksgaard copenhagen for EM AE
293,a simple nonaseptic lowcast process for the conversion of cassava a starchy tropical root crop into microbial protein for use as animal feed was sought screening tests culminated in the isolation of a thermotolerant amylaseproducing mold designated i which was identified as aspergillus fumigatus the optimum ph for protein synthesis was but the optimum temperature was less than the desired temperature larger than or equal to c required for a nonaseptic fermentation a fumigatus i and its asporogenous mutant ia grew equally well in a medium prepared from whole cassava roots with a mean protein doubling time at c and ph of h in batch culture approximately carbohydrate supplied as whole cassava could be feremented in h giving a final yield of g of dry product containing CP per liter the conversion of carbohydrate used to crude protein was when determined as amino acids the protein content of the product which contained cassava bark and other unfermented residues was with urea as the nitrogen source no ph control was necessary preliminary data indicated that medium prepared from whole cassava roots was GABA to the mold unless the cassava pulp was heated to c immediately after being ground heating to c was required to gelatinize the starch and permit its complete utilization
294,the in situ absorption from the rat small intestine of the weakly acidic drug warfarin pka at mug ml in the instilled fluid with initial ph levels of or has been examined these initial phs in the buffer changed rapidly towards neutrality the buffers at phs and probably caused different amounts of warfarin precipitation which resulted in different rates of warfarin disappearance from the instilled fluid which paralleled the initial rates of accumulation of warfarin in or on the intestinal wall where greater drug precipitation had probably occurred the initial rates of absorption into the plasma were slower at the initial ph of and by CMS of warfarin with propylene glycol the rate of absorption was similar to that from a fluid of ph propylene glycol in solution did not affect the system significantly the relatively high transfer of warfarin into octanol from buffer solution at ph might indicate that the small fraction of unionized drug at ph is enough for remarkable transfer of this highly lipidsoluble drug
295,congenital heart malformations in neonates infants and young children represent the main problem of paediatric cardiology in poland congenital cardiovascular diseases incidence also approximately per in liveborn infants cause very high mortality particularly in the neonatal and infantile period approximately liveborn children are affected every year by serious heart malformations for at least two thirds of these previously hopelessly ill infants there are real possibilities of effective medical and surgical treatment not only a considerable drop in mortality in the earliest infancy would be achieved but a further normal PCS and psychical growth and development of these children would be possible at present however the available possibilities are by far not sufficient as in all hitherto functioning centres we were able to manage children yearly whereas the real needs are at leasttenfold greater therefore it is necessary to increase the number and capacity of hospital wards capable enough to provide the intensive CP care to execute AGA reorganization aimed to concentrating the appropriate specialists pediatric cardiologists radiologists surgeons anesthesiologists nurses and equipment cardiological and cardiosurgical appliances xray equipment intensive care units etc in centres designated for the above tasks at least paediatric intensive care and cardiosurgical centres should be instituted in poland for a satisfactory management of congenital heart diseases
296,significant alterations in heart carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are present h T3 intravenous injection of alloxan mgkg in rats it has been suggested that uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the alloxanized rat heart in vivo whereas normal oxidative metabolism has been demonstrated in alloxandiabetic rat hearts perfused in vitro under conditions of adequate oxygen delivery we examined the hypothesis that highenergy phosphate metabolism might be adversely affected in the alloxandiabetic rat heart in vivo phosphocreatine and atp were reduced by and respectively p is less than also oxygendissociation curves were shifted to the left by mmhg and the rate of oxygen PR from blood was reduced by p is less than insulin administration normalized heart highenergy phosphate EDC atp production was accelerated in diabetic NF perfused in vitro with a welloxygenated buffer these studies support the hypothesis that oxidative atp production in the alloxandiabetic rat HR is reduced and suggest that decreased oxygen delivery may have a regulatory role in the oxidative metabolism of the diabetic rat heart
297,certain conclusions may be drawn from the present review and presentation of new data concerning the unilaterally cryptorchid patient and possible subfertility the truly undescended testisnot the retractile testis of infancywill not descend spontaneously T3 year of age the seminal quality of the unilaterally cryptorchid patient is definitely impaired although not rendered infertile in a great majority of patients irrespective of the time of surgery the dystopic position of the maldescended testis appears to superimpose a second insult on what very likely may be an inherent abnormality in the cryptorchid testis the latter accounting perhaps for its abnormal extrascrotal position orchiopexy before the age of seems advisable to ensure minimal histologic changes that may be secondary to the testis increased exposure to elevated extrascrotal temperature the cryptorchid testis will be smaller in size irrespective of surgery and usually correlates with significant testicular pathology basal levels of gonadotropins especially folliclestimulating hormone are likely to be elevated but this does not necessarily imply overwhelming testicular damage androgen production should not be affected surgical correction is advised when human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation fails to produce teticular descent thereby defining the maldescended testis as not merely retractile but truly crytorchid
298,fifty healthy mothers with normal placental CF were anaesthetised with ketamine for caesarean section anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide oxygen muscle relaxants and controlled ventilation surgery was conducted in the lateral tilt position arterial blood samples were drawn from the mothers and from the vessels of a double clamped section of umbilical cord for bloodgas analysis results obtained were compared with those of a previous series anaesthetised with thiopentone nitrous oxide oxygen and muscle relaxants eight infants were clinically depressed judged on the basis of their modified apgar score T2 after delivery the average time to sustained QO2 tsr was seconds the mean maternal ph and base excess values in the ketamine group were significantly greather than those reported T3 thiopentone anaesthesia mean uv and ua ph levels were also significantly higher after ketamine in contrast the average fetal base excess values did not differ from those obtained previously with thiopentone the mean mauv and maua ph gradients were and ph units greater respectively in the ketamine group compared to the thiopentone p less than the average uvua po gradient was mmhg less T3 ketamine anaesthesia p less than a significant inverse correlation was observed relating the id interval to the ma and ua ph values maternal arterial BD values appeared to increase with delay in delivering the fetus prolongation of the uterine incision to delivery ud interval was associated with a decrease in ua ph and BE values maua ph and base excess gradients increased with lengthening of the ud interval no convincing evidence of awareness during anaesthesia was found during the study five patients appeared to be hallucinated in the immediate postanaesthetic period unpleasant dreams were reported in instances in this T0 ketamine appeared to be unassociated with significant PSA asphyxia but may have been responsible for some element of drug induced neonatal depression in view of our own experience and that of other workers it is suggested that ketamine induction for caesarean section should be reevaluated using a lower dose of the drug
299,illumination of cell envelope LDV from h halobium causes the development of protonmotive force and energizes the uphill transport of glu although the uncoupler ptrifluoromethoxycarbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone fccp and the membranepermeant cation triphenylmethylphosphonium tpmp are inhibitory to the effect of CS the time course and kinetics of the production of the energized state for transport and its rate of decay after illumination are inconsistent with the idea that glutamate accumulation is driven directly by the protonmotive force similarities between the lightinduced transport and the nagradientinduced transport of glu in these vesicles suggest that the energized state for the amino acid uptake in both cases consists of a transmembrane na gradient naoutnain greater than rapid efflux of na from the env LDV is induced by illumination fccp and tpmp inhibit the lightinduced efflux of na but accelerate the postillumination relaxation of the na gradient created suggesting electrogenic antiport of na with another cation or electrogenic symport with an anion the lightinduced protonmotive force in the h halobium cell envelope LDV is thus coupled to na efflux and thereby indirectly to glu uptake as well
300,perfusion of the rat liver in situ for min provides for maintaining optimal values of acidbase balance for the following indexes surplus of bases content of standard bicarbonate buffer bases ph po pco hbo the level of bile secretion content of lactate Pyr atp adp that evidences for a high PET activity in the tissue introduction of dinitroorthocresol dnc into the perfusion liquid causes development of acidosis dnc results in dissociation of oxidative phosphorylation the content of atp and intensity of inorganic phosphorus utilization decrease oxygen uptake intensifies a compensatory increase in the glycolysis intensity directed to maintaining the level of macroergs under these conditions is is pronounced in the intensified uptake of glucose in a rise in the content of lactate in perfusate and an increase in the pyruvate kinase activity in the liver the redox state of nadpairs ratio of nad nadn calculated from the content of redox metabolites and the equilibrium constant for the lactate dehydrogenase system shifts toward an increase in the reducing properties of hepatocytes cytoplasm the phosphate potential value calculated from the ratio atp adp pinor lowers under conditions of the experiment
301,a rapid change in length of cat papillary muscle induces two reciprocal diastolic and systolic processes stretching causes a viscoelastic relaxation of the muscle the opposite behavior is observed after abrupt releases when subsequent to an increase in resting tension diastolic force attains its new equilibrium the stretchinduced process of relaxation is accompanied by a transient decrease in mechanogram amplitudes a PR is accordingly followed by a temporary increase in ISO muscle performance the mechanograms of the Css prove to be the function of the degree of stretch or release whereas muscle contractions in the early phase of stress relaxation depend on the contractile state before the change in length all interventions which augment developed tension increased calcium decreased potassium increased or decreased sodium concentrations strontium postextrasystolic potentiation sympathicomimetic agents frequency potentiation diminish the transient phenomena due to stretch whereas VLF or a lesser intensity of electromechanical coupling hexobarbital iproveratril desoxycorticosteron ryanodine increases them a decrease of bath temperature enhances the transient increase in force due to a PR or an initial reduction of isometric tension T3 a sudden stretch although the absolute forces increase no substantial changes could be observed in reserpinized cats with betablocking agents or under hypoxia it is supposed that alterations in the time course of the action potential could be related to poststretch and postrelease systolic phenomena a final interpretation of mechanical and electrical events T3 stretch and release is not possible with the methods used in these experiments
302,the kinetics of protein fluorescence change exhibited by adp or orthophosphate addition to the mgor mnactivated unadenylylated glutamine synthetase from escherichia coli were studied the kinetic patterns of these reactions are incompatible with a simple bimolecular binding process and a mechanism which required protein isomerization prior to substrate binding they are consistent with a mechanism in which direct substrate binding is followed by a substrateinduced conformational change step es in equilibrium es at ph and degrees c the association constants for the direct binding k of adp to mne and of pi to mneadp are x and x m respectively the association constant for the direct binding of adp to mnepi is x m at ph and degrees c the deltag degrees for the substrateinduced conformational step are and kcal mol due to adp IB to mnepi and mne respectively and kcal mol due to pi binding to mneadp rate constants k and k for the isomerization step are and s for adp binding to mne and s for adp binding to mnepi and and s for pi binding to mneadp due to low ATP affinity the association constant for direct pi binding to mne was roughly estimated to be m and k s k s at degrees c and ph the estimated association constants for the direct adp IB to mge and mge pi are x and x m respectively and the rate constants for the isomerization step associated with the corresponding reaction are k s k s and k s k s from the kinetic analysis it is evident that the inability of mn to support biosynthetic activity of the unadenylylated enzyme is due to the slow rate of adp PR from the mnepiadp complex in contrast the large k obtained for adp PR from the mgeadp or mgepiadp complex indicates that this step is not rate limiting in the biosynthesis of glutamine since the k catalysis obtained under the same conditions is s
303,at the surface of aggregating cells of the slime mould dictyostelium discoideum two different sites interacting with extracellular camp are detectable IB CS and cyclnucleotide phosphodiesterase both CS are developmentally regulated an adequate stimulus for the chemoreceptor system in d discoideum is the change of camp concentration in time rather than concentration per se longterm IB of camp causes only shortterm response the system is consequently adapted to the recognition of pulses rather than to steadystate concentrations of camp the cells are nevertheless able to sense stationary spatial gradients and to respond to them by chemotactic orientation the possibility is discussed that they do so by transforming spatial concentration changes into temporal ones using extending pseudopods as sensors the camp recognition system is part of a molecular network involved in the generation of spatiotemporal patterns of cellular activities this system controls the periodic formation of chemotactic signals and their propagation from cell to cell the phosphodiesterase limits the duration of the camp pulses and thus sharply separates the periods of signalling the binding sites at the cell surface are supposed to be the chemoreceptors the control of cellular activities via camp receptors can be studied with biochemical techniques with cell suspensions in which spatial inhomogeneities are suppressed by intense stirring whereas the temporal aspect of the spatiotemporal DP is preserved under these conditions it can be shown that the extracellular camp concentration changes periodically and that the phase of the cellular FEO can be shifted by external pulses of camp it can also be shown that small camp pulses induce a high SO of camp which demonstrates signal amplification a CF necessary for a cellular relay system
304,the sensitivity and specificity of each of five esophageal tests used in the diagnosis of RE were compared with those of six combinations of two tests one indicating esophagitis and the other indicating sphincter incompetence the esophageal tests were performed in patients with reflux symptoms CP and esophagitis without reflux PS control data were obtained from normal subjects negative control and DU positive control the results indicate that the acid infusion test and esophageal biopsy combined with esophageal ph study after hc have similar sensitivity and greater specificity than any test alone in normal subjects the cumulative incidence of abnormalities with esophageal tests alone was but with combinations of two tests it was only the use of criteria simultaneous esophagitis and sphincter incompetence which establish the diagnosis of reflux esophagitis helps to resolve conflicting results obtained with single tests the most sensitive and specific test combination for the diagnosis of reflux esophagitis appears to be esophageal biopsy with esophageal ph T0 after hc
305,in order to study the relationship between aromatization estrogen biosynthesis and betahydroxylation the effects of a variety of AF on these processes were evaluated using the c ATP estrenedione it was found that carbon monoxide su amphenone b potassium cyanide androstenedione and ADD inhibited the above transformations significantly and to varying degrees however within a given experiment the inhibition of each process was similar skfa did not inhibit either transformation in addition phosphate tris and barbital buffers as well as ph changes from to had no stimulatory or inhibitory effect on the production of estrogen and betahydroxy compounds in contrast several inhibitors affected the aromatization of c and c steroids differently these include carbon monoxide su and amphenone b when a mixture of betahiestrenedione and cnortestosterone were incubated together the former was preferentially converted to estrogen this preference for the keto steroidal form mimics results observed for c substrates we conclude that while estrogen biosynthesis and betahydroxylation appear to be mediated by the same enzyme system the same conclusion cannot be drawn for the aromatization of c and c substrates
306,a double blind betweengroups trial was carried out to compare the effectiveness of the new benzodiazepine compound bromazepam lexotan ro as an antianxiety compound with that of diazepan the fiftyeight psychoneurotic inpatients admitted to the trial were divided into two groups obsessives and neurotics in order to assess any specific action of the drug assessment was made by means of bprs of overall and gorham rsas of hamilton prs of wittenborn and imps of lorr the results showed that bromazepam has a GA therapeutic effectiveness though not always as great as that of diazepam as an antianxiety agent while no difference in the effects of the two drugs was found between the two psychopathologic groups with both treatments the obsessives responded less than the neurotics detailed evaluation of the individual items of the imps showed that bromazepam is likely to exert a disinhibiting or activating action unlike most other benzodiazepines in clinical use
307,illumination of envelope vesicles prepared from halobacterium halobium cells causes translocation of protons from inside to outside due to the lightinduced cycling of bacteriorhodopsin this process results in a ph gradient across the membranes an electrical potential and the movements of k and na the electrical potential was estimated by following the fluorescence of a cyanine dye dipentyloxadicarbocyanine illumination of h halobium LDV resulted in a rapid reversible decrease of the dye fluorescence by as much as this effect was not seen in nonvesicular patches of purple membrane observation of maximal fluorescence decreases upon ilumination of vesicles required an optimal dyemembrane protein ratio the ph optimum for the lightinduced fluorescence decrease was the decrease was linear with actinic light intensity up to about x ergs cn s valinomycin gramicidin and triphenylmethylphosphonium ion all abolished the fluorescence changes however the lightinduced ph change was enhanced by these agents conversely buffered vesicles showed no ph NC but gave the same or larger fluorescence changes thus we have identified the fluorescence decrease with a lightinduced membrane potential inside negative by using valinomycinkinduced membrane potentials we calibrated the fluorescence decrease with calculated nernst diffusion potentials we found a linear dependence between potential and fluorescence decrease of mv up to mv when the envelope vesicles were illuminated the total protonmotive force generated was dependent on the presence of na and k and their concentration gradients across the membrane in general k appeared to be more permeable than na and thus permitted development of greater ph gradients and lower electrical potentials by calculating the total protonmotive force from the sum of the ph and potential terms we found that the LDV can produce protonmotive forces near mv
308,the specificity of lactoperoxidasecatalyzed iodination for the proteins of the hepatoma tissue culture cell plasma membrane was examined by histochemical PSA and cell fractionation techniques CS microscope ARG of sectioned cells shows the incorporated label to be localized primarily at the periphery of the cell most of this label can be released from the cell by trypsin but not by MMP-8 or hyaluronidase the label is recovered from the cells as either MIT or DIT T3 hydrolysis of CE with a mixture of proteolytic enzymes the label copurifies during cell fractionation with an authentic CL cell plasma membrane marker enzyme nucleotidase thus the incorporated iodide is itself a valid marker for those membrane polypeptides having tyrosine residues accessible to the lactoperoxidase the polypeptide complexity of the purified plasma membrane was examined by high resolution dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at least polypeptides in the membrane are accessible to iodination these polypeptides probably represent the bulk of the protein mass of the membrane and iodinating them does not affect cell viability growth rate or cell CF labeling experiments with fucose and glucosamine show that at least nine of the iodinated MMP may be glycoproteins
309,the factors involved in the movement of monovalent cations across the inner membrane of the isolate HR mitochondrion are reviewed the evidence suggests that the energydependent uptake of k and na which results in swelling of the matrix is an electrophoretic response to a negative internal potential there are no clear cut indications that this electrophoretic cation movement is carriermediated and possible modes of entry which do not require a carrier are examined the evidence also suggests that the monovalent cation for proton exchanger na greater than k present in the membrane may participate in the energydependent extrusion of accumulated ions the two processes electrophoreti c cation uptake swelling and exchangedependent cation extrusion contraction may represent a means of controlling the volume of the mitochondrion within the SF-36 cell a number of indications point to the possibility that the volume control process may be mediated by the divalent cations ca and mg studies with mercurial reagents also implicate certain membrane thiol groups in the postulated volume control process
310,methods have been devised to harvest megakaryocytes from guinea pig FA marrow and to isolate them in high yield when marrow tissue was disaggregated the megakaryocytes underwent degenerative changes characterized by the loss of cytoplasmic granules and alterations in membrane topography similar to the changes seen in aggregating platelets these morphologic changes were interpreted to mean that megakaryocytes possessed functional attributes of platelets the use of agents which inhibit platelt aggregation sodium citrate m adenosine and x m theophylline in a medium free of bivalent cations prevented these changes this solution resulted in both an excellent morphologic preservation and a significantly increased recovery of megakaryocytes from marrow tissue a twostep purification of the IN megakaryocytes was carried out on the basis of their low density and C1 size with equilibrium density gradient centrifugation followed by velocity sedimentation this sequence gave approximately a fold enrichment of megakaryocytes significantly better than that achieved with either method alone these techniques for harvesting and concentrating megakaryocytes make it possible for the first time to study megakaryocytes in vitro
311,desensitization of kitten atria with mum isoprenaline resulted in a fold and fold increase in the ecs of isoprenaline for its positive chronotropic effects sinus pacemakers and positive inotropic effects left atria respectively but only in a fold increase of the ec of isoprenaline for aca stimulation in membrane particles from atria however maximum cyclase stimulation by isoprenaline was decreased to in membranes from isoprenalinetreated atria whereas maximum increases in rate of sinus pacemakers and force of LA were unchanged and reduced by respectively the high affinity betaadrenoceptor blocker bupranolol antagonized the adenylyl cyclase stimulation by isoprenaline to similar extent in membranes from isoprenaline and UT atria suggesting that the apparent affinity of betaadrenoceptors for ligands is unchanged by desensitization the evidence is compatible with the concept that desensitization is associated with decreased availability of receptors and with the view that near maximal positive chronotropic effects of catecholamines may be caused by only threshold increases in membrane adenylyl cyclase activity
312,addition of dimethylsulfoxide at concentrations of and volvol to cells of mouse neuroblastoma clone nie in the confluent phase of growth resulted in the production of morphologically differentiated cultures with extensive process formation cell maintained in dimethylsulfoxide remained in a stable nondividing condition for periods of up to weeks a high degree of electrical excitability was found in these cells but there was no clear correlation of this property with the level of induction of either acetylcholinesterase acetylcholine hydrolase ec or tyrosine hydroxylase ltyrosine tetrahydropteridineoxygen oxidoreductase hydroxylating ec in addition intracellular C2 of cyclic amp were not elevated in fully morphologically and electrically differentiated cells while cell division was markedly inhibited by or higher concentrations of dimethylsulfoxide at growth continued at a somewhat slowed rate and such cultures exhibited enhanced process formation and EA for a relatively short period high concentrations or of dimethylsulfoxide totally suppressed process formation and did not result in increased excitability but cells maintained high resting potentials the results suggest that the development of the excitable membrane in Neuro-2a may be expressed independently of neurospecific enzyme induction and does not require a sustained elevation of cyclic amp levels
313,in this report we describe a new method which is useful for measuring hydrophobic interactions between aliphatic hydrocarbon chains and proteins in AQ environment the method is based on partition of proteins in an aqueous twophase system containing dextran and polyethylene glycol and different fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol the partition is measured under conditions where contributions from electrostatic interactions are eliminated the difference in partition of proteins in phase systems with and without hyrocarbon groups bound to polyethylene glycol deltalog k where k is the partition coefficient is taken as a measure of hydrophobic interaction deltalog k varies with size of hydrocarbon chain and type of protein the length of the aliphatic chain should be greater than carbon atoms in order to get a measurable effect in terms of deltalog k bovine serum Al betalactoglobulin hemoglobin and myoglobin have been shown to have different affinities for palmitic acid ester of polyethylene glycol no hydrophobic effect could be observed for ovalbumin cytochrome c or alphachymotrypsinogen a
314,the unilateral transection of nigro striatal dopaminergic axons produced a short lasting min increase in the affinity of striatal tyrosine monooxygenase th for a synthetic pteridine cofactor dmph the kinetic changes of striatal th were paralleled by an increase of striatal camp content apomorphine mgkg ip failed to block the activation of th by cerebral hemisection haloperidol mgkg ip and reserpine mgkg ip also elicited a sudden and similar change in striatal th activity but this response occurred without an increase in the camp content and lasted for longer than hrs if the hemisection of nigrostriatal pathway was performed after haloperidol or reserpine injection the activation of th produced by these two drugs was reversed rapidly about minutes pretreatment with haloperidol or reserpine prevented the increase of striatal camp following CBF hemisection moreover haloperidol injected min T3 CBF hemisection failed to change the th kinetic properties in the striatum ipsilateral to the lesion but it changed striatal th in the side contralateral to the lesion these results suggest that the increase in the affinity of striatal th for the pteridine cofactor elicited by CBF hemisection is not related to a lack of stimulation of da autoreceptors moreover these experiments provide an evidence that postsynaptic dopamine receptors play a role in the activation of striatal th elicited by haloperidol
315,deltabetahydroxysteroid oxidoreductase was extracted in magnesiumcontaining tris buffer from sonicated streptomyces griseocarneus cells the enzyme was partially purified x by ion exchange chromatography and GF following nhso fractionation upon gel filtration on sephadex g to g the greatest part of the activity gave a peak in the fractionation range the enzyme obtained from the gel yielded small enzyme molecules on repeated chromatography a molecular weight of to was calculated for the activity appearing in the fractionation range of sephadex g to g the enzyme is highly specific for the irreversible oxidation of the betahydroxyl group in CS with a transanellated a b ring system with either c or c double bond deltaketosteroids are converted into deltaketosteroids at a high rate but the isomerase activity cannot be separated from the oxidoreductase activity either by chromatography or by selective heat inactivation nad nadp fmn or fad did not influence the activity but the enzyme is inactive in the absence of molecular oxygen
316,passive redistributions of mg and k ions across the thylakoid membranes occurring in association with the lightdriven electrogenic influx of hydrogen ions have been examined in suspensions of broken spinach chloroplasts under a variety of conditions i in accord with results of hind el al proc natl acad sci us it was found that at a low kmg concentration ratio in the medium the kefflux is negligibly small whereas a substantial mgefflux is observed the converse is true when the kmg concentration ratio in the medium is high ii in the presence of a which was found to cause approximately a inhibition of the lightinduced phgradient a significant influx of mg was observed in the light at a high kmg concentration ratio conversely the mginflux was small in the presence of a when the kmg concentration ratio in the medium was low under these conditions the mginflux was considerably increased upon the addition of valinomycin a was found not to affect the kefflux in the CS iii the lightinduced kinflux observed in the presence of nigericin also was found to be dependent on the concentration ratio of the monovalent and divalent cation its magnitude increased upon an increase in the kmg ratio the results are interpreted in terms of a simplified MM in which the total passive efflux of cations driven by the potential set by the electrogenic proton pump is considered to be a constant fraction of the proton influx according to this an increase in the flux of an ion species induced either by raising its concentration or by increasing its permeability through the membrane will cause a decrease in the flux of the other cations the relevance of the results is discussed with respect to conclusions about the involvement and relative magnitudes of the passive k and mg effluxes across the thylakoid membrane during energization of intact chloroplasts and chloroplasts in situ
317,the ph optimum was the same in canine tissue for cardiac and skeletal muscle myosin when S1 was G1 by monovalent cations the ph optimum was while activation of S1 by divalent cations gave a ph optimum of protons were needed for divalent cation activation of myosin with changes in ph there were concomitant changes in the EC50 of enzyme for ATP s such that with a decrease in ph there was an elevation in k or nh activated myosins EC50 for adenosine triphosphate atp and at the same time a decrease in vmax values of S1 the converse was true with the divalent cations ca and mn here with a decrease in ph there was a concomitant decrease in apparent affinity of myosin for atp and at the same time an increase in the enzymatic vmax values it appeared that hydrogen ions affected the apparent affinity of myosin for substrate and this in turn affected the ratelimiting step in atpase reaction addition of monovalent cations to the divalent cation activating system lowered the activity of myosin and the converse was true divalent cations lowered the activity of myosin when activated by monovalent ones in a monovalent cation activating system
318,gammaglutamyl transpeptidase gammagt an enzyme possibly involved in amino acid transport was investigated in rat small intestine using the synthetic substrate lgammaglutamylpnitroanilide enzyme localization and characteristics were correlated with features of amino acid uptake gammagt activity copurified with sucrase and alkaline phosphatase activity was maximal at ph and was stimulated by monovalent cations the relative specificity of the gammagt reaction with diglycine and eight essential amino acids as substrates correlated well with the rate of intestinal absorption of this dipeptide and these amino acids as observed by others gammagt activity was fold greater in the jejunum than in the ileum again in agreement with relative rates of CAA absorption along the length of rat intestine the TPS activity of gammagt in villus tip cells was times greater than in crypt cells and amino acid uptake was to times greater with villus tip than with crypt cells bromosulfophthalein a noncompetitive inhibitor of gammagt inhibited amino acid uptake these studies support the concept that membrane gammagt may be involved in amino acid and dipeptide uptake and indicate that further investigation of such involvement may be conveniently pursued using mammalian small bowel
319,the effects of hyamine triton x nadeoxycholate acetic acid and hypertonic kcl and mgcl as well as freezing and thawing and sonication were studied on the solubilization of acrosin from washed bull spermatozoa from hyaminepretreated spermatozoa devoid of cell and outer acrosome membrane and of acrosomal material and from isolated acrosomal caps and vesicles concurrent ultrastructural changes were observed hyamine triton kcl and acetic acid effectively solubilized acrosin from whole spermatozoa but mgcl had a poor effect the outer acrosome membrane and acrosomal material extracted by hyamine contained about of the total acrosin activity and three quarters of it was soluble the rest of acrosin situated in the innter acrosome membrane or equatorial segment was best extracted by hypertonic kcl and mgcl but the detergents were ineffective in this case indicating that acrosin is bound differently to the outer and inner parts of acrosome the opposite effect of mgcl on the acrosin MICs extracted from these two parts could even be a suggestion of multiple forms of acrosin the increase of the total acrosin activity during the hyamine treatment indicates that acrosin is partly in an inactive form due either to steric hindrance inhibitor complex of existence of a proacrosin
320,a pneumococcal mutant sulrc resistant to sulfonamides and three transformants bearing associated d or d resistance markers have earlier been reported to be unstable and show distinct patterns and frequencies of segregating SD progeny lacking the c marker each of the four strains showed a characteristic dosage of the genes involved in the merodiploidy complementary strands of dnas from these stable and unstable strains were resolved and homoduplex and heteroduplex hybrids made from the separated dna strands were used as donors in genetic transformations activities of a normal marker streptomycin resistance and those involved in the heterozygosity c d and d were quantitatively measured from those heteroduplexes made up of opposite strands derived from a heterozygote and a stable CS the normal marker is transferred efficiently but the heterozygous markers are not on the other hand if both strands of a heteroduplex are derived from different heterozygotic strains all markers can be transferred with usual efficiency to a stable recipient strain the lowered efficiency in the former type of heteroduplex is attributed to an inhomology resulting from a tandem duplication in the merodiploid strains and a postulated dna repair process stimulated by it while in the form of the donor duplex the inhomology probably includes a a microheterogeneity between the c site and the wild type locus and b a more extensive incompatibility attributable to an extra segment of genome in a tandem duplication covering the c and d sites the first of these inhomologies produces a lowered efficiency of transfer from all configurations of the particular d S2 associated with the mutant c marker and therefore accounts for the characteristic transfer patterns even from the native merodiploid dnas
321,seventyfour strains of venezuelan encephalitis ve virus recovered from sentinel hamsters or mosquitoes at enzootic habitats in guatemala in the two years following the epidemicequine epizootic were examined for ability to produce small plaques in vero african green monkey kidney cell cultures like isolates obtained during the epizootic a one strain recovered from a sentinel hamster in late october at an enzootic habitat near the epicenter of the hemagglutinationinhibition hi and equinevirulence properties like epizootic virus this strain retained its small plaque characteristic after inoculation and recovery from bloods of three horses b none of the other strains produced uniformly small plaques but formed a few small plaques among large ones virions from small plaques of five strains were cloned twice in vero cell cultures four clones produced uniformly small plaques T3 one more passage in vero cells three had hemagglutinationph properties compatible with epizootic virus or intermediate between epizootic and enzootic virus but hi tests with these three hemagglutinins or with antibody to the fourth cloned CS showed them to be like central american enzootic virus one of three cloned strains tested in horses produced encephalitis and death in one of four horses another strain produced encephalitis with recovery in one of two horses c thus these small vero plaque clones resembled central american enzootic strains of ve virus in hi and equinevirulence tests and the small vero plaque characteristic was not a satisfactory marker for consistently isolating equinevirulent epizootic ve virions nevertheless this technic led to recognition of one epizootic CS isolated at an enzootic habitat in guatemala at the end of outbreak whether this strain was there before the outbreak or subsequently penetrated the habitat is uncertain during the next two years this strain did not become dominant in that enzootic focus
322,extracts of dormant microcysts of polysphondylium pallidum demonstrate ph optima for the hydrolysis of casein at and during germination the intracellular ph caseinolytic TPS activity does not change significantly the ph protease is also active on azoalbumin revealing the same developmental pattern with this ATP both acid protease activities are excreted during the germination process addition of purified nonspecific protease to cultures speeds up germination suggesting that the excreted protease may play a role in removal of the microcyst wall when cycloheximide is added to cultures complete germination emergence is stopped whereas the ph protease activity still accumulates to between and of the maximum control activity although this suggests that posttranslational controls might mediate the accumulation of a portion of the ph protease increase mixing and dilution experiments with cell extracts do not reveal the differential presence of soluble activators or inhibitors of this activity at different developmental stages the presence of tightly bound enzymeinhibitor complexes for protease b in dormant microcysts has not been ruled out and is currently under study
323,levels of reduced and Ox triphosphopyridine nucleotides have been determined in reconstituted spinach chloroplasts and compared with levels in whole isolated chloroplasts during photosynthesis and darkness the ratio of nadphnadp reaches values slightly above at the beginning of photosynthesis less than half the ratio attained with whole chloroplasts nonetheless these lower ratios are sufficient to maintain high rates of photosynthetic carbon dioxide fixation and reduction which are comparable in the reconstituted chloroplasts to the rates found with whole chloroplasts as with whole chloroplasts there is a decline in the ration of nadphnadp as a CF of time of photosynthesis the effect of addition of bicarbonate mm in causing a transient drop in the ratio of nadphnadp is described and discussed in terms of the reversibility of the reduction of phosphoglycerate to triose phosphate the ratio nadphnadp can be improved by the addition of more lamellae either before or during the course of photosynthesis and this improvement in ratio is accompanied by an improved rate of co fixation or a more sustained rate of co fixation with time of photosynthesis the importance of nadphnadp ratio not only to the reduction of phosphoglycerate to triose phosphate but also to the activation of the ribulosediphosphate carboxylasemediated step is discussed
324,the oxygen dissociation curve shifted less to the RA in venous blood draining from muscle in eight insulindeficient diabetics working at a constant submaximal workload than in seven NCs mm hg vs mm hg p less than this diminution of the invivo bohr effect at the muscle tissue level during exercise in diabetics was due to a significantly smaller decrease of A-V blood ph down to vs in normals p less than probably a consequence of an latered muscle metabolism in insulin deficiency although no glucose was taken up even during exercise and less lactate was produced by insulindeficient muscle p less than the differences in venous blood ph appeared to be brought about mainly by a different co production of the exercising muscle in the two groups the response of krebs cycle activity to exercise in insulindeficient muscle might have been inadequate as suggested by the increased hydroxybutyrateacetoacetate ratio in the venous blood observed in the NCs but not in the diabetics furthermore proportionally less of the arterial ketone body concentration was utilized by the working muscle in the insulindeficient diabetics changes in erythrocyte diphosphoglycerate did not contribute to the differences in the invivo bohr effect
325,a method is described for the preparation of high purity myosin from the left ventricle of pig heart the purified S1 was free from nucleic acid actin tropomyosin troponin the molecular weight protein and other contaminants analyses of subunits in the purified myosin were carried out on acrylamide gel with sds of the total protein present in myosin was in the CS chains light chain lc and CS chain lc urea gel electrophoresis of the purified S1 showed three closely spaced bands corresponding to the dalton the chargemodified dalton and the phosphorylated dalton components the properties of the caactivated and kactivated atpases ec of the purified myosin were also studied the km values were and mum and the vmax values were and mumole pmgmin for the caactivated and kactivated atpases respectively the phactivity profiles and the effects of sh modification were of the skeletal S1 type except that the activities were lower
326,the biotin carboxyl carrier protein bccp component of escherichia coli acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase and three peptides derived from bccp by proteolytic digestion have been examined by circular dichroism spectroscopy bccp which has a peptide molecular weight of has a spectrum typical of globular proteins with negative extrema at nm and nm the two smallest peptides bccpsc and bccp with molecular weights of and respectively exhibit unusual positive cd bands centered at nm and nm bccp with a molecular weight of has a cd spectrum intermediate between bccp and that of the smallest peptides since dbiotin exhibits a positive cd band at nm it was suspected that the biotin prosthetic group might be the chromophore responsible for the nm cd band seen in bccpsc and bccp enzymatic carboxylation of bccpsc to form cobccpsc caused the cd spectrum to change with a shift of the nm band to nm the positive cd band at nm was unaffected by carboxylation of the biotin prosthetic group these date suggest that the nm signal may be due either to the biotin which acts as a chromophore directly or to a chromophore that is perturbed by the carboxylation of biotin a spectropolarimetric titration was carried out to investigate the possible contribution of the single IMT residue of bccpsc to the cd spectrum of this peptide at ph values over the cd spetrum changed with the disappearance of the nm band suggesting that tyrosine might contribute to this cd band denaturation of bccpsc or bccp with m urea of m guanidine hcl abolished the positive cd bands and resulted in spectra typical of a random coil whereas treatment of bccpsc with sodium dodecyl sulfate abolished the positive bands and left a spectrum exhibiting a shoulder at nm and a negative band at nm suggestive of a high degree of ordered structure it is concluded that the cd band at nm in bccpsc and bccp is prabably due to a noncovalent interaction of biotin with an CAA residues of the protein it is suggested that the biotin prosthetic group is partially buried in the surface of the protein rather than swinging free at the end of the lysine side chain through which it is covalently linked to the protein to permit this interaction to occur
327,copper ii ions successively induce dimers and tetramers of human serum albumin l when the cu ii concentration is extended beyond that of mum this is shown by emf titrations and by ultracentrifugation experiments the emf titrations which involve a new ph static method were performed at degrees in a m nacio medium at ph using glass and copper amalgam electrodes the total concentration of cuii varied from to mm and the ALB from to mm in order to evaluate the formula of the main complexes without using any a priori assumptions regarding their compositions a detailed graphic procedure was used the results in the form of equilibrium constants for the main species were refined by the use of a general least squares computer program the experimental data are found to be consistent with the formation of the monomeric cul cul and cul species and the dimeric cul cul cul and cul species in addition there is some indication for a minor species most probably the cul tetramer the ph static results qualitatively agree with the findings obtained by UC as indicated by distinct bands and their svalues ultracentrifugation experiments show not only monomeric and dimeric species of albumin but also tetrameric species the polymerization of the Al is reversible since diglycyllhistidine a peptide designed to mimic the cu ii transport site of Al depolymerizes the cu iialbumin polymers
328,hydrolysis of lysolecithin acyl GPC acyl gpc by preparations of phospholipase d from peanut seeds was investigated LL was hydrolyzed at a much slower rate than phosphatidylcholine lecithin although ca ions are required for the cleavage of lecithin by the enzyme their effect on the hydrolysis of lysolecithin depended upon the concentration of the ATP at mm lysolecithin ca ions increased the reaction rates whereas at concentrations of the substrate lower than mm ca ions were inhibitory a broad ph activity curve between and was obtained with higher rates in the ALP range both in the absence and presence of ca ions the increased hydrolysis of lysolecithin due to ca was noticed over the entire ph range upon storage of the enzyme solutions at c decreased rates of hydrolysis of lecithin were observed with t values of ca and days depending on the purity of the preparation during the same period no reduction occurred in the activity of these S9 on lysolecithin as substrate the effects of ca ions and the analysis of the products of acyl gpc cleavage by the enzyme preparations revealed the presence of more than one enzyme and the formation of the following EDC lysophosphatidic acids acyl glycerophosphoric acids free fatty acids glycerophosphorylcholine and choline the possible pathways leading to the Kd of lysolecithin and the formation of these products include reactions catalyzed by lysophospholipase a lysophosphatidylcholine acyl hydrolase ec and a phosphodiesterase lglycerylphosphorylcholine glycerophosphohydrolase ec in addition to phospholipase d phosphatidylcholine phosphatidohydrolase ec
329,deltaaminolaevulinic acid dehydratase catalyses the synthesis of porphobilinogen the enzyme has a molecular mass of and is composed of eight similar subunits of molecular mass the nterminal amino acid is acylated and the number of peptides found on tryptic digestion equals the number of lysine and arginine residues per mass of the eight subunits are apparently arranged at the corners of a cube and therefore have dihedral d symmetry the bovine CL enzyme which has been cystallized contains atoms of zinc per mole of enzyme the apoenzyme obtained on prolonged hydrolysis can be reactivated by the addition of zinc or cadmium ions the dialysed enzyme must be first treated with dithiothreitol there are two very active sh groups in a total of sh groups per S1 the substrate forms a schiff base with the epsilonamino group of a lysine residue reduction of the schiff base with nabh should reveal the number of active sites per mole of enzyme it appears that only four of the eight subunits form a schiff base with the substrate indicating that the enzyme exhibits the phenomenon of either halfsite reactivity or negative cooperativity the enzyme appears to have a strong subunitsubunit interaction for an immobilized preparation remained stable for at least a month an immobilized enzyme preparation was treated in a manner so that it dissociated into tetramers both the eluate and protein still attached to the sepharose on a column were enzymically active the bound enzyme could not reassociate under assay conditions but still contained about of the original enzyme activity it would seem that the enzyme is active when composed with less than eight subunits
330,the adsorption of OTC hydrochloride tetracycline hydrochloride doxycycline hyclate TAO chloramphenicol ampicillin and cloxacillin sodium was studied on various antacids namely magnesium trisilicate magnesium oxide calcium carbonate Bi oxycarbonate aluminium XTT and kaolin the adsorption of the various antibiotics by milk was also tested as milk is frequently used as an antacid charcoal was included in the present T0 as a MM adsorbent having a C1 hydrophobic surface the adsorption of the various antibiotics on the different antacids and other adsorbents in most cases obeyed the freundlich adsorption isotherm magnesium trisilicate and magnesium oxide showed the highest adsorptive capacity relative to other antacids used for most antibiotics calcium carbonate and Al hydroxide and intermediate power while kaolin and Bi oxycarbonate had the least adsorptive power charcoal exhibited a marked adsorption for all antibiotics tested tetracyclines were found to be more highly adsorbed than other antibiotics studied triacetyloleandomycin and chloramphenicol had intermediate values ampicillin was only adsorbed to a slight extent while cloxacillin was not adsorbed on the antacids used the extent of adsorption was correlated to the structure of both the adsorbent and adsorbate the ph of the adsorbent suspension and to the polarity of the antibiotic in such ph the reversibility of the adsorption process was studied in different media and at ph values similar to those of the gastrointestinal tract the extent of elution was found to be inversely proportional to the adsorptive capacity of the different adsorbents in general n nahco solution was found to possess higher eluting properties than n hcl an exception to this pattern was observed with tetracyclines adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide where the elution with acid resulted in a higher degree of desorption careful in vitro and in vivo testing of drug availability is advisable prior to the concomitant administration of antibiotics with antacids or other adsorbents
331,ph and temperature conformation transitions in the active center of penicillin amidase ie penicillinamidohydrolase ec iii were investigated by means of the kinetic method and a new US method it was shown that the catalytic activity of the enzyme was controlled by ionogenic groups with pk and the study of penicillinamidase by means of the ultrasonic method showed that the ionogenic group with pk was responsible for maintaining the catalytically AS conformation of the enzyme active center investigation of the temperature relation between the kinetic parameters of the enzymatic hydrolysis of benzylpenicillin catalyzed by penicillin amidase and the data on the effect of ultrasound on the enzyme showed that the enzyme was subjected to the temperature conformation transiton the temperature and thermodynamic parameters of the conformation transition were determinded t degrees k delta h kcalmole and delta s eu the structure of the active center of the enzyme is discussed on the basis of the data obtained
332,diurnal cycles in physical parameters in the environment modulate biochemical and physiological circadian rhythms in experimental animals including cycles in the sensitivity to external influences environmental lighting synchronizes cycles of indole metabolism and melatonin synthesis in the rat pineal gland by modulating the activity of postganglionic sympathetic SN as a consequence the sensitivity of pineal nacetyltransferase to stimulation by isoproterenol or by dibutyryl cyclic amp varies diurnally also the capacity of actinomycin d to inhibit this induction varies with circadian periodicity the cycles in sensitivity to isoproterenol reflect cycles in the system that regulates cAMP production and include R2 in the availability of specific badrenergic IB sites and in the sensitivity of receptorcoupled adenylate cyclase to catecholamines further a variation in the response to dibutyryl cAMP indicates in addition the participation of intracellular controls in the regulation of the sensitivity of nacetyltransferase to catecholamines the varying sensitivity to actinomycin d suggests a changing requirement for the synthesis of rna as a function of prior environmental lighting conditions the basic nature of these sensitivity changes suggests that diurnal cycles of environmental lighting may similarly affect other systems
333,we have investigated the energydependent uptake of ca by rat liver mitochondria with succinate as respiratory substrate with rotenone added to block nadlinked electron transport in the presence of hydroxybutyric or other permeant monocarboxylic acids ca was taken up to extents approaching those seen in the presence of phosphate the quantitative relationship between cation and anion uptake was determined from the Mw of a plot of hydroxybutyrate uptake against ca uptake a method which allowed determination of the stoichiometry without requiring ambiguous corrections for early nonenergized or nonstoichiometric binding events this procedure showed that molecules of hydroxtbutyrate were accumulated with each ca ion under these conditions close to ca ions and molecules of hydroxybutyrate were accumulated per pair of electrons per energyconserving site of the respiratory chain since hydroxybutyrate must be protonated to pass the membrane as the undissociated free acid it is concluded that protons were ejected and subsequently reabsorbed per pair of electrons per energyconserving site in contrast to the value postulated by the chemiosmotic hypothesis
334,an alphalfucosidase had been purified approximately fold from the CL hepatopancreas of the marine mollusc chamelea gallina l venus gallina l during the different steps of the purification procedure it was difficult to remove the contaminant nacetylglucosaminidase activity but after electrofocusing a final preparation free of this and other glycosidades present in the crude extract was obtained the purified enzyme has a broad specificity it hydrolyzes pnitrophenyl alphalfucoside and natural substrates such as oligosaccharides containing fucosidic residues with alpha alpha and alpha linkages also it hydrolyzes fucosecontaining glycopeptides such as thyroglobulin glycopeptide and glycoproteins as procine submaxillary mucin previously rendered free of sialic acid the enzyme has a ph optimum of with a km of x m using pnitrophenyl lfucoside as substrate it is inhibited by hg and some sugars and activated by cn zn ca and edta it shows two peaks by isoelectric focusing at and the molecular weight of the alphalfucosidase by gel filtration was over
335,the analgesic and antiinflammatory efficacy and adverse effects of benorylate were studied over a period of months in patients suffering from definite or classical rheumatoid ICA the average dose used was g daily and examinations were made before treatment and at regular intervals during treatment to assess the clinical status of the patient tolerance to the drug and any effect on blood liver or renal function benorylate had a satisfactory effect in patients additional treatment was requried in cases and treatment discontinued in cases distinct improvement of grip strength morning stiffness and esr in cases indicates the antiinflammatory tau of benorylate there were no signs of toxicity to bone marrow CL or kidney severe side effects such as stomch ulcers gastrointestinal bleeding and severe allergic complications were not observed SE such as constipation and tinnitus that occurred at the beginning of treatment were mainly of a a passing nature and disappeared without a need to change therapy benorylate is suitable for the treatment of recent RA ICA of a low to moderate activity as well as for LT treatment
336,the h urinary excretion of betahydroxycortisol and dglucaric acid the plasma half lives and total clearances of aminopyrine and serum gammaglutamyltranspeptidase activity have been measured in nineteen healthy male volunteers the T0 was done double blind and was conducted as a test of induction of microsomal drug metabolizing enzymes during and after daily doses of mg clemastine mg phenobarbital or a PL the urinary excretion of betahydroxycortisol and dglucaric acid was significantly increased in the phenobarbital group the standard for induction no changes were observed after treatment with clemastine or placebo phenobarbital also reduced the t1/2 of aminopyrine but it was not affected by clemastine or placebo gammaglutamyltranspeptidase activity increased only in the phenobarbital group the elimination constant k of aminopyrine and the excretion of glucaric acid in the premedication period were correlated p less than the results indicate that the tests were of diagnostic value in determination of microsomal enzyme induction by phenobarbital failure to observe similar changes T3 treatment with clemastine imply failure of induction of this activity under the experimental conditions
337,kinetic studies have been carried out of the monomerdimer interaction of insulin betalactoglobulin and alphachymotrypsin using stoppedflow and temperaturejump techniques the ph indicators bromothymol blue bromophenol blue and PR were used to monitor ph changes associated with the monomerdimer interaction in all three cases a kinetic process was observed which could be attributed to a simple monomerdimer equilibrium and association k and dissociation k rate constants were determined the results obtained are as follows for insulin at degrees c ph m kno k x m s k x s for betalactoglobulin ab at degrees c ph m kno d x m s k s for alphachymotrypsin at degreesc ph m kno k x m s k s the kinetic behavior of the separated betalactoglobulin a and b was similar to that of the mixture in the case of chymotrypsin bromophenol blue was found to activate the enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of pnitrophenyl acetate and a rate process was observed with the temperature jump which could be attributed to a conformational change of the indicatorprotein complex the association rate constant for dimer formation of insulin approaches the value expected for a diffusioncontrolled process while the values obtained for the other two proteins are below those expected for a diffusioncontrolled reaction unless unusally C1 steric and electrostatic effects are present
338,the metabolism and disposition of bitolterol the diptoluate ester of ntbutylarterenol tba was studied in man T3 a single oral dose and in dog after intraduodenal iv or oral administration the mean se peak plasma radioactivity in man dose mugkg was ng equivalents of hbitolterol per ml or approximately of the dose whereas peak plasma radioactivity in dog dose mugkg was ng equivalents per ml or approximately of the dose for both man and dog the time for maximum plasma level of radioactivity varied from to hr in man only of the plasma radioactivity represented intact hbitolterol hr after medication in the dog radioactivity was concentrated in lung tissue after iv administration of hbitolterol recovery of intact hbitolterol in lung at hr ranged from to of total tissue radioactivity T3 iv dosage and from to total tissue radioactivity T3 intraduodenal administration radioactivity recovered in human urine and feces hr accounted for and of the dose respectively REC of radioactivity in dog urine and feces accounted for and of the dose respectively in the same time period radiochromatograms of urine samples from man and dog revealed similar patterns of metabolites including free and conjugated forms of both tba and the omethyl metabolite ntbutylmetarterenol the L1 radioactive components of the feces were bitolterol and tba the results indicate that bitolterol is absorbed orally and retained as the intact ester in lung the prolonged bronchodilator activity of bitolterol is due to the slow PR of the ester from lung and hydrolysis to tba an AS betaadrenoceptor agonist pharmacological activity is terminated by metabolism of tba via conjugation or omethylation
339,a psychrotrophic pseudomonad isolated from iced fish Ox alanine at temperatures close to degrees c and grew over the range degrees c degrees c the rate of oxidation of alanine measured manometrically by cells grown at degrees c was lower than that of cells grown at degrees c however the consumption of oxygen after heat treatment at degrees for min was reduced considerably by degrees c grown cells alanine oxidase activity was tested in an extract from cells grown at degrees c and degrees c with alanine as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy source cells grown at degrees c produced an alanine oxidase with a temperature optimum of degrees c and ph optimum of which lost about activity by heat treatment at degrees c for min there was no NC in activity after dialysis at ph or extracts from cells grown at degrees c contained an alanine oxidase system with an optimum temperature of degrees c a ph optimum above and only about reduction of activity after heat treatment this CEA was concentrated in the m elution fraction from a sephadex column and dialysis reduced the activity at ph and mesophilic enzyme synthesis apparently started around a growth temperature of degrees c the crude alanine oxidase systems of pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from cells grown at degrees c and degrees c had a common optimum temperature of degrees c these data suggest that one mechanism of psychrophilic growth by psychrotrophic bacteria may be the induction of enzymes with low optimum temperatures in response to low temperature conditions
340,mea i and ii are two genetically distinct tumor endocrinopathies both showing AD inheritance little overlap exists between these conditions and that which is present can be explained on the basis of two mutually exclusive factors the secondary consequences of hormone excess on another endocrine gland or the fact that both tumor syndromes appear to result from genetically faulty differentiation of neuroectoderm a seemingly disproportionate amount of effort has been expended on study of the mea syndromes however there would seen to be ample justification for this interest the mea syndromes unlike most neoplastic conditions are hereditary and can be readily detected and more expeditiously treated hormone radioimmunoassay has greatly facilitated diagnosis in asymptomatic individuals and probably most importantly study of these syndromes has provided considerable insight into the embryologic origin of the endocrine system it is conceivable that knowledge gained from these conditions may stimulate further inquiry into the processes whereby neoplasia occurs in endocrine tissue and thus lead the way to the development of ERP therapy for a host of hormoneproducing PT
341,the functions of a kidney whether normal or cystic can be conceptualized in terms of anatomy glomerulus proximal tubule loop of henle distal convolution and collecting duct activity volume regulation dilution and concentration acidbase regulation potassium excretion transport of organic molecules and calcium and phosphate excretion and the integration of anatomic organization to meet functional demand our discussion of renal cystic disorders follows this conceptual outline for discussions of normal renal physiology the reader is referred to any one of several recent excellent reviews systematic DUE of renal function in cystic diseases of the kidney MSK medullary cystic disease and polycystic kidney disease has only rarely been performed the available information suggests that the earliest detectable lesions consist primarily of tubular dysfunction with time however significant reduction of glomerular filtration occurs and the resultant accumulation of uremic toxins dominates the clinical picture in polycystic and medullary cystic disease significant changes in glomerular CF are unusual in MSK this review represents an attempt to summarize the large body of literature that has accumulated on functional abnormalities in these disorders and to point out those areas where further investigations are needed
342,the effect of catecholamines on the intracellular ph of rat cardiac and skeletal muscle during varying extracellular acidbase states was determined intracellualr ph phi was calculated from the CSD of cdmo acidbase disturbances were produced by placing the animals in an environmental chamber containing or co or by administering hcl or nahco two hours later the animals were anesthetized with SP and blood and tissue samples obtained in one series of animals the effects of catecholamines were attenuated by administering the betaadrenoreceptor antagonist mj sotalol in animals breathing co cardiac muscle ph was lower in betablocked than unblocked animals vs during MA cardiac muscle ph of betablocked animals was lower than that of unblocked animals vs the same relationship was observed for skeletal muscle during metabolic acidosisbeta blockade phi unblocked phi the phi of betablocked versus unblocked animals was not significantly different under normal acidbase conditions or metabolic alkalosis for cardiac or skeletal muscle the effective buffer value of both tissue over the normal acidotic range was decreased by the betablocking agent these results indicate that catecholamine release accompanying acidosis attenuates the change in phi and increases the effective buffer value of cardiac and skeletal muscle
343,after a h preincubation to remove endogenous insulin adipose tissue of obese mice cbll obob had a lower rate of gl metabolism than tissue which was not preincubated in contrast preincubation did not NC the metabolism of AT from lean mice cbj the preincubation effect was abolished in obese mice which had had their serum insulin levels lowered toward normal by streptozotocin treatment injection of AIS to obese mice caused adipose tissue removed min after the i.t. to display a rate of glucose metabolsim lower than that of tissue removed before the injection no such effect was seen in lean mice these data are consistent with the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia in the obese mice causes a chronic state of insulin stimulation of their AT possibly contributing to their high rates of lipogenesis and their obesity several lipogenic enzymes were measured in adipose tissue of both lean and obese mice and no single enzymatic abnormality was detected which might explain the hyperlipogenesis pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetylcoa carboxylase were both insulinsensitive enzymes in lean and obese mice
344,the interactions of the substrate analogs betamethylglcnac glcnac and glcnac with hen eggwhite lysozyme ec in which an ester linkage had been formed between glu and trp ester lysozyme were studied by the circular dichroic and fluorescence techniques and were compared with those for IN lysozyme the binding constants of betamethylglcnac and glcnac to ester lysozyme were essentially the same as those for IN lysozyme in the ph range of to above ph the binding constants of these saccharides to ester lysozyme did not change with ph while the binding constants to intact lysozyme decreased this indicates that glu pk in intact lysozyme participates in the binding of these saccharides the extent and direction of the pk shifts of asp pk asp pk and asp pk observed when betamethylglcnac is bound to ester lysozyme were the same as those for intact lysozyme the participation of asp and asp in the binding of glcnac to ester lysozyme was also the same as that for intact lysozyme these findings indicate that the conformations of subsites b and c are not changed by the formation of the ester linkage on the other hand the IB constants of glcnac to ester lysozyme were higher than those for intact lysozyme at all ph values studied this result is interpreted in terms of an increase in the affinity for a glcnac residue of subsite d which is situated near the esterified glu
345,studies were made on the PCS and chemical properties of polysaccharides synthesized by CF extracts of Sm streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus sp and their susceptibilities to dextranases among the polysaccharides examined insoluble glucans were rather resistant to available dextranase preparations and the insoluble sticky glucan produced by s mutans omz which could be important in formation of dental plaques was the most resistant by enrichment SC of soil specimens using omz glucans as the sole carbon source an organism was isolated that produced colonies surrounded by a clear lytic zone on opaque agar plates containing the omz glucan the organism was identified as a strain of flavobacterium and named the ek bacterium ek bacterium was grown in TSB and an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the omz glucan was concentrated from the culture supernatant and purified by negative adsorption on a diethylaminoethylcellulose de column and gradient elution chromatography with a carboxymethylcellulose cm column the enzyme was a basic protein with an isoelectric point of ph and molecular weight of its optimum ph was and its optimal temperature was c the purified enzyme released of the total gl residues of the omz glucan as reducing sugars and solubilized about half of the ATP glucan the products were found to be isomaltose nigerose and nigerotriose with some oligosaccharides the purified enzyme split the alphaglucan endolytically and was inactive toward glucans containing alpha alpha beta beta andor beta bonds as the main linkages
346,nutritional and PCS conditions affecting nitrogenase activity in the strain of cowpea rhizobia h were examined using cultures grown on agar medium arabinose in the basic medium cs could be replaced by ribose xylose or glycerol but mannitol gl sucrose or galactose only supported low nitrogenase ch reduction activity succinate could be replaced by pyruvate fumarate malate or oxoglutarate but without any carboxylic acid nitrogenase activity was low or undetectable unless a high level of arabinose was provided Ins was not essential several nitrogen sources could replace glutamine including glutamate urea nhso and asparagine the maximum nitrogenase activity of cultures grown in air at degrees c was observed under CA conditions of po atm and degrees c incubation greatest activity occurred after a period of rapid bacterial growth when viable cell count was relatively constant compared with results obtained on the cs medium nitrogenase activity could be substantially increased andor sustained for longer periods of time by using mm succinate and mm arabinose by increasing phosphate concentration from to mm or by culturing the bacteria at degrees c
347,the internal ph of escherichia coli cells was estimated from the distribution of either cdimethyloxazolidinedione or cmethylamine edtavalinomycin treatment of cells was employed to estimate delta psi from rb distribution concomitant with the delta ph for calculation of delta muh respiring IN cells maintained an internal ph more alkaline by unit than that of the milieu at extracellular ph both in growth medium and kcl solutions the delta ph decreased when respiration was inhibited by anaerobiosis or in the presence of kcn the delta muh established by edtavalinomycintreated cells was constant mv over extracellular potassium concentration of mm mm at the lower potassium concentration delta psi mv was the predominant component and at the higher concentration delta ph increased to units mv at mm potassium delta muh was reduced to mv mostly due to a delta ph component of mv the interchangeability of the delta muh components is consistent with an electronic proton pump and with potassium serving as a counter ion in the presence of valinomycin indeed both parameters of delta muh decreased in the presence of carbonylcyanide ptrifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone the highest delta ph of units was observed in the intact cells at ph increasing the extracellular ph decreased the delta ph to at ph and to at ph a similar pattern of dependence of delta ph on extracellular ph was observed in edtavalinomycintreated cells but the delta psi was almost constant over the whole range of extracellular ph values implying electroneutral proton movement potassium is specifically required for respiration of edtatreated e coli k cells since other monovalent or divalent cations could not replace potassium and valinomycin was not required
348,both gammaglutamyltransferase gammagt and pseudocholinesterase pce were found to be increased in hypertriglyceridemic subjects high values of gammagt were noted in alcoholic subjects and especially in those with either increased serum triglyceride or alanine aminotransferase higher than muml while pce was not significantly changed in alcoholic subjects although both enzymes were strongly correlated with the logarithm of serum triglyceride and the prebeta electrophoretic fraction there were striking differences concerning their behavior in various hypertriglyceridemic subjects pce activity was high even in moderate hypertriglyceridemias but its rho with SS triglyceride had a tendency to flatten with increasing concentration of triglyceride however increase of gammagt was rather characteristic for gross hypetriglyceridemia ST triglyceridelowering therapy was accompanied by a tendency to normalization of gammagt while pce values were not influenced an attempt was made to interpret these changes of serumenzyme activity in HTG in connection with mechanisms of lipoprotein synthesis and with the pathogeny of hyperlipemic conditions
349,the alveolar wall on contact with air can be compared with a biological airliquide interface as with all interfaces there are therefore superficial forces which tend to reduce the surface to a minimum in the case of a pulmonary alveolus with a spherical surface these forces are at the origin of an internal pressure excess dependent on the radius of the alveolus and on the superficial tension related to the nature of the interface owing to the disparity in the AM radii under these conditions the smaller alveoli would collapse to the benefit of a larger one the pressure being lower and lower in the latter in addition at any time in the respiratory cycles this surpression must be negligible in order to avoid rupture of the equilibrium of the forces exerted on the AM wall consequently it is necessary that this airalveolar wall interface should have a SF tension on the one hand variable with the surface and on the other hand always very low owing to the demonstration of large concentrations of phospholipid in this area it can be thought that a SF film is substituted at the airbiological liquid interface and owing to this fact effectively has superficial properties necessary for alveolar stability the surfacetensioactive effect of this film lead to the giving of the name of SF to these constituents as a whole
350,cytosolbinding proteins for lthyroxine t and triiodolthyronine t were studied in human CL specimens obtained at autopsy from male and female subjects the liver cytosol containing it or t together with or without added stable hormones was fractionated by pevikon thinlayer electrophoresis at ph and it was demonstrated in all the specimens that besides a small amount of serum tbinding AHG there existed three tbinding proteins termed ht ht and ht with the electrophoretic mobilities of alpha and betaglobulins and two tbinding proteins termed ht and ht with the mobilities of gammaglobulin binding of hormones by the cytosol proteins was phdependent and a preliminary dialysis had no effect on the hormone binding the major band of t ht bound more than half the tracer t and possessed the maximal IB capacity of mug ml of cytosol at ph however it showed no apparent affinity for t because the bound t could not be displaced with a t load of mug ml the L1 band of t ht bound more than of the tracer t and appeared to have a C1 capacity for the hormone although AA binding sites on the same molecule might be responsible for the large capacity the binding CS appeared almost specific for t because only a small insignificant displacement was noted with a t load of mug ml the results provide evidence for distinct IB proteins for t and t in the human liver cytosol though their physiological roles remain to be elucidated
351,a small amount of antitryptic activity is detectable in the supernatant of deproteinized human SS preincubation of serum with trypsin causes an increase in acidstable antitryptic activity this rise in activity depends on the inter alphatrypsin inhibitor concentration the native inhibitor present in normal sera and in higher concentrations in sera of patients with nephropathies and the trypsinliberated inhibitor show immunological cross reaction with antibodies to the serum interalphatrypsin inhibitor the two inhibitors differ in molecular weight and electrophoretic mobility the physiological inhibitor i with a molecular weight of and a high carbohydrate content can be transformed by TR into an inhibitor i with a molecular weight of this inhibitor is identical with the inhibitors liberated by TR from serum or from purified interalphatrypsin inhibitor the acidstable inhibitor from urine is identical with the physiological SS inhibitor analogously this inhibitor is transformed by TR into the inhibitor with a molecular weight of we conclude that the interalphatrypsin inhibitor is the F0 of both the physiological and the trypsinliberated inhibitor by a mechanism as yet unknown but most likely a limited proteolysis the secreted inhibitor is liberated from the high molecular weight precursor in contrast to the monospecific trypsininhibiting precursor the physiological and artificially liberated inhibitors are trypsinchymotrypsinplasmin inhibitors
352,carbon nmr spectra have been obtained for aqueous solutions of dlalphahydroxyethylthiamin dlalphahydroxybenzylthiamin dlalphahydroxybenzyloxythiamin and related n methyl and n benzyl analogs the unusually large downfield shift of the c resonance of c of hydroxyethylthiamin suggests that this carbon bears a partial positive charge this result stands in contrast to results of xray crystallographic studies of hydroxyethylthiamin which place a partial negative charge on c pletcher j and sax m j am chem soc a partial positive charge on c helps to explain the facility of carbanion formation at the alpha carbon both enzymatically and in model systems the rates of protondeuteron exchange of calphah with solvent deuterium and of PR of aldehyde to regenerate thiamin have been measured for hydroxyethylthiamin and analogs the differences in kinetic pH of calphah and of rates of aldehyde release are rationalized in terms of differing electronwithdrawing abilities of the substituents attached to n and appear not to be related to intramolecular basic catalysis of these processes by the c amino group
353,several novel selective sorbents for mouse interferon are described that exploit the hydrophobic property and glycoprotein nature of this molecule lowmolecularweight ligands hydrocarbons and MW ligands bovine serum Al immobilized on agarose bind selectively mouse lcell interferon the high selectivity of binding is due primarily to a hydrophobic effect although electrostatic forces are also apparently involved mouse lcell interferon binds to immobilized serum albumin and can be completely recovered by raising the ionic strength of the eluant the specific activity of interferon S9 can be increased fold to a value of x reference units per mg of protein in a single step with full REC of the antiviral activity a selective adsorption although to a lesser degree can be also obtained on hydrocarboncoated agarose affigel resulting in fold purification on desorption the existence of two major components of mouse interferon was revealed upon its chromatography on the following sorbents i bovine serum albuminagarose ii omegacarboxypentylagarose and iii bandeiraea simplicifolia lectinagarose this report thus provides for the first time a means for efficient and clearcut separation of interferon components thus enabling their further characterization
354,in a period of lowest day activity of IMT aminotransferase within days T3 bilatheral adrenalectomy the CEA was decreased by about as compared with an adequate control at the same time within a day and seven days after hypophisectomy in rat CL tissue the enzyme activity was increased approximately twofold as compared with the normal state within four hrs after intraperitoneal administration into intact fasting rats at a dose of g per kg of body weight dcycloserine and its dimer caused an induction of IMT aminotransferase by and respectively induction of the enzyme by dcycloserine and its dimer was inhibited by actinomycin d the phenomenon was not observed in ADX within a day after hypophisectomy dcycloserine did not cause the induction of tyrosine aminotransferase in rat liver tissue to the contrary the dimer of dcycloserine caused induction of the enzyme comparable to the acth effect in liver tissue of hypophisectomized rats
355,the dependence of the threshold potential for contraction of ph and the concentration of ca and mg in the bathing solution was measured in frog skeletal muscle decreasing the ph from to resulted in a threshold shift to more positive potentials between ph and the concentration threshold was almost ph independent increasing cao in the concentration range mm shifted the curves relating contraction threshold to ph to less negative potentials and diminished the overall phdependence the contraction threshold exhibited a similar dependence on cao and mgo the two curves running parallel in the concentration range of mm but mg was only c as effective as ca to explain these results a surface charge model is proposed which assumes that two acidic groups sigma and sigma and one basic group sigma reside at the outer surface of the membrane of the tsystem alterations in the extracellular medium exert their influence on the electromechanical coupling process by changing the surface potential the CG will be titrated by protons and their charges screened off by the divalent cations in addition ca was supposed to bind with a weak dissociation constant m to the two acidic groups the chosen charge densities are sigma a e a sigma a e a sigma a e a with intrinsic dissociation constants kh m kh m and kh m the measured threshold values are satisfactorily described by this model except at extreme alkaline and acid ph values
356,crude particulate preparations obtained from anaerobic lightgrown cells of rhodopseudomonas spheroides have been shown to possess a significant level of snglycerolphosphate acyltransferase ec activity in contrast to the enzyme from escherichia coli the r spheroides glycerophosphate acyltransferase has a high specificity for acyl thiolester derivatives of ACP acp as acyl donors for the reaction only limited nonlinear glycerophosphate incorporation into lipid occurs when acyl coenzyme a coa derivatives are employed as acyl substrate with oleylacp as substrate maximal CEA was observed at degrees over a broad ph range to and did not require a divalent metal cation the presence of dithiothreitol stimulated enzymeactivity to when oleylacp or palmitylacp was employed as sole acyl group donor the L1 products recoverable from the reaction mixtures were lysophosphatidic acid phosphatidic acid and monoglyceride althouh oleylacp and palmitylacp gave comparable maximal velocities in the initial acylation of glycerophosphate the formation of phosphatidic acid occurred preferentially with the unsaturated acylacp derivative
357,ehrlich ascitestumour cells were investigated with regard to their stability to transport llactate by measuring either the distribution of clactate or concomitant h ion movements the movement of lactate was dependent on the ph difference across the cell membrane and was electroneutral as evidenced by an observed antiport for oh ions or symport with h ions kinetic experiments showed that lactate transport was saturable with an apparent km of approx mm and a vmax as high as nmolmin per mg of protein at ph and degrees c lactate transport exhibited a high temperature dependence activation energy kjmol lactate transport was inhibited competitively by a a variety of other substituted monocarboxylic acids eg Pyr ki mm which were themselves transported b the nontransportable analogues alphacyanohydroxycinnamate ki mm alphacyanohydroxycinnamate ki mm and dlphydroxyphenyllactate ki mm and c the thiolgroup reagent mersalyl ki mum transport of simple monocarboxylic acids including acetate and propionate was insensitive to these inhibitors they presumably cross the membrane by means of a different mechanism experiments using saturating amounts of mersalyl as an inhibitor stop allowed measurements of the initial rates of net influx and of net efflux of clactate influx and efflux of lactate were judged to be symmetrical reactions in that they exhibited similar concentration dependence it is concluded that lactate transport in ehrlich ascitestumour cells is mediated by a carrier capable of transporting a number of other substituted monocarboxylic acids but not unsubstituted shortchain aliphatic acids
358,to T0 the interaction between carboxyl groups and amino groups in native lysozyme ec and to identify the positions and the pk values of the abnormal carboxyl groups nacetylated lysozyme was prepared the acetylation did not affect the molecular shape of the enzyme but changed six amino CG to a nonionizable form leaving one amino group free this was determined to be lys in addition ph titration of the acetylated lysozyme in or m kcl AQ solution indicated fewer titratable groups with pkint of or compared with the native protein though the number of titratable carboxyl groups was not affected by the acetylation from the ph titration results and structural considerations the unititratable carboxyl groups were suggested to be asp asp and asp on the other hand spectrophotometric titration in m kcl showed that all three IMT residues are titratable in the acetylated protein although an abnormal tyrosine residue exists in the native state tyr was suggested to be untitratable in the ph range of
359,deflocculated suspensions of coarse powders tend to cake as the individual particles settle out and form compact cohesive sediments limited flocculation results in looser sediments because the settledout flocs incorporate large amounts of the liquid suspending medium controlled flocculation of BSN suspensions was achieved by the addition of small amounts of bentonite the interaction of the coarse positively charge bismuth subnitrate particles in AQ suspension with negatively charged colloidally dispersed bentonite was investigated by measuring electrophoretic mobility sedimentation volume and viscosity gradual addition of bentonite dispersion to BSN suspensions first reduced the zetapotential of the bismuth subnitrate particles from mv to zero then inverted it and finally caused it to level off at mv for bismuth subnitratebentonite weight ratios below owing to the much greater SSA of bentonite the surface of the bismuth subnitrate lathshaped crystals was completely covered by of its weight in clay platelets adhesion was promoted by electrovalences between surface bismuthyl ions and cationexchange sites of the clay and by secondary valences the charge neutralization of BSN by bentonite was a heterocoagulation process the addition of small amounts of the clay flocculated the BSN suspensions and eliminated caking while the zetapotential of the BSN particles leveled off when their surface was saturated with bentonite platelets sedimentation volume and viscosity continued to increase when the clay concentration was increased further while maintaining the bismuth subnitrate concentration constant the excess nonadsorbed bentonite formed the characteristic houseofcards structure incorporating the bentonitecoated bismuth subnitrate particles as cornerstones
360,the formation of nnitrososarcosine from creatine creatinineoxime and lmethylhydantoinoxime from creatinine was investigated in MM solutions under various conditions temperature ph concentration of sodium nitrite nnitrososarcosine was formed from creatine only in strongly acidic medium and its concentration increased with temperature and concentration of sodium nitrite no nnitrososarcosine was detected at degrees c and in the presence of an equimolar amount of sodium nitrite creatinineoxime and lmethylhydantoinoxime was formed from creatinine in a broad region of ph the highest concentration of these compounds was found in ph the main reaction product was lmethylhydantoinoxime at a given ph the concentrations of these two oximes increased generally with increased temperature andor concentration of sodium nitrite no oxime were detected at o degrees c and in the presence of equimolar amounts of sodium nitrite likewise was studied the influence of temperature on the decomposition of the above mentioned compounds the activation energies of the studied reactions in acidic medium were nnitrososarcosine creatinineoxime and kcalmol lmethylhydantoinoxime respectively
361,the mechanism of action of quinidine on squid axons has been examined by means of Vc clamp and internal perfusion techniques when applied either externally or internally quinidine hcl suppresses both sodium and potassium conductance increases the effect on the former accounting for the observed decrease in action potential the potassium conductance in quinidine undergoes a marked inactivation in a manner dependent upon the membrane potential and time accounting for the observed prolongation of the terminal falling phase of the action potential quinidine methiodide exhibits the effect similar to that of quinidine hcl only when applied internally the dissociation constants of quinidine in suppressing the sodium conducting system are estimated to be x and x m for quinidine hcl and methiodide respectively the dissociation constant of quinidine in suppressing the potassiumconducting system decreases with increasing step depolarization when applied externally to the intact axons quinidine hcl is more effective at external ph than at when perfused internally quinidine hcl is more ERP at internal ph than at and the potency is related to the calculated internal concentration of the charged form rather than that of the uncharged form these results lead to the conclusion that quinidine hcl penetrates the nerve membrane in the uncharged form is ionized in the axon and blocks the sodium and potassium conductances primarily in the charged form thus quinidine and local anesthetics share some features in the terms of the site of action and active form
362,an investigation of the SMB of PP ix deuteroporphyrin ix HP ix and coproporphyrin iii in aqueous solution revealed extensive and complex aggregation processes PP appears to be highly aggregated under all conditions studied at concentrations below mum aggregation of deutero haemato and coproporphyrin is probably restricted to dimerization at approx mum each of these three porphyrins exhibits sharp changes in spectra consistent with a micellization process to form large aggregates of unknown size this critical concentration increases with increasing temperature and ph but is not very sensitive to R2 in ionic strength temperaturejump kinetic studies on deuteroporphyrin also imply an initial dimerization process the rate constants for which are comparable with those for various synthetic porphyrins followed by a further extensive aggragation the ability of a particular porphyrin to dimerize appears to parallel that of the corresponding ironiii complexes ferrihaems although it is thought that ferrihaems do not exhibit further aggregation under these conditions
363,comparison of xenobioticmetabolizing enzymes in rabbit small intestinal and hepatic microsomal fractions showed mainly quantitative differences most of the MICs were two to seven times higher in liver than in intestine however udpglucuronyltransferase activity was higher in intestine than in liver the apparent absence of BZ hydroxylase in small intestine was the only qualitative difference noticed aniline hydroxylase aminopyrine ndemethylase and aryl hydrocarbon dydroxylase were characterized in intestinal microsomes and compared to those of liver CSD of these enzymes along the entire length of small intestine showed that maximum activities of the enzymes were present in the proximal cm of the intestine all the enzymes in both tissues required nadph and o for maximum activity and were inhibited by cytochrome c skf a and co the in vitro addition of drug substrates to microsomal fractions of both tissues produced typical type i and type ii binding spectra comparison of the relationships between MICs and ph duration of incubation and substrate and protein concentration suggested that the rb intestinal and hepatic xenobioticmetabolizing enzymes studied have similar characteristics
364,the livers lungs and small intestines of UT rabbits and the livers of control rats were stored intact or as microsomal suspensions under liquid nitrogen at degrees c aniline hydroxylase aminopyrine demethylase benzpyrene hydroxylase BP hydroxylase nadphcytochrome c reductase udpglucuronyltransferase activities the microsomal content of cytochrome p and the aniline and benzphetamineinduced spectral changes were compared in fresh and stored preparations few significant changes in any of the above parameters resulted from storage of rabbit tissue preparations in liquid nitrogen for periods of up to days pretreatment of rabbits with phenobarbital did not affect the stability of their stored microsomal preparations enzyme activities in the livers of UT or methylcholanthrenepretreated rats were less SD to storage than in tissue preparations from rabbits stored under identical conditions however when rat hepatic microsomes were resuspended in kclhepes supplemented with mm edta before storage enzyme activities were largely unaffected by freezing in liquid nitrogen
365,the kinetics of formation of horseradish peroxidase compound i were studied by using peroxobenzoic acid and ten substituted peroxobenzoic acids as substrates kinetic data for the formation of compound i with ho and for the reaction of deuteroferrihaem with ho and peroxobenzoic acids to form a peroxidatically active intermediate are included for comparison the observed secondorder rate constants for the formation of compound i with peroxobenzoic acids decrease with increasing ph in the range ph in contrast with phindependence of the reaction with ho the results imply that the formation of compound i involves a reaction between the enzyme and unionized hydroperoxide molecules the Vmax constants for compound i formation with unhindered peroxobenzoic acids exceed that for ho peroxobenzoic acids with bulky ortho substituents show marked adverse steric effects the pattern of substituent effects does not agree with expectations for an electrophilic oxidation of the enzyme by peroxoacid molecules in aqueous solution but is in agreement with that expected for a reaction involving nucleophilic attack by peroxo anions possible reaction mechanisms are considered by which the apparent conflict between the pheffect and substituenteffect data may be resolved a MM in which it is postulated that a negatively charged electrostatic gate controls access of substrate to the active site and may also activate ATP within the active site provides the most satisfactory explanation for both the present results and data from the literature
366,the experiments were done on single myelinated nerve fibres of rana esculenta the rates of toxin effect were studied either by measuring the maximum rate of rise va of repetitively evoked action potentials or by measuring na currents during periodic impulses in the Vc clamp va measurements showed that in ALP solutions ph up to the offset rate was unchanged while the onset was slowed in quantitative agreement with an assumed decrease in the active cationic form of tetrodotoxin both va measurements and those in the Vc clamp revealed a decrease in toff the offset TC and in increase in the onset time constant ton as the ph was lowered for tetrodotoxin concentrations ttx up to nm and ph values down to the simple relation tontoff pr held where pt is the constant factor by which the na permeability was reduced at equilibrium with a given ttx the agreement between kinetic and equilibrium results was also valid when at constant ttx and ph pt was modified by the holding potential during equilibration no unequivocal explanation of the results can be given but some of their features resemble acid catalysis
367,coronary vascular and myocardial responses to selective hypoxic andor hypercapnic carotid chemoreceptor stimulation were investigated in constantly ventilated pentobarbital or urethanchloralose anesthetized dogs bilaterally isolated carotid chemoreceptors were perfused with autologous blood of varying o and co tensions via an extracorporeal lung circuit systemic gas tensions were unchanged effects of carotid chemoreceptor stimulation on CVR left ventricular dpdt and straingauge arch SO were studied at natural coronary blood flow with the chest closed and during constantflow perfusion of the left common coronary artery with the chest open carotid chemoreceptor stimulation slightly increased left ventricular dpdt and slightly decreased the straingauge arch output while markedly increasing systemic pressure coronary blood flow increased however coronary V1 resistance waas not affected these studies show that local carotid body stimulation increases coronary blood flow but has little effect on the myocardium the increase in coronary blood flow results mainly from an increase in systemic arterial pressure thus these data provide little evidence for increased sympathetic activity of the heart during local stimulation of the carotid chemoreceptors with hypoxic and hypercapnic blood
368,the kinetics of reduction of horse heartcytochrome c have been investigated using the reductants sodium dithionite and potassium ferrocyanide sodium dithionite reduction at ph yields rate constants of x msec for so and x m sec for so at infinite dilution moreover the data presented demonstrates the participation of positively charged CAA side chains at the site of electron transfer the effect of ph on the reduction of ferricytochrome c requires a minimum of two pk values for description pk pk based on the pk values determined one or more lysines and a residuess with a low pk are implicated as the positively charged residues participating in electron transfer from a comparison of the rates of reduction of various denatured forms of cytochrome c we feel that the most viable conclusion is that electron transfer takes place at the exposed heme edge in the vicinity of the amino acid side chains indicated above ferrocyanide reduction of ferrihorse heart cytochrome c takes place in a kinetically complex manner a mechanism is described which includes complexes of ferrocyanide and ferricytochrome c and ferricyanide and ferrocytochrome c as was found for dithionite reduction a positively charged region of the cytochrome c participates in electron transfer combining our results with ferrocyanide and dithionite we conclude that avaible data is compatible with a single mechanism of electron transfer it is suggested that the kinetic distinction between different reductants lies in the lifetime of the transient complex formed with the order ferrocyanide greater than so greater than so
369,the activity of rrna methylases was stimulated by highenergy precursors of rna ribonucleoside triphosphates and inhibited by degradation products of rna ribonucleotides and oligoribonucleotides the response of methylases from rat novikoff ascites tumor and CL to these metabolites was strikingly different the highly active tumor enzymes responded preferentially to inhibition by catabolic metabolites whereas the less active CL enzymes responded exclusively to stimulation by anabolic metabolites when the activity of rrna methylases was assayed in response to increasing concentration of sadenosylmethionine the tumor enzymes responded with a hyperbolic substrate dependence curve and the CL enzymes with a sigmoidal curve in the presence of an inhibitory dinucleotide apa the tumor enzymes responded with a sigmoidal curve in the presence of a stimulator adenosine triphosphate the liver enzymes responded with a hyperbolic substrate concentration curve when normal rats were subject to a series of treatments by thioacetamide a hepatocarcinogen the liver nucleolar rrna methylases became responsive to inhibition by apa and relatively unresponsive to stimulation by adenosine triphosphate when tumorbearing rats were treated with polyinosinatepolycytidylate an antitumor agent the RT nucleolar rrna methylases became unresponsive to inhibition by apa and more responsive to stimulation by adenosine triphosphate a correlation was noted between increased methylation efficiency in vivo and increased stability of nucleolar rna during incubation in vitro or vice versa these results are interpreted to indicate that rrnamethylases are regulated by cellular metabolites during the nucleolar biosynthesis of ribosomes and that rrna methylases may provide a favorable site for selective action by CA chemotherapeutic agents
370,lasparagine uptake by stemphylium botryosum is mediated by two distinct energy and temperaturedependent transport systems one permease is relatively specific for lasparagine and lglutamine and is present in nutrientsufficient mycelium the specific permease shows an optimum ph at saturation kinetics km x m vmax mumolg per min competitive gradient of lasparagine and higher affinity towards the lisomer of asparagine NH derivatives of lasparagine diazooxolnorvaline or laspartyl hydroxamate are the most effective competitors alphaamino derivative nacetyl asparagine is a moderate competitor and alphacarboxyl derivative lasparaginetbutylester shows only slight inhibition of the specific permease derivatives of lglutamine are significantly less effective competitors than those of lasparatine the level of the specific permease is affected by nitrogen sources and increases approximately threefold upon starvation the nonspecific permease possesses an optimum ph at saturation kinetics km x m vmax mumolg per min kt x m for lleucine and high affinity towards various types of amino acids
371,the metabolic responsiveness of lung tissue to inhibition of oxidative metabolism was determined by measurement of the redox state of the isolated perfused and ventilated rat lung changes in redox state were evaluated by fluorescence from the lung surface at wavelengths suitable for reduced pyridine nucleotides and by measurement of the ratios of redox couples in rapidly frozen lung tissue maximal change of redox state was observed during ventilation with carbon monoxide surface fluorescence increased lactatepyruvate increased times glycerol pdihydroxyacetonep increased fourfold and glutamatealphaketoglutarate doubled kcn infusion resulted in similar changes hypoxia produced with n ventilation resulted in less than maximal changes in redox couple ratios until alveolar po was reduced below mmhg redox changes observed during infusion of mm aminoxyacetic acid suggested that maintenance of cytoplasmic redox state depended on functioning of a malateaspartate shuttle the isolated perfused lung appears suitable to study factors controlling pulmonary PC oxidative metabolism the results emphasize the need for ventilation with co to establish intracellular anoxia
372,inositol biosynthesis was studied in soluble cell extracts of a wildtype ino CS of saccharomyces cerevisiae two reactions were detected i conversion of dglucosephosphate to a phosphorylated form of inositol presumably inositolphosphate ip synthethase ec and ii conversion of phosphorylated inositol to inositol ip phosphatase ec the in vitro rate of conversion of glucosephosphate to inositol was proportional to incubaion time and enzyme concentration the ph optimum was the synthesis of inositol required oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad and was stimulated bynhc and mgc nadp substituted poorly for nad and nadh inhibitedthe reaction phosphorylated inositol accumulated in the absence of mgc suggesting that inositolphosphate is an intermediate in the pathway and that mg ions stimulate the dephosphorylation of inositolphosphate ip synthetase was inhibited approximately in the presence of Ins in the reaction mixture at concentrations exceeding mm the enzyme was repressed approximately fold when inositol was present in the growth medium at concentrations exceeding mum ip synthetase reached the fully repressed level approximately h after the addition of Ins to logarithmic cultures grown in the absence of inositol the specific activity of the enzyme increased with time in logarithmically growing cultures lacking Ins andapproached the fully depressed level as the cells entered stationary phase
373,the levels of six lysosomal enzymes acid phosphatase betaacetylglucosaminidase cathepsin d betagalactosidase arylsulfatase a and betaglucuronidase and four neutral and alkaline hydrolases esterase inorganic phyrophosphatase alkaline phosphatase and nucleotidase were measured in osteoarthritic rheumatoid and control synovia all enzyme C2 in diseased synovium except esterase values in osteoarthritis were significantly elevated compared with controls the mean values of the group of acid hydrolases and the group of neutral and alkaline hydrolases in osteoarthritic synovia were and fold greater than those of control specimens in rheumatoid synovia the values were and fold greater than control for the same enzymes levels in rheumatoid synovia were significantly higher than those in osteoarthritic synovia with the exception of nucleotidase only a limited correlation between the extents of inflammation present in the synovia and the levels of a lysosomal marker enzyme cathepsin d was observed these results demonstrate that whatever the mechanism increased C2 of acid hydrolases as well as certain neutral and alkaline hydrolases are present in osteoarthritic and rheumatoid synovia and these enzymes are probably contained in the synovial lining cells
374,membrane vesicles from azotobacter vinelandii o prepared by osmotic lysis of spheroplasts in tris hydroxymethyl aminomethaneacetate buffer ph contain a latent adenosine triphosphatase atpase the atpase can be activated when the LDV are incubated in the presence of an electron donor dlactate and a mixture of adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate or by controlled treatment with TR T3 the atpase is activated the membrane LDV in the presence of adenosine triphosphate accumulate calcium but not glucose or rubidium in the presence of valinomycin atpdependent calcium uptake follows michaelismenten kinetics with a km of mum and a vmax of nmolminmg of membrane protein and is highly TPS for calcium over cations magnesium barium lanthanum sodium potassium and lithium the calcium accumulated in the presence of atp is freely exchangeable with external calcium and is rapidly released in the presenceof uncouplers or atpase inhibitors calcium uptake in the presenceof atp is blocked by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide adp pchloromercuriphenylsulfonate by the protonconducting ionophores mchlorophenylcarbonylcyanide hydrazone nigericin monensin and gramicidin d but not by potassium cyanide anoxia or valinomycin in the presence of potassium measurements of the external ph of vesicle suspensions reveal that protons are actively taken up by the membranes during hydrolysis of atp these results suggest that LDV prepared under these conditions have a topology which is inverted with respect to the intact cell and that calcium is accumulated by means of proton antiport
375,twenty mongrel dogs weighing between and kg were used to investigate the percentage limits permissible for hemodilution using a doublehelical reservoir heartlung machine which has a ml of priming volume in both and per cent groups of intentional HD by minute extracorporeal circulation remarkable anemia was inevitable and recovery was extremely slow especially in the per cent dilution group in both and per cent groups of intentional hemodilutions by minute extracorporeal circulation metabolic acidosis was observed in per cent group of intentional hemodilution no improvement of metabolic acidosis was observed even T3 perfusion when sodium bicarbonate was administered to per cent hemodilution group minimum alterations of acidbase balance and of serum electrolytes were observed during and after extracorporeal perfusion when sodium bicarbonate was administered to per cent hemodilution group metabolic acidosis was more evident than in per cent hemodilution group accompanied with an increase in serum sodium concentration and a decrease in serum chloride concentration these data qualify the use of per cent intentional HD using lactate ringers solution or low molecular weight dextran for minute extracorporeal circulation when sodium bicarbonate is administered in adequate amounts
376,the gills of the dogfish scyliorhinus canicula are more permeable to cl than to na in sea water influx of na and cl exceeded the efflux of these ions under these conditions the fish were slightly electronegative by about mv to the external solution the net accumulation of cl could be accounted for by diffusion along the observed electrochemical gradient byt the movement of na into the fish was more consistent with an electrically neutral AS na transport mechanism using the ussing flux ratio criterion when the external ph was was changed from to influxes of na and cl were depressed while the effluxes were unaffected and the fish became slightly less electronegative in artificial solutions in which the concentrations of na and cl were lowered and replaced with urea to maintain the total osmotic concentration na influx displayed saturation kinetics while na efflux increased with decreasing na concentrations cl influx decreased linearly while cl efflux remained constant the efflux of cl could not be reconciled with a process of passive diffusion along any of the observed electrochemical gradients and thus could reflect the presence of an active transport mechanism
377,ultraviolet difference absorption spectra produced by DDE glycol were measured for hen lysozyme ec and bovine chymotrypsinogen nacetylltryptophanamide and nacetylltyrosinamide were employed as MM EDC for tryptophyl and tyrosyl residues respectively and their ultraviolet difference spectra were also measured as a function of ethylene glycol concentration by comparison of the slopes of plots of molar difference extinction coefficients delta epsilon versus EG concentration for the proteins with those of the model EDC at peak positions and nm in the difference spectra the average number of tyrosyl as well as tryptophyl residues in exposed states could be estimated the results gave tryptophyl and tyrosyl residues exposed for lysozyme at ph and tryptophyl and tyrosyl residues exposed for chymotrypsinogen at ph the somewhat higher tyrosyl SE of chymotrypsinogen compared with the findings from spectrophotometric titration and chemical modification was not unexpected because delta epsilon was larger than delta epsilon and the situation is discussed with REF to preferential interaction of ethylene glycol with the tyrosyl residues andor side chains in the vicinity of the chromophore in the protein the procedure employed in the present work seems to be suitable for estimation of the average number of exposed tryptophyl and tyrosyl residues in tryptophanrich proteins the effects of DDE glycol on the circular dichroism spectra of lysozyme at ph and chymotrypsinogen at ph were also investigated at high ethylene glycol concentrations both proteins were found to undergo conformational changes in the direction of more ordered structures presumably more helical for lysozyme and more betastructured for chymotrypsinogen
378,thermostable membrane vesicles which were capable of AS transport of alanine dependent on either respiration or an artificial membrane potential were isolated from the thermophilic aerobic bacterium ps uptake of alanine was dependent on the oxidation of ascorbatephenazine methosulfate or on generated or exogenous nadh but succinate and malate failed to drive the uptake the optimum temperature for respirationdriven uptake of alanine was to degrees potassium ionloaded LDV were prepared by incubating vesicles at degrees in m potassium phosphate the addition of valinomycin elicited rapid and transient uptake of alanine under the test conditions uptake of alanine in response to valinomycin was progressively enhanced by the addition of dicylohexylcarbodiimide but was CR abolished in the presence of a proton conductor or synthetic permeable cation the effect of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was dependent on its concentration and was maximal at a concentration of mm the proton permeability of membrane LDV was reduced by the addition of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide a small but significant difference was found in the initial rates of proton uptake in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide with and without alanine the results suggest that protons alanine are transported simultaneously in a stoichiometric ratio of the uptake of alanine was also driven by a ph gradient induced by an instantaneous ph drop in a suspension of alkaliloaded vesicles thus alanine accumulation was driven not only by an electrical potential but also by a ph gradient addition of atp resulted in the inhibition of alanine uptake dependent on artificial membrane potential atp hydrolysis by membrane atpase created a membrane potential which was insidepositive and this might decrease the ERP membrane potential generated by k efflux mediated by valinomycin available to drive alanine uptake
379,according to previous authors cytochrome b when extracted from bovine liver by a detergent method is called cytochrome db on the other hand the protein obtained after trypsin action which eliminates an hydrophobic peptide of about residues is called cytochrome tb fluorescence polarization of the dansyl phosphatidylethanolamine probe inserted into phospholipid LDV is very sensitive to the binding of proteins and so is a useful method to study lipidprotein interactions the chromophore mobility r decreases markedly when dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles are incubated with cytochrome db whereas r does not change for cytochrome c and cytochrome tb this can be interpreted as a strengthening of bilayer only due to the interaction of the hydrophobic peptide tail interaction of dipalmitoly phosphatidylcholine vesicles with cytochrome db occurs either below or above the melting temperature of the aliphatic chains degrees c even for a high protein to lipid molar ratio molecule of protein for phospholipid molecules the melting temperature is apparently unaffected phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol do not interact at ph with cytochrome db because electrostatic forces prevent formation of complexes at low ph the interaction with the protein occurs but the binding is mainly of electrostatic nature
380,pig SP phosphofructokinase has been purified fold with a yield of two isoenzymes that appear to be kinetically MZ can be separated by deaecellulose column chromatography in common with the enzyme from other rat sources the spleen enzyme has a ph optimum of at ph it displays sigmoidal kinetics with respect to fructose phosphate concentration but its cooperative behaviour is very dependent on ph protein concentration and the concentration of mgatp mggtp and mgitp can replace mgatp as phosphate donors but unlike mgatp these nucleotides do not cause significant inhibition mn and co as the metal ionatp complexes act as cofactors and in the free form are far more inhibitory than free mg the spleen enzyme responds to a wide variety of potential effector molecules adp amp cAMP AST nh fructose phosphate fructose diphosphate and pi all act as either activators or protectors whereas mgatp mg citrate phosphoenolpyruvate and the phosphoglucerates are inhibitors
381,the hemelinked protonation of a ferrous horseradish peroxidase is assigned to a distal amino acid residue the conclusion is drawn from analyses of reactions that involve the protonation unfortunately it is difficult to apply it to the myoglobin case because no reaction has been found which is coupled with the protonation of the distal histidine it is therefore of special interest to note that the pk value of has been assigned to the distal histidine of metmyoglobin from IB kinetics with ligands it is well known that the reaction with hydrogen peroxide is quite different for the two types of hemoproteins the distal base may be associated with the stabilization of the primary compound with hydrogen peroxide and also another CAA residue may serve as a nucleophile for the stabilization of the pication radical of porphyrin in the case if peroxidases numerous papers have dealt with heme substitution heme linked protonation and reactions of hemoproteins related to the present subject in this short paper however the discussion has mostly centered around the data obtained recently in our laboratory
382,the interaction of nacetylchitotriose glcnac with human lysozyme ec was studied at various ph values by measuring changes in the circular dichroic cd band at or nm and the data were compared with the results for hen and turkey lysozymes reported previously kuramitsu et al j biochem kuramitsu et al j biochem the ph dependence of the IB constant of glcnac to human lysozyme was different from those for hen and turkey lysozymes the catalytic carboxyls of HL asp and glu were not perturbed on binding of glcnac this is consistent with the previous findings that the macroscopic pk values of asp and glu of human lysozyme are and at ionic strength and degrees and were unchanged on complexing with glcnac an ionizable group with pk which participates in the binding of glcnac to hen lysozyme and was assigned as asp did not participate in the binding of the saccharide to HL between ph and the binding constants of glcnac to hen lysozyme remained unchanged whereas perturbation of an ionizable group with pk to was observed for HL this group may be tyr in the activesite cleft the binding constants of glcnac to human lysozyme molecules having different microscopic protonation forms with respect to the catalytic carboxyls were estimated using the IB constants obtained in the present experiments and the microscopic ionization constants of the catalytic carboxyls obtained previously all four species of human lysozyme had similar binding constants to glcnac this result is different from those for hen and turkey lysozymes
383,the apoprotein of hog kidney damino acid oxidase was reconstituted with deazaflavin adenine dinucleotide deazafad to yield a protein which contains mol of deazafadmol of enzyme the deazafadcontaining enzyme forms complexes with benzoate amino benzoate and aminobenzoate which are both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed with native enzyme the complex with aminobenzoate exhibits a new long wavelength absorption band characteristic of a flavin chargetransfer complex the reconstituted enzyme exhibits no activity when assayed by dalanine oxidation however the bound chromophore can be reduced by alanine phenylalanine proline methionine and valine but not by glutamate or AST indicating the deazafad enzyme retains the ATP specificity of the native enzyme reduction of the enzyme by dalanine exhibits a fold deuterium isotope effect reoxidation of the reduced enzyme occurred in the presence of pyruvate plus ammonia but not with Pyr CT or ammonia alone betaphenylpyruvate and alphaketobutyrate but not alphaketoglutarate could replace pyruvate reduced enzyme isolated following reaction with alphahalanine was found to contain mol of tritiummol of deazafadh T3 denaturation of the tritiumlabeled enzyme the radioactivity was identified as deazafadh reaction of the reduced tritiumlabeled enzyme with Pyr plus ammonia prior to denaturation yields alphahalanine and unlabeled deazafad these results suggest that reduction and reoxidation of enzymebound deazafad involves the stereospecific transfer of alphahydrogen from ATP to deazafad
384,EIA eia virus which was propagated on an equine dermal cell line agglutinated guinea pig erythrocytes viral fluids containing about mean TC L3 dosesml showed hemagglutinating ha titers ranging from to units ml results of cesium chloride equilibrium density gradient centrifugation revealed that the hemagglutinin was inseparable from the virus particles the HA reaction persisted over a wide range of temperature and ph and the absence of divalent cations did not decrease its activity the ha activity was stable at degrees c but not at degreesc the activity was destroyed by virusdisrupting lipid solvents and moderately sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme neuraminidase enhanced ha activity slightly phospholipase c had no effect on ha titer although it CR inactivated infectivity it was relatively SD to ultraviolet irradiation thus the hemagglutinin appears to be closely associated with virus particles and its activity is dependent on the presence of its lipids and proteins hemagglutination was inhibited by sera from horses INF with eia virus hemagglutinin receptors on the erythrocytes were inactivated by a proteolytic enzyme and formaldehyde but were not influenced by neuraminidase sodium deoxycholate or kio
385,in diphasic BA media trypanosoma vespertilionis developed spheroid clusters as compared to rather long sausageshaped sometimes branched clusters formed by trypanosoma dionisii the former species attained a greater population density approximately x organismsml than the latter approximately x organismsml greater numbers of epimastigotes some in active binary divisions were observed during the logarithmic phase of growth and morphologic changes occurred during cultivation which correlated with increased acidity and a SD of glucose maximum numbers of trypomastigote forms were found during the stationary and early death phases most of the forms observed T3 days were sphaeromastigotes glucose concentrations decreased to m in t vespertilionis and to x m in t dionisii cultures during the stationary and death phases by the th day of incubation cultures of t vespertilionis were more acid ph than those of t dionisii vespertilionis and t dionisii contained common and TPS antigens at least common antigens were detected in extracts reacted against rat antisera TPS antigens were observed as nonidentical lines formed by extracts reacted against homologous and heterologous antisera and with antisera absorbed with heterologous antigens at least specific antigens were evident in extracts of t vespertilionis and in extracts of t dionisii
386,extracts of HP lysosomes from rat CL were examined for their ability to degrade native collagen and thermally denatured collagen at ph values between and after a h digestion at degrees with the lysosomal extract at a ph of or lower collagenlysosomal protein or both native and denatured collagen were degraded to an extent equivalent to to of that observed upon total acid hydrolysis in n hcl as measured by the ninhydrin reaction nm at a ph of native collagen and denatured collagen were degraded by the mixture of lysosomal proteinases to and of total acid hydrolysis respectively at ph and the corresponding values were versus and versus respectively fragments of collagen tca and tcb are produced when mammalian MMP-8 degrades native collagen at degrees these fragments were degraded by the lysosomal extract at degrees to an extent equivalent to and of total acid hydrolysis at ph and respectively the experiments at ph and were done using a collagenlysosomal protein ratio of at ph a ph which is found within secondary lysosomes the lysosomal extracts degraded collagen to a mixture of free amino acids and small peptides amino acid analysis established that approximately of the amino acid residues of the collagen appeared in the lysosomal hydrolysate as free amino acids hydroxyproline and perhaps hydroxylysine were the only amino acids found in collagen which did not appear at least to some extent as the free amino acid in this hydrolysate
387,in rat isolated VD the isotonic contractile responses to low doses of noradrenaline or adrenaline were antagonized and those to high doses were potentiated by yohimbine piperoxan phentolamine and tolazoline effects due to intermediate doses were not affected or were potentiated within about min following an initial inhibition the alphaadrenoceptor blockers thus caused a shift to the right and an increase of the maximum height of log doseresponse curves of alphaadrenoceptor stimulants for a given dose of antagonist the onset was slower for the potentiating than for the blocking effect the shift to the RA induced by piperoxan and yohimbine on DR curves of noradrenaline and adrenaline was analysed with the schild plot and the slopes obtained around were lower than expected from receptor theory when cocaine was used to block neuronal uptake the slopes were close to the increase in maximum response to noradrenaline and adrenaline induced by alphaadrenoceptor blockers was dependent on the time of incubation on the dose of antagonist and on the initial height of responses to the agonist a less pronounced potentiation was also obtained when acetylcholine was used as agonist the findings are explained in terms of receptor theory as being due to a dual effect of alphaadrenoceptor antagonists competitive antagonism proper which may be disclosed after blockade of neuronal uptake and an interaction at a different locus which results in potentiation of the effects of noradrenaline and adrenaline
388,a number of hemodynamic pharmacologic and metabolic interventions were found to change the extent of acute ischemic injury of the myocardium and subsequent necrosis following exp CAO reduction in myocardial damage occurred by decreasing myocardial oxygen demands betaadrenergic blocking agents intraaortic balloon counterpulsation external counterpulsation nitroglycerin decreasing afterload in hypertensive patients inhibition of lipolysis and digitalis in the failing heart by increasing myocardial oxygen supply either directly coronary i.a. reperfusion or elevating arterial po or through collateral vessels elevation of coronary perfusion pressure by alphaadrenergic agonists intraaortic balloon counterpulsation or by increasing plasma osmolality mannitol hypertonic gl presumably by augmenting anaerobic metabolism glucoseinsulinpotassium hypertonic glucose by enhancing transport to the ICM zone of substrates utilized in energy production hyaluronidase by protecting against autolytic and heterolytic damage hydrocortisone cobra venom factor aprotinin augmentation of myocardial ischemic damage occurred as a consequence of increasing myocardial oxygen requirements isoproterenol glucagon ouabain bretylium tosylate ART by decreasing myocardial oxygen supply either directly hypoxia anemia or through reduction of collateral flow hemorrhagic SH minoxidil or by decreasing substrate availability glycemia pilot studies have been carried out in patients with hyaluronidase nitroglycerin intraaortic balloon counterpulsation betablocking agents and arfonad and have shown that these interventions may also reduce myocardial damage suggesting that the concept of reduction in infarct size following coronary occlusion is applicable clinically
389,the PET role of the bacillus stearothermophilus s ribosomal protein bl probably rat to the escherichia coli protein l was examined by chemical modification the complex bls rna was photooxidized in the presence of rose bengal and the modified protein incorporated by reconstitution into s ribosomal subunits containing all other unmodified components particles containing photooxidized bl are defective in several PET assays including polyudirected polyphe synthesis peptidyltransferase activity ability to associate with a spolyuphetrna complex and binding of elongation factor g and gtp the rates of loss of the partial PET activities during photooxidation of bl indicate that at least two independent inactivating events are occurring a faster one involving oxidation of one or more histidine residues affecting peptidyltransferase and S1 association activities and a slower one affecting efg binding therefore the protein bl has one or more histidine residues which are essential for peptidyltransferase and S1 association and another residue which is essential for efggtp binding bl may be the ribosomal peptidyltransferase protein or a part of the AS site and may contribute functional groups to the other active CS as well
390,conformational states of fibrinogen and fibrin monomer were studied by methods of differential and solventperturbation spectrophotometry and ultraviolet fluorescence at about neutral ph and in the region of lower ph to to prevent repolymerization of Fn monomer at ph urea was added in a nondenaturing concentration of m in the acid region specified the immediate environment of tyrosine and tryptophan residues was found to be more polar and the accessibility to perturbants higher than at ph much more drastic changes of the same type occurred at ph less than when denaturation of the protein takes place the conformation of fibrinogen altered progressively upon lowering ph from to this pH increase practically did not influence the conformation of fibrin monomer thus the tolerance of the latter to the appearance of the new positively changed groups seems to be comparably high the bulk of the conformational changes subsequent upon neutralization of an acid fibrin monomer solution proceeds at a higher rate than the activation transition ie the acquirement of a state of polymerization readiness by fibrin monomer molecules
391,riboflavinrequiring mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae are able to transport clabeled riboflavin into the cell although no significant transport is seen in commercial yeast or in the parent strain from which the mutants were derived transport activity is greatest in the early to midlog phase of anaerobic growth and declines sharply in the late log phase in aerobically grown cells activity is substantially lower at all stages of growth in the CA devised for its measurement transport activity shows a sharp ph optimum at ph a strong temperature dependence ea calmol and saturation kinetics with respect to riboflavin km mum characteristics consistent with a carriermediated mechanism monovalent inorganic cations particularly k and rb stimulate riboflavin uptake while certain organic cations are inhibitory besides riboflavin only methylriboflavin methylriboflavin and deazaflavin have been found to serve as substrates while lumiflavin tetraacetylriboflavin and ncarboxybutyldimethylisoalloxazine do not although a number of flavin analogs in which the ribityl side chain is modified are good competitive inhibitors of riboflavin uptake compounds resembling the ribityl side chain such as sugars and sugar alcohols do not inhibit an apparent inhibition of uptake by dglucose dmannose and dfructose which develops in the course of CA proved to result from stimulation of an opposing process the release of riboflavin from the cells
392,this paper presents a comparison of energy metabolism in wild type and respirationdeficient V79 from previous work defrancesco et al it was concluded that the mutant satisfies essentially all of its energy requirements from glycolysis and in this study we measure precisely the amount of glucose consumed and lactate produced per milligram increment of protein in exponentially growing cultures from these measurements we calculate the amount of atp derived from glycolysis and hence the total energy requirement for normal proliferation to be mumoles atpdelta mg protein in the mutant it is mumoles atpdelta mg protein derived from glycolysis in wild type cells we present evidence that the total energy requirement of wild type cells is similar to that of the mutant suggesting that approximately of the energy requirement is derived from respiration the oxidation of glutamine appears to be more significant than the complete oxidation of glucose to co in these V79 the amount of atp required by the mutant cells per milligram increment of protein is relatively independent of ph
393,enzymic properties of MAO-A mao in dog serum were studied and the following results were obtained some of enzymic properties of mao in dog serum differed from that of mitochondrial mao when dog SS was fractionated by ammonium sulfate proteins were concentrated in two fractions such as approximately and approximately of saturated ammonium sulfate fraction while mao activity was concentrated in approximately of saturated ammonium sulfate fraction the reaction rate of mao in dog SS was found to be proportional to enzyme concentration the optimum ph of mao in dog serum was which differed from that of mao in rb serum ph trishcl buffer strongly inhibited mao activity in dog SS when BZ was used as substrate the highest activity was obtained compared with the other ATP used the activities with butylamine amylamine betaphenylethylamine and tyramine showed about while tryptamine and serotonin showed approximately compared to that with benzymlamine as substrate the value of pi of catron was about x m and that of harmaline was about x m but pargyline did not inhibit mao activity in dog SS at the concentration of x m
394,the binding of biologically active ithyrotropin to purified PMs prepared from bovine thyroid glands was studied at degrees c specific binding reached a maximum after h of incubation and a plateau was maintained for up to h degradation of ithyrotropin was undetectable after h of incubation and was only of the total T3 h at ph at which binding was maximal a single class of binding sites having a KB of approx nm was evident dissociation studies revealed first order kinetics with a halftime of min at ph IB curves were complex suggesting two orders of IB sites with dissociation constants of approx nm and pm further at this ph dissociation of the thyrotropin from its receptor was also complex suggesting the presence of two first order reactions one with a halftime similar to that seen at ph and another with a halftime of h at both ph and insulin glucagon growth hormone and prolactin were without effect on ithyrotropin binding similar high affinity and low affinity IB sites were seen with porcine thyroid CM but only low affinity sites were seen with either rat liver CM or human cultured lymphocytes
395,sequential determinations of glucose outflow and inflow and rates of gluconeogenesis from alanine before during and T3 insulininduced hypoglycemia were obtained in relation to alterations in circulating EN norepinephrine glucagon cortisol and growth hormone in six normal subjects insulin decreased the mean sem PG from to mgdl min after injection but this decline ceased despite serum insulin C2 of mulml before insulin glucose inflow and outflow were constant averaging mgkg per h min after insulin mean glucose outflow increased threefold but then decreased at min reaching a rate less than the preinsulin rate gl inflow decreased min after insulin but increased at min reaching a maximum of twice the basal rate gluconeogenesis from alanine decreased min after insulin but returned to preinsulin rates at min and remained constant for the next min after which it increased linearly a fourfold increase in mean plasma epinephrine was found min after insulin with maximal C2 times basal plasma norepinephrine concentrations first increased significantly at min after insulin whereas significantly increased C2 of cortisol and glucagon occurred at min and growth hormone at min after insulin thus insulininduced hypoglycemia in man results from both a decrease in glucose production and an increase in glucose utilization accelerated glycogenolysis produced much of the initial posthypoglycemic increment in gl production the contribution of glycogenolysis decreased with time while that of gluconeogenesis from alanine increased of the hormones studied only the increments in plasma CAs preceded or coincided with the measured increase in glucose production after hypoglycemia it therefore seems probable that adrenergic mechanisms play a major role in the initiation of counterregulatory responses to insulininduced hypoglycemia in man
396,a collagenase was purified from homogenates of v ascitescell carcinoma growing in rabbit muscle nhso precipitation ionexchange and gelfiltration chromatography and affinity chromatography by using the cb cnbr cleavage fragment of alpha i collagen linked to agarose gave a fold purification and a sevenfold increase in total enzyme units recovered the specific activity defined as mumol of collagen in solution cleavedh per mg of enzyme at degrees c was the collagenase had a broad ph optimum from ph to and a molwt of between and it was inhibited by dithiothreitol lcysteine dpenicillamine edta and phenanthroline and by both rb and human SS removal of cations by a chelating resin chelex produced as inactive enzyme that could be reactiviated by the addition of ca ions at concentrations as low as mum other bivalent cations were not ERP the purified collagenase cleaved peptides alpha and alphacb denatured polypeptides of collagen at degrees c at one site only alpha ialpha and alphaiii collagens in solution were cleaved at the same site approximately five times more rapidly than alpha ii an inhibitor of the enzyme in the tumour extracts which was dissociable from the enzyme at the nh so precipitation step of purification had a mol wt of between and but was distinct from the alpha trypsin inhibitor studies with zonal densitygradient centrifugation suggested that the enzyme was bound to fibrillar substrate collagen extracellularly but that it was not associated with enzymes originating in cell mitochondria microsomal S9 or lysosomes
397,the TM electrical potential deltaphi the proton flux h the rate of electron transport e the ph gradient deltaph and the rate of phosphorylation atp were measured in chloroplasts of spinach photosynthesis was excited periodically with flashes of variable frequencies and intensities a new method is described for determining the rate of electron transport and proton flux under conditions where the rate of electron transport and proton flux are not ph controlled the following correlations were found in the range mv less than or equal to deltaphi less than or equal to mv and less than or equal to deltaph less than or equal to the ph gradient deltaph increases with h independently of phout between the rate of phosphorylation atp depends exponentially on deltaph at constant deltaphi and is independent of phout between the rate of phosphorylation atp depends also on deltaphi at constant deltaph and at constant proton flux h the proton flux via the atpase pathway hp depends nonlinearly on the ratio of the proton concentrations hp approximately hinhoutb b the proton flux via the basal pathway hb depends linearly on the ratio of the proton concentrations hb approximately hinhout the ratio deltahatp eatp ie the ratio of the total proton flux hp hb and the rate of atp formation atp depends strongly on deltaphi and on deltaph the ratio is deltahatp approximately eatp approximately at deltaph and deltaphi mv it is supposed that the reason for the dependence of deltahatp on deltaphi anddeltaph is the different functional dependence of the basal proton flux hb and the phosphorylating proton flux hp on deltaph and deltaphi the calculation of deltahatp on the basis of this assumption is in fair agreement with the exp values also the threshold effects can be explained in this way the ratio of deltahpatp ie the ratio of the phosphorylating proton flux hp and atp is deltahpatp approximately
398,we compared ionic fluxes across human GM after instillation of test solutions of isotonic HCl alone or containing salicylic acid or prednisolone or both prednisolone produced no alteration in fluxes of h and na ions compared with controls salicyclic acid induced a significant net loss of h ions and gain of na ions indicating alteration of the gastric mucosal barrier combined salicyclic acid plus prednisolone produced no increase in permeability of gastric mucosa to h and na ions or to salicylic acid itself prednisolone was not appreciably absorbed from the stomach while salicylic acid was well absorbed combination of salicylic acid and prednisolone did not increase absorption of either drug neither salicylic acid nor prednisolone solutions alone or combined caused an increase in pepsin SO over that due to mm hcl salicylic acid resulted in a significant fall in potential difference compared to control while prednisolone produced no NC in the one subject studied in acute studies in man prednisolone is not absorbed from the stomach does not itself affect the gastric mucosal barrier nor pepsin SO nor does it enhance the absorption of or effect of salicylic acid on gastric ionic fluxes or pepsin SO
399,the effect of oxprenolol i.v. and mg and orally and mg on PC of the drug resting HR rate exerciseinduced tachycardia and arterial blood pressure was assessed as a CF of time in HS the pharmacokinetics of oxprenolol following intravenous administration are best described as compartnent open MM with dosedependent parameters the mean sd plasma halflife for oral doses is and for intravenous doses is hr T3 oral administration Tmax are reached within to min and the area under the plasma concentrationtime curve varies linearly with the dose comparison of oral and intravenous data reveals the R2 in bioavailabilty of orally po oxprenolol to range from to unlike propranolol oxprenolol does not show a saturable firstpass beta effect blockade of betareceptors occurs at plasma C2 in excess of ngml as evidenced by significant reductions in RHR and exerciseinduced tachycardia higher plasma concentrations of oxprenolol are required to lower blood pressure compared to those necessary to slow heart rate these data suggest significant pharmacokinetic differences between oxprenolol and other betaadrenergic receptor antagonists
400,pah clearance was carried out in newborns hospitalized in the infantile resuscitation unit for respiratory distress of these children weighed less than kg had hyaline membrane disease had either amniotic CA or transitory tachypnea were surgical patients one right diaphragmatic hernia one postoperative respiratory complication after intervention for neonatal occlusion in cases the newborn was under controled artificial ventilation associated with peep at to cm of water in all of the cases the hemodynamic metabolic and blood gas conditions were normal a control series of newnorn was carried out in a pediatric unit the clearance was done without urine samples the rough value of the figures found varied from ml per minute to ml per minute in the respiratory distress series and to ml per minute in the control series the analysis of these results in rendered difficult by the juxtaposition of several factors choice of a REF criterion body surface area pah space patients weight theoretical weight of the kidneys the factor of prematurity the problem of the date of the investigation in comparison with the date of birth
401,a compound tentatively identified as omethylcarboxymethyluridine cmum was recently isolated in this laboratory from bulk yeast tRNA gray m w can j biochem ALP hydrolysis of yeast trna releases this nucleoside as part of an alkalistable dinucleotide cmumap from which sufficient cmum was prepared in the present investigation for a detailed examination of its properties the ultraviolet absorption spectra and chromatographic and electrophoretic properties of cmum were consistent with the proposed structure which was confirmed by characterization of the base and sugar moieties as carboxymethyluracil and omethylribose respectively snake venom hydrolysis of yeast trna releases cmum in the form of a carboxylblocked nucleotide designated pu identification of the alkalilabile blocking group in pu as an amide was based on quantitative assay for ammonia released upon acid hydrolysis of the corresponding nucleoside u and by chromatographic comparison of u with the semisynthetic methyl ester and amide derivatives of cmum mcmum and ncmum respectively quantitative analysis has indicated that ncmum may be confined to a single species of yeast trna in view of the unique localization the wobble position of the anticodon sequence and coding properties pairing with a but not with g of other cmu derivatives in transfer rna the CpG cmumap may be derived from the first two positions of the anticodon sequence of a yeast trna species recognizing an nua codon this predicts that omethylcarbamoylmethyluridine will be found in an isoleucine leucine or valine isoacceptor
402,binding of hnorgestrel to human plasma proteins has been investigated norgestrel showed greater affinity to plasma than to human SS Al indicating specific NG binding proteins in the plasma AGP showed high affinity for NG when compared with human serum albumin the binding protein was eluted at ph by step by step elution on a deaecellulose column norgestrel binding to plasma proteins was not affected at degrees c the optimal binding occurred between ph and ligand specificity of the binding protein revealed that progesterone was able to compete for the norgestrel IB sites whereas corticosterone testosterone oestradiol and norethindrone acetate did not show much competition the molecular weight of the binding protein was found to be approximately SDG analysis indicated that norgestrel bound to a macromolecular component of sedimentation coefficient s the association constant kass and dissociation constant kdiss of norgestrelbinding plasma protein was found to be m and m respectively the number of IB CS was molmg protein norgestrelbinding protein in the plasma appeared to be a protein different from human serum Al corticosteroidbinding globulin and sexsteroidbinding protein this binding protein showed some similarities to alphaacid glycoprotein
403,as a model T0 to investigate the binding mechanism between thyroid hormones and carrier protein the interaction of diiodoltyrosine dit and triiodophenol iphi with bovine SS Al bsa was investigated by circular dichroism cd and fluorescence methods in both the ditbsa system and the iphibsa system induced cotton effect was observed in the wavelength region near nm this induced cotton effect was measured at various molar ratios of ligands to bsa lp the value of the ellipticity at nm theta in the iphibsa system was remarkably large compared with that of the ditbsa system and theta at an lp ratio of one was x degree cm decimole for the iphibsa system and x for the ditbsa system the binding constants for the combination of bsa with a single molecule of ligand calculated by measuring the quenching of the fluorescence of the protein were x m at degrees for the ditbsa system and x m at degrees for the ithetabsa system these results suggest that the IB of itheta to bsa is stronger than that of dit and a cleft may exist more congruent with the molecular dimensions of itheta than with those of dit
404,the pharmacological properties of chloroptoluidinoimidazolinenitrate tolonidine a new synthetic derivative of imidazoline are reported in a series of three successive articles this compound has been shown to possess hypotensive and antihypertensive properties T3 iv administration the hypotensive phase was preceded by hypertension related to the potent direct alphasympatheticomimetic properties of the product this pressor response which was not seen T3 oral administration was accompanied by a marked decrease in cardiac output and a significant increase in peripheral vascular resistance the hypotensive action of the product was due to a drop in cardiac output probably reinforced by a decrease in vasoconstrictor sympathetic tone due to a central action whatever the route of administration tolonidine slowed HR rate independently of blood pressure variations due essentially to an increase in vagal tone in studies of diuresis liquid and salt loss were observed in the cat not in the dog at doses which induce a drop in blood pressure tolonidine did not produce a reduction in pilocarpineinduced salivary secretion and only partially inhibited gastric secretion in the central nervous system tolonidine produced a sedation which first appeared at doses having an antihypertensive effect but which was only fully apparent with increased doses a decrease in the release of cerebral amines serotonin and noradrenaline by tolonidine is proposed tolonidine was compared with three other antihypertensive agents clonidine which is structurally related and guanethidine and mecamylamine which are structurally unrelated and have a different mode of action a close resemblance of the pharmacological properties of tolonidine and clonidine was established due to the chemical relationship between the two substances
405,the physiological disposition of a new orally active antiarrhythmic drug alpha alphadimethylalpha alpha beta betatetrafluorophenethylbenzylamine mk was investigated in the rat dog Rh monkey baboon and man mk was extensively absorbed after p.o. in all species fecal excretion was the major route of tracer beta in the rat and dog whereas the monkey baboon and man excreted the majority of the dose via the urine mk andor its metabolites were widely distributed in rat tissues and exhibited tissueplasma ratios greater than one in most instances the lung liver and kidney possessed a high tissue affinity for drug and metabolites the plasma and urinary profile of radioactivity indicated extensive metabolism of mk in all species less than of the plasma and urinary radioactivity was identified as unchanged drug in spite of extensive metabolic transformations a remarkable feature of this drug is its persistence in the plasma for long periods of time this is thought to be due to tissue affinity the metabolic DP for mk was essentially the same in all species the major metabolites present in the plasma and the urine were identified as the carbinol analog of mk alpha alpha beta betatetrafluorophenethylphenylpropanol i and its glucuronide conjugate other metabolites characterized in the urine and plasma were the nglucuronide of mk alpha alpha beta betatetrafluorophenethylphenylpropene ii nitroalpha alpha beta betatetrafluorophenethylphenylpropane iii alpha alphadimethylalpha alpha beta betatetrafluorophenethylbenzyl methyl ether iv and alpha alpha beta betatetrafluorophenethyl acetophenone iv two minor urinary metabolites were tentatively identified as the nhydroxy analog of mk and the glycol analog of carbinol i the in vivo formation of the methyl ether represents the first report of alkylation of a tertiary alcohol
406,the synthetic prostaglandin dimethyl e pge given by intravenous infusion at mugkgh inhibited gastric secretion of h k cl and pepsin in four fistula dogs stimulated by histamine h PG p urecholine u and deoxydglucose dg when given for min during steady infusions of nearmaximal doses of h p and u pge caused inhibition of h maximally at min and over inhibition of pepsin secretion maximally at min recovery of secretion took h T3 infusion of pge was stopped injection of kcl meqkg during inhibition of histamine by pge gave only a min transient reversal in inhibition when pge was given as background to min stepdose responses mugkg competitively inhibited histamine stimulation and mugkgh gave inhibition against pentagastrin mug pgekgh had no effect and mug caused uncompetitive inhibition against urecholine mug pgekgh caused competitive inhibition of JH pepsin was more markedly inhibited in each case there were no side effects at either dose of pge which is a potent inhibitor of gastric secretion with all forms of stimuli
407,the affinity label nbromoacetylethanolamine phosphate bracnhetop has been used previously at ph to identify his of rb muscle aldolase as an active site residue we now find that the specificity of the reagent is phdependent at ph alkylation with clabeled bracnhetop abolishes both fructosep cleavage activity and transaldolase activity the stoichiometry of incorporation the kinetics of inactivation and the protection against inactivation afforded by a competitive inhibitor or DHA phosphate are consistent with the involvement of an active site residue a comparison of c profiles obtained from chromatography on the CAA analyzer of acid hydrolysates of inactivated and protected samples reveals that inactivation results from the alkylation of lysyl residues the major peptide in tryptic digests of the inactivated enzyme has been isolated based on its amino acid composition and the known CS of ALD lys is the residue preferentially alkylated by the reagent aldolase modified at his is still subject to alkylation of lysine thus lys and his are not mutually exclusive sites however ALD modified at lys is not subject to alkylation of histidine one explanation of these observations is that modification of lys abolishes the IB capacity of aldolase for substrates and substrate analogs bracnhetop whereas modification of his does not consistent with this explanation is the ability of aldolase modified at his to form a SB with substrate and the inability of ALD modified at lys to do so therefore lys could be one of the cationic CG that functions in electrostatic binding of the substrates phosphate CG
408,nhydroxyacetylaminofluorene nohaaf ST is an enzyme that catalyzes the sulfate transfer from the active sulfate phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate paps to nohaaf to form a highly reactive product acetylaminofluorene nsulfate it has been purified about fold with a yield of over from adult spraguedawley male rat livers by an eightstep procedure the final preparation was homogeneous on analytrical disc gel PACE the purified enzyme had activity toward pnitrophenol with an approximately fold increase in specific activity over the crude homogenate but it had almost no detectable activity toward steroids such as estrone betaestradiol testosterone dehydroisoandrosterone and corticosterone there was also very little sulfation activity toward serotonin and ltyrosine methyl ester the optimal ph for the enzyme activity is approximately when measured in sodium phosphate buffer mg at to mm could increase the enzyme activity up to mn activated the enzyme only slightly at very low concentrations zn co cu and ni were all strongly inhibitory but ca had very little effect thiol compounds were found to have a stabilizing effect and thiolblocking reagents were potent inhibitors for this enzyme the pure enzyme was very unstable especially in diluet solutions the isoelectric point pl of the enzyme is the molecular weight of the native enzyme was as estimated by sephadex g and g gel filtrations a single component with molecular weight of was observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel PACE in the absence and presence of mercaptoethanol comparison of the enzyme activity in mail and female rat livers at each stage of purification revealed that there was only a trace amount of nohaaf sulfotransferase present in the female rat liver
409,eighteen patients with angina pectoris who had previously participated in a crossover study with mg metoprolol tid and placebo have been included in this T0 during an introductory sixmonth open tolerability study all patients were treated with mg MET tid and during a subsequent crossover study the efficacy of this dose was compared with that of placebo under doubleblind conditions an exercise was performed at the end of each crossover period MET in a dose of mg tid gave a significant improvement compared with placebo in respect of the number of anginal attacks nitroglycerin consumption and daily subjective assessment of the patients anginal PS metoprolol also gave a significant increase in exercise capacity both until the appearance of mm st segment depression and until the end of exercise heart rate and blood pressure were reduced both at rest and during exercise no severe unwanted effects were observed during this study ranging over eight months and none of the patients had any signs or symptoms of cardiac failure or pulmonary dysfunction on any occasion unwanted effects reported were mild to moderate and the frequency was the same as during PL treatment no abnormal laboratory findings were observed and the relative HV was not significantly changed administration of mg metoprolol tid seems to be of greater benefit than mg metoprolol tid previously investigated in these patients
410,evidence was sought during of persistence of equinevirulent venezuelan encephalitis ve virus in regions of central america that were heavily involved in the epidemicequine epizootic of a four sentinel horses were exposed in an arid upland region of the atlantic drainage of guatemala during augustoctober but no horse became INF b the epicenter region of the outbreak in southwestern guatemala and southwestern el salvador was studied during july february no antibody developed in sentinel horses sentinel hamsters did not die mosquitoes yielded no virus wild rats had no detectable ve virus hi antibody unexplained decreases in populations of wild terrestrial mammals possibly limited maintenance of ve virus however mosquitoes were plentiful and present in the same species composition found at a focus of enzootic ve virus about km northwest of the epicenter region c in studies at two guatemalan ranches near the epicenter where horses died in ve viruse infected sentinel horses along one of three lakes on one ranch during the wet season of but not during the dry or wet seasons of the titers of neutralizing antibodies in these four horses were higher against an enzootic CS of ve virus than against an epizootic strain during and ve virus was isolated from sentinel hamsters exposed at a marsh on the other ranch but vero plaque characteristics were those of enzootic ve virus d the only epizootic activity of ve virus discovered in central america in occurred in nicaragua between april and june several hundred horses died and n antibody like that engendered by epizootic virus was found in two young unvaccinated horses whether this represented persistence of epizootic ve virus or reintroduction of virus is unknown
411,subacute effects of c t s or b CT or in combination with a were tested against p in two doubleblind crossover trials with healthy students the drugs were given in capsules tid for weeks each and the psychomotor performance choice reaction coordination attention was measured on the th and th days of treatment at each session the subjects swallowed a capsule together with gkg of a or p drink and the measurements were done and min thereafter t alone did not differ from placebo in the doses used mg tid for days and mg tid for the next days after c dosing as above and s mg tid both reactive and coordinative skills were slightly impaired b mg tid clearly impaired both reactive skills and attention t a had no major combined effect on skills while c interacted with a resulting in impaired reactive and coordinative skills T3 c a the subjects were unable of compensating their coordination mistakes by slow driving the interaction of s with a was mild whereas b a strongly impaired coordination and divided attention no alterations were recorded in flicker fusion after any treatment
412,aldrin epoxidation and dihydroisodrin hexachloroendoendotetracyclo dodecene dhi hydroxylation have been studied in ml CL monooxygenase S9 CL biopsy specimens of rhesus macaca mulatta and bonnet m radiata monkeys obtained with a mm menghini needle were the primary enzyme sources dieldrin and monohydroxydihydroisodrin dhioh were the only metabolites detected by electroncapture glc analysis of hexane extracts of incubation media incubation extraction and analysis could be done in the same vessel maximum rates were obtained in the presence of nadph and o and both transformations were inhibited by co the apparent km and vmax sd for epoxidation was x m aldrin and pmol of dieldrin per mg of protein per min and the corresponding values for hydroxylation were x m dhi and pmol of dhioh per mg of protein per min aldrin epoxidation and dhi hydroxylation activities of Rh monkey liver biopsy and rat liver S9 were evaluated after phenobarbital treatment the assay procedures can be used in protocols in which animals serve as their own controls
413,in acute experiments on cats anesthetized with urethane and kept under controlled respiration the mechanism of tonic activity of the pulmonary vessels was studied in the presence of a decreased partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli the tonicity of the pulmonary vessels was recorded during autoperfusion of the vessels of the posterior lobe of the left lung by means of a perfusion pump simultaneously the pressure in the common carotid artery was recorded and the oxygen saturation of the blood was measured pharmacological analysis was used for the T0 of the mechanism of the pressor reaction of the pulmonary vessels under hypoxic hypoxy and it demonstrated that the pression of the pulmonary vessels that develops under alveolar hypoxy is less distinct under the effect of the ganglioblocking agent benzohexonium as well as the myotropic agents papaverine and chloracizine the above reaction was significantly inhibited by the blocking agents of the d and mserotoninreactive structures dihydroergothamine morphine and novocain and it was CR lacking against the background of the action of izadrine and dimedrol blocking agents of serotonin and histaminereactive structures it can be supposed that the d and mserotoninreactive and probably also the histaminereactive structures participate in the regulation of the interrelationship of ventilation and pulmonary circulation
414,an improved procedure of purification of serinesulfhydrase from chicken CL is described preparations of enzyme fold purification with the yield of per cent from total activity have been obtained homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis molecular weight of serinesulfhydrase is mole of enzyme contains moles of pyridoxalphosphate and consists apparently of subunits amino acid composition of the enzyme is studied absorption spectrum of serinesulfhydrase has a maximum at nm what is characteristic of numerous pyridoxalp enzymes the position of this maximum does not depend on ph within its range and the presence of lserine a primary enzyme ATP an essential change in the absorption spectrum of enzyme was observed in the presence of some thiol compounddlhomocysteine betamercaptoethanol and glutathione cosubstrates of the reaction and lcysteine a primary reaction ATP it is suggested that this change in the spectrum is due to the action of shcompounds on the enzyme conformation before the beginning of the enzymatic reaction or on its initial stages
415,TH from pseudomonas aeruginosa was purified to apparent homogeneity with an improved method employing affinity chromatography on naminohexyladenosine bisphosphatesepharose b PAGE of the purified transhydrogenase carried out in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate indicated a minimal molecular weight of the kinetic and regulatory properties of the purified transhydrogenase resembled those of the crude enzyme ie nadph adenosine monophosphate and ca were activators whereas nadp was inhibitory nicotinamide nucleotidespecific release of IB of the transhydrogenase to naminohexyladenosinebisphosphatesepharose and naminohexyladenosinemonophosphatesepharose suggests the presence of at least two separate binding sites for nicotinamide nucleotides one that is TPS for nadph and one that binds both nadh and nadph binding of transhydrogenase to naminohexyladenosinebisphosphatesepharose and activation of the enzyme by adenosinebisphophate showed a marked ph dependence in contrast inhibition of the caactivated enzyme by adenosine bisphosphate was virtually constant at various ph values this descrepancy was interpreted to indicate the existence of separate nucleotidebinding effector and AS sites
416,a rise in fetal paco was observed after elective cesarean section in patients anesthetized both with a barbiturate and with nitrous oxideoxygen epidural analgesia seemed to be a good alternative in order to attain better blood gas values in the newborn infant fourteen healthy mothers and their infants were studied in connection with elective cesarean section epidural analgesia with plain bupivacaine was used doses varied between and mg the time between the EPI i.t. and delivery was around min in six cases the fetal heart rate was registered continuously most of the mothers were sedated with diazepam intravenously or fully anesthetized after delivery the mothers were interviewed later the respiratory adaptation of the infants was studied by blood gas and acidbase measurements in repeated arterial samples during the first hours of life a comparison was made with a group previously studied where GA with a barbiturate nitrous oxideoxygen was the method used the present material showed no differences concerning pao and paco but clearly indicated a tendency towards an earlier normalization of the initial metabolic acidosis mothers showed a respiratory alkalosis which was overcompensated by the metabolic component maternal blood pressure falls were observed in four cases and fetal effects could be detected although EPI analgesia has a more favorable effect upon the newborns metabolic component both the compared methods allow good respiratory adaptation provided they are used correctly mothers can be given the opportunity to choose between being conscious or asleep when their child is delivered
417,the effect of walker RT on sulphacetamide distribution was studied in rats days after tumor implantation in a hind leg T3 p.o. of sulphacetamide and min the concentration of the drug was found to be lower in the plasma and liver of tumorbearing rats when compared with that of control group however min T3 sulphacetamide administration the concentration of the drug in these same tissues was found to be higher in tumorbearing rats than in control animals whereas the tumor had no apparent effect on sulphacetamide concentration in the BB drug concentrations in the fat tissue of TB rats were constantly higher than those of control animals these changes in sulphacentamide disposition kinetics could be explained in part by delay in gastrointestinal absorption of the drug contrary to what was observed T3 oral administration constantly higher drug concentrations were found in the plasma of TB rats T3 iv injection of sulphacetamide furthermore the halflife of sulphacetamide in these same animals was much higher than in control animals it is concluded that in walker tumorbearing rats there are changes in the kinetics of sulphacetamide which are functions of the route of administration of the drug
418,concentrations of methaqualone have been measured in the serum of five male human subjects receiving five consecutive evening doses of a combination formulation containing methaqualone mg carbromal mg and benactyzine mg in each tablet after administration of the first dose mean peak serum concentrations of methaqualone mugml occurred at h after obtaining peak C2 mean concentrations of methaqualone declined rapidly during the next h and thereafter more slowly during the next h after administration of the last fifth dose mean Cmax of methaqualone mugml mugml above the predose level occurred at h after attaining peak levels mean concentrations of methaqualone declined rapidly during the next h and thereafter more slowly with a halflife of approximately h mean concentrations of methaqualone in SS samples h after the second third fourth or fifth doses were not significantly different mugml mugml during this period of dosing this suggests that significant accumulation of methaqualone in the SS did not occur during a period of five consecutive evening doses of the combination formulation
419,alcohol dehydrogenase has been purified from human liver by AC ultracentrifugation sephadex g chromatography and amino acid analyses of multiple preparations demonstrate homogeneity of molecular weight sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel PACE reveals a single species of molecular weight based on a molecular weight of for the dimer obtained from the amino acid composition and a molar absorptivity of anm the enzyme contains gatoms of zinc as determined by emission spectrography microwaveinduced emission and AAS inhibition by OP ethylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid and alphaalphabipyridine demonstrates that zinc is essential to enzymatic function detailed kinetic analyses using primary alcohols of the homologous series chchnoh n and the corresponding aldehydes as substrates show that km values become smaller as n increases this suggest that hydrophobic interactions play a role in substrate binding the availability of welldefined preparations of human CL alcohol dehydrogenase now allows definitive genetic and functional studies of this enzyme to elucidate human ethanol metabolism
420,the binding of suramin to bovine and human serum albumin was investigated by gel filtration and spectroscopic measurements besides some lowaffinity binding CS suramin has on the bovine serum albumin molecule one and on the human serum albumin molecule two highaffinity binding sites spectroscopic measurements reveal that there are large differences between the albumins in the mechanism of binding to the highaffinity binding sites further it is suggested that high concentrations of suramin provoke an unfolding of the albumin moleculse in order to explain the unusual behaviour of suramin in connection with the displacement of other ligands from the albumin binding the fluorescence probe anilinonaphthalenesulfonic acid ans was employed as a reporter group molecule for fluorescence as well as circular dichroism measurements by these measurements it could be shown that suramin greatly influences the microorganization of both albumin molecules in the case of these measurements large differences between bovine and human SS Al were also found
421,from a crude extract of chick peas cicer arietinum l inhibitors of TR and chymotrypsin were isolated by affinity chromatography on a column of trypsinsepharose b the content of inhibitors was found to be gkg they were further separated into six isoinhibitors by ionexchange chromatography on deaesephadex a two of the isoinhibitors accounted for about of the isolated inhibitors and were further purified to a homogeneous state the isoinhibitors had a molecular weight of about as determined by molecularsieve chromatography on sephadex g they were stable towards extremes of ph and temperatures up to degrees c or towards digestion by pepsin they were also SD in m urea but not in m guanidinehcl the intact inhibitors were destroyed when the peas were cooked at degrees c or when they were toasted at degrees c the four major inhibitors had similar amino acid compositions and did not contain detectable amounts of free sulfhydryl CG tryptophan or carbohydrate cysteine is the dominant amino acid residue in all of them and accounted for about of their amino acid content the isoelectric point of the isoinhibitors lies in the range of ph and two of the major inhibitors had isoelectric points of ph and ph they inhibited chymotrypsin to the same extent but differed in their inhibitory activities towards trypsin indicating that they are mixtures of native and trypsinmodified forms and that they probably have separate CS for the two enzymes they did not inhibit other proteolytic enzymes belonging to two groups ie serine or cysteine enzymes or originating from different sources ie animals plants or bacteria
422,adverse drug reactions adrs can be broadly classified as either a nuisance or lifethreatening voluntary reporting systems gradually accumulate a quite impressive list of suspected adrs with antihypertensive drugs as their use becomes widespread such data gives no clue to true or relative incidence the absolute and comparative incidence of adrs can only be determined fairly by a system of unbiased general data collection of adrs from which the data for AHD is then selected the boston collaborative drug surveillance program provides such a source of information data from the boston program reveals that most of the listed adrs with antihypertensive drugs occur very infrequently that nuisance adrs occur in to of patients in whom they are used and that lifethreatening adrs occur in less than adrs tend to discourage patient compliance with medication aims in selecting specific antihypertensive therapy the clinician should be mindful not only of the severity of the hypertension to be treated but also of the nature type and severity of potential adrs the personality and likely complicance of the patient and the need for patient education regarding drug effects possible unwanted effects and what measures should be taken when adrs occur
423,cultures established from mechanically dissociated neonatal mouse brains were found to be suitable for electrophysiological investigation of drug action during culture most cells were aggregated into either monolayer regions or thick cords joining ML regions a few cells remained isolated the neurones in the ML regions were distinguished from glial cells by differential staining and were found to be the best subject for intracellular recording frequency of resting MPs of these cells proved to be reproducible in cultures of the same age and were a useful index of sensitivity to bath applied drugs acetylcholine dopamine histamine serotonin and noradrenaline depolarized various neurones gaba caused hyperpolarization while glutamate and glycine had no significant effect antagonism of the responses to acetylcholine dopamine serotonin and gaba was seen using atropine PIM methysergide and bicuculline respectively it is concluded that dissociated BB neurones in culture show chemosensitivity and may be useful in further pharmacological studies
424,the lacrimal gland glandula orbitalis externa of rat contains both peroxidase and catalase and was used as a model for PSA and cytochemical distinction between peroxidase and catalase both enzymes were isolated by ammonium sulfate precipitation from tissue homogenates and the effects of fixation with glutaraldehyde and various conditions of incubation were investigated colorimetrically using dab as hydrogen donor the LG peroxidase is strongly inhibited by glutaraldehyde treatment in contrast for catalase the fixation with glutaraldehyde is the prerequistie for demonstration of its peroxidatic activity the maximal peroxidatic activity was obtained after treatment of catalase with glutaraldehyde higher concentrations being inhibitory for LG peroxidase the Vmax of oxidation of dab is at ph whereas for catalase it is at ph the optimal concentration of ho for LG peroxidase is at m and for peroxidatic activity of catalase at m these optimal conditions obtained biochemically were applied to tissue sections of rat LG after the fixation of tissue with a low concentration of glutaraldehyde and incubation in the dab medium at neutral ph containing m ho peroxidase medium the RP was localized in the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum in elements of the golgi apparatus and in secretory granules T3 the fixation of tissue with glutaraldehyde and incubation in the dabmedium containing m ho and at ph catalase medium the IF in the endoplasmic reticulum the golgiapparatus and in secretory LG was completely inhibited and RP was localized exclusively in small mu particles similar to small peroxisomes described in various other celltypes
425,the flexibility of the tertiary structure around the active site of myosin atpase ec was studied using the reactivity of two specific thiol groups s and s as a structural probe the following four maleimide derivatives were used as thioldirected reagents nethylmaleimide nem nmethoxybenzimidazolyl methyl maleimide mbm npbenzimidazolylphenylmaleimide bipm and ndimethylaminodinitrophenylmaleimide ddpm all the maleimide derivatives used activated the caatpase activity and inhibited the edtaatpase activity like nem indicating that they modified s the rate of modification of s by nem and bipm increased with increasing ph while that by ddpm decreased bipm simultaneously modified s and s s showed much higher reactivity toward the maleimides except for bipm than did NAC naccys a low molecularweight MM compound the extremely small pka value of s accounted for this high reactivity in addition the atpinduced increase in its reactivity inducated that s was in a buried state kinetic analysis showed that the teritiary structure around s at ALP ph differed from that at acidic ph the apparent rate constant of smodification with nem was approximately one sevenhundredth and one fourhundredth of those of s and naccys respectively fluorimetric studies using bipm revealed that s in the buried state was exposed upon adding atp this was compensated by the burying of some other thiol groups sp nonlinearity of the arrhenius plots of the reaction rate of s suggested that the s region of S1 had different conformations at high and low temperatures the transition temperature being degrees this nonlinearity completely disappeared in the presence of mgatp on the other hand arrhenius plots for the thiols reactive to bipm did not show nonlinearity in the presence or absence of atp
426,in six healthy male volunteers at sea level pb torr we measured ph and pco in cerebrospinal fluid csf and in arterial and jugular bulb blood from these data we estimated pco and ph for the intracranial portion of csf the measurements were repeated after days in a hypobaric chamber pb torr both lumbar and intracranial csf were significantly more alkaline at simulated altitude than at sea level decrease in hco in lumbar csf at altitude was similar to that in BP both at sea level and at high altitude pco measured in the lumbar csf was higher than that estimated for the intracranial csf at ALT hyperoxia in comparison with breathing room air resulted in an increase in intracranial pco and a decrease in the estimated ph in intracranial csf with hyperoxia at altitude alveolar ventilation was significantly higher than during sealevel hyperoxia or normoxia confirming that a degree of acclimatization had occurred changes in cerebral arteriovenous differences in co measured in three subjects suggest that CBF blood flow may have been elevated after days at altitude
427,one hundred and twentyeight SDRs were each anesthetized with one of four anaesthetics and subjected to a standard hemorrhage protocol to determine the effects of anesthetics on survival following hemorrhage the anesthetics studied were HAL vol per cent fluroxene vol per cent pentobarbital mgkg ip ketamine mgkg im MAP pressure was conrolled at torr during minutes of hemorrhage cumulative survival rates were determined at the end of hemorrhage and hr hr hr and days after hemorrhage twentyfourhour survival rates were halothane per cent fluroxene per cent pentobarbital per cent ketamine per cent sevenday survival rates were halothane per cent fluroxene per cent pentobarbital per cent ketamine per cent survival rates were significantly higher p less than in animals anesthetized with ketamine compared with survival rates associated with the other anesthetics longterm hr and sevenday survival rates were significantly p less than lower in animals anesthetized with fluroxene microscopic examination of livers and small intestines revealed significantly fewer p less than athologic changes in the splanchnic organs of hemorrhaged rats anesthetized with ketamine compared with animals anesthetized with the other drugs
428,the anatomy of the pharynx of caenorhabditis elegans has been reconstructed from electron micrographs of serial sections the pharynx is used for pumping food into the gut and is composed of muscle cells marginal cells epithelial cells gland cells and neurones three regions of specialization in the cuticle lining of the pharyngeal lumen may aid in the accumulation of food particles a basement membrane isolates the pharynx from the rest of the animal making the pharyngeal NS a nearly selfcontained unit which is composed primarily of five classes of motor neurones and six classes of interneurones three other classes have also been described which by their morphology appear to be neurosecretory and motor motor and interneuronal and lastly one pair that only innervates three of the marginal cells some classes of neurone have free endings just under the cuticle lining the lumen of the pharynx suggesting that these are mechano or proprioreceptive endings the connectivity of these neurones has been described at the level of individual synaptic regions and after combining this information with video taped observations of the pharynx pumping some interpretations of how these neurones CF have been offered
429,the literature and the findings from the camarillo schizophrenia research project reported in this paper indicate that a satisfactory method for predicting the response of an individual schizophrenic patient to antipsychotic drugs has yet to be devised a test dose procedure is described which offers promise of a practical approach to selecting the most appropriate drug and dosage for a particular patient and tailoring blood concentrations to the needs of the individual case preliminary findings indicate that the test dose procedure is feasible that detectable changes occur after a single test dose and that measurements made during the test dose period may be predictive of eventual outcome these findings are of course only a report of a preliminary pilot experiment subject to important caveats about small number of cases interpretation of C1 numbers of rho coefficients and need for CV nevertheless they are encouraging and suggest that the test dose approach has considerable potential for further research
430,rats were given access AL to various concentrations to mgml of methadone hydrochloride dissolved in sucrose solution the ndemethylation of various narcotics was studied in hepatic preparations from methadoneconsuming rats in order to determine if there was ATP specificity for the microsomal demethylase system the vmax for the ndemethylation of methadone ethylmorphine and meperidine was increased by whereas that for morphine ndemethylation was reduced to of the control value additive or synergistic effects on microsomal cytochrome p content were seen when methadone consumption was supplemented by administration of maximally inducing doses of either methylcholanthrene mc or phenobarbital pb this suggested that there was an increase in a type of cytochrome p which was independent of that induced by pb or mc the qualitative change in cytochrome p reflected in the ethylisocyanide binding spectrum was also apparent T3 treatment with MTD pb or mc and the combination of MTD and pb exhibited effects that differed from pb CT twosubstrate kinetic analysis with methadone and morphine as substrates indicated that more than one enzymic system may be involved in the ndemethylation reaction and that a common component of this ndemethylase system could not be induced with phenobarbital however MTD and meperidine seem to be demethylated by the same enzymic system
431,to characterize further a putative dopamine receptor in the renal artery the effects of dopamine on canine renal artery adenylate cyclase activity were studied since the femoral artery is thought to be devoid of a similar dopamine receptor the effects of dopamine on the adenylate cyclase activity of the canine femoral artery were also studied in tissues from dogs with or without phenoxybenzamine pretreatment renal artery adenylate cyclase was maximally stimulated by mum dopamine compared to mum required for the FA i.a. enzyme the concentrations of isoprenaline required to maximally stimulate renal and femoral artery adenylate cyclase were and mum respectively in tissue from the phenoxybenzaminepretreated dog the sitmulatroy effect of dopamine on the renal artery enzyme was selectively blocked by mum haloperidol but not by mum propranolol in the femoral artery however the dopamine stimulation was blocked by both antagonists stimulation by isoprenaline of renal and FA adenylate cyclase was blocked by propranolol these data suggest the concept that dopamine interacts with a specific artery receptor apparently different from alphaand betaadrenoceptors
432,there was a high activity of alkaline phosphatase in the blood plasma of piglets during the first few days of live enzyme obtained at this time had high heat stability and was readily inhibited by lphenylalanine mm the enzyme in blood was inhibited to a greater extent than alkaline phosphatase from intestinal mucosa with increasing age there was a fall in heat stability and in the ease with that the enzyme could be inhibited by phenylalanine the proportion of ALP phosphatase derived from bone and present in blood plasma increased with increasing age two isoenzymes were detected in liver kidney lung intestinal mucosa and endometrial mucosa by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel heat lability and inhibition by phenylalanine were good criteria for differentiating different types of alkaline phosphatase in pigs in the case of alkaline phosphatase in BP disodium phenylphosphate was split more readily than pnitrophenyl phosphate and very much more readily than phenolphthalein diphosphate and betaglycerophosphate
433,we studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during and comparing with other antibiotics beta hemolytic streptococci pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci staph aureus and staph epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin and no resistant strain to this drug was found haemophilus influenzae h parainfluenzae and h parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin and there is no resistant CS to this drug escherichia coli klebsiella citrobacter serratia and five species of proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin a few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in e coli citrobacerr serratia pr morganii and pr rettgeri pr inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of proteus antibacterial activity of gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger gentamicinresistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few
434,"two rb EA CS kinases gtpcasein kinase i and gtpcasein kinase ii have been purified and fold respectively studies employing sucrose density gradient centrifugation indicate that kinase i has a molecular weight of about s and kinase ii about s these enzymes can utilize either atp or gtp as the phosphoryl donor among various protein substrates examined these kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of CS greater than dephosphorylated phosvitin congruent to dephosphorylated casein greater than phosvitin histones protamine and bovine SS albumin are poor phosphoryl acceptors kinetic data indicate that both enzymes are inhibited by high CS substrate concentrations which may be partially relieved by nacl both phosphotransferases require mg for activity and are optimally AS at ph the enzymes have apparent km values of m for gtp m for atp and mgml for CS the incorporation of the terminal phosphate of gtp into casein as catalyzed by these enzymes is inhibited to varying degrees by atp itp adp and gdp but not by utp ctp gmp adenosine cyclic monophosphate and guanosine cyclic monophosphate in addition naf and diphosphoglyceric acid are also found to inhibit the activity of both kinases the effect of 2,3-DPG is interesting and suggests that this metabolite may regulate the activity of the CS kinases in the red blood cells"
435,sodium acetate ac is routinely used in dialysis solutions in hemodialysis units as it provides a ready source of fixed base the renal dynamics of the buffer salt are not well known anesthetized dogs received iv infusions of ac at a rate of to mueqkgmin urinary ac and bicarbonate excretion was measured and correlated with pah and creatinine clearance and urinary electrolyte excretion ac appeared in the urine as quickly as it was detected in the plasma its excretion gradually increased and tended to parallel bicarbonate excretion pah clearance increased with the advent of ac infusion plasma ph and bicarbonate increase as ac is introduced ac infusion caused an immediate drop in blood pressure the systolic blood pressure returned to control in min there was a more gradual return in Pd we conclude that ac is filtered and excreted into the urine at low plasma levels and has a low renal threshold
436,in order to clarify whether or not trimetoquinol tmq and isoproterenol iso interact with the same receptor the pa values of propranolol pr and certain trimethoxybenzene derivatives were measured using isolated guinea pig tracheal chains each of pr mescaline mes and its derivatives gave almost the same pa values for tmq and iso introduction of an alkyl group into the n atom of mes increased the affinity to the receptor in the order of methyl and isopropyl as well as the structureactivity relationship of catecholamines while that of hydroxyl group in the betaposition of the side chain decreased pa values the slopes of the regression lines for antitmq action of mes derivatives as well as pr were almost one but those for their antiiso action were less than trimethoxyaniline and trimethoxybenzoic acid had little activity as betablocking agents these results suggest the possibility that tmq and iso would interact with the same receptor CS the importance of the trimethoxybenzene and the phenethylamine moieties in the mesderivatives for antitmq action is discussed
437,the values of vmax and km for the three genetic variants a b and a of erythrocyte glucosephosphate dehydrogenase have been determined at different ph values in the range from to and at four different temperatures in the range from degrees the log vmax versus ph curve for each of the enzymes shows a monotonic increase between ph and and a plateau from ph upwards these curves and their temperature dependence are compatible with the presence of a single ionizable group which in its conjugate acid form renders the enzymesubstrate complex inactive the pk of this group is at degrees and its enthalpy of ionization is kcal mol the log km versus ph curves show a broad plateau between ph and interrupted by a sharp minimum at ph for variant b while variants a and a show sharp maxima at ph and respectively it is proposed that this unusual behavior depends on the dissociation of the tetrameric enzyme to dimers in this ph region specifically it is shown that a sharp maximum or minimum of km can arise if cooperative uptake or release of protons is linked to dimer formation and if the degree of cooperativity is different for the free enzyme compared to the enzymesubstrate complex the ph dependence of the equilibrium between the tetrameric and the dimeric form of the enzyme has been determined by gel filtration for the same three genetic SCV b a and a in PA with previous ultracentrifugal data the enzyme is a tetramer in acid solution and a dimer in alkaline solution the ph at which half of the enzyme is in dimeric form under our exp conditions is for SCV a and b and for variant a these ph values correspond closely for all three SCV to the sharp extrema in the ph dependence of their km values for glucose phosphate from the measured dissociation equilibria it can be inferred that the tetramerdimer transition entails cooperative release of protons the degree of cooperativity estimated from these data agrees closely with the independent estimate based on the ph dependence of km
438,ionpair chromatography offers attractive possibilities in pharmaceutical analysis the specificity of the separation systems can be varied over a wide range by appropriate selection of the stationary phase the choice of a suitable counterion can also drastically improve the PCD limit permitting the determination of drug substances in low dosage and possibly of byproducts or breakdown products ionpair chromatography of tropane and ergot alkaloids has been investigated using picrate as counterion alumina kieselguhr and various grades of ODS have been tested as supports partition properties studied in a batch procedure have been compared with the actual chromatographic conditions columns cm filled with silical gel particle size mum pore size a show the best performance in the separation of hyoscyamine scopolamine and ergotamine as picrate ionpairs close control of ph and temperature is essential for reproducible separations improvements in PCD limits between and times have been observed with these systems ionpair extractions of these alkaloids from dosage forms can be used for sample preparation prior to i.t. on the the column this provides an added degree of selectivity and sensitivity
439,type iii pneumococcal polysaccharide siii and bacterial lipopolysaccharide lps were used to evaluate b cell and t cell regulatory functions in balbc sjlj and ch mice of various ages it was found that the balbc and ch mice could mount high level plaqueforming cell pfc responses to siii at various ages through weeks whereas the C2 of the sjlj pfc responses had begun to decline by the age of weeks through the age of weeks balbc mice were also capable of producing strong pfc responses to lps at various ages through weeks whereas the comparable sjlj pfc responses to lps had declined by weeks of age by using antilymphocyte SS als and lowdose paralysis to siii it was shown that suppressor t cell activity was apparently greater in young balbc mice than in older balbc mice it was also found that paralysis to siii in balbc mice was easier to achieve at an early age sjlj mice were found to have the necessary b cell activity to respond to siii through weeks of age and the pfc responses could be greatly enhanced by als implications of the roles of regulatory t cells in aging are discussed
440,iodoaminodideoxyuridinentriphosphate aidutp a phosphoramidate analog of iododideoxyuridine triphosphate idutp was synthesized and some of its chemical and biological properties were investigated although aidutp is stable in ALP solutions below ph it undergoes degradation by a novel phosphorylysis reaction which exhibits first order kinetics inclusion of magnesium ion in the reaction mixture decreased the rate of degradation protonation of a group on aidutp which has a pka of presumably the secondary ionized oxygen on the gamma phosphate precedes phosphorylysis the only detectable reaction products are the nucleoside iodoaminodideoxyuridine aidurd and trimetaphosphate a mechanism for the acid catalyzed phosphorylysis of aidutp is proposed aidutp like ttp converts escherichia coli thymidine kinase into an inactive dimer with a sedimentation coefficient of s aidutp is however fold more potent as an allosteric inhibitor than is ttp at ph although the GABA effect of ttp is markedly reduced at high ph the activity of aidutp is lowered only slightly the allosteric effects of aidutp also differ from those of idutp which is an inhibitor at low ph but a strong activator above ph iododeoxycytidine triphosphate a potent enzyme activator cannot completely reverse the aidutp inhibition even when present at a fold molar excess
441,four benzomorphans which have potent antinociceptive activity in the hotplate and writhing tests in the mouse but do not suppress or precipitate withdrawal symptoms in the morphinedependent monkey have been examined for their pharmacological actions in the guineapig ileum and mouse vas deferens in the guineapig ileum their agonist potencies are to times greater than that of normorphine of morphine whereas in the mouse VD their potencies relative to morphine are to they exhibit no antagonist activity in either preparation benzomorphans which substitute for morphine in the morphinedependent monkey do not show such differences between their relative potencies in the guineapig ileum and mouse vas diferens the relative potencies of the four benzomorphans to inhibit stereospecific hdihydromorphine binding by membrane fragments from rat brain are more closely related to their relative agonist potencies in the mouse VD than to those found in the guineapig ileum in order to antagonize the agonist actions of these benzomorphans naloxone is required in concentrations which are to times higher than those needed for the antagonism of normorphine or morphine or of benzomorphans which suppress abstinence in morphinedependent monkeys it may be possible to use the three assays namely ratio of relative agonist potency in mouse vas deferens to that in guineapig ileum ratio of relative agonist potency to relative affinity to opiate receptors and the concentration of nalozone required for antagonism for the prediction of the potential of new compounds to produce physical dependence
442,axenic washed conidia of fusarium solani f sp phaseoli aspergillus flavus and verticillium alboatrum were placed on washed difco purified agar discs along with an inorganic salt solution containing various levels of carbon and nitrogen substrates these discs were exposed to volatiles from six soils ph fusarium solani macroconidial germination was inhibited mostly by volatiles from soils of ph and but high levels of glucose and nhcl reversed this inhibition raising germination to that of nosoil nocarbon or nitrogen controls conidial germination of a flavus was inhibited mainly by volatiles from high ph and soils and increased levels of glucose plus an CAA mixture nullified this inhibition volatiles from soils of ph and stimulated a flavus conidial germination assays after the removal of co from the air above soil of ph demonstrated that volatiles inhibitory to a flavus were produced by this soil assays indicated that a kohsoluble compound was a fungistatic soil volatile to f solani macroconidial germination the nullification by carbon and nitrogen substrates of f solani and a flavus inhibition caused by soil volatiles parallels that for soil fungistasis conidial germination of v alboatrum was markedly stimulated by volatiles in all soils tested and was not affected by removal of co inhibitory soil volatiles may increase the nutritional requirements for spore germination of certain fungi
443,the most important observations in the present T0 can be summarized as follows in horizontal and bipolar cells blocking chemical transmission caused membrane potential changes of the same polarity as the responses to illumination in each cell type acceleration of transmitter release from the receptor terminals depolarized the horizontal cells which is the opposite polarity to the light response stimulation by transretinal current flowing from receptor side to vitreous side depolarized the receptor terminals and triggered transmitter PR which in turn evoked transient postsynaptic potentials in horizontal and bipolar cells the polarity of the postsynaptic responses was the opposite to that of the lightevoked responses in each type of cell hyperpolarization of the receptor terminals by the current of relatively long duration flowing from vitreous side to receptor side reduced the transmitter release as demonstrated by the horizontal cell hyperpolarization from these observations it is inferred that the receptors release the transmitter in the dark and that the transmission depolarizes horizontal and offcenter BCs by increasing membrane permeability chiefly to na and hyperpolarizes the oncenter BP cell by decreasing membrane permeability to na
444,a simple radioactivesubstrate CA for PGS ec which uses tlc to measure simultaneously different prostaglandins synthesized from one precursor substrate was developed rabbit kidneymedulla PGS catalyses the formation of prostaglandin e prostaglandin falpha and prostaglandin d from AA fractionation of crude homogenates indicated that the microsomal fraction possessed the highest specific activity of prostaglandin synthase whereas the soluble fraction exhibited little enzyme activity but rather contained a heatlabile inhibitory macromolecular factors which might be attributed to the SS Al present in this fraction the microsomal fraction possessed low intrinsic enzyme activity but the actvity could be fully stimulated by the presence of both gsh reduced glutathione and a phenolic cofactor only cysteine could partially replace gsh whereas other thiols were inactive and some were even inhibitory a variety of phenolic compounds including CAs dopamine dihydroxyphenethylamine hydroxytryptamine and quinol were AS in stimulating PGS in all cases the stimulation was reflected in the synthesis of all three prostaglandins with ratios not significantly altered by different phenolic cofactors the synthesis of each of the different prostaglandins appeared to have similar ph optima the enzyme system was not inhibited by thiolgroup inhibitors or a variety of metal chelators except for cyanide and hydroxyquinoline characterization of the kidneymedulla prostaglandin synthase system indicated that it exhibited properties similar to those of the enzyme system present in seminal vesicles
445,acute aneurysms and other morphologically defined cardiac lesions were produced in frogs by isoproterenol ipr as previously described samples from lesions verified in vivo and from macroscopically normal ventricular areas together with samples from nontreated control animals were analyzed for total water content inulin space phe and phi by using dmoc and inulinh total cardiac tissue water content was increased in all types of lesions after ipr injection the highest content was found in bulging noncontractile aneurysms in space was enlarged in all HR muscle specimens from iprtreated animals including those without macroscopically visible lesions those specimens with aneurysms showed the greatest degree of enlargement the phephi did not differ between injected and noninjected animals and the noncontractile samples from aneurysms did not differ from other lesions and macroscopically intact areas in iprinjected animals there was no difference in phi between macroscopically damaged and nondamaged segments of ventricle wall on comparing these animals to controls however a slight shift to the alkaline side for both phi and phe was observed the phephi was higher in skeletal muscle than in HR muscle in both iprtreated and nontreated animals tissue water increased in skeletal muscle after ipr i.t. reflecting a change of intracellular water as inulin space was maintained
446,conformational changes accompanying the different modes of aggregation of tobacco mosaic virus protein tmvprotein were investigated using circular dichroism cd and absorption difference spectra in the range of aromatic absorption comparing wildtype protein and mutant ni tyr leads to cys a tentative localization of aromatic amino acids in the threedimensional structure is rendered possible in all modes of aggregation the cd spectra are determined by intrasubunit interactions between aromatic residues in particular trp and trp as well as tyr tyr and tyr the trptrp interaction was found to be highly CS towards changes of the quaternary structure especially with respect to helical aggregates this suggests that the environment of the two tryptophan residues is of crucial importance in the threedimensional structure of the S1 in the course of aggregation intersubunit interactions compete with the specific intrasubunit trptrp interactions it is suggested that try and tyr form hydrogen bonds in a strongly hydrophobic environment formation of the double disc decreases the rotatory strength pointing to an increase in conformational flexibility spectroscopic and chemical evidence prove that tyr tyr and tyr are in close neighbourhood double disc formation by lowering the ph ph leads to i m or increasing the ionic strength ph i leads to m is reflected by identical spectral effects in the environment of tyr tyr however the interaction between trp and trp indicates significant differences in the conformation which may be important for the formation of higher aggregates ie lockwashers helices and stacked discs
447,gustatory hairs were investigated on the legs and mouthparts of culiseta inornata williston diptera culicidae one type of hair each innervated by four neurons was found on the legs two of the neurons responded to nacl stimulation one neuron to water stimulation and one neuron to sucrose stimulation three kinds of hairs designated type i t type t and type t were analyzed on the labella the t hairs are innervated by one sugar neuron one mechanoreceptor two salt SN and one water neuron the t hairs are innervated by two salt neurons and one mechanoreceptor the t hairs located on the oral surface of the labella are innervated by a variable number of neurons precise ID of the t chemosensory neurons was not made because of the small size and inaccessibility of the t hairs chemosensory hairs on the tip of the labrum were tested electrophysiologically the sequence of decreasing effeectiveness for the three salts tested was kcl greater than nacl greater than licl labral chemoreceptors also responded positively to sucrose
448,the interstitial fluid pressure of the submucosa of the gastric fundus was monitored by means of guytons capsules in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital the intracapsular pressure icp was measured during secretion produced by a hypertonic solutions placed inside the stomach b arterial hypertension mmhg applied during intraarterial infusion of histamine and c intraarterial infusion of acetylcholine the first procedure did not modify the icp on the other hand whenever interstitial fluid appeared in the gastric lumen during hypertension plus histamine the mean icp increased mostly due to augmented capillary filtration the hydraulic coefficient measured in these experiments was at least orders of magnitude larger than the respective osmotic coefficient the action of acetylcholine was complex large doses enlarged the net capillary filtration but small doses increased the mean icp by muscle stimulation only contraction of the MM might be the most important mechanism underlying bulk flow of interstitial fluid in physiological conditions it is concluded that hydraulic gradients across the epithelium might account for the secretion of ALP juice
449,urinary arylsulphatases ec a and b were increased in male rats fasted for hours excretion of non dialysable protein nitrogen decreased whereas creatinine excretion increased on refeeding diet arylsulphatase a activity was restored to normal whereas arylsulphatase b was not normalised a single oral supplementation of vitamin a acetate iu to rats fasted for hours resulted in a significant reduction of both arylsulphatase a and b eventhough no further reduction of protein nitrogen excretion was evident in vitamin a deficient male rats significant reduction in urinary excretion of both arylsulphatases a and b occured in a smaller number of female rats depression of only arylsulphatase a was observed this effect of vitamin a deficiency leading to reduced urinary arylsulphatase activity was evident even at the weight plateau stage when no reduction in FI or growth had occurred these results suggest a possible direct or indirect role for vitamin a on urinary excretion DP of arylsulphatases presumably released from lysosomes of tissues
450,approximately week was required to stabilize the extragonadal sperm reserves in stallions ejaculated daily for weeks the true daily sperm output of a stallion was equal to the mean daily sperm SO of seven ejaculates x spermatozoa mean concentrations of spermatozoaml and number of spermatozoaejaculate were higher p less than for x and xweek ejaculation frequencies than for a xweek frequency sperm outputweek was nearly identical for a xweek frequency sperm outputweek was nearly identical for the x and x frequencies and higher p less than than the x frequency increase of ejaculation frequency from one to two ejaculatesday twice weekly significantly p less than raised the output of spermatozoaweek gelfree semen volume spermatozoaml and number of spermatozoaejaculate were higher p less than in the first than in the second ejaculate collection of semen on alternate days would be a practical ejaculation frequency for inseminating mares two ejaculates collected twice a week would be a practical ejaculation frequency for longterm storage of stallion semen
451,benzoapyrene and benza anthrancene which in contrast to the kregion epoxides BP oxide and benzaanthracene oxide are not mutagenic to salmonella typhimurium ta in the absence of mammalian enzyme S9 were activated by CL microsomes from ch mice which had not received any pretreatment to mutagens reverting this tester CS to histidine prototrophy addition of epoxide hydratase inhibitors greatly increased this mutagenicity and addition of pure epoxide hydratase reduced it by more than down to the range of spontaneous mutations as observed in absence of any added mutagen this demonstrates than the metabolic pathway responsible for the mutagenicity of both polycyclic hydrocarbons observed in this system proceeds entirely via an epoxidation pathway and that the responsible metabolites are epoxides or species arising from them moreover further metabolism by epoxide hydratase does not lead to produce contributing to the mutagenicity observed with the tester strain used finally the epoxides relevant for the observed mutagenicity are substrates for epoxide hydratase indeed modest amounts of the pure enzyme can prevent the mutagenic effect
452,the effects of acidic and intestinal proteolytic environments on bovine milk xanthine oxidase xo activity were determined in order to evaluate the extent to which this enzyme was absorbed in biologically active form the inhibition of xo by folic acid and the relative affinities of xo for the oxidation of palmitaldehyde stearaldehyde and xanthine were compared the effects of acid and gastric juice on xo activity were measured by incubating purified enzyme and nonpurified enzyme milk in buffers ranging in ph from to fresh gastric juice was also incubated with milk increasing amounts of the enzyme were inactivated as the ph of the incubation mixture was reduced below ph below ph the enzyme was CR inactivated gastric juice ph juice incubated with milk milk xo activity was reduced when mild was incubated with an equal volume of gastric juice homogenized milk had less xo activity compared with raw molk fresh raw milk xo homogenized milk xo and purified xo were equally susceptible to inactivation by acid or gastric juice T3 incubation of milk with gastric juice or gastric juice followed by pancreatin xo activity was associated with a macromolecule of daltons molecular weight and subunits containg activity were not found it was estimated that of the xo in the intestine was absorbed both folic acid and allopurinol inhibited xo activity in vitro allopurinol was times more potent an inhibitor than folic acid a large excess of dietary folic acid did not reduce rat liver or intestinal xo activity in vivo xo had a much greater affinity for xanthine than for palmitaldehyde or stearaldehyde substrates it was estimated that of mg of xo in fresh raw milk mg remained after homogenization mg entered the intestine and only ng were absorbed as IN enzyme
453,the ph and pco values measured by the astrup technique were compared in CSF fluid csf obtained using two different sampling techniques a direct or in vivo technique and the widely accepted syringe sampling technique in pairs of measurements in dogs it was found that the ph was always overestimated and the pco always underestimated in the syringe sample when compared to the in vivo sample the equations describing the relationships are as follows ph syringe ph in vivo and pco syringe pco in vivo the amount by which the syringe sample underestimated the true pco value increased with the absolute pco value consistent with the possibility of there being a diffusional loss of co during the transfer of csf from the syringe to the ph electrode pco in vivo pco syringe and mmhg at in vivo pcos of and mmhg this study indicates that the technique used for sampling csf is crucial to the expected accuracy of the results and that the number of transfers of csf during the sampling and measurement procedures should be minimized in order to obtain reliable results
454,the authors report on the drug benorylate which is available in the federal republic under the name of benortan acetamidophenylacetoxybenzoat numerous examinations have shown that it is well tolerated by mouth and that it has beneficial clinical effects with few side effects benorylate is a neutral fatsoluble waterinsoluble substance which upon absorption is almost completely hydrolyzed into salicylate and paracetamol patients with classical SP rheumatoid ICA and with a highly AS synovialitis of one or both knee joints not previously treated received g of a benorylate suspension orally twice daily over a period of days on different days at exactly determined times of drug administration blood and on the day of synovectomy synovial fluid and synovial tissue were taken and frozen to degrees c and subsequently examined as to the content of salicylate PAR and unchanged benorylate the plasma C2 of salicylate and paracetamol were generally distinctly higher than the concentrations of these metabolites in the synovial fluid benorylate which is practically not detectable in blood is found in the synovial tissue and is detectable in greatest quantities in the most inflamed synovial villi benorylate can probably penetrate into the synovial membrane like its metabolites salicylate and paracetamol it remains however to be examined whether the metabolites are distributed differently in different synovial Az active inflamed and unattacked synovial tissue respectively in the same way as benorylate per se
455,the effect of oxygen saturation and pco on brain uptake of glucose analogues was studied in rabbits using a modified oldendorf technique clabeled gl analogues with a ho reference standard were introduced into the CBF circulation via the common i.c. and the radioactivity of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex was counted and expressed in terms of a BB uptake index bui severe hypoxia oxygen saturation less than or equal to resulted in approximately a decrease in the bui of deoxydglucose and a decrease in the bui of methyldglucose severe hypercapnia pco mm hg caused a decrease in the bui of both of these gl analogues hypercapnia superimposed on severe hypoxia had no additional effect hypocapnia pco mm hg increased the bui of methyldglucose by of the control value and this increase was extremely sensitive to competitive inhibition when bui values were plotted against ph rather than pco for the same experiments there was a good correlation with the calculated linear regression these results are compared with previous findings on pathologically induced changes in brain uptake of glucose analogues and the possible role of blood flow is considered in detail
456,a sulfonamideresistant mutant of pneumococcus sulrc displays a genetic instability regularly segregating to wild type dna extracts of derivatives of the strain possess transforming MICs for both the mutant and wildtype alleles establishing that the CS is a partial diploid the linkage of sulrc to strr a stable chromosomal marker was established thus defining a chromosomal locus for sulrc dna isolated from sulrc cells transforms two mutant recipient strains at the same low efficiency as it does a wildtype recipient although the mutant property of these strains makes them capable of integrating CP lowefficiency donor markers equally as efficiently as high efficiency markers hence sulrc must have a different basis for its low efficiency than do classical low efficiency point mutations we suggest that the dna in the region of the sulrc mutation has a structural abnormality which leads both to its frequent segregation during growth and its difficulty in efficiently mediating genetic transformation
457,the uptake of hexoses by chlorella vulgaris is accompanied by the uptake of protons for deoxyglucose a stoichiometry of one proton taken up per sugar molecule has been measured whereas for deoxyglucose approximately two protons are taken up per sugar molecule it was found that in the presence of deoxyglucose a considerable proportion of carrier catalyzes the transport of protons without the concomitant transport of sugar presumably the IB of sugar initiates the translocation of the carrierprotonsugar complex but whereas deoxyglucose can still dissociate from the complex at the external side of the cytoplasmic membrane the translocation of the carrierproton complex continues this conclusion was reached since a the composition of the translocated carrierprotonsugar complex is the same for both sugar its formation is a first order reaction with respect to protons b when deoxyglucose present inside cells is exchanged for external sugar the exchange ratio is two to one when the external sugar is deoxyglucose two molecules of deoxyglucose are lost for each molecule of deoxyglucose entering this result indicates that during uptake of deoxyglucose statistically only each second carrier molecule appearing at the internal side of the cytoplasmic membrane is carrying sugar
458,products of mast cell degranulation as well as histamine and serotonin were added to a mishell and dutton preparation for in vitro primary immunisation induction of igm antibody formation to sheep or horse red blood cells degranulation products were either obatined beforehand by reacting passively sensitised mast cells with the corresponding antigen unrelated to or identical with the in vitro immunising antigen or liberated into the culture medium where mast cells actively sensitised to the in vitro immunising antigen had been added a to reduction of direct igm plaque forming cells was observed in all cases this reduction was prevented by antihistamine the responsible mediators were AS in the to hour period after antigen introduction the anaphylactic degranulating antibodies triggering this inhibitory activity were found to be thermolabile in one experiment an in vivoinduced mast cell degranulation led to a reduced formation of PI forming cells the enhancing and immunoregulatory activity of anaphylactic mouse antibodies is therefore tentatively and at least partially attributed to their capacity to degranulate mast cells T3 contact with the antigen
459,some properties molecular weight pi temperature stability action of selected inhibitors substrate specificity and phactivity dependence of two not yet known cathepsins from rat liver lysosomes are compared with the properties of the known cathepsin b cathepsin l is a thiolproteinase has a molecular weight of and a pi of by disc electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing there appear several protein bands which all have enzymatic activity leupeptin behaves as a strong inhibitor the phoptimum for digestion of proteins is close to cat l does not hydrolyse esters and splits synthetic low molecular substrates only to a low degree cathepsin l stored in presence of glutathion and edta in liquid nitrogen kept its activity for some months cathepsin h is an aminopeptidase as well as an endopeptidase an enzyme with these bifunctional properties was detected up to now only in e coli but not in animal cells cathepsin h is a thiolenzyme with a molecular weight of and a pi of strong inhibitors are leucylchlormethan and shblocking substances leupeptin shows only a weak inhibitory effect to this enzyme compared to its action on cathepsins l and b the phoptimum for hydrolysis of all substrates is cathepsin h splits proteins CAA derivatives and selected nprotected amino acid derivatives cat h compared to cathepsin l and b is quite temperature stable
460,a single SE to a severe stressor either cold swim or inescapable shock impairs subsequent performance in a shuttle avoidanceescape task a deficit attributed to reduction in brain noradrenergic activity produced by these stressors in the present paper exp are described which examine how repeated SE to such stressors affects a shuttle avoidanceescape performance experiment and b aspects of BB norepinephrine metabolism experiment experiment showed that whereas subjects receiving the single SE to cold swim or shock showed a large avoidanceescape deficit subjects that received repeated exposure to these stressors for days performed similarly to the control group that received no stressor experiment showed that whereas subjects that received one session of the inescapable shock stressor showed a lower level of norepinephrine in hypothalamus and cortex than did subjects that received no shock subjects that received repeated exposure to inescapable shock or cold swim showed neurochemical habituation subjects that received repeated shock showed elevated IMT hydroxylase activity and no SD of norepinephrine level and both repeated shock and cold swim caused a decrease in uptake of hnorepinephrine by slices of SC in vitro thus it is concluded that the behavioral and neurochemical changes that were observed after the stressful conditions studied are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in avoidanceescape responding following SE to these stressful events are due to changes in BB noradrenergic activity
461,catecholamines produce MI inhibition in primary cell cultures of human KCs probably via a block in the g part of the cell cycle EN produced significant mitotic inhibition at a concentration as low as x m while its analog isoproterenol produced inhibition at x m norepinephrine elicited a inhibitory response at x m one other catecholamine dopamine caused a decrease in mitosis at x m other structurally related amines to exhibit mitotic inhibition were phenylephrine at x m octopamine at x m and tyramine at x m serotonin showed no mitotic inhibition at x m various alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agents were added to the cell system the alpha blocking agent phentolamine had no effect on mitosis when added in conjunction with epinephrine or norepinephrine no reduction of the catecholamineinduced mitotic inhibition was observed the beta blocking agent propranolol by itself showed slight mitotic inhibition at x m when added along with EN or noreinephrine propranolol reduced the catecholamineinduced MI inhibition approximately in addition propranolol blocked MI inhibition caused by phenylephrine an alpha adrenergic agent however another beta blocking agent dichloroisoproterenol showed strong mitotic inhibition when added to the cultures at a concentration of x m the effect was reduced to zero in the presence of propranolol these data suggest that while beta receptors may be involved in the catecholamineinduced mitotic inhibition of human keratinocytes in vitro the nature of the receptormolecule interaction may be complex
462,human hemoglobin was spin labeled with isothiocanatotetramethylpiperdinooxyl which is known to bind specifically to the nterminal alphaamino CG of proteins and slightly to the reactive sulfhydryl groups electron spin resonance esr analysis indicated a partially resolved fiveline spectrum suggesting that the label was attached to at least two different IB sites using specific blocking reagents prior to spin labeling the two IB CS were attributed to the sulfhydryl group of beta immobile and the alphaamino group of the nterminal valines mobile the relative motion of the spin at one set of binding sites was restricted regardless of the state of ligation and ph while the motion at the other site showed dependence on those parameters eg the spinlabeled NT ends of deoxyhemoglobin have restricted motion at all ph ranges studied while those of oxyhemoglobin are relatively free to move at the basic ph range but become more restricted in the acidic ph range
463,a simple and sensitive radiometric method to determine the individual enantiomers of cicloprofen has been developed ccicloprofen was converted to its lleucine diastereoisomers which were separated by thinlayer chromatography and quantified by measuring the radioactivity in the area corresponding to each individual diastereoisomer this technique has also been used to measure the enantiomers of unlabeled cicloprofen by condensing with clabeled lleucine by using the radiometric method a unique biotransformation process the inversion of the enantiomer of alphamethylfluoreneacetic acid to its enantiomer has been demonstrated in the rat and monkey the rate of to inversion was found to be faster in the rat than in the monkey after single or repeated oral adminstration of the racemic modification or the enantiomer of cicloprofen to both species the ratio of to enantiomers of cicloprofen in plasma urine or bile increased with time at and hr after oral administration of a single mgkg dose of the enantiomer ccicloprofen in rat plasma contained and respectively of the enantiomer after receiving the same dose of enantiomer monkey plasma contained and of enantiomer at and hr respectively T3 oral administration of a single mgkg dose of the enantiomer of ccicloprofen to rats and monkeys the percentage of enantiomer in plasma varied from to since the administered enantiomer contained of enantiomer and the enantiomer was excreted at a faster rate than its antipode by rats or monkeys it is not known whether an occasional small percentage increase of enantiomer in plasma resulted from the to inversion or from faster elimination of the enantiomer nevertheless if to inversion does occur in these two species the rate is much slower than for the to inversion
464,in the isolated preparation from the rabbit thoracic aorta the affinities of the vasoconstrictor agents phenylephrine and histamine as well as of the vasodilator betasympathomimetic drugs isoprenaline fenoterol th a terbutaline and salbutamol under the conditions of temperature increase triiodothyronine and decrease of extracellular ph were investigated it was observed that a temperature increase from degrees to degrees c significantly indreased the maximal tension evoked by histamine whereas that induced by the alphasympathomimetic drug phenylephrine was not altered significantly the maximal relaxation caused by betasympathomimetic drugs either at degrees or at degrees c did not differ from one another the affinities of histamine phenylephrine and of the betasympathomimetic drugs isoprenaline fenoterol terbutaline and salbutamol each were comparable at either degrees or degrees c the rank order of efficacy of the betasympathomimetic drugs is isoprenaline greater than fenoterol greater than salbutamol greater than terbutaline a decrease of the ph from to diminished the affinities of histamine and of the beta sympathomimetic drugs whereas that of the alphaadrenergic drug phenylephrine was not altered a further decrease of the ph to diminished additionally the affinity of histamine and of isoprenaline and especially that of the other betasympathomimetic drugs to such an extent that in the latter case complete doseresponse curves could not be determined any more i.c.v. of the animals with mgkg of triiodothyronine t for two days which strongly depressed the tension induced by either histamine or phenylephrine did not alter the affinity of both drugs t in vitro m only diminished the affinity of histamine but left that of phenylephrine unaltered i.c.v. for two days with mgkg of t yielded a significant diminution of the pdvalues for two betasympathomimetic drugs investigated namely isoprenaline and fenoterol also the administration of t in vitro in a final concentration of m resulted in a diminution of the affinity of both betasympathomimetic drugs the results obtained show that also on the aorta betaadrenoceptor stimulants are dependent on the metabolic state while alphaadrenoceptor stimulants are not
465,the transfer of so from water to air by bursting bubbles was studied as a CF of three C2 each of three variables in a bubbling solution the variables were ph surfactant concentration and na so concentration one combination of the above variables was also studied at three different temperatures sterile water solutions containing different combinations of the above factors and a fixed amount of nacl were bubbled in an enclosure for hour after bubbling samples of the aerosol produced the larger drops that fell out of the air and the bulk solution were collected and assayed for their s and na content using liquid scintillation counting the sna enrichment for each droplet sample as compared to the ratio for the bulk solution was determined and it was found to be dependent upon the combination of the factor C2 being bubbled both positive and negative enrichments were found with large positive enrichments being found consistently only for the highest value of surfactant concentration the temperature study showed no significant enrichment differences for any of the three temperatures studied
466,rat CL IMT aminotransferase was purified fold and an AS raised against it in rabbits hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase activity was increased fourfold by tyrosine twofold by tetracycline fold by cortisone acetate and ninefold by a combination of tyrosine and cortisol administered intraperitoneally to rats radioimmunoassay with clabelled tyrosine aminotransferase in conjunction with rb antiserum against the enzyme revealed that cortisol stimulates the synthesis of the enzyme de novo but that tetracycline has no such effect incubation of rat liver homogenates with purified TAT in vitro leads to a rapid inactivation of the enzyme which tetracycline partially inhibits the inactivation is brought about by intact lysosomes and the addition of mmcysteine increases the rate of enzyme inactivation which is further markedly increased by mmmg and mmatp here again tetracycline partially inhibits the tau leading to the inference that the increase of tyrosine aminotransferase activity in vivo by tetracycline is brought about by the latter inhibiting the lysosomal catheptic action
467,the interactions between pancreatic lipase and colipase and the substrate and the effect of bile salts on these interactions have been investigated by the use of kinetic experiments and studies on the semiquantitative phase distribution of lipase and colipase activities the results suggest that lipase binds to hydrophobic interfaces with partial irreversible inactivation bile salts in the range of micellar concentrations and above a ph of about displace lipase from this IB resulting in a reversible in activation at ph values below about lipase binds strongly to the substrate even in the presence of bile salt and a low activity peak is seen around ph this is the result of the binding of lipase to the supersubstrate and the activity of the catalytic site in the presence of bile salt colipase promotes the binding of lipase to the supersubstrate but not to other hydrophobic interfaces and catalytic activity is reestablished kinetic data indicate that the binding between colipase and lipase in the presence of substrate is strong and occurs in an approximately stoichiometric relationship
468,a procedure is described for the preparation of extensively purified betadglucosidase ec from the cytosol fraction of rat kidney the specific activity of the betaglucosidase in the high speed supernatant x g min fraction of rat kidney TH is fold greater than that in the same fraction from heart skeletal muscle lung spleen brain or liver betaglucosidase activity cochromatographs with betadgalactosidase betadfucosidase alphalarabinosidase and betadxylosidase activities through the last four column steps of the purification and their TPS activities are and relative to that of betaglucosidase respectively the specific activity of the apparently homogeneous betaglucosidase is nmol of glucose released from methylumbelliferylbetadglucopyranoside per mg protein per h all five glycosidase activities possess similar ph dependency ph optimum and heat lability and comigrate on polyacrylamide disc gels at ph rf betaglucosidase acitivity is inhibited competitively by glucono leads to lactone ki mm and noncompetitively by a variety of sulfhydryl reagents including nethylmaleimide pchloromercuribenzoate dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid and IAA although the enzyme will PR glucose from pnitrophenyl and methylumbelliferyl derivatives of betadglucose it will not hydrolyze xylosyloserine betadglucocerebroside lactose galactosylovalbumin or trehalose the enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of has a sedimentation coefficient of s and contains a relatively C1 number of acidic amino acids a study of the distribution of betaglucosidase activity in various regions of the dissected rat kidney indicates that the enzyme is probably contained in cells of the proximal convoluted tubule the enzyme is also present in relatively large amounts in the villus cells but not crypt cells of the intestine the physiological ATP and function of the enzyme are unknown
469,stoichactis helianthus toxin a protein derived presumably from the nematocysts was purified to homogeneity it has a molecular weight of about an isoelectric ph of and it contains approximately carbohydrate it is powerfully hemolytic for erythrocytes derived from a variety of animal species those of the cat being the most CS and those of the guinea pig the most resistant the toxin is lytic also for rabbit blood platelets and it destroys cultured fibroblasts but is inactive for several kinds of bacterial protoplasts and spheroplasts the hemolytic activity is specifically inhibited by sphingomyelin and it is proposed that this phospholipid is the constituent of the membrane which functions as receptor for the toxin supporting evidence includes the findings that enzymes known to destroy sphingomyelin a prevent EA membranes from inhibiting hemolysis and b render erythrocytes resistant to lysis by the toxin the mechanism underlying hemolysis may involve translocation of membrane sphingomyelin by virtue of a TPS affinity of the coelenterate protein for this phospholipid
470,cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase ctp cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase ec is located in both the microsomal and supernatant fractions of adult lung when the tissue is homogenized in m nacl the activity is located predominantly in the supernatant fraction in fetal lung cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase in the supernatant from fetal lung is stimulated to fold by the additions of total lung lipid serine phosphoglycerides and inositol phosphoglycerides specifically caused stimulation whereas choline phosphoglycerides and ethanolamine phosphoglycerides produced no stimulation lysophosphatidylcholine cause some stimulation but only at high concentrations a number of detergents were investigated all produced inhibition except for the ampholytic detergent miranol hm which was not GABA none of the detergents produced any stimulation of activity cytidylyltransferase activity in fetal lung when assayed in the absence of lipid is about of the adult the activity when assayed in the presence of lipid is equal or slightly higher than adult levels the activity measured without added phospholipid increases to fold within h after birth to values higher than in the adult the activity measured in the presence of phospholipid increased almost linearly from day until day there is an inverse relationship between the concentration of phospholipid in the fetal lung supernatant and the degree of lipid stimulation chromatographic experiments with biogel a columns have shown that cytidylyltransferase can exist in two molecular sizes a small molecular size that requires phospholipid for activity and a larger molecular weight species which does not require the addition of phospholipid for activity fetal lung has a higher proportion of the low molecular weight form than adult lung the small molecular weight species can be converted to the larger molecular weight form by the addition of phospholipids
471,the HFA composition of the total and polar lipid fractions of choanephora cucurbitarum grown under different cultural conditions were analyzed by TLC and gasliquid chromatography it was observed that temperature age ph and light influenced the degree of unsaturation this being due mainly to changes in the gammalinolenic acid concentration the conditions used in this T0 did not alter the qualitative profile of fatty acids normally present in the organism neither did these conditions stimulate the production of further longchain fatty acids cc beyond gammalinolenic acid c as reported earlier using growth media containing glutamic acid the HFA pattern of lipid fractions though the same qualitatively differed quantitatively the polar lipid fractions phosphatidyl choline phosphatidyl ethanolamine and diphosphatidyl glycerol showed an appreciable variation in gammalinolenic acid content under different cultural conditions the degree of unsaturation of the various lipid fractions decreased with increases in temperature CS intensity and ph but within each treatment the same pattern of decreasing degree of unsaturation with increasing age was observed the significance of these observations is discussed
472,competitive labelling withcacetic anhydride over a range of ph values has been used to explore the surface topography of the apovitellenin i moiety in emu egg yolk lowdensity lipoprotein the reaction of the lysine xiamino CG with acetic anhydride has been related to ph in a set of titration curves from these the reactivities relative to alanine and the ionization constants of all but the amino terminal lysines have been determined all lysines have near normal pka values around and lower than normal reactivities except the amino terminal lysine at ph values above the titration curves show breaks where the epsilonamino groups become much more reactive except for lysine which in this regard behaves like a normally ionizing lysine in not showing a discontinuity most of the basic residues in this apoprotein may occur clustered at the surface of the molecule this accounts best for the observed low reactivities and pka values the amino terminal lysine residue is presumably completely exposed to the aqueous environment
473,curves of experimentally plotted log dose ratio vslog b for the antagonism between adrenergic betamimetics isoproterenol iso and trimetoquinol tmq and various betaantagonists in relaxation of guineapig trachea could not be reasonably fitted to schilds equation which has been commonly used in the analysis of drugantagonism taking into consideration the saturable uptake process of the drug used herein the equation presented in this paper fitted fairly well to the experimental curves and explains the following results tmq was more strongly antagonized than iso by all the blocking agents tested that is the apparent modes of antagonism were different between iso and tmq although they are considered to interact with the same receptor site the Mw of the curve for a given antagonist markedly differed between iso and tmq it is hypothesized that iso is more easily taken up than tmq this was experimentally confirmed ie iso was potentiated about fold by inhibiting the uptake process with dibenamine while tmq was not by pretreatment with dibenamine the log dose ratio vslog b curve for the isopropranolol antagonism was shifted upward and superimposed with the theoretical curve of antagonism in which uptake of the agonist was neglected
474,the effects of mianserin a tetracyclic antidepressant on uptake and PR of hnoradrenaline hna hdopamine hda hhydroxytryptaminehht and hgammaaminobutyric acid hgaba in synaptosomes from different areas of the rat BB were investigated in a comparative T0 with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine mianserin and imipramine were inhibitors of hna uptake in the hypothalamus but could not increase hna release from NE nerve endings this behaviour was similar to that of amphetamine both mianserin and imipramine had essentially no effect on hda transport mechanisms in striatal synaptosomes amphetamine in contrast strongly affected both hda uptake and release imipramine was stronger than mianserin in inhibiting hht accumulation by striatal synaptosomes in contrast mianserin stimulated hht PR whereas imipramine was ineffective mianserin had virtually no LIA on hht uptake by rat blood platelets imipramine was a modest inhibitor of hgaba accumulation by whole brain synaptosomes mianserin had no effect both drugs did not alter hgaba release these results indicate that mianserin interferes in a way different from that to TCAs with the neurotransmitter transport mechanisms at the presynaptic level
475,villus tip cells and crypt cells of rat jejunal mucosa were separated by the planning procedure of imondi et al and were studied with respect to their activities of the enzymes of the gammaglutamyl cycle and glutathione content the villus tip cells exhibit much higher gammaglutamyl transpeptidase activities than do the crypt cells thus gammaglutamyl trnaspeptidase appears to be a villusspecific enzyme gammaglutamyl cyclotransferase and the enzymes required for glutathione synthesis are not specifically localized to either the crypt or villus tip cells but are present in both the crypt cells have a high concentration of glutathione mm comparable to the levels found in CL and kidney in contrast the villus tip cells have much lower concentrations on fasting the glutathione concentration decreased markedly in both villus tip and crypt cells feeding of protein but not of SU led to increased glutathione concentrations the migration of cells from the undifferentiated crypt cell region to the villus tip is associated with structural and biochemical changes that equip the cell for its mature PET activities which include transport the present findings indicate that such cellular differentiation and migration is associated with a marked increase in gammaglutamyl transpeptidase activity and in the utilization of glutathione
476,the presence of at least two ionizable AS center groups has been detected by a T0 of the effect of ph upon catalysis of hydrolysis of lalanylbetanaphthylamide by human liver alanine aminopeptidase and upon the inhibition of hydrolysis by inhibitors and substrate analogs octanoic acid octylamine and peptide inhibitors have been found to be competitive inhibitors and are therefore thought to bind the AS center lphe was previously shown to bind the active center since it was found to be a competitive inhibitor of the hydrolysis of tripeptide substrates garner c w and behal f j biochemistry a plot of pkm vs ph for the substrate lalabetanaphthylamide showed that binding decreased below ph and above the points at which the theoretical curve undergoes an integral change in slope these points are interpreted as the pka either of ATP ionizable groups or bindingdependent enzyme active center groups similar plots of pkm vs ph for lalanylpnitroanilide as substrate and pki vs ph for lleulleulleu and dleultyr as inhibitors gave pairs fo pka values of and and and and respectively all the above substrates and dleultyr have pka values near therefore the bindingdependent group with a pka value near is possibly this ATP group similar plots of pki vs ph for the inhibitors lphe lmet lleu octylamine and octanoic acid had only one bending point at and respectively amino acid inhibitors octylamine and octanoic acid have no groups with pka values between and these data indicate that there are two AS center ionizable groups with pka values of approximately and which are involved in substrate binding or inhibitory CAA binding but not in catalysis since vmax was constant at all ph values tested
477,four major enolase isozymes have been identified in human tissues and are referred to as l m intermediate and fast the m isozyme is the L1 form found in skeletal muscle and heart extracts and the l isozyme the L1 form found in extracts of liver and most other tissues the intermediate and fast isozymes are most active in brain but are observed as weak components in most other tissues including HR but are not seen in skeletal muscle it was observed that during fetal OD of heart and skeletal muscle the l form declines in activity while the m form increases in activity the kinetic properties heat stabilities and molecular sizes of the main enolase isozymes have been compared although the isozymes share many features in common the fast isozyme is more stable when subjected to heat treatment than either the l or m isozymes further the fast isozyme retains its dimeric structure and activity in the absence of magnesium ions while the l and m isozymes dissociate and lose activity the intermediate isozyme has properties which are intermediate to those of the l and fast isozymes the intermediate isozyme can be partially dissociated to equal quantities of l and fast isozymes by storage at room temperature or by freezing and thawing in the presence of mnacl conversely mixtures of l with fast and m with fast give rise to an intermediate isozyme T3 freezing and thawing evidence derived from this study has led to the suggestion that three separate gene loci are involved in the determination of human enolase it is proposed that one of these eno determines the l isozyme which is the homodimer alphaalpha another locus eno determines the fast isozyme which is the homodiner betabeta and the third locus eno determines the m isozyme which is the homodimer gammagamma the intermediate isozyme seen as a strong component in brain and as a weak component in most other tissues is thought to be the heterodimer alphabeta in heart however it is probably mainly betagamma
478,a quantitative assay for the hematopoietic F0 of thymocytes has been developed using this assay the kinetics of appearance of the progeny of transfused bone marrow and spleen cells in the thymus of irradiated r mice has been studied precursor cells are seven to eightfold more common in bone marrow than in spleen and are absent from PN they decline in number as the animals age when hematopoietic cells are injected immediately after lethal irradiation only a small number of cells actually enter the gland their progeny are not detectable in the thymus for days the time of their detection depends both upon the size of the residual endogenous thymocyte population and the number of progenitor cells injected evidence has been presented that excludes thymic injury as the basis for the delay in the appearance of donor type cells and indicates that neither the production of a homing signal in the irradiated animal nor the development of F0 cells are limiting factors in the rate of thymic repopulation these studies indicate that only an exceedingly small number less than of prothymocytes are required to repopulate the thymus of an irradiated mouse this restricted number of progenitors must produce the entire repertory of tcell immunologic responsiveness seen in the first weeks after repopulation
479,the isolated skin of the toad bufo marinus ictericus when impaled from the outer surface by glass microelectrodes filled with m kcl shows a voltage profile which is a continuous function of the depth of impalement the superficial intraepithelial potential difference measured with reference to the external solution pdi is negative with naclringers solution on both sides of the skin displaying a minimum of mv at mum null value is obtained at mum with positive values for deeper impalements indications of cell impalements abrupt voltage and resistance jumps were frequently observed at CS deeper than mum from the outer surface measurements of the electrical resistance between the microelectrode and the external solution made with single and doublebarreled microelectrodes showed great discrepancies which may be attributed to distinct pathways of different resistances in the SC pdi measured at a depth of mum was a logarithmic function of naso or kso concentration in the external solution increasing in negativity with a reduction in concentration substitution of na by k in the external solution had only minor effects on pdi acidification of the external solution from ph is accompanied by a reduction in the negative value of pdi at ph pdi was positive pdi was interpreted as a DWI potential at the tip of the microelectrode due to kcl diffusion from the electrode into the matrix of the SC differences in k and cl mobilities responsible for the origin of pdi were attributed to fixed charges in the matrix of the SC with density and polarity determined by their degree of proponation controlled by the hydrogen ion concentration of the external solution skin potential SCC and their relationship to pdi were discussed
480,the biosynthesis of the glucuronide and sulphate conjugates of hydroxymethoxyphenylethanol was demonstrated in vitro by using the highspeed supernatant and microsomal fractions of liver respectively these two conjugates were also produced simultaneously by using the postmitochondrial fraction of rat rb or guineapig liver in contrast only the glucuronide was synthesized by human CL and only the sulphate by mouse and cat livers neither of these conjugates was formed by the kidney or the small or C1 intestine of the rat a high sulphateconjugating activity was observed in mouse kidney the rate of sulphation of hydroxymethoxyphenylethanol with kidney homogenate and highspeed supernatant S9 was times greater than with liver S9 the sulphoconjugates of hydroxymethoxyphenylethanol and hydroxymethoxyphenylglycol were also formed by enzyme S9 of rabbit adrenal and rat brain the glycol was the better substrate in the latter system mouse brain did not possess any sulphotransferase activity for the conjugation of hydroxymethoxyphenylethanol by rb liver the km for udpglucuronic acid was mm and that for naso was mm the sulphotransferase has a greater affinity for hydroxymethoxyphenylethanol than has glucuronyltransferase as indicated by their respective km values of and mm it was concluded that sulphate conjugation of hydroxymethoxyphenylethanol predominates in most species of animals
481,the kinetics of rat CL ltype pyruvate kinase ec phosphorylated with cyclic ampstimulated protein kinase from the same source and the unphosphorylated enzyme have been compared the effects of ph and various concentrations of substrates mg k and modifiers were studied in the absence of fructose diphosphate at ph the phosphorylated pyruvate kinase appeared to have a lower affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate k mm than the unphosphorylated enzyme k mm the enzyme activity vs phosphoenolpyruvate concentration curve was more sigmoidal for the phosphorylated enzyme with a hill coefficient of compared to for the unphosphorylated enzyme fructose diphosphate increased the apparent affinity of both enzyme forms for phosphoenolpyruvate at saturating concentrations of this activator the kinetics of both enzyme forms were transformed to approximately the same hyperbolic curve with a hill coefficient of and k of about mm for phosphoenolpyruvate the apparent affinity of the enzyme for fructose diphosphate was high at mm phosphoenolpyruvate with a k mum for the unphosphorylated pyruvate kinase and mum for the phosphorylated enzyme however in the presence of mm alanine plus mm atp a higher fructose diphosphate concentration was needed for activation with k of mum for the unphosphorylated enzyme and of mum for the phosphorylated enzyme the results obtained strongly indicate that phosphorylation of Pyr kinase may also inhibit the enzyme in vivo such an inhibition should be important during gluconeogenesis
482,transmitter PR at the neuromuscular junction of the crayfish walking leg has been found to deviate from binomial predictions immediately after the ON of repetitive stimulation of the presynaptic nerve at frequencies of at least hz after several minutes of continuous stimulation and at lower rates of stimulation however the number of quanta released could be described quite well by binomial or poisson statistics deviations from the theoretical expectations were characterized by a fewer release failures than predicted b occasions in which the number of quanta released was more than the estimated number of quanta available for release and c a tendency for the data to be underdispersed each of these three characteristics are consistent with the hypothesis that different releasable quanta may have different probabilities of responding to a nerve impulse using two different methods different values of the nonuniform probabilities were estimated from the data at each synaptic site at least one of the estimated probabilities was very high the need for caution in interpreting statistical description of quantal release is emphasized
483,nethylmaleimide nem irreversibly inactivates the response of gustatory cells to stimulation by nacl sucrose and hydrogen ions the rate of inactivation can be measured by monitoring the decay of naclstimulated summated electrophysiological activity at the chorda tympani nerve in the presence of nem the observed pseudo firstorder rate constants are linear with nem concentration and the secondorder rate constant is m sec other nsubstituted maleimides such as nmethylmaleimide and nbutylmaleimide which have etherwater partition coefficient and is essentially ineffective as an inactivator of the nacl response these results together with the observation that the inactivation rate is independent of ph between and indicate the inactivation site is either intracellular or buried within the CM at a locus inaccessible to most extracellular fluids the rate of inactivation of the sucrose and hcl responses were measured indirectly and found to be comparable to the naclstimulated inactivation rate indicating the inhibited event is common to the transduction of the response for all of the stimuli examined possible sites of inactivation by nsubstituted maleimides are considered in the context for and characterizing receptorspecific as well as other classes of taste cell inhibitors
484,p.o. of MD mgkg twice daily for days to mongrel dogs produced a significant decrease in blood pressure and heart rate the drug treatment affected neither the resting VT nor the cardiac output thus the hypotensive effect of the drug was predominantly due to a reduction in total peripheral resistance vasoconstrictor responses of the renal vasculature to sympathetic nerve stimulation were significantly impaired after methyldopa at all the frequencies while MES vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were impaired only at the lower stimulation frequencies in addition methylnorepinephrine was a significantly less potent vasoconstrictor than norepinephrine in the renal vasculature but was equipotent to norepinephrine in the mesentery the finding of a reduction in the renal vascular resistance of methyldopatreated dogs with no such alteration in the MES vascular resistance is consistent with the nerve stimulation studies therefore the results of the present investigation indicate that in addition to the existing evidence favoring a central site of action for methyldopa the impairment of peripheral sympathetic neuronal function is also of importance in accounting for the hemodynamic alterations observed following treatment with MD
485,the formation of the interchain disulfide bonds in partially reduced bence jones proteins and immunoglobulins was studied in the presence of glutathione it was found that only Ox glutathione gssg was ERP for the formation of the interchain disulfide bonds in type gamma bence jones proteins and igg in type kappa bence jones proteins on the other hand no formation of the inter ll disulfide bond was observed in the presence of gssg at above ph the kinetic pattern of disulfide bond formation of bence jones proteins was well interpreted by assuming that two monomers of a type gamma protein dimer are discriminated monomers and and that only an intermediate in which the sh group on monomer is blocked with gssg can form a disulfidebonded dimer and the intermediate in which the sh group on monomer is blocked with gssg can not comparison of the kinetic data for the formation of the interchain disulfide bonds of igg with those for bence jones proteins suggested that h chaingssg mixed disulfide is a principal intermediate for the formation of the inter hl disulfide bond
486,the binding of chloramphenicol to an albuminlecithin complex in the presence or absence of premicellar concentrations of both ionic and nonionic surfactants has been examined long chain strong ionic detergents such as SDS or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide severely perturb protein structure and eventually allow full separation of the complex into lecithin and albumindetergent complexes the dissociation process is reversible upon the removal of the detergent by exhaustive dialysis T3 the splitting of the complex the amount of antibiotic associated with the lipidprotein mixture increases structural alteration of the albuminlecithin complex and the increase in the binding of chloramphenicol have an effect on the transfer rate of this antibiotic across an artificial barrier consisting of an AQ dispersion of the same complex as observed in a model system it is suggested that a reversible alteration in membrane structure and consequently in membrane permeability might be easily effected at the molecular level through a reversible dissociation of structural lipoproteins into their components operated by premicellar concentrations of ionic surfactants this represents a tentative picture of the possible events taking place within the membrane and modifying the Ka of a drug when it is associated with surfactants in a pharmaceutical preparation
487,the effects of single oral doses of the cardioselective beta adrenoceptor blocking drugs MET and tolamolol on specific airways resistance sraw were compared with those of propranolol and practolol in healthy volunteers and in patients with bronchial asthma wholebody plethysmography was used to measure sraw and the blocking potency of different antagonists assessed by the degree of inhibition of tachycardia due to exercise on a treadmill the changes correlated with plasma drug C2 propranolol and practolol were measured fluorometrically and MET by electroncapture gasliquid chromatography in normal subjects about reduction in exerciseinduced tachycardia resulted from single doses of mg propranolol plasma levels sd to sd ngml mg practolol plasma C2 sd to sd mugml mg metoprolol plasma levels sd to sd ngml and mg tolamolol in patients these doses of the drugs produced significant increases in sraw these increases were greater than those after placebo but significantly so only during the peak effect hr after propranolol compared with changes after placebo significant effects on sraw were also found in patients given mg of tolamolol none of the drugs had a significant effect on sraw in normal subjects it is concluded that MET practolol and tolamolol may impair VE function in asthmatics less than propranolol and that at high doses this difference may not be demonstrable
488,aspects of a possible involvement of hydrogen ions in the electrophysiological responses to light of limulus ventral photoreceptors were investigated a m solution of either a zwitterionic ph buffer or a weaklybuffering control substance was pressure injected through a micropipette into a ventral photoreceptor cell to estimate the amount injected so was included in the solution membrane currents induced by light flashes were measured by a voltageclamp technique the bufferfilled micropipette passed current and a m kcl filled micropipette monitored membrane voltage the sensitivity peak lightinduced currentstimulus energy was measured after dark adaptation before and after injection i.v. of buffers ph to intracellular concentrations of at least mm produced only a small mean decrease in sensitivity approximately equal to that caused by injections of control substances excitation therefore apparently is not mediated by a NC in intracellular ph buffers with ph values were also injected the time to peak of the response depended on ph being shortened by up to at ph values below and lengthened at higher ph values the time to peak of the response appeared to be shortened by an increase in intracellular phbuffering capacity even when there was no NC in intracellular ph
489,when streptomyces alboniger spores were grown in hickeytresner broth containing mum ethidium bromide a high frequency of permanently cured aerial mycelianegative am colonies was recovered the appearance an am colonies was time dependent a very VLF at zero time a maximum to after to days of growth and a decline again to low frequencies later in the growth cycle on agar cured am colonies of s alboniger still produced puromycin the development of aerial mycelia in s alboniger s scabies and s coelicolor was also sensitive to gl repression colonies grown on hickeytresner agar containing gl remained phenotypically am throughout the observation period adenine mm or greater and to a lesser extent adenosine and guanosine specifically reversed the repression the accumulation of undissociated organic acids appears to be involved in glucose repression of aerial mycelia formation however this does not appear to be the case with puromycin production in s alboniger glucose repression was observed over the ph range to
490,administration of hydrocortisone or insulin and also a simultaneous use of these hormones in a high dose caused a marked elevation of the total activity of tyrosinealphaketoglutaric transaminase and its anode and cathode isoenzymes in the soluble fraction of the CL in the sexually immature weighing g and mature weighing g male rats the stimulating effect of insulin was sharper in the young in comparison with adult animals administration of hydrocortisone caused a more pronounced elevation of the total tyrosinealphaketoglutaric transaminase activity in the hepatic mitochondria of young rats than in AD animals insulin administration increased the activity of tyrosinealphaketoglutaric transaminase in the mitochondria of the liver of the sexually mature male rats without significant changes of this enzyme in the sexually imature rats a simultaneous injection of hydrocortisone and insulin to the sexaully mature male rats caused the same increase in the tyrosinealphaketoglutaric transaminase activity in the hepatic mitochondria as after the administration of glucocorticosteriod alone as to the sexaully immature males the activity of the enzyme fell to the normal level it is supposed that androgens played a significant role in the realization of the inducing action of glucocorticoids and insulin influencing the synthesis of tyrosinealphaketoglutaric transaminase in different directions in the mitochondria of the CL of young and sexually mature animals
491,a system has been developed for the quantitative measurment of GAP dehydrogenase activity in tissue sections an obstacle to the histochemical study of this enzyme has been the fact that the substrate gylceraldehyde phosphate is very unstable in the present system a stable compound fructose diphosphate is used as the primary substrate and the demonsatration of the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase activity depends on the conversion of this compound into the specific substrate by the aldolase present in the tissue the characteristics of the dehydrogenase activity resulting from the addition of fructose diphosphate resemble closely the known properties of purified GAP dehydrogenase use of PVA in the reaction medium prevents PR of enzymes from the sections as occurs in AQ media although in this study intrinsic aldolase activity was found to be adequate for the rapid conversion of fructose diphosphate into the TPS ATP for the dehydrogenase the use of exogenous ALD may be of particular advantage in assessing the intergrity of the embdenmeyerhof pathway
492,the cytotoxic action of the antitumor antibiotic mitomycin c occurs primarily at the level of dna using highly sensitive fluorescence assays which depend on the enhancement of ethidium fluorescence only when it intercalates duplex regions of dna three aspects of mitomycin c action on dna have been studied a crosslinking events b alkylation without necessarily crosslinking and c strand breakage crosslinking of dna is determined by the return of fluorescence after a heat denaturation step at alkaline phs under these conditions denatured dna gives no fluorescence the crosslinking was independently confirmed by sendonuclease ec digestion at relatively high concentrations of mitomycin the suppression of ethidium fluorescence enhancement was shown not to be due to depurination but rather to alkylation as a result of losses in potential intercalation sites a linear relationship exists between binding ratio for MMC and loss of fluorescence the proportional decrease in fluorescence with ph strongly suggests that the alkylation is due to the aziridine moiety of the antibiotic under these conditions a parallel increase in the rate and overall efficiency of covalent crosslinking of dna with lower ph suggests that the crosslinking event to which the primary cytotoxic action has been linked occurs sequentially with alkylation by aziridine and then by carbamate mitomycin c reduced chemically was shown to induce single strand cleavage as well as monoaklylation and covalent crosslinking in pm covalently closed circular dna the inhibition of this cleavage by superoxide dismutase ec and catalase ec and by free radical scavengers suggests that the Kd of dna observed to accompany the cytotoxic action of MMC c is largely due to the free radical o in contrast to the SMB of the antibiotic streptonigrin mitomycin c does not inactivate the protective enzymes superoxide dismutase or catalase lastly mitomycin c is able to crosslink dna in the absence of reduction at ph this is consistent with the postulated crosslinking mechansims
493,the effects of ph variation on ionic exchange and mechanical function were studied in the arterially perfused rat and rabbit septa the ph and pco of the control perfusate were and mmhg respectively in the rabbit SP a MA ph equals pco equals mmhg caused a loss of of control tension in min na and k exchange were unaltered a comparable respiratory acidosis ph equals pco equals mmhg caused a loss of tension in min na exchange was unaltered but k efflux fell from mean se to mmolkg dry wt per min p less than n equals a net gain of k of n equals mmolkg dry wt occurred and was attributable to a delayed fall in k influx relative to efflux over min the net gain could not be mimicked by epinephrine administration or blocked by propranolol and was absent in the beating rat septum and the quiescent rb SP these results suggest that the net uptake of k which appears to be dependent on a period of depolarization and the changes of +dP/dt are controlled by the h ion concentration at a cellular site whose exchange with the extracellular space is characterized by a considerable restriction of diffusion changes of +dP/dt are not related to the net uptake of k
494,transplantable mammary adenocarcinomas and livers of ch mice fed a stock diet or a linoleate rich diet corn oil contain similar amounts of oleate ca mggm tissue on feeding either a high carbohydrate fat free or a high carbohydrate saturated fatcontaining hydrogenated coconut or cottonseed oil diet for weeks oleate levels increased fold in tumor and fold in CL the specific activity of stearoylcoa desaturase in CL microsomes was similar to that in the corresponding fractions of mammary glands of lactating mice in CL this activity was enhanced to fold by FF a high carbohydrate fat free or a high carbohydrate saturated fat diet the desaturase activity in mammary tumor microsomes while only of that in hepatic microsomes remained unaltered regardless of the type of diet fed these observations suggest that a a major portion of the oleate in the mammary RT is not produced within the tissue b dietary adaptation is not a general characteristic of stearoylcoa desaturase in neoplastic tissues and c enhanced desaturase activity in liver is directly related to the absence of linoleate or oleate or to a large decrease in oleate in the diet
495,the effect of a cardioselective betaadrenergic blocking agent MET on symptoms and ET was studied in patients with angina pectoris metroprolol was compared with placebo at two dose C2 mg tds and mg tds in a doubleblind trial in patients compared with placebo metroprolol caused a significant reduction of heart rate and systolic blood pressure during exercise and consequently a reduction of the ratepressure product the reduction was greater with mg tds than with mg tds the exercise tolerance measured as total work increased significantly by per cent during treatment with metroprolol mg tds and by per cent during treatment with mg tds there was a reduction in the number of anginal attacks and in nitroglycerin consumption and subjective improvement of AP at both dose levels of metroprolol no signs of cardiac failure appeared during any of the four treatment periods HV showed no significant change unwanted effects were of the same frequency and severity during treatment with metroprolol at both dose C2 as with placebo
496,radiolabeled CO was incorporated into vesicles prepared from egg yolk lecithin and utilized as a substrate for studies of sterol ester hydrolases present in rat CL homogenates the cholesteryl oleate was shown to be associated with vesicles unilamellar liposomes using sepharose b chromatography with this ATP two different cholesteryl ester hydrolytic enzymes were demonstrated in subcellular fractions from the liver homogenates in the lysosomerich fraction an acid hydrolase was present while in the cytosol fraction g supernatant hydrolytic activity was shown to occur with an optimum ph between and the substrate was characterized by sepharose chromatography both before and T3 incubation with the CL fraction and was not dramatically altered even by rigorous incubation conditions the lysosomal enzyme preparation was capable of hydrolyzing almost all the cholesteryl oleate in the vesicles hydrolysis of the phospholipid was proportionately much less than that of the cholesteryl oleate comparisons were performed between the vesicle preparation and an alternate ATP preparation involving the direct addition of cholesteryl oleate in acetone solution the vesicles appeared to be a better substrate for the lysosomal enzyme whereas the activity in the cytosol fraction did not distinguish between the two substrate S9 unsonicated suspensions of CO and lecithin did not serve as suitable substrates for the enzymes these studies demonstrate the applicability of cholesteryl estercontaining vesicles as a useful ATP for studying cholesteryl ester hydrolysis in vitro
497,the postnatal development of aminopyrine ndemethylase aniline hydroxylase benzpyrene hydroxylase biphenyl hydroxylase ethoxycoumarin deethylase activities nadphcytochrome c reductase and cytochrome p was compared in microsomes from the liver and small intestine of new zealand white rabbits apart from hepatic aniline hydroxylase activity all of the xenobioticmetabolizing enzyme activities examined had a similar pattern of development in the CL and small intestine in both tissues the ability to metabolize xenobiotics was generally undetectable at days of age and remained relatively low for the first days of life theresfter a rapid to fold increase in all the enzyme activity studied was noted and adult values were reached or exceeded by days of age subsequent development of xenobioticmetabolizing enzyme activities in the small intestine but not in the liver exhibited a transient fall at days of age before adult activities were attained after days of age the developmental pattern of cytochrome p in the small intestine closely resembled that of the xenobioticmetabolizing enzyme MICs but in the CL this rho was less exact
498,the developmental variations of tyrosine hydroxylase th and of acetylcholinesterase ache were studied in embryonic and posthatching chicken sympathetic ganglia different levels of th activity were found in two different flocks of WL chicken which are probably dependent on genetic differences these enzymatic differences however do not become apparent before hatching and may indicate a combined effect of genetic variation and PET demands during the period of incubation th activity is characterized by a pronounced and steady increase from the twelfth day of incubation up to day after hatching this corresponds to a period of intense maturation of the sympathetic neuron in the period following hatching the fourth day fall phenomenon previously described by us for dopa decarboxylase ddc dopaminebetahydroxylase dbh and monoamine oxidase mao is not seen in the th curve instead th activity tends to remain constant between days and T3 hatching ah both ganglionic protein and weight remain constant in this period indicating a phase of general pause in protein synthesis ache activity increases steadily from the eighth until the twentyfirst day of incubation a sudden and significant drop in ache activity was found at day ah followed by a period of rapid increase at day ah and a levelling of activity up to day ah comparing the present variations to those observed in our previous studies on dbh a temporal relationship between th and dbh activity is observed during the phases of synaptogenesis and maturation but not during the phase of intense PET activity our results strongly suggest that before hatching in chick embryo sympathetic ganglia the cholinergic presynaptic terminals play a role in regulating the OD of the adrenergic SN in the period following hatching however the dbh and th C2 in cell HB seem to be principally regulated by the functional activity this results in depletion of dbh but not th through liberation along with the neurotransmitter at the periphery depletion of dbh at the terminals may result in increased transport and thereby depletion in the cell body this mechanism is probably responsible for the difference in the profiles of activity of dbh and th in the cell bodies observed in the first week T3 hatching
499,histidine ammonialyase ec from rat liver was purified more than fold to near homogeneity electrophoretic determinations indicated a native molecular weight of approximately the enzyme has a ph optimum of approximately ph the minimum km for lhistidine was mm at ph the michaelis constant in the physiological ph range was however more than mm dalphahydrazinoimidazolylpropionic acid was found to be a potent competitive inhibitor of liver histidine ammonialyase kis mum the l enantiomer of this compound was less effective in this regard the enzyme was also inhibited competitively by lhistidine hydroxamate kis mm and to a lesser extent by lhistidinol dhistidine and glycine failure of a wide variety of other histidine analogues to inhibit the enzyme substantially indicates high specificity of the AS site for lhistidine no alternate substrates were identified for the enzyme dlalphahydrazinophenylpropionic acid the alphahydrzino analogue of phenylalanine was similarly shown to be a very potent competitive inhibitor of a mechanistically similar lphenylalanine ammonialyase purified from rhodotorula glutinis the properties of histidine ammonialyase from rat CL differ significantly from those of the enzyme from pseudomonas fluorescens which has been studied most extensively to date
500,several hypotheses have been put forward to explain postdialysis hypocapnia three were tested in this T0 impairment of tissue oxygenation by dialysis dinduced alkalosis bohr effect the d disequilibrium syndrome and the loss of carbon dioxide co in d fluid in patients predpco was significantly correlated with plasma bicarbonate concentration hco and no disproportionate reduction of pco was discernible in patients using a bath acetate concentration of meq pco was unchanged T3 d versus mm hg before d and was low relative to hco whic increased from to meq after a dialysis using an acetate concentration of meq hco remained constant versus meq pred whereas pco fell from to mm hg p less than consequently pco was again low relative to hco removal of co by d fluid was excluded as a cause for low blood pco addition of gaseous co to the bath had no influence on arterial blood gases since postd hypocapnia was not prevented when hco was kept constant it was concluded that postd alkalosis cannot be the main reason for postd hyperventilation and that other AF related to the process of d are responsible
501,the binding constants of nacetylglucosamine gcnac and its methyl alpha and beta glycosides to hen and turkey eggwhite lysozymes ec in the latter of which asp is replaced by gly were determined at various ph values by measuring changes in the circular dichroic dc band at nm the IB of betamethylgcnac to turkey and hen lysozymes perturbed the pk value of glu from to the pk value of asp from to and the pk value of asp from to in addition perturbation of the pk value of asp from to was observed in the binding of this saccharide to hen lysozyme the binding of alphamethylglcnac to hen and turkey lysozymes perturbed the pk value of glu to the alkaline side by about ph unit the pk value of asp to the acidic side by about ph unit and the pk value of an ionizable group to the acidic side by about ph unit the last ionizable group was tentatively assigned to asp the pk value of asp was not perturbed by the IB of this saccharide the ph dependence curves for the binding of glcnac to hen and turkey lysozymes were very similar and it was suggested that asp in addition to asp asp and glu is perturbed by the IB of glcnac
502,the na kactivated mgdependent atpase from rabbit kidney outer medulla was prepared in a partially inactivated soluble form depleted of endogenous phospholipids using deoxycholate this preparation was reactivated to fold by sonicated liposomes of phosphatidylserine but not by nonsonicated phosphatidylserine liposomes or sonicated phosphatidylcholine liposomes the reconstituted enzyme resembled native membrane S9 of na katpase in its ph optimum being around showing optimal activity at mgatp mol ratios of approximately and a km value for atp of mm arrhenius plots of this reactivated activity at a constant ph of and an mg atp mol ratio of showed a discontinuity sharp change of slope at degrees c with activation energy ea values of kcalmol above this temperature and kcal below it a further discontinuity was also found at degrees c and the ea below this was very high greater than kcalmol increased mg concentrations at mgatp ratios in excess of inhibited the na katpase activity and also abolished the discontinuities in the arrhenius plots the addition of cholesterol to phosphatidylserine at a mol ratio partially inhibited na katpase reactivation arrhenius plots under these conditions showed a single discontinuity at degrees c and ea values of and kcalmol above and below this temperature respectively the ouabaininsensitive mgatpase normally showed a linear arrhenius plot with an ea of kcalmol the cholesterolphosphatidylserine mixed liposomes stimulated the mgatpase activity which now also showed a discontinuity at degrees c with however an increased value of kcalmol above this temperature and kcalmol below kinetic studies showed that cholesterol had no significant effect on the km values for atp since both cholesterol and mg are known to alter the effects of temperature on the fluidity of phospholipids the above results are discussed in this context
503,the effect of specific immunization on the antibacterial defense mechanisms of the murine lung was assessed against streptococcus pneumoniae staphylococcus aureus staphylococcus aureus smith serratia marcescens klebsiella pneumoniae proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa immunization by aerosol inhalation significantly enhanced the intrapulmonary killing of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis but not the remaining organisms with p mirabilis SVR immunization induced higher titers of specific serum agglutinins as compared with local RT immunization however local immunization was more effective in enhancing pulmonary bactericidal activity than was parenteral vaccination passive immunity against p mirabilis or aerogenic challenge with preopsonized p mirabilis significantly enhanced intrapulmonary killing of the homologous organism with s aureus pulmonary bactericidal activity was not accelerated by aerosol challenge with the preopsonized organism nor was it accelerated in passively immunized mice these data demonstrate that the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity is governed by the bacterium used for challenge and the route of immunization the results further demonstrate that with p mirabilis antibodymediated mechanisms are involved in the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity
504,studies were performed to characterize the previously reported particulate oforming system from human neutrophils of eight reducing agents examined including glutathione ascorbic acid and intermediates of the glycolytic and hexose monophosphate shunt pathways only the pyridine nucleotides could serve as electron donors at mm pyridine nucleotide o production was relatively independent of ph the km for nadh was approximately mm regardless of ph while with nadph the km varied from mm at ph to mm at ph the molar ratio of nadph Ox to o produced was consistent with the reaction nadph o leads to nadp h the product nucleotide was shown enzymatically to be nadp o production was not inhibited by cn na edta or phenanthroline particulate o production accounted for of the oxygen taken up during the RB by an equivalent number of intact neutrophils greatly diminished o production was seen with particles prepared from cells obtained from three patients with CGD with mm nadph as electron donor with mm nadh similar observations were made with particles from two of the patients but with this nucelotide o production was only slightly reduced in the third case the evidence available suggests that this particulate o forming system is the one responsible for the respiratory burst in G1 neutrophils the relationship between this system and other o forming system found in human neutrophils is discussed
505,lactic dehydrogenase from pig skeletal muscle m can be reversibly dissociated to the monomer at ph depending on the anion applied using identical experimental conditions the phdepending profiles of dissociation denaturation and deactivation coincide with each other deviations in the phdependence of protein fluorescence reflect changes in the microenvironment of specific chromophores rather than significant differences in the structurefunction relationship as ph is changed the dissociation state is characterized by the homogeneous inactive monomer of the reassociated material consists of up to fully active tetramers indistinguishable from the initial native enzymes as shown by hydrodynamic spectroscopic and enzymic properties the rest represents a mixture of irreversibly denatured high aggregates under optimum conditions of reactivation both recovery of enzymic activity and native fluorescence obey strict second order kinetics with an activation SE of kcalmol kjmol nad and nadh do not show any significant influence on the yield and kinetics of the refolding process and the recovery of enzymic activity the kinetic results suggest the reassociation of inactive monomers to be ratelimiting in the refolding and reactivation processes being considered
506,the cellular content of acetylcoa carboxylase acetylcoacarbondioxide ligase adpforming ec in saccharomyces cerevisiae is reduced by the addition of longchain fatty acids to the culture medium mutant strains of s cerevisiae defective in acylcoa synthetase acidcoa ligase ampforming ec were isolated and used to determine whether fatty acid itself or a metabolite of fatty acid is more directly responsible for the repression of acetylcoa carboxylase cells of the mutant strains were capable of incorporating HFA to an extent comparable to that observed with the wildtype strain but they accumulated markedly more of the incorporated HFA in the nonesterified form than did the wildtype cells the level of acetylcoa carboxylase activity in the mutants in contrast to that in the wildtype strain was hardly affected by the addition of fatty acids to the medium these results indicate that the activation of exogenous fatty acid is required for the repression of acetylcoa carboxylase supporting the view that the repressive effect is mediated by some compound metabolically derived from fatty acid
507,histamine concentrations in the gastric mucosa gastric vein blood and gastric contents were measured after instillation of ml of and volvol ethanol intragastrically for min in anesthetized dogs the mean histamine concentration in the gastric mucosa gastric vein blood and gastric contents in dogs treated with ethanol was significantly higher than in dogs treated with sodium chloride nacl serial studies of the gastric vein blood of the ethanoltreated dogs should significant elevation of histamine concentrations for hr after instillation of ethanol but less increases at and min T3 instillation of and respectively no change was observed after administration of gl and mannitol morphologically the GM of the ethanoltreated dogs was edematous congested and hemorrhagic the severity of these changes increased with the concentration used the mucosa of the dogs treated with sodium chloride gl or mannitol was normal the factors that may underlie the increase in histamine concentrations in the gastric vein blood and the possible relation of such an increase to the morphologic alterations are discussed
508,when rat brain synaptosomes were incubated with hnoradrenaline for min and then exposed to osmotic shock only about of the newly accumulated hnoradrenaline was released it would appear that most but possibly not all of the newly accumulated hnoradrenaline is rapidly bound to some particulate cytoplasmic constituent within the synaptosome hdopamine and hhydroxytryptamine were also rapidly bound within synaptosomes but hglycine and hgammaaminobutyric acid were not reserpinization mgkg ip h before preparation only slightly reduced the initial rate of hnoradrenaline uptake by synaptosomes however when reserpinized synaptosomes were osmotically shocked most of the newly accumulated radioactivity was released this radioactivity was identified chromatographically as hnoradrenaline on the basis of the findings with reserpinized S9 it seems likely that the rapid intrasynaptosomal binding involves synaptic vesicles and the neuronal membrane transport system itself may be capable of driving the uptake of noradrenaline by nerveterminals the rapid vesicular IB observed may not be essential for the accumulation of the amine by presynaptic terminals during brief exposures

510,cell extracts and extracellular culture fluids of species of the yeast genus schizosaccharomyces exhibited exobeta leads to and exobeta leads to glucanase ec MICs using a combination of sephadex g and deaecellulose chromatography the exobeta leads to glucanases from the cell extracts and SC fluid of schizosaccharomyces japonicus var versatilis were purified extensively the enzymes from either location exhibited similar purification and other properties the purified enzymes hydrolysed the beta leads to glucosidic linkage in addition to the beta leads to linkage heat denaturation inhibition and electrophoretic studies indicated that both hydrolytic activities were properties of a single protein laminarin and pustulan hydrolysis followed michaelismenten kinetics the km and v for laminarin hydrolysis were mgml and mumol of glucose releasedminmg protein and for pustulan they were mgml and mumol of gl releasedminmg protein the exobetaglucanase was assigned a molecular weight of the purified enzyme failed to hydrolyse isolated cell walls from either bakers yeast or Sp or to induce protoplast formation from IN cells of s japonicus var versatilis or saccharomyces cerevisiae
511,we conducted a controlled prospective trial to evaluate the effectiveness of rapidly infusing sodium bicarbonate nahco and saltpoor albumin into highrisk premature infants in the first hours of life fiftythree infants randomized into one of four treatment CG received ml per kilogram of a solution containing either a glucose in water b saltpoor albumin c nahco or d a combination of albumin and nahco after the initial infusion the babies received no colloid or alkali solutions until hours of age we managed them supportively with warmth appropriate oxygen administration isotonic fluid infusion and close monitoring among the infants who received alkali of acquired the RD syndrome rds died and four had intracranial hemorrhage among babies who received no alkali rds occurred in of died and none had intracranial hemorrhage these results do not support the common practice of rapidly infusing nahco into highrisk premature infants and they suggest that the early management of such infants needs renewed critical evaluation
512,an in vitro system for acetate incorporation into fatty acids by the mitochondrial and the cytosol fractions of rat testis is described the rate of incorporation of acetate into fatty acids was twice as fast with the mitochondrial as with the cytosol fraction both systems were stimulated in the presence of adenosine triphosphate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate coenzyme a and mgc the optimum ph was between for the mitochondrial fraction and between for the cytosol fraction radio gas chromatography showed that palmitic acid was the most highly labeled acid followed by stearic acid in the mitochondrial fraction in accord with the pathway of de novo HFA synthesis some of the labeled acetate was also incorporated into the and fatty acids of this fraction distribution of radioactivity among the mitochondrial lipid classes was highest in the phospholipids and monoglycerides followed by diglycerides and cholesterol little radioactivity was present in the triglyceride fraction these observations are in accord with studies of the incorporation of labeled metabolites into testicular lipids following intratesticular injection and indicate the validity of the in vitro system for studies of TPS reactions occurring in vivo
513,two strains of escherichia coli and one strain each of salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa were killed by the bactericidal activity of the lactoperoxidasethiocyanatehydrogen peroxide system in milk and in a synthetic medium ho was supplied exogenously by gl oxidase and glucose was produced at a level which was itself noninhibitory two phases were distinguished the first phase was dependent on the oxidation of scn by lactoperoxidase and ho which was reversed by reducing agent and the second phase was dependent on the presence of accumulated ho which was reversed by catalase the latter enzyme could also reverse the first phase but only when present in excessive and unphysiological levels the bactericidal activity was greatest at ph and below and it depended on the scnconcentration and on the number of organisms since raw or heated milk neutralizes the acid barrier against infection in the stomach the bactericidal system discussed may contribute to the prevention of enteric infections in neonates
514,in vitro bioluminescence components of the dinoflagellates gonyaulax polyedra g tamarensis dissodinium lunual and pyrocystis noctiluca were studied the luciferases and luciferins of the four species crossreact in all combinations all of these species possess highmolecular weight luciferases daltons with similar ph activity profiles the active single chains of luciferases from the gonyaulax species have a mw of while those from p noctiluca and d lunula have a mw of extractable luciferase activity varies with time of day in the two gonyaulax species but not in the other two a luciferin IB protein lbp can easily be extracted from the two gonyaulax species mw approximately daltons but none could be detected in extracts of either d lunula or p noctiluca scintillons are extractable from all four species but they vary in density and the degree to which activity can be increased by added luciferin although the biochemistry of bioluminescence in these dinoflagellates is generally similar the observations that d lunula and p noctiluca apparently lack lbp and have luciferases with low mw single chains require further clarification
515,phosphypyridoxyl trifluoroethylamine has been synthesized as an active sitedirected f nmr probe for AST transaminase this coenzyme derivative adds stoichiometrically to the apotransaminase as observed by both fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements the fluorinated phosphypyridoxamine derivative when bound to the apotransaminase will not dissociate upon extensive dialysis or passage through sephadex g the compound behaves as a pyridoxamine phosphate derivative and not as a coenzymesubstrate complex since both competing anions and dicarboxylic acid inhibitors still bind to the phosphopyridoxyl trifluoroethylamine enzyme the f nmr spectra of the enzymebound phosphopyridoxyl trifluoroethylamine were measured as a CF of ph ionic strength and temperature the f mnr of the enzymebound coenzyme derivative revealed no predetermined asymmetry in the subunits of AST transaminase insolution in terms of differences in chemical shift or resonance line shape between the two environments a phdependent chemical shift change of the single f resonance was observed which is consistent with the influence of a single ionization with an apparent pka of in m kcl at degrees increasing the ionic strength resulted in increasing values for the observed pka the highest recorded value was in m kcl the temperature dependence of the ph titration of the chemical shift gives deltah of ionization of kcalmol the evidence suggests a possible epsilonamino group electrostatically affected by positive charges being responsible for the titration effect of the active sitebound fluorine derivative of PMP
516,four fractions of protein kinase ec activity peak ih iih iiic and ivc have been resolved and partially purified from the x g supernatant fraction of bovine parotid glands by deaecellulose and phosphocellulose chromatographies the protein kinases of peak ih and iih were adenosine monophosphate cAMP dependent and had similar enzymic properties the enzyme activities of peak iiic and ivc were cyclicamp independent but there were some distinct differences between their properties the protein kinase in peak iiic was activated by m nacl or kcl and phosphorylated CS preferentially as the ATP utilizing only atp as a phosphate donor on the other hand the protein kinase in peak ivc was inhibited by univalent salts and preferred phosvitin to casein utilizing either atp or gtp as a phosphate donor tolbutamide increased the km value for atp and the KB for cAMP resulting in the inhibition of cyclicamp dependent protein kinase activity in the presence of cyclic amp tolbtamide and its carboxy derivative butylpcarboxyphenylsulfonylurea exerted almost no inhibitory effect on either the cyclicamp dependent protein kinase MICs in the absence of cyclic amp or on the cyclicamp independent protein kinase activities
517,bullfrog sympathetic ganglion cells produced hyperpolarizing adhyperpolarization and depolarizing addepolarization responses when adrenaline ad was directly applied to ganglia the nature of adhyperpolarization recorded by the sucrosegap method was analysed in the present experiment in order to clarify its electrogenesis the amplitude of adhyperpolarization was increased or decreased while GCL membranes were hyperpolarized or depolarized respectively by applying a moderate conditioning current to the ganglia the adhyperpolarization was depressed in krich solutions as well as in kdeficient solutions it was not significantly altered by replacing the extracellular total cl ions by equimolar glutamate or thiosulfate ions adhyperpolarization was depressed and finally abolished in the nafree tris solution and was reversibly eliminated in the solution where na ions were totally replaced by equimolar li ions it was enhanced when a preparation was previously perfused in the kfree narich solution for certain periods during which the intracellular na concentration might be increased adhyperpolarization was depressed by lowering the temperature and by the action of ouabain and the amplitude of adhyperpolarization was markedly increased in the presence of tea the ionic mechanism underlying the generation of adhyperpolarization was discussed on the basis of these present exp results and it was suggested that adhyperpolarization might be generated by an electrogenic sodium pump
518,the ph dependence of the IB of dye beibrich scarlet to hen eggwhite lysozymeec was studied at ionic strength and degrees by following circular dichroic cdbands originating from the bound dye this binding involved one of the catalytic groups glu the effect of the binding of nacetylglucosamine glcnac its dimer or trimer on the binding of this dye was also studied at ph by measuring changes in the cd bands of the dye bound to lysozyme it was shown that there are two sites for simultaneous IB of these saccharides in the lysozyme molecule the stronger binding of the saccharide was MK-801 and the weaker binding was competitive with dye binding the binding constants for the stronger binding site the upper portion of lysozyme cleft were in good agreement with those previously determined by following changes in the tryptophyl cd bands of lysozyme the binding constants to the weaker site were about x x and m for the trimer dimer and monomer of glcnac respectively assuming that the trimer dimer and monomer occupy subsites d e and f e and f and e respectively the unitary free energies of saccharide binding were estimated to be about and kcalmole for d e and f respectively
519,difluorophenyl carboxycsalicyclic acid mk was quickly and completely absorbed in rats dogs and man peak levels of plasma radioactivity occurred in hr T3 oral administration the dose was mgkg in rats and dogs and or mg in man most of the drug in plasma was intact mk which was extensively bound to plasma protein in man the peak concentration following the mg dose was approximately times that T3 the lower dose which suggests that absorption rates of both doses were similar elimination of drug from plasma was dosedependent the area under the curve for mkc in plasma was times higher following the mg dose than the mg dose dogs given mgkg orally or intravenously excreted of the dose in the urine and in the feces in hr rats given the same dose level by either route of administration excreted in the urine and in the feces in man approximately of a or mg oral dose was excreted in the urine and in the feces in hr mk and two metabolites were present in the urine of three species the ether and ester glucuronides were identified in human urine the latter metabolite was also identified in rat and dog urine the glycine conjugate of mk was not observed in the urine of the three species no interaction was observed between mk and bishydroxycoumarin in the prothrombin time test nor with tolbutamide in the gl ATT a significant lowering of hexobarbital sleeping time was observed in female but not male rats after four consecutive daily doses of mk after repeated daily administration of mk mgkg the diurnal plasma level in dogs was not significantly altered indicating that no saturation induction or inhibition of its own metabolism took place
520,in the hepatic cytosol fraction of bullfrog rana catesbeiana an ALP rnase ec exists in two forms one is the free form of rnase which elutes from a carboxymethylcellulose column at a concentration of m nac the other is a masked or latent form rnasernase inhibitor complex which is not adsorbed on the carboxymethylcellulose column and which can be converted to the free form of rnase by the addition of pchloromercuribenzoate electrophoretically pure rnase was obtained by the following procedure the unadsorbed fraction of hepatic cytosol on a column of carboxymethylcellulose was treated with pchloromercuribenzoate and then applied to a second carboxymethylcellulose column the molar weight of rnase was determined to be approximately by GF and polyacrylamide gel PACE in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate from the results of GF the molecular weight of the rnasernase inhibitor complex was the rnase hydrolyzed poly c poly u and poly i but not poly a or poly g when poly c was used as a substrate cyclic cmp as an intermediate and cmp as a final product were identified the results of amino acid analysis indicated the presence of an unusual component the general properties of the rnase and the rnasernase inhibitor complex are also reported
521,conformational changes of apo a the principal apoprotein of human plasma high density lipoprotein have been studied by differential scanning calorimetry and ultraviolet difference spectroscopy as a CF of temperature ph concentration of apoprotein and urea concentration calorimetry shows that apo a to mgml ph undergoes a twostate reversible denaturation enthalpy kcalmole between degrees Tm temperature tm degrees associated with a rise in heat capacity deltacvd of kcalmoledegrees c apo a to mgml ph develops a Nd spectrum between degrees with tm degrees the enthalpy deltah kcalmole at tm and heat capacity NC kcalmoledegrees c in the spectroscopic experiments were not significantly different from the calorimetric values below ph and above ph the calorimetric tm and deltah of denaturation are decreased in the ph range of reversible denaturation to delath and tm are linearly related showing that the heat capacity NC ddeltahdt associated with denaturation is independent of tm in urea solutions the calorimetric tm and deltah of denaturation are decreased at degrees apo a develops a Nd spectrum between and m urea fifty per cent of the spectral change occurs in m urea which corresponds to the urea concentration obtained by extrapolation of the calorimetric tm to degrees in urea solution of less than m there is hyperchromicity at nm delta epsilon in m urea indicating strong interaction of aromatic amino acid residues in the native molecule with the solvent spectrophotometric titration of apo a shows that of the tyrosine groups of apo a titrate at ph less than with similar titration curves obtained in AQ solutions and in m urea the free SE of stabilization deltag of the native conformation of apo a was estimated a at degrees using the calorimetric deltaa and deltacvd and b at degrees by extrapolation of spectroscopic data to zero urea concentration the values deltag degrees and deltag degrees kcalmole are small compared to typical globular proteins indicating that native apo a has a loosely folded tertiary structure the low values of deltag reflect the high degree of SE of hydrophobic areas in the native protein molecule the loosely folded conformation of apo a allows extensive binding of lipid since this can involve both surface hydrophobic sites and hydrophobic areas exposed by a cooperative low SE unfolding process
522,i report further experience in measuring ionized calcium ca with the amt electron system and its serum standards and solidstate dip calciumselective electrodes with this system serum ph can be adjusted with co gas and ca and ph simultaneously measured when co mm pco is used for sample equilibration the standard bicarbonate concentration is also provided i measured SS ca as a CF of ph between ph and and found the relationship to be reproducible with no evidence of irreversible complexing of ca when the ph of aerobically exposed mailed sera was restored to the original values their values for ca were the same as for the fresh sera measurement of ca in routinely aerobically handled sera after ph restoration with co gas was therefore validated both samples from within an institution and mailed specimens standardization to ph is recommended for routine measurements is generally more accurate than use of heparin or quasianaerobic techniques and is a practical RPA in patients with possible uncompensated acidbase disturbance which may be indicated by an abnormal standard bicarbonate concentration if not suspected clinically patient ph should be measured independently as part of the usual strict anaerobic bloodgasanalysis procedures abnormal patient ph must be considered in the interpretation of ca results determined at ph which are borderline or slightly abnormal most accurately ca may be measured in the separated sera at the previously determined patient ph value studies of AQ solutions with the currently used ca electrodes showed a selectivity coefficient the constant which relates the activity of an interfering ion to the activity of calcium that would contribute the same emf kna se and kmg se at physiological concentrations of ca physiologically encountered R2 in na is of no significance in resulting ca but extreme R2 in mg may cause an error of approximately
523,to examine the adaptations to low o and high co among fossorial and nonfossorial rodents hematological parameters were determined for laboratory rats the valley pocket gopher thomomys bottae from m and the mountain pocket gopher t umbrinus melanotis from m hematocrit hemoglobin concentration and o capacity were higher in pocket gophers than in rats blood po at saturation and ph was mmhg for both gophers and mmhg for rats bohr factors for all three rodents were similar to but buffer value delta log pcodelta ph was for t umbrinus for t bottae and for rattus concentrations of total acidsoluble phosphates were higher in gophers than in rats while bicarbonate values were within the normal mammalian range all three rodents had similar myoglobin concentrations in cardiac muscle myoglobin concentrations were significantly higher in skeletal muscles diaphragm gastrocnemius of t umbrinus when compared to t bottae and significantly higher in both gophers when compared to rats these differences may constitute important adaptations to the hypoxia and hypercapnia in burrows certain of these factors in pocket gophers respond to the additional AS of high ALT hypoxia
524,a circular dichroism cd study of dpro and dprobradykinin selected peptide fragments and the model compound nacetyllphenylalaninamide support our previous conclusion biochemistry that the positive nm cd band of bradykinin is a composite of bands due to two chromophores the nm band characteristic of the phe residues overlying the nm band of the nterminal sequence argpropro the results also indicate that the nm band of argpropro is associated with the configuration of the propro CS argdpropro and argprodpro virtually being diastereoisomers accordingly the conformation of argpropro was probed in further detail upon increasing the temperature from about to degrees c argpropro undergoes a conformational transition characterized by large positive values of deltahdegrees and deltasdegrees which is interpreted to mean that the structure of water and thus solutesolvent interactions play a dominant role in determining the conformation of the peptide c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicates that the effect of lowering the ph on the cd of argpropro is explicable in terms of hydrogenbond formation between the carboxyl group and pro carbonyl oxygen at acid ph with concomitant cis to trans isomerization
525,dopamine and isoproterenol although used primarily for their inotropic effects are also potent vasoactive substances to determine their effects on the pulmonary circulation we cannulated the left lower lobe bronchus in dogs to permit ventilation with either air or a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide systemic oxygenation was maintained by venitlating the RA lung with oxygen the lobe was perfused at a controlled flow rate and left atrial pressure was held constant hypoxic ventilation increased the lobar vascular resistance by p less than dopamine infusion mcg per kilogram per minute during air ventilation also increased lobar vascular resistance by p less than during hypoxic ventilation dopamine increased the resistance by an additional p less than in contrast isoproterenol mcg per kilogram per minute abolished the HPR p less than combined alpha and betaadrenergic blockade did not alter hypoxiainduced vasoconstriction whereas phentolamine blocked the dopamine response and propranolol abolished the isoproterenolinduced vasodilation these results indicate the following the hypoxic pressor response is independent of sympathetic innervation dopamine in dogs is a pulmonary vasoconstrictor and isoproterenol is a pulmonary vasodilator if these findings can be extrapolated to man isoproterenol may be the preferred inotropic agent in patients with an elevated pulmonary V1 resistance
526,the kinetics of cglycerol exchange was studied in human red cells glycerol appeared to be transported by two mechanisms i by facilitated diffusion with permeability depending on glycerol concentration and ii by an unspecific pathway presumably representing the diffusion of individual glycerol molecules through the membrane with permeability independent of glycerol concentration the latter permeability was x cms at degrees c it was independent of ph and had an activation SE of kcalmol the facilitated transport of glycerol was CR inhibited by cu and the activation energy was low about kcalmol the transport system was competitively inhibited by h reacting with at least three hydrogen analogue as well as dimethylsulfoxide a hydrogen bonding molecule with no structural resemblance to glycerol inhibited glycerol transport competitively steins dimerizer hypothesis was revised according to our findings a kinetic scheme describing the reactions of a transport controlling site with glycerol is presented in the appendix it is demonstrated in the article that the scheme accounts for out exp results
527,the loss in protein synthesis which the regenerating forelimb of the newt suffers after denervation can be recovered by infusing into it an extract of newt soluble brain protein moreover the synthesis of basic protein shows a greater response to the AS brain principle than does that of Pa the active agent of the nervous tissue is destroyed by heat and trypsin digestion extracts of liver and spleen similarly prepared do not evoke recovery of lost protein synthesis synaptosomal extracts of the frog BB also cause recovery of protein synthesis in the DNX regenerate demonstrating the likelihood that the AS agent is not speciesspecific within these amphibians that it is a constituent of the neuronal fraction of nervous tissue and that it is present in axonal terminals additional experiments showed that the nervous agent is likely a basic protein and that the amount of protein infused is of the order of only of the total regenerate protein the significance of the findings is discussed in relation to the nature of the effect on protein synthesis and the nature of the AS principle
528,the Eh of chloroperoxidase an enzyme which catalyzes peroxidative chlorination bromination and iodination reactions has been investigated in addition to catalyzing biological halogenation reactions chloroperoxidase is unusual in that the carbon monoxide complex of ferrous chloroperoxidase shows the typical long wavelength soret absorption associated with p hemoproteins the ph dependence of the chloroperoxidase oxidationreduction potential shows a discontinuity around ph similarly measurements of the affinity of ferrous chloroperoxidase for carbon monoxide monitored both by spectroscopic and potentiometric titration exhibit a discontinuity in the ph region oxidationreduction potential measurements on CPO in a co atmosphere also show a discontinuous ph profile these results suggest that ferrous chloroperoxidase undergoes reversible modification at low ph and that these changes are reflected in the oxidationreduction potential the oxidationreduction potential of chloroperoxidase at ph is mv close to that measured for cytochrome pcam in the presence of ATP the oxidationreduction potential of chloroperoxidase at ph the ph optimum for enzymatic chlorination is mv the oxidationreduction potentials of the halide complexes of chloroperoxidase chloride bromide and iodide are essentially identical with the potential measurements on the native enzyme these observations suggest that although halide anions bind to the enzyme they probably do not bind as an axial ligand to the heme ferric iron
529,membrane vesicles isolated from e coli generate a transmembrane proton gradient of ph units under appropriate conditions when assayed by flow dialysis using the CSD of weak acids to measure the proton gradient deltaph and the distribution of the lipophilic cation triphenylmethylphosphonium to measure the electrical potential across the membrane delta psi the vesicles are shown to generate an electrochemical proton gradient deltamuh of approximately mv at ph in the presence of ascorbate and phenazine methosulfate the major component of which is a deltaph of about mv as external ph is increased deltaph decreases reaching at ph and above while delta psi remains at about mv and internal ph remains at ph moreover the ability of various electron donors to drive transport is correlated with their ability to generate deltamuh in addition deltaph and delta psi can be varied reciprocally in the presence of valinomycin and nigericin these data and others manuscript in preparation provide convincing support for the role of chemiosmotic phenomena in active transport
530,in vitro assembly of TSH alpha and beta subunits led to an increase in content of alpha helix and beta sheet very similar to that found for gonadotropins this associationdependent active folding involved the burying of three IMT residues tentatively assigned to tyr alpha tyr beta and tyr beta and common to all studied glycoprotein hormones in vitro hybridizations between alpha and beta subunits of various hormones thyrotropin lutropin and choriogonadotropin from different species ovine bovine and human triggered the same molecular events as assembly of rat subunits the burying of three IMT residues and the increase of periodic structure of the folding these changes are slow timedependent processes rates and yields of hybrid formation measured by sedimentation analysis and difference spectroscopy of tyrosines are identical within exp error with the rates and yields measured by the REC of the biological activity either the stimulation of chick thyroids for thyrotropinbeta hybrids or binding to porcine testis receptors for gonadotropinbeta hybrids whatever the origin of the alpha S1 the thyrotropinbeta hybrids were not able to bind to testis receptors although AS on chick thyroids rates and yields of hybrid formation essentially depended on the origin of the beta subunit all the hybrids could be dissociated at acid ph with rates similar to those of native hormone the extension to TSH and various hybrids of the structural features of the in vitro assembly already recognized for gonadotropins strengthens the hypothesis that one deals with a basic activation process which also occurs in vivo after the synthesis of the subunits
531,the audiogenic seizureinducing drug h was found to elicit opposing effects on the in vivo accumulation of htp hydroxytryptophan and dopa dihydroxyphenylalanine in the brain following inhibition of lamino acid decarboxylase in strains of mice that normally do not exhibit audiogenic seizures h retarded the accumulation of htp in the telencephalon diencephalon and brainstem and enhanced the accumulation dopa in the diencephalon and brainstem the duration of the biochemical action of hcorrelated with the duration of the behavioral effect when h is administered to strains of mice with a geneticallydetermined susceptibility to audiogenic seizures but at an age when they are developing resistance to seizures h does not alter the incidence of soundinduced seizures the effect on the accumulation of htp and dopa was similar to that noted in the geneticallyresistant strain a retardation of the accumulation of htp in the telencephalon and BS and an enhancement of dopa accumulation in the brainstem since the rate of accumulation of htp and dopa is a measure of the in vivo rates of tryptophan and tyrosine hydroxylase respectively the results may reflect changes in neural activity with consequent effects on the synthesizing enzymes these results emphasize the usefulness of the drug in analyzing central mechanisms underlying audiogenic seizure activity and in studying PET properties and interactions of the central catecholand indoleamine systems
532,the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy has been investigated in a twostage devascularization MM in the rat with portavacal shunt and HAL there is a significant increase in BB octopamine and phenylethanolamine and a decrease in brain norepinephrine ne to hours after hepatic artery ligation the depletion of ne seems the sequel of diminished synthesis in the presence of an unaltered kcat due to a blockade of IMT hydroxylase either by accumulation of false neurochemical transmitters or by phenylalanine it is most marked in the SC and midbrain the highenergy phosphate EDC atp phosphocreatine and glucosephosphate are not diminished in hepatic coma nor is glucose indicating that other mechanism are involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic state by the increased ammonia level intestinal sterilization and total colectomy have no significant effect on the ammonia level but cause a decrease in the level or aromatic precursor amino acids in the plasma and brain with normalization of the level of cerebral transmitters these results permit the formulation of a unified concept of the hepatic coma syndrome and its clinical manifestations such as flapping tremor the hyperdynamic cardiovascular state and the HRS moreover they form the basis for the introduction of a new therapeutic principle in the management of hepatic encephalopathy by ldopa or modified CAA solutions which act by altering the central and peripheral neurotransmitters
533,"monophosphoglycerate mutase has been purified to homogeneity from outdated human erythrocytes as indicated by exclusion chromatography polyacrylamide gel PACE and equilibrium centrifugation occasionally the recommended purification procedure yields a small amount or less of a single extraneous protein which can be deleted from the enzyme preparation by employing an additional purification step the native enzyme has a molecular weight of to as determined by equilibrium centrifugation and exclusion chromatography disc gel PACE in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate yields a single protein band with a molecular weight of indicating that the native macromolecule is a dimer composed of subunits of similar mass homogeneous monophosphoglycerate mutase is free of 2,3-DPG mutase enolase and nonspecific phosphatase activities however the enzyme manifests intrinsic diphosphodglycerate phosphatase activity as shown by thermal denaturation studies the diphosphatase activity is stimulated by ppi and glycolatep but is inhibited by cl hso and pi the ph optimum for both the diphosphatase and the mutase is the km for diphosphodglycerate in the phosphatase reaction is mum at degrees and ph the amino acid composition of homogeneous monophosphoglycerate mutase is given"
534,a novel phosphodiesterase was purified from cultured tobacco cells to a state which appeared homogeneous on PAGE the enzyme hydrolyzed various PO and pyrophosphate bonds including pnitrophenyl thymidine phosphate pnitrophenyl thymidine phosphate cyclic nucleotides atp nad inorganic pyrophosphate dinucleotides and polyadenosine diphosphate ribose which is a polymer synthesized from nad however it did not hydrolyze highly polymerized polynucleotides the molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated as to by GF on sephadex g and biogel am sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the enzyme was composed of subunits with molecular weights calculated to be the enzyme did not require divalent cations for activity being fully AS in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid the ph optimum for the enzyme was approximately with pnitrophenyl thymidine phosphate or adenosine cyclic monophosphate and with nad double reciprocal plots of the initial velocity against the concentration of pnitrophenyl thymidine phosphate gave two apparent km values of and mm suggesting the presence of at least two AS CS
535,the effect of gvhr on thymusdependent lymphocytes of various lymphoid organs has been followed autoradiographically and by scintillation technique in a temporal dependence on the induction of the reaction gvhr was induced in bd x lw B/W rats with parental SP bd cells as marker of the thymusdependent lymphocytes the in vitro huridine incorporation was used compared to b cells t lymphocytes of rats have a higher ability of incorporating labeled uridine t lymphocytes in peripheral blood and the TD achieved their peak at or days following gvhr induction on the fourth day simultaneously with a gvhaltered thymus a rapid decline in the number of these cells was also observed a mobilization of t lymphocytes from the spleen and lymph nodes into the circulation already in the very first days of the reaction might be responsible for the peak seen in pbl and tdl the gvhalteration lasting days caused an evident reduction of thymusdependent lymphocytes in all the organs studied here the immunological attack of gvhr is considered to be primarily responsible for the exhaustion of t cells the discussion bears on the possibility of a more progressive action of gvhr on the more mature t lymphocyte subpopulation
536,the reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate gl with nad and nadp has been studied with stoppedflow techniques the enzyme was in all experiments present in excess of the coenzyme the results indicate that the ternary complex enadphkg is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable complex enadphgl the identification of the complexes is based on their absorption spectra the binding of the coenzyme to egl is the ratelimiting step in the formation of enadphkg while the dissociation of alphaketoglutarate kg from this complex is the ratelimiting step in the formation of enadphgl the km for glutamate was mm in the first reaction and mm in the formation of the SD complex the km values were independent of the coenzyme the reaction rates with nad were approximately greater than those with nadp furthermore high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of enadhkg while no substrate inhibition was found with nadp as coenzyme adp enhanced while gtp reduced the rate of enadphgl formation the rate of formation of enadphkg was inhibited by adp while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of gtp were added the results show that the higher activity found with nad compared to nadp under steadystate CA conditions do not necessarily involve IB of nad to the adp activating site of the enzyme moreover the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steadystate assay condition is not due to the formation of enadphgl as this complex is formed with km of mm glu and the substrate inhibition is only significant at times this concentration
537,redox components bound with chromatophores of rhodospirillum rubrum and pure samples of ubiquinone and rhodoquinone were studied polarographically at degrees in a mixture of ethanol and water vv at ph ubiquinone and rhodoquinone had halfwave potentials e of mv and mv respectively for both quinones values of the electron transfer number n were and plots of e versus ph formed straight lines with slopes of mvph in the neutral ph range thus values of the PT number na were estimated to be for both quinones when bound with chromatophores ubiquinone and rhodoquinone had e values of mv n and mv n respectively at ph values of na were estimated to be for ubiquinone and for rhodoquinone a component poc thought to be one of the active center bacteriochlorophylls liac was characterized it has e value of mv at ph and its oxidationreduction is possibly brought about by dehydrogenationhydrogenation conceivably the oxidationreduction sites of ubiquinone rhodoquinone and poc partly if not all exist on the surface of chromatophore membrane or project outside the membrane because of their accessibility to the polarographic electrode
538,the overall PET capacity of the CL was evaluated using sbromosulphophthalein bsp mgkg iv in biliary fistulated adult rats pretreated orally with different doses of paracetamol apap for varying time intervals the maximal hepatic damage occurred between h after single doses of apap or gkg hepatic excretory function returned to control levels by hours administration of either or gkg apap h before bsp caused a dosedependent inhibition of the choleretic effect of bsp and of the min cumulative excretion of the dye but conversely produced a significant increase in the liver and plasma concentrations of s following acute gkg or subacute gkg twice daily for days treatment with apap the total excretion of s in bile and the retention of s in the liver or plasma remained essentially the same as that for the controls in rats given single doses of gkg apap the hepatic uptake of the dye was significantly increased during the early stages of intoxication while the opposite effect was observed at late periods the bile flow appeared to be inversely related to the excretion of unchanged bsp and directly related to the excretion of the major bsp conjugate in bile the hepatic clearance of bsp was more rapid in rats treated subacutely with or gkg apap than in those treated acutely with equal doses suggesting that the intensity of apapinduced hepatotoxicity became less severe T3 the repeated administration of this drug it is concluded that the hepatic uptake metabolism and excretion of bsp are reversibly impaired following apapinduced CL injury

540,rat tissues were surveyed for proteins which bind cgmp CBA was high in extracts of lung cerebellum and small intestine but was low in those of liver adipose tissue and skeletal muscle deaecellulose chromatography resolved two peaks of cgmpbinding activity in most tissues the binding protein in peak was eluted in the flowthrough volume and was most abundant in extracts of intestine it had a sedimentation coefficient of s and was highly specific for cgmp at ph dissociation constant kd mum no cgmpdependent histone kinase activity was found for this peak the IB protein in peak was eluted by m nacl and was the predominant binding substance in lung cerebellum and heart it had a sedimentation coefficient of s and IB was also highly TPS for cgmp with a kd of mum this peak of CBA was associated with cgmpdependent protein kinase activity which could be purified approximately fold by sepharose b chromatography cyclic gmp dependency of kinase activity was observed only at low histone concentrations the abundance of one or both the above binding proteins correlated with the known basal levels of cgmp in the tissues
541,a weak base morpholine has been labelled with h and tested for its suitability as an indicator for intracellular ph by distribution in the tissue water of frog sartorius muscle in the species hyla litoria its pka at degrees c in a solution of the same ionic strength as frog ringer was found to be which is in the range of maximal sensitivity morpholine equilibrated with the tissue in h it was shown that it was not bound to intracellular constituents that it was not metabolised nor toxic in the concentrations used it was therefore judged suitable as a ph indcator intracellular ph was then measured by distribution of morpholine nicotine and the weak acid DMO and the phsensitive microelectrodes the equilibrium value it was shown that the four significantly different values could not be reconciled in terms of exp error heterogeneity of intracellular ph liquid junction PDs or binding of indicator molecules inside the fibre they could however be reconciled if the fibre water had different structure and solvent properties from the extracellular water and all ions were distributed across the membrane as between two liquid phases containing different solvents then the h would be in equilibrium as shown by the microelectrode measurement but intracellular ph would be indeterminable and probably greater than
542,cytologic biochemical and immunoelectrophoretic studies were carried out of amniotic fluids in ewes with normal pregnancy and ewes that had miscarried each month of pregnancy a total of and animals of the two CG respectively were studied it was found that the biochemical and metabolic processes taking place in the fetus lead to changes in the amniotic fluids altering the ph value the alkali reserve the content of potassium calcium phosphorus ALP phosphatase as well as their bactericidal activity more characteristic changes linked with pregnancy were observed in the cell composition of the amniotic fluids with advancing in age the increase in cell count was accompanied IF with NB sulfate with a rise of the orange cell content the amniotic fluids of ewes with normal pregnancy were found to contain proteins which precipitated with hyper immune sera against blood SS and kidney heart and placenta proteins in ewes that had miscarried the ph values of the amniotic fluids dropped in the months when abortions took place and as against and respectively along with ph the alkali reserve also dropped to in the first month and in the fifth month in ewes that had miscarried in the nd rd and th month these values were and cu cm respectively in cases of abortions the protein composition of the amniotic fluids showed higher C2 of the alfa and beta globulins
543,the yeast proteinase that causes activation of the chitin synthetase zymogen has been purified by a procedure that includes affinity chromatography on an agarose column to which the proteinaceous inhibitor of the enzyme had been covalently attached the purified enzyme yielded a single band upon disc gel PACE at ph in the presence of urea at the same ph but without urea a faint band was detected in coincidence with enzymatic activity whereas at ph either in the absence or in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate no protein zone could be seen from sedimentation and gel filtration data a molecular weight of was estimated the proteinase was active within a wide range of ph values with an optimum between ph and titraton of the activity with the protein inhibitor from yeast required mol of inhibitormol of enzyme a similar result was obtained with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride an indication that serine residue is required for enzymatic activity the enzyme exhibited hydrolytic activity with several proteins and esterolytic activity with many synthetic substrates including benzoylarginine ethyl ester and acetyltyrosine ethyl estera comparison of the properties of the enzyme with those of known yeast proteinases led to the conclusion that the chitin synthestase activating factor is identical with the enzyme previously designated as proteinase b ec this is the first time that a homogeneous preparation of proteinase b has been obtained and characterized
544,e coli b tsnc an e coli b mutant with normal phenotype unable to replicate phage t dna chamberlin m j virol contained no detectable level of thioredoxin when assayed with ribonucleotide reductase deoxyribonucleosidediphosphateoxidizedthioredoxin oxidoreductase ec gently lysed e coli tsnc cell extracts reduced cdp when supplemented with nadph as efficiently as the parent CS e coli b despite the lack of thioredoxin indicating the presence of another hydrogen transport system this could be divided into two parts by heat treatment at degrees one heatstable fraction which was AS in the presence of dithiothreitol or glutathione and one heatlabile fraction addition of yeast glutathione reductase nadphoxidizedglutathione oxidoreductase ec to the heated extracts restored full activity the results demonstrate a novel hydrogen transport system in e coli consisting of nadph glutathione glutathione reductase and a HS enzyme called glutaredoxin reduced glutathione at physiological concentrations functions as hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reduction only in the presence of glutaredoxin glutaredoxin was not reduced by e coli thioredoxin reductase nadphoxidizedthioredoxin oxidoreductase ec and showed no crossreaction with antibodies against thioredoxin these results demonstrate the existence of two different electron transfer systems from nadph to deoxyribonucleotides and provide a CF for glutathione in dna synthesis
545,the purine precursor in the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway in eremothecium ashbyii was examined using a guanine analogue azaguanine with nongrowing cell systems riboflavin formation in the SC filtrate was determined at and hr after start of the incubation of the nongrowing cells in the presence of xanthine or azaguanine mm respectively at hr of incubation the addition of xanthine stimulated riboflavin formation by and the addition of azaguanine inhibited the formation by acid soluble nucleotide pools in the cells were followed at and hr of the incubation period in the presence of xanthine or azaguanine by means of anion exchange column chromatography the result showed that the gtp pool changed markedly despite the fact that the adenosine nucleotide pool was almost constant irrespective of the presence or absence of these purines till hr of incubation but the decrease of the former was overcome in part by the addition of flavinogenic xanthine furthermore the total amounts of gtp and guanosine accumulated in cells in the presence of azaguanine reached the maximum already at hr attaining a level twice as much as the gtp contents of the control the role of guanosine nucleotide pool in riboflavin formation was further examined using azaguanine in this experiment the drug was added to the suspension of nongrowing cells at hr or hr after the incubation was started and the reaction was continued till the th hr a more clearcut correlationship between riboflavin formation and guanosine nucleotide pool was oberved by this experiment the guanosine nucleotide pool consisting of gmp gdp and gtp increased simultaneously with the inhibition of riboflavin formation of the guanosine nucleotides pools the gmp pool increased times above normal upon the addition of azaguanine during the incubation for hr and fold for hr while the gtp pool increased fold above normal for hrs incubation in the supplementation of this drug but decreased to onehalf of the normal at the incubation period of hr in these cases the decreased amounts of gtp were equal to the increased amounts of gmp during the incubation periods of hr and hr in the presence of added azaguanine the above results suggest strongly that gtp is an immediate F0 of riboflavin in the form of nucleotide
546,oxidative capacity of the fusidinproducing strains with various biosynthetic activity was studied comparatively the studies showed that by their capacity to oxidize pyruvate and some metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid cycle acetate succinate malate the strains were arranged in the order reverse to their antibiotic activity such regularity was observed during the whole fermentation process and was most pronounced by the rd and th days beginning of the idiophase the rate of gl oxidation was higher in more active strains the same regularity was noted in the nd phase of the strain OD associated with beginning of fusidin biosynthesis in the st phase the st and nd days the strains almost did not differ by their capacity to oxidize glucose by oxidation of phosphorylated ethers of carbohydrates glucosephosphate and fructosophosphate the strains did not differ various fusidinproducing strains Ox nadn and nadpn approximately with the same rate it is supposed that mutations leading to increased antibiotic production are associated with changes in acetate metabolism in the direction of more intensive biosynthesis of isoprenoid compounds potential precursors of the fusidin molecule
547,the ultrastructural localization of NOX a possible enzyme in the increased oxidative activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes pmn during phagocytosis was studied a new cytochemical technique for the localization of ho a product of NOX activity was developed cerous ions in the presence of peroxide form an electrondense precipitate resting and phagocytically stimulated pmn were exposed to cerous ions at ph to demonstrate sites of nadhdependent cyanideinsensitive ho production resting pmn exhibites slight activity on the plasma membrane phagocytizing pmn had extensive deposits of RP localized within the phagosome and on the BPM peroxide involvement was demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of catalase on cerium precipitation the surface localization of the enzyme responsible was confirmed by using nonpenetrating inhibitors of enzymatic activity a correlative study was performed with an nadhdependent tetrazoliumreduction system as with cerium formazan deposition on the surface of the cell was nadh dependent cyanide insensitive and stimulated by phagocytosis superoxide dismutase did not inhibit tetrazolium reduction as observed cytochemically indicating direct enzymatic dye reduction without superoxide interposition these findings combined with oxygen consumption studies on resting and stimulated pmn in the presence or absence of nadh indicate that NOX is a surface enzyme in human pmn it is internalized during phagocytosis and retains its peroxidegenerating capacity within the phagocytic vacuole
548,gammaglutamyl transpeptidase present in various mammalian tissues transfers the gammaglutamyl moiety of glutathione to a variety of acceptor amino acids and MMP this enzyme has been purified from human kidney cortex about fold to a specific activity of unitsmg of protein the purification steps involved incubation of the TH at degrees followed by centrifugation and SE of the sediment with m trishcl buffer ph containing sodium deoxycholate batchwise absorption on deaecellulose deaecellulose de column chromatography sephadex g gel filtration and AC using concanavalin a insolubilized on beaded agarose detergents were used throughout the purification of the enzyme the purified enzyme separated into three protein bands all of which had CEA on polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis in the presence of triton x the enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of about as shown by sephadex g gel filtration and appears to be a tetramer with subunits of molecular weights of about the km for gammaglutamyl transpeptidase using the artificial substrate gammaglutamylpnitroanilide with glycylglycine as the acceptor amino acid was found to be about mm the optimum ph for the CEA is and the isoelectric point is both gsh and gssg competitively inhibited the activity of gammaglutamyl transpeptidase when gammaglutamylpnitroanilide was used as the substrate treatment of the purified enzyme with papain has no effect on the enzyme activity or mobility on polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis the purified gammaglutamyl transpeptidase had no phosphateindependent GA activity the ratio of gammaglutamyl transpeptidase to phosphateindependent glutaminase changed significantly through the initial steps of gammaglutamyl transpeptidase purification these studies indicate that the transpeptidase and phosphateindependent glutaminase activities are not exhibited by the same protein in human kidney
549,from a pair of parietal electrodes an original apparatusthe monitor of CBF functiongives a nonstop recording of the brain electric activity for frequencies ranging from to hertz it is at the moment less expensive than an ordinary eeg apparatus easy to carry to use and to read the artefacts interferences or technical defects are either totally eliminated or immediately detected thanks to a parallel graph it is the first apparatus that has been conceived and used as a routine instrument for cerebral monitoring it can be used in the intensive ECU as well as in the operating theatrepreventively whenever there is a risk of an alteration in the cerebral circulation cec extracorporal circulation for instance as a diagnosis a prognosis or a therapy when there is a cerebral lesion whatever the origin of it can be the use of this apparatus that has now become part of the daily routine at the london hospital has quickly proved indispensable and the common eeg is no longer being resorted to except upon very few occasions
550,four healthy subjects and four addicts on high daily maintenance doses of methadone each received a parenteral dose of methadone hydrochloride following an overnight fast the concentration of methadone in blood was compared with that in the gastric juice obtained over hr by continuous lowpressure suction via a nasogastric tube the concentration in the gastric juice was times that measured at the same time in the blood thus hr T3 the injection mean blood concentrations of and ng of methadone per ml were recorded in the normal subjects and the addicts respectively the corresponding concentrations in gastric juice were ngml and ngml respectively in the normal subjects about of the administered dose was recovered in the gastric juice in hr whereas in addicts about was recovered the greater recovery of MTD from the addicts appears to be the result of the larger volume of gastric juice recovered from the latter subjects methadone was also excreted in the saliva of both groups of subjects in addicts salivary concentrations were often times those recorded in the blood the nmonodemethylated metabolite of methadone was identified in the gastric juice of addicts by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry
551,cells of azotobacter vinelandii atcc can be transformed by exogenous deoxyribonucleic acid towards the end of exponential growth transformation occurs at very low frequencies when the deoxyribonucleic acid is purified or when the transformation is carried out in liquid medium optimal transformation occurs on plates of burk nitrogenfree gl medium containing either high phosphate mm or low calcium to mm content higher C2 of calcium are inhibitory whereas magnesium ions are essential for transformation and growth extracellular polymer and capsule are increasingly inhibitory to transformation and are most abundant when the calcium content of the medium is high transformation is optimal at ph to and at c conditions which also coincide with minimal extracellular polymer production nonencapsulated strains are excellent transformation recipients glycineinduced pleomorphism reduces the transformation frequency and the degree of inhibition is dependent on the phosphate concentration of the medium RFP resistance and shifts from adenine hypoxanthine uracil and nitrogenase auxotrophy to prototrophy can be achieved although single marker transfer is always greater than double marker transfer the data suggest that rifampin resistance is linked to hypoxanthine adenine and uracil protorophy at intervals of increasing distance rifampin resistance did not appear to be linked to nitrogenase
552,the determination with murexide of free and proteinbound calcium in model systems of known composition ionic strength and ph was investigated the spectra of calcium murexide in the presence of varying amounts of calcium ions indicated that the absorption maximum fo calcium murexide complex occurs at nm while that of murexide ion is at nm the absorbance at nm is independent of calcium ion concentration and therefore could be used to measure the total dye the spectra are ph dependent but constant in the range to the apparent dissociation constant of calcium murexide is dependent upon ionic environment ionic strength and free calcium ion concentration the relationship between the apparent dissociation constant and free calcium concentration was established whole CS had no effect on the absorption spectra of calcium murexide and no affinity for calcium murexide complex or murexide ion betacasein at the concentrations employed did not influence the dissociation fo calcium murexide at ph ionic strength and c betacasein bound calcium as if there were IB sites per molecule each of pk corresponding to an intrinsic association constant of liters per mole
553,cell free preparations of the wholecell lysate and ultrafiltration uf fractions of broth cultures of a strain of enterobacter cloacae isolated from a puerto rican with tropical sprue were assayed for their ability to induce in vivo net water secretion in the rat jejunum the wholecell lysate and um retentate of broth cultures were inactive the um retentate and filtrate were active at a concentration of mugml or more the toxigenic activity was entirely retained and increased to mugml by a um membrane washing this retentate yielded a fraction with an activity of ngml stationary aerobic SC conditions yielded the most active uf fractions when ammonium sulfate was used as the precipitating agent whereas anaerobic culture conditions produced the most active fractions in broth cultures precipitated by acetone passage of the active acetoneprecipitated uf fractions through a sephadex g column yielded eluate pools with enhanced toxigenic activity in or adjacent to the void volume but maximum activity of the ammonium sulfateprecipitated um retentate eluated at a kav of to neither of the most AS gel filtration elution fractions of the um retentates contained detectable carbohydrate suggesting that the toxin is not associated with endotoxin toxigenic activity was unaltered by SE to a temperature of c for min lowering the ph to or incubation with either pronase or trypsin these observations indicate that the CS of e cloacae under study elaborates a heatstable enterotoxin htat has approximately the same molecular weight and shares many of the characteristics of the heatstable enterotoxin produced by some strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae
554,myoplasmic impedance was measured on a barnacle balanus nubilus single muscle fiber that was placed in a cylindrical cavity to limit the volume and prevent the hydration of the myoplasm at both ends of the cavity the myoplasm was in direct contact with an electrolyte solution when equilibrium with the external medium was reached the myoplasmic impedance was measured at degrees c with an impedance bridge at hz the results indicated that the myoplasmic impedance of the muscle fiber is mainly resistive treating the myoplasm as a suspension of small conductive particles we deduced the TPS conductivity of the contractile filaments kf and their volume fraction rho kf x omegacm and rho the experimental technique permits an estimate of the specific myoplasmic conductivity in vivo x omegacm finally a decrease in the ph of the external solution from to lowered the myoplasmic conductivity by this may be considered as indirect evidence that the conductivity of the contractile filaments is associated with the protein counterions since hinke et al ann ny acad sci reported evidence that a lowering of ph decreases the number of counterions
555,the influence of the sympathetic nervous system on the cerebral circulatory response to graded reductions in mean arterial blood pressure was studied in anesthetized baboons cerebral blood flow was measured by the xe clearance method and arterial blood pressure was decreased by controlled hemorrhage in normal baboons the constancy of cerebral blood flow was maintained until mean arterial blood pressure was approximately of the baseline value thereafter CBF blood flow decreased when arterial blood pressure was reduced superior cervical sympathectomy of weeks duration did not affect the normal response in contrast both acute surgical sympathectomy cervical trunk division and alphareceptor blockade mgkg of phenoxybenzamine enhanced the maintenance of CBF blood flow in the face of hemorrhagic hypotension in that CBF blood flow did not decrease until mean arterial blood pressure was approximately of the baseline value the results indicate that the sympathetic nervous system is not involved in the maintenance of CBF blood flow in the face of a fall in arterial blood pressure indeed the implication is that the sympathicoadrenal discharge accompanying HH is detrimental to rather than responsible for CBF autoregulation
556,the present study was designed to assess the effects of two betaadrenergic agonists isoproterenol sulfate and carbuterol hydrochloride and aerosolized freon propellant a mixture of freon ii freon and freon on tracheal mucous velocity and cardiac SO in anesthetized dogs five CG of ten animals each received the following dosages of aerosols freon puffs isoproterenol four puffs carbuterol four puffs isoproterenol puffs and carbuterol puffs the puff was delivered by a standard metered aerosol each puff of isoproterenol spray contained mug of isoproterenol sulfate and each puff of carbuterol spray contained mug of carbuterol hydrochloride tracheal mucous velocity was not changed by receiving freon but administration of both isoproterenol and carbuterol caused a significant increase in this measurement with peak increases ranging from to percent above control values the duration of action for four and puffs of isoproterenol and for four puffs of carbuterol was two hours twenty puffs of carbuterol increased tracheal mucous velocity for three hours administration of carbuterol effected a slightly larger increase in cardiac SO than isoproterenol the duration of action for the increased cardiac output was shorter than the duration of action for the increased tracheal mucous velocity these studies indicate that betaadrenergic agonists may have an important role in improving mucous transport in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in whom mucociliary clearance is depressed
557,transplantable mouse melanomas possess a melanotropinsensitive adenylate cyclase system which is responsive to alphamelanotropin betamelanotropin adrenocorticotropin acth and prostaglandin e it was found that sensitivity to acth was not directed towards the acth activity but to the intrinsic melanotropin activity of the acth molecule therefore the melanotropinsensitive adenylate cyclase system is hormonally specific to the intrinsic melanotropin activity of peptide hormones and is unique in the melanoma tissue the significance of the sensitivity to prostaglandin e is obscure at present the melanotropinsensitive adenylate cyclase requires the presence of mg or mn for its enzymic activity ca inhibit the enzyme in the presence of a wide range of concentrations of mg the enzymic activity is atp concentrationdependent and the saturation concentration appears to be mm the enzyme is very labile in the unfractionated tumor homogenates a washed x g particulate fraction representing about of the total enzymic activity was found to be more stable and could be stored at degrees c for h without appreciable loss of the activity this fraction retained sensitivity to melanotropin prostaglandin e and naf about of the activity of the tumor TH could not be sedimented by centrifugation at x g for min this soluble fraction was not responsive to melanotropin prostaglandin e and naf and might be a degradative product produced by the fractionation cAMP and alphamelanotropin were able to increase the tyr activity of isolated mouse melanomacells in vitro under the same conditions
558,lactalbumin hydrolyzate lh a commercially prepared enzymatic digest of a milk protein fraction can partially replace the serum requirement of svt cells in a low but obligatory background of calf SS vv lh carses a large increase in the final cell density x over the control while modestly steimulating the actual growth rate lactalbumin hydrolyzate does not contain survival activity for svt cells and does not affect the growth of t cells since even prolonged SE to ph or results in complete abolishment of the growthrate stimulatory capability without affecting the capacity to increase the final cell density it is possible that the lh growth activity may consist of two dissociable components all of lh growth activity is water soluble autoclavable and resists proteolytic treatment on sephadex g growth activity appears as a single peak at the void volume but on g it is retained beyond the void volume as a broad skewed peak the relevant molecular weight range lies between and the putative low ph resistant material is strongly adsorbed to dowex x and can be displaced from the column by a reduction in the ph a comparison of the properties of the lh factors with those of known growth promoting agents isolated from serum and various enzymatic digests indicates that these new factors do not correspond to any of these agents
559,we examined the possibility that dopamine may play a role in nervemediated off responses of esophageal body eb and relaxations of lower esophageal spincter les smooth muscle the effects of dopamine epinine and dopamine antagonists on eb and les smooth muscle were studied on these responses dopamine and epinine caused a doserelated fall in basal les muscle tension and in amplitude of eb muscle off responses threshold dose for both was about m and maximal dose was about m at high concentrations they also caused repetitive transient contractions of both les and eb muscle T3 the period of inhibition these effects were antagonized by haloperidol m and bulbocapnine m but were not influenced by propranolol m nor by phenoxybenzamine m neither haloperidol nor bulbocapnine influenced responses to electrical field stimulation tetrodotoxin m abolished the responses to electrical field stimulation but did not antagonize the effects of dopamine and epinine eb and les smooth muscle contain a dopamine receptor it is unlikely that dopamine is involved in responses to EFS
560,the child health associate program provides a model for using social workers in the training of new health professionals administratively social workers have contributed to curriculum OD in the behavioral sciences they have influenced decisions regarding student selection and have developed and implemented a faculty adviser program because of their practical experience as primary care practitioners social workers have been able to define effectively the skills needed by the new professionals to meet the social and emotional needs of their patients social workers have made use of their contacts in hospitals and communities to design and implement courses and clinics that combine in a meaningful manner theoretical material and practical experiences in patient contact evaluative research in the area of interviewing skills and crisis management demonstrates that the teaching methods applied by the social work profession are ERP in increasing the level of students interviewing skills in clinical practice and help prepare them to recognize familiy crises
561,nadhcoenzyme q reductase from bovine heart mitochondria complex i was incorporated into phospholipid LDV by the cholate dialysis procedure mixtures of purified phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were required oxidation of nadh by coenzyme q catalyzed by the reconstituted vesicles was coupled to proton translocation directed inward with an he ratio greater than similar experiments measuring proton translocation in submitochondrial particles gave an he ratio of the proton translocation in both systems was not seen in the presence of uncoupling agents and was in addition to the net proton uptake from the reduction of coenzyme q by nadh electron transfer in the reconstituted LDV also caused the uptake of the permeant anion tetraphenylboron the rate of electron transfer by the reconstituted vesicles was stimulated about fold by uncouplers or by valinomycin plus nigericin and k ions the results indicate that energy coupling can be observed with isolated nadhcoenzyme q reductase if the enzyme complex is properly incorporated into a phospholipid vesicle
562,when gnrh is radioiodinated by the chloraminet method two immunoreactive labeled species are formed at ph with a chloraminet gnrh molar ratio of whereas four bands i iia iib and iii are separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when the hormone is iodinated at ph in a system containing a molar ratio of chloraminetgnrh because they were more stable and were more immunoreactive than the other products band i and band iia from the latter system were used separately as tracers with niswender antiserum r in radioimmunoassays for gnrh the standard curves of each tracer are distinct when analyzed after loglogit transformation the band i curve had a mean slope of se and a bbt level of pg n of synthetic gnrh whereas the band iia standard curve had a slope of and a bbt value of pg n the sensitivity of both assays is approximately pg gn rh Cmax and serum samples assayed with band i were consistently greater than those assayed with band iia normal adult male plasmas assayed with band i measured pgml whereas band iia values were pgml no difference between plasma and SS was detected nor was there any difference among adult men adult women prepubertal children hypogonadal patients or hypopituitary patients with either assay plasma gnrh concentrations were also similar in jugular and vena cava samples from intact and castrated male rats because many of the samples were at or below the sensitivity of the band iia assay they were concentrated T3 extraction with either methanol or acidethanol however endogenous immunoreactive gnrh could not be concentrated by these extraction procedures as measured in the band iia assay Thy extracts from control adult male rats contained ng while hypothalami from castrated rats contained ng similar but slightly lower values were obtained with band i in contrast the gnrh content of pineal PG from intact and castrated male rats was similar approximately pg when determined in either CA these studies emphasize that the characteristics of the radioiodinated hormone can influence the quantitation of gnrh and endogenous PC of gnrh are much lower than previously reported
563,the mechanisms involved in the pulmonary vascular and airway responses to pulmonary microembolism have not been clearly defined therefore we determined the effects of TPS prostaglandin and histamine blockade on the hemodynamic and arterial blood gas tension responses to particulate microembolism mu glass beads in IN anesthetized dogs the marked increases in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance observed in the untreated dogs were attenuated but not abolished following both prostaglandin blockade with either meclofenamate or polyphloretin phosphate and histamine blockade with chlorpheniramine and metiamide at minutes and were still att T2 post embolization combined prostaglandin and histamine blockade further attenuated but again did not abolish the pulmonary vascular responses cardiac outputs and systemic arterial pressures were unchanged from control by embolism the alveolar hypoventilation decreased arterial oxygen tension and increased carbon dioxide tension observed in the untreated embolized dogs was prevented only with the prostaglandin inhibitors pulmonary microembolism in intact dogs therefore appears to induce vasoconstriction mediated partially by prostaglandin and histamine action and alveolar hypoventilation mediated by prostaglandin but not histamine action
564,hydrogendeuterium exchange in h solutions of the two redox states of horse HR cytochrome c was investigated at degrees c ph by mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy mass spectrometry indicates that ferricytochrome has hydrogens unexchanged T3 h hydrogens exchanging between min and h and hydrogens exchanging within min comparative values for ferrocytochrome are and the MSD of the exchange curves obtained by infrared corresponds to to peptide hydrogens these combined methods show many nonpeptide hydrogens exchanging rapidly and for ferricytochrome c and ferrocytochrome c respectively whereas others probably buried inside the molecule and involved in hydrogen bonds are not exchanged even after h and hydrogens respectively which is relatively large for a small protein infrared results are given in terms of changes of standard free energy for the transconformational reaction which exposes the peptide hydrogens to solvent in ferricytochrome c and ferrycoytochrome c and respectively of the peptide hydrogens are protected by conformational transitions stabilized by more than kcalmol kjmol which implies a large increase in rigidity for the reduced form
565,in a previous paper kinetic equations of secondary AS transport by cotransport have been derived in the present paper these equations have been expanded by including the effect of an electrical potential difference in order to make them applicable to the more realistic systems of AA active transport driven by the gradients of na or h thermodynamically an electrical potential difference is as a driving force fully exchangeable with an equivalent chemical potential difference this is not necessarily so for the kinetics of cotransport it is not always the same whether a given difference in electrochemical activity of the driver ion is mainly osmotic ie due to difference in concentration or electric ie due to a difference in the electrochemical AC in most cases a difference in concentration is more effective in driving cotransport than is an equivalent difference in electrical potential leading to the same difference in EA the effectiveness of the latter highly depends on the model whether it is of the affinity type or of the velocity type but also on whether the loaded or the unloaded carrier bears an electrical charge with the same electrical potential difference cotransport is as a rule faster if the ternary complex rather than the empty carrier is charged also the standard parameters see glossary page jmax and km of the overall transport respond differently to the introduction of an electrical potential difference depending on the model so an electrical potential difference will mostly affect km if the loaded carrier is ionic and mostly jmax if the empty carrier is ionic provided that the mobility of the loaded carrier is greater than that of the empty one on the other hand distinctive criteria between affinity type and velocity type models are partly affected by an electrical potential difference if the translocation steps of loaded and unloaded carrier are no longer rate limiting for the overall transport electrical effects on the transport rate are bound to vanish as does the activation by cotransport
566,the metabolism and disposition of the bronchodilator ntbutylarterenol tba and its diptoluate ester bitolterol were compared in the rat radioactivity was preferentially retained in lungs of rats compared with heart and blood after iv medication with tritiumlabeled bitolterol but was not retained in tissues T3 iv medication with htba T3 oral and iv medication with hbitolterol fecal radioactivity accounted for of the dose and and of the radioactivity respectively was excreted in urine hr in comparison urine radioactivity T3 oral and iv medication with htba was and of the dose respectively and fecal radioactivity accounted for or of the dose respectively hr bitolterol was hydrolyzed in vitro to tba by esterases found in various tissues including small intestine liver and plasma moreover tba was a ATP for catecholamine omethyltransferase but not for monoamine oxidase similar metabolites were observed in urine samples of rats given either htba or hbitolterol urine metabolites were identified as free and conjugated forms of both tba and omethyltba
567,the obligate intracellular parasitic bacterium rickettsia prowazeki has a carriermediated transport system for adp and atp the transport of nucleotides was measured by membrane filtration assays the assay was shown not to harm the relatively labile rickettsiae the nucleotide transport system was shown to reside in the rickettsiae not in the contaminating yolk sac mitochondria of the preparation the influx of nucleotide had an activation energy of to kcal above degrees an apparent transition temperature and kcal below this value the uptake of nucleotide was independent of the mg concentration but was markedly stimulated by the phosphate concentration the ph optimum of the influx of nucleotide was ph the specificity of the transport system was remarkable in that it required a TPS moiety in each portion of the nucleotide ie an adenine base a ribose sugar and two or three but not one phosphates of the wide variety of compounds tested the system could transport only adp atp and beta gammamethylene adenosine triphosphate the influx of nucleotide was a saturable process halfmaximum velocity was achieved at a nucleotide concentration of about mum adp and atp were competitive inhibitors of each others transport although at least of the labeled intracellular nucleotide was exchangeable efflux of labeled nucleotide was observed only in the presence of unlabeled nucleotide in the medium halfmaximum efflux was achieved at a concentration of about mum a C1 intracellular to extracellular concentration gradient of labeled nucleotide was maintained in the presence of metabolic inhibitors and uncouplers which CR abolished rickettsial hemolysis while having no effect on the steady state kcn and dnp accelerated both influx and efflux measurements of the endogenous pool of adenine nucleotides in isolated rickettsiae show that is was large mm and that these unlabeled nucleotides exchanged on approximately a basis with exogenously added nucleotide these studies support the proposal that rickettsiae are not leaky to adenine nucleotides or to small molecules in general and that they have a carriermediated transport system which allows an exchange of host and parasite adp and atp
568,total atpase levels were determined in homogenate fractions of bakers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae k and rhodotorula glutinis the maximum atpase activities in x g supernatant of the three yeast strains were and mmol pih gds respectively the activities in the sediment were somewhat higher exponential cells of s cerevisiae k and r glutinis exhibited higher atpase levels than did the stationary cells the total atpase activity in both yeast species showed a maximum at ph a minimum at ph and another broader masimum around ph no significant nakatpase activity was detected in bakers yeast in either the exponential or the stationary cells of r glutinis and in exponential s cerevisiae k cells in the ph range of stationary cells of s cerevisiae k exhibited at ph a nakatpase activity attaining of total atpase level x m phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride had no effect on the total atpase level in s cerevisiae and inhibited the activity in r glutinis by it did not bring forth any nakatpase activity apart from that found in its absence m urea lowered the atpase activity in r glutinis by but had no effect on s cerevisiae cells m dicyclohexylcarbodiimide suppressed the atpase activity in s cerevisiae and r glutinis by and respectively neither agent revealed and additional nakatpase activity the comparison of nakatpase MICs with data on k fluxes across the yeast BPM suggested that even with the lower flux values the nakatpase even if present would account for a mere of transported ions the results imply that the active ion transport in yeasts is energized by mechanisms other than the nakatpase
569,in the last part of this series we have studied the effects of various drugs on pontogeniculooccipital pgo waves induced by the benzoquinolizine derivative ro pgo and by the inhibitor of trypotophan hydroxylase pchlorophenylalanine pgopcpa and continuously recorder and counted in the lateral geniculate bodies lgb of unanaesthetized and immobilizedcats the major aim of this study was to test the specificity of druginduced alterations of the pgo wave activity suggested by the previous investigations hypnoticssedatives of different classes had no significant effects in doses that did not markedly alter the electrical background activity in the lgb a notable exception was gammahydroxybutyric acid which increased the density of pgo and pgopcpa a number of neuroleptics were found inactive sulpiride surprisingly decreased the density of pgo bulbocapnine had a similar effect convulsants in subconvulsive doses did not uniformly affect pgo waves while pentetrazole had no consistent effect strychnine decreased and picrotoxin increased the density of pgo high doses of morphine methadone and meperidine decreased the pgo ethanol was inactive even in high doses caffeine and mefexamide reduced the density of pgo mepiprazol was the most potent depressant of pgo probably by inhibiting the uptake of ht mescaline was a weak depressor of pgo pchloromethamphetamine induced pgo waves in untreated cats less consitently than did pcpa AMA reduced the amplitude of pgo waves due to a CE antinicotinic action the results of this study and of the whole series suggested a tentative scheme of the generation and modulation of pgo waves in which the hypothetical roles and CS of action of four central neurotransmitters are included
570,recent studies indicate that coronary vessels have alpha and betaadrenergic receptors and that the alpha receptors are functionally innervated we studied whether the betavasodilator receptors are functionally innervated using a dog in situ modified langendorff preparation with constant coronary perfusion pressure the beating nonworking heart and systemic circulation were supported with a pump oxygenator stimulation of the left stellate ganglion increased coronary blood flow and decreased coronary sinus oxygen tension from prestimulation control values T3 betareceptor blockade practolol mgkg stellate stimulation decreased coronary blood flow and decreased coronary sinus oxygen tension from prestimulation control values revealing alphareceptor vasoconstriction after the addition of alphareceptor blockade dibozane mgkg stellate stimulation increased coronary blood flow and coronary sinus oxygen tension a small amount from prestimulation values finally T3 the addition of betareceptor blockade propranolol mgkg stellate stimulation increased flow and coronary sinus oxygen tension slightly from prestimulation control values direct intracoronary injections of isoproterenol norepinephrine and EN gave results consistent with the presence of beta myocardial receptors and alpha and beta coronary receptors we conclude that there is little PET innervation of coronary V1 beta receptors intracoronary injections of isoproterenol and epinephrine G1 betareceptor coronary vasodilation after betareceptor blockade but norepinephrine did not
571,the effect of iododeoxyuridine monophosphate idump various halogenatedazido dideoxyuridine derivatives deoxyazauridine azdurd and its halogenated analogs on the ultraviolet sensitization of escherichia coli thymidylate kinase has been investigated only those EDC iodinated in position enhance the rate of ultraviolet inactivation of this enzyme however azido nucleosides with iodo bromo chloro or fluoro substituents in position neither protect nor sensitize thymidylate kinase to ultraviolet inactivation thymidine monophosphate partially protects the enzyme against ultraviolet inactivation either in the presence or absence of ultravioletsensitizing iodinated analogs magnesium ion does not enhance the ultraviolet inactivation of thymidylate kinase by iodinated nucleoside analogs the kinatic data support an AS sitedirected enhancement of the enzyme to ultraviolet inactivation by iododeoxyuridine monophosphate since the concentration of idump required to attain maximal enhancement is mm which is in good PA with its ki of mm when either iidump or cidump was irradiated with the enzyme both radioactivities were associated with the enzyme however only with the c analog was the amount bound at halfsaturation essentially equal to the amount required to inactivate the enzyme by these data support the hypothesis that the active entity in the enhancement by idump of thymidylate kinase inactivation during ultraviolet irradiation is the uridylate free radical which is formed photochemically from idump photochemical studies of azauracil azura deoxyazauridine and iododeoxyazauridine iazdurd were performed photolysis of iazdurd in the presence of a hydrogen donor yields azdurd which upon further photolysis yields the photohydrate the photohydrate of azdurd when incubated in the dark at ph is converted back to azdurd whereas the photohydrate of azura is only partially converted to azura the rate of deiodination of iazdurd is fold greater than that of idump although the ki of idump and iazdurd is similar the increased photosensitivity of the aza analog accounts for the much greater enhancement of ultraviolet inactivation of thymidylate kinase the ability of a compound to enhance the ultraviolet inactivation of deoxythymidylate kinase is correlated with the potential of the compound to produce a free radical rather than a photohydrate when the enzymesubstrate analog complex is irradiated
572,electrical stimulations of the central and basolateral part of the AC and of the septum in freely moving cats elicit changes in arterial pressure ie an increase in pressure during stimulation of the CE part of the amygdala and a decrease followed by an increase during stimulation of the basolateral part of the amygdala and of the septum these changes within the cardiovascular system are followed by rage reactions when the central part of the amygdala is stimulated defense patterns when the basolateral part of the amygdala is stimulated and pitiful mewing as a result of septal stimulation medazepam hydrochloride in a dose of approximately mgkg iv given over a period of h in order to maintain constant blood C2 of the drug att slightly the cardiovascular reactions and elevated markedly the thresholds for psychomotoric behavior the latencies between the onset of electrical stimulation and the beginning of the increase in arterial pressure were only slightly increased whereas the latencies for spychomotoric behavior were markedly prolonged due to drug application the data support the view that medazepam hydrochloride exerts depressant effects on the limbichypothalamic level with respect to psychomotoric responses the effect was not identical for all nuclei tested the basolateral part of the amygdala was significantly less sensitive to medazepam hydrochloride than the CE part of the amygdala
573,a postoperative use of the caloriconitrogenous mixture trivÃ© was carried out in patients after digestive surgery the prescribed dose of this lipidic emulsion was for an average period of four days a T0 of the results led to establish the following factsa p cent increase in the nitrogen PR in comparison with a control series of ten patients and from j o the day of the MI to j f the day when the treatment was stopped besides the duration of the treatment did not seem to modify this balance at least within the limits of the period of use on the other hand the quantity of eb was a determining factor since ml were necessary to obtain a positive NB ga very small rise in the aminoacid serous rate it appeared in patients and supplied by eb other aminoacids increased their proportion spontaneously aspgluctaua reduction of the rate of aminoacids one of which however arginine was being supplied by the drip the variations were never statistically significant but for the phenylalanine rate increasea nonsystematic R2 in the blood proteids that decreased as far as total proteids and Al were concerned and that increased as far as globulins alpha and alpha were concernedfinally no variations in the serous graphic record of lipid C2 were noted neither in the average of figures nor in the analyses carried out T3 each bottle besides it must be added that the tolerance of the product was excellent both on a general level very few cases of intolerance and on the level of the plasma turbidimetry which did not reveal and CMs except in one case therefore trivÃ© proved to be an interesting nutrient combinatin quite suited to a parenteral FF because of its high caloric SP the necessity of a caloriesgnitrogen ratio from to corresponding to ml of eb was once more evidenced therefore such a dose for lack of a protein assimilation allows for a nitrogen retention important enough to prevent an excessive consumption of the body proteinic reserves such doses are perfectly tolerated both on the general and metabolic levels mainly on the lipometabolic one
574,the effect of incubating the hypothalamus of AD male rats with various neurotransmitters upon the release of corticotrophinreleasing hormone crh was studied the crh activity in the incubation medium was assayed in h median eminencelesioned rats and the corticosteroidogenesis of excised adrenals in vitro was used as the endpoint hydroxytryptamine pgmlngml caused a dosedependent release of crh which was antagonized by methysergide ngml the response to hydroxytryptamine was also inhibited by hexamethonium and atropine which indicated that it was acting through a ACh interneurone melatonin ng did not alter the basal release of crh but inhibited the action of both hydroxytryptamine ng and acetylcholine pg thus it appears that both hydroxytryptamine and melatonin play a role in the control of crh release noradrenaline blocked the release of crh induced by both acetylcholine and hydroxytryptamine and presumably this inhibition was caused by direct action on the crh neurone gammaaminobutyric acid gaba also inhibited the PR of crh and may also be involved in the regulation of crh secretion the inhibitory neurotransmitters noradrenaline gaba and melatonin act via independent receptor mechanisms a MM based on the above data is presented
575,the results from six separate evaluations of flurazepam mg in the sleep laboratory were combined to determine the effectiveness of the drug in inducing and maintaining sleep and its effects on sleep stages in a large sample of insomniac subjects the combined studies provide a model from which a detailed profile of the effects of a hypnotic drug over short intermediate and LT conditions can be thoroughly evaluated although sleep was significantly improved on the first night of flurazepam administration peak effectiveness of the drug did not result until the second and third consecutive drug nights flurazepam continued to be effective in inducing and maintaining sleep with intermediateand longterm drug use with only a slight loss of effectiveness with longterm use sleep was also significantly improved on the first and second nights of drug withdrawal carryover effectiveness of active metabolites of flurazepam from one drug night to the next drug night and to withdrawl nights is discussed the clinical implications are discussed with regard to the time of peak effectiveness of the drug dosage recommendations and schedule minimizing possible effects of the drug on daytime performance and the rationale and method for using drug holidays in the treatment regimen with this comprehensive profile of the drugs actions the physician is able to more rationally and effectively utilize the drug in treating the insomniac patient with shortterm administration flurazepam produced a slight decrease in rapid eye movement rem sleep and an increase in rem RL these effects were much more pronounced with intermediateterm drug administration again possibly due to the accumulation of active metabolites T3 withdrawal there was no rebound in rem sleep stages and sleep decreased progressively through short and intermediate drug administration with initial withdrawal there was a slight recovery in both sleep stages
576,previous studies have shown that when pneumococci are incubated in normal nonimmune SS they activate the alternative pathway and opsonically active cb is fixed to the surface of the organism other studies have demonstrated that cdependent opsonization via the alternative pathway plays a significant role in the nonimmune hosts defense against the pneumococcus the present studies concern the role of the capsular polysaccharide in initiating the activation of the alternative pathway by the pneumococcus some PCP types but not all are able to activate the AP soluble purified capsular polysaccharide types and activate the AP whereas types and do not since the capsular polysaccharides exist in their native form attached to the pneumococcal surface selected CPSs were also tested for their ability to activate the alternative pathway when attached to a particulate carrier sheep erythrocytes capsular polysaccharide types and failed to activate the alternative pathway when attached to sheep erythrocytes paralleling the results obtained when these capsular polysaccharides were in solution in contrast the type capsular polysaccharide not only G1 the alternative pathway when attached to sheep erythrocytes as it had when in solution but it also initiated alternative pathwaymediated lysis of the erythrocytes the capsular polysaccharide is not required for the activation of the alternative pathway by the pneumococcus although all types of encapsulated pneumococci are able to activate the AP not all the purified capsular polysaccharide types are able to do so in addition a nonencapsulated pneumococcus derived originally from a type organism activates the alternative pathway as well as a fully encapsulated type pneumococcus
577,the experiments were carried out on conscious pregnant jersey cows with intravascular catheters implanted during late gestation in umbilical and uterine vessels all but three of fifteen animals delivered live healthy calves rountine daily analyses were made of blood gas tensions ph and packed cell volume in foetal and maternal BP concentrations of glucose fructose lactate and urea were also determined measurements of plasma free fatty acids and blood acetate concentrations were made less frequently foetal heart rate and arterial blood pressure were recorded in animals with an UA catheter the concentration differences between foetal and maternal blood or plasma in glucose urea and acetate were measured in fifteen animals the maternaltofoetal gl and acetate gradients across the placenta were high while the foetaltomaternal plasma urea differences were small in those animals with patent arterial and A-V catheters uterine and umbilical blood flows were measured together with the arteriovenous differences in gl acetate and lactate so that rates of foetal and uterine consumption could be estimated the rates of utilization of o glucose and acetate by the foetus were lower than the values for the whole uterus while the uteroplacental metabolism of these substrates was very high significant amounts of lactate which appeared to be produced by the uteroplacental tissue were utilized by the foetus the remainder passed into the uterine venous blood the total substrateo quotient for the foetus calculated from the utilization of known metabolites appeared to be greater than thus in the calf some carbon accumulation from sources other than amino acids the uptake of which was not measured would seem to occur these results and the metabolic activity of the uterine tissues are discussed in relation to comparable findings in the sheep
578,the effects of luminal salicylate mm were measured on rates of ion transport by isolated antral mucosa at neutral luminal ph salicylate increases na and decreases cl permeability salicylate does not alter net na transport but decreases net cl secretion at luminal ph the effects of salicylate can be arbitrarily divided into two phases the intitial phase is associated with an increase in na and marked decrease in cl permeability subsequently a greater increase in PNa and a marked increase in cl permeability occurs active na transport persists in the presence of salicylate at ph indirect evidence also suggests that cl secretion persists under these conditions buy at a reduced rate the rate of luminal acid acid loss also increases in the presence of salicylate a fold increase in salicylate concentration or decrease in luminal ph from to did not appear to intensify the effects observed for mm salicylate at ph the increase in cation and decrease in anion permeability observed at ph and initially at ph are compatible with an influence of a negative charge of the salicylate anion the subsequent changes observed in the presence of acid also are compatible with the concept that as the mucosa becomes overwhelmed with acid a nonspecific increase in permeability occurs however the effect of salicylate on active cl transport is largely independent of acid diffusing into the mucosa
579,the activation process of pepsinogen was analyzed by a combination of computer simulation and experiment in order to investigate in detail the SMB of the basic schemes proposed in the previous T0 further computer simulations were conducted some experiments were performed based on the information obtained the changes in the uv difference spectrum in the early stage was measured by the stoppedflow technique and the conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin ec was followed by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel PACE furthermore on the basis of the exp results the most reasonable scheme was selected and modified as a result a scheme for the activation process of pepsinogen was obtained scheme on the basis of the above analyses it was assumed that the first step and the third step are phdependent based on the NC in the uv spectrum that the second step is a nonlinear reaction containing a looped reaction with a dimeric intermediate in this step peptide fragments are released and pepsinogen is converted to a pepsinlike molecule and that the third step is an equilibrium reaction involving proton IB
580,subcutaneous or IA injections of mg of hgcl g body weight markedly depressed hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity of chicks at h postinjection the depression occurred despite the fact that the chicks continued to eat up until the time they were killed under these same conditions the hepatic activity of acetylcoa carboxylase ec was not affected by hgcl while the activity of the mitochondrial system of fatty acid elongation was stimulated when mercaptoethanol was included in the incubation medium for a HP preparation of fatty acid synthetase mum hgcl was required to show definite inhibition of the enzyme when mercaptoethanol was omitted mum hgcl was inhibitory and mum hgcl abolished CEA mm dithiothreitol completely protected the purified FAS preparation from inhibition by mum hgcl when dithiothreitol was added after the addition of enzyme to the mercurycontaining medium protection of the enzyme was not CR dialysis of cytosol fractions from chicks injected with hgcl against vol of m potassium phosphate buffer ph containing mm edta and mm dithiothreitol for h at degrees stimulated the fatty acid synthetase activity of the fractions dialysis of cytosol fractions from noninjected chicks under the same conditions was without effect on FAS activity these data support the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of hgcl administered in vivo on hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity in chicks is mediated through the interaction of mercury with the sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme
581,countercurrent CSD in an aqueous dextranpolyethylene glycol twophase system has been used to fractionate membrane fragments obtained by press treatment of class ii chloroplasts by the countercurrent CSD technique membrane particles are separated according to their surface properties such as charge and hydrophobicity the fractions obtained were analysed with respect to photochemical MICs chlorophyll and p contents the photosystem ii enrichment after countercurrent distribution was better than that obtained by differential centrifugation of the disrupted chloroplasts however the best separation of photosystem i and ii enriched particles could be achieved if differential centrifugation was combined with the countercurrent distribution technique each centrifugal fraction could be further separated into photosystems i and ii enriched fractions since the photosystem ii particles preferred the dextranrich bottom phase while the photosystem i particles preferred the PE glycolrich top phase by this procedure it was possible without the use of detergents to obtain LDV which were more EC in photosystem ii as compared to IN grana stacks the partition behaviour of undisrupted class ii chloroplasts and the photosystem i centrifugal fraction was the same this similarity indicated that the membrane which is exposed to the surrounding polymers by the class ii chloroplasts is the photosystem i rich membrane of the stroma lamellae
582,one hundred and fortyseven patients with acute suppurative otitis media were divided into three groups and treated with antibiotics azidocillin ampicillin and cephalexin the therapeutic effect was assessed bacterioloically by swabbing from the aural discharge and from the NP on the first second third and seventh day after initiation of treatment in addition the concentration of antibiotic in the aural discharge and in the nasopharynx was determined as compared with other published materials there was a common occurrence of haemophilus influenzae and s aureus hemolytic streptococci are less common than prior to the advent of antibiotics pneumococci disappeared in all cases from the aural discharge in the course of the first three days the effect upon haemophilus was slower in the nasopharynx the effect was questionable and no effect was obtained upon other bacteria the clinical course could not be correlated to the bacterial findings except that resistant bacteria were found in all cases with persisting discharge
583,both high ph at degrees c and humidity at degrees c prevent dpl films from attaining zero surface tension whereas humidity at degrees c and high ph at degrees c do not at degrees c dpl lowered surface tension to zero when spread from organic solvent or when absorbed from aqueous m nacl in the surface balance in which the surface film was exposed to the room air dry film upon saturation of the atmosphere with water vapor in equilibrium with the aqueous phase at degrees c in a closed chamber dpl lost the ability to produce zero surface tension and the gamma min of the dpl film increased from zero to dynecm addition of dpl in CF to distilled water before dispersion by sonication did not prevent the effect of the humidity however when the chloroform solution of dpl was added to m nacl before sonication the adsorbed film produced immediately a SD gamma min of zero in a saturated atmosphere degrees c in the absence of chloroform with dpl adsorbed from either distilled water or m nacl the effect of humidity was reversed either by removing the chamber and returning the wet film to RA or by introducing small quantities of dispersing agents such as cholesteryl palmitate however whereas the effect of humidifying the air was reversible indefinitely the effect of cholesteryl palmitate zero surface tension wet or dry film was irreversible this means that there are substances or conditions that can assist dpl films in maintaining zero surface tension when such films are exposed to humiditysaturated air at degrees c
584,in gallamineimmobilized cats the caudate nucleus and the nucleus accumbens septi were perfused by means of a pushpull cannula and dopamine was measured in the perfusate chlorpromazine mg kg and clozapine mg kg po intravenously enhanced the release of dopamine the effect of chlorpromazine was similar in both regions whereas that of clozapine was more pronounced in the nucleus accumbens than in the caudate nucleus furthermore in the rat sulpiride CLZ and thioridazine increased the homovanillic acid concentration in striatum and limbic system to a similar extent however following probenecid administration the net effect of these drugs on homovanillic acid accumulation was more marked in the limbic system than in the striatum whereas haolperidol and chlorpromazine had a similar effect in the two regions it is concluded that in contrast to haloperidol and chlorpromazine sulpiride CLZ and thioridazine may preferentially affect the limbic dopaminergic transmission this possibly accounts for the fact that sulpiride clozapine and thioridazine display an antipsychotic action and yet cause less extrapyramidal side effects than haloperidol and chlorpromazine
585,rapid hemodialysis of uremic animals may induce a syndrome characterized by increased CSF fluid csf pressure grand mal seizures and electroencephalographic CA there is a fall in ph and bicarbonate concentration in csf and brain osmolality exceeds that of plasma resulting in a net movement of water into the BB this syndrome has been called exp dialysis disequilibrium syndrome the fall in ph of csf may be secondary to a fall of intracellular ph phi in brain since changes in phi can alter intracellular osmolality in other tissues it was decided to investigate BB phi in uremia and the effects of hemodialysis brain phi was measured by evaluating the distribution of clabeled dimethadione in BB relative to csf while extracellular space was calculated as the space relative to csf in animals with acute renal failure brain CBF SC phi was se while that in csf was both values not different from normal after rapid hemodialysis min of uremic animals plasma creatinine fell from to mgdl BB phi was and csf ph and both values significantly lower than in uremic animals p less than and there was a increase in brain water content after slow hemodialysis min brain phi and ph in csf were both significantly greater than values observed after rapid hemodialysis p less than and brain water content was normal none of the above maneuvers had any effect on phi of skeletal muscle or subcortical white matter the data show that rapid hemodialysis of uremic dogs is accompanied by a significant fall in ph of csf and phi in cerebral cortex accompanying the fall in brain phi is cerebral edema
586,the degradation of biological activity of virusinduced murine interferon was determined in linear nonisothermal and multiple isothermal tests the stabilizing effect of ph during heating on interferon in solution was greatest at low ph such that ph greater than ph greater than ph greater than or equal to ph freezedried preparations of interferon were also more heatstable at acid ph than at neutral ph heat stability was a function of the hion concentration rather than the ionic composition of the buffer interferon solutions containing monovalent cations with different ionic radii had similar heat stability a NC in the h ion concentration was a critical event during the cooling of heated interferon a shift in the direction of acidity contributed to stability whereas a shift towards alkalinity led to inactivation the rate of cooling of heated interferon significantly influenced its residual activity rapid cooling and sudden freezing decreased the residual activities of interferons at ph and more than normal cooling an effect not observed at ph interferon heated to degree c could not be reactivated at degree c or degree c interferon of higher apparent molecular weight was more HS than that with lower apparent molecular weight it is postulated that the physicochemical alterations in the AQ environment significantly affecting the stability of interferon operate by producing changes in the size andor conformation of interferon molecules a model is proposed that relates thermal inactivation to different possible molecular states of interferon
587,cl minusnuclear magnetic resonance nmr studies indicate that various digests of human hemoglobin with carboxypeptidase a and b or a combination of the two may be used for the ID of chloride IB sites all the digestion products contain like hemoglobin itself at least two classes of binding sites one of high the others of low affinity the ph dependence of the excess linewidth of the cl minus nmr signal indicates that in the simple digests with either CP a or b chloride is bound with high affinity at or near hisbetaaspbeta and at or near valalphaargalpha the highaffinity CS show in the case of the simple digests a strong oxygen linkage which is lost in the forms digested with both carboxypeptidase a and b this linkage may thus be correlated to the presence of conformational changes organic phosphates like inositol hexaphosphate show competition for some of the highaffinity chloride IB sites in hemoglobin and in the simple digests this competition is likewise lost in the doubly digested hemoglobins
588,the cyanobacteria produce multilarginylpoly aspartic acid a high molecular weight mr branched polypeptide consisting of a polyaspartic acid core with larginyl residues peptide bonded to each free carboxyl group of the polyaspartic acid an enzyme which will elongate argpolyasp has been isolated and purified fold from the filamentous cyanobacterium anabaena cylindrica the enzyme incorporates arginine and aspartic acid into argpolyasp in a reaction which requires atp kcl mgcl and a sulfhydryl reagent the enzymatic incorporation of Arg is dependent upon the presence of laspartic acid but not visa versa a finding which suggests the order of amino acid addition to the branched polypeptideaspartic acid is added to the core followed by the attachment of an arginine branch the elongation of argpolyasp invitro is insensitive to the addition of protein synthesis inhibitors and to the addition of nucleases these findings support the notion previosly suggested from invivo studies that argpolyasp is synthesized via a nonribosomal route and also demonstrate that aminoacetylated transferrnas play no part in at least one step of the biosynthetic mechanism
589,the hypotensive actions of dlpropranolol and a new betablocking agent dltertbutylamino dimethylphenoxypropanol hydrochloride d were studied in conscious normotensive and renal hypertensive dogs using a crossover design the effects were compared with that of PL lactose mghead po administered in a blind fashion a marked reduction in systolic blood pressure from to mean se mm hg was observed at hr after administration of mgkg po of d in renal hypertensive dogs but not in normotensive ones in both normotensive and renal hypertensive dogs and mgkg po of d caused a marked increase in HR rate intravenous infusion of poh d a main metabolite of d in dogs at a rate of mgkg per min for min into renal hypertensive dogs caused a significant longlasting fall in blood pressure and a sustained increase in heart rate whereas that of d mgkg per min for min failed to do so propranolol andor mgkg po produced no significant changes in blood pressure and heart rate in both preparations these results indicate that d causes a fall in blood pressure in conscious renal hypertensive dogs mainly by a metabolite of d poh d
590,the effects of the histamine hreceptor inhibitor metiamide on histaminestimulated canine bile flow and gastric hydrogen ion output were evaluated histamine was found to stimulate bile volume in doses comparable to those that stimulated gastric hydrogen ion output both responses appeared to have the same maximal response dose mugkg per h metiamide alone did not alter hepatic bile flow administration of metiamide mgkg per h along with various doses of histamine demonstrated that the hreceptor antagonist decreased bile volume and gastric hydrogen ion output from values obtained with histamine administration alone the d of histamine for bile flow was mugkg per h and the d for hydrogen ion SO was mugkg per h kinetic analysis suggests that the decrease in histaminestimulated hydrogen ion SO produced by metiamide is the result of competitive inhibition the decrease in histaminestimulated bile volume by metiamide which is different from the hydrogen ion inhibition suggests noncompetitive inhibition these data indicate that the mechanism of histamine choleresis is different from the mechanism of histaminestimulated gastric acid SO and that histaminestimulated bile flow may not be the result of direct hormonereceptor interaction
591,the kinetics of the phinduced dissociation of the x mol wt hemoglobin from lumbricus terrestris the earthworm have been studied in a lightscattering stoppedflow apparatus the ligand dependent dissociation data were fit well by a simple sequential model the data for co and oxyhemoglobin are consistent with hb leads to hb leads to hb methemoglobin at ph appears to be hexameric and the dissociation is consistent with the model hb leads to hb in a sequential decay scheme for which lightscattering changes are monitored the relative amounts of rapid and slow phase are determined by the rate constants as well as the molecular weights of intermediate species assignment of the hexameric intermediate is supported by an investigation of the sensitivity of the theoretical kinetic curves to the molecular weights of the intermediates this assignment is further supported by the following the same model will fit the data for oxy and cohemoglobin at all three temperatures a fold variation in rate constants evidence from electron microscopy shows hexameric forms and methemoglobin is apparently SD as a hexamer at ph when co replaces o as the ligand the dissociation rate increases by a factor of four the met is about times faster than the initial oxyhemoglobin dissociation rate but perhaps more relevant for comparing dissociation of the hexamer the met rate was respectively times and times faster than that for the assumed hexameric forms of co and oxyhemoglobin the E(a) for the dodecamer to hexamer dissociation and for the dissociation of the hexamer to smaller forms were about kcalmol for oxy co and methemoglobin
592,although a sulfatereducing pathway in escherichia coli involving free sulfite and sulfide has been suggested it is shown that as in chlorella a pathway involving bound intermediates is also present e coli extracts contained a ST that transferred the sulfonyl group from a nucleosidephosphosulfate to an acceptor to form an organic thiosulfate this enzyme was specific for adenosine phosphate phosphosulfate did not utilize adenine phosphosulfate and transferred to a carrier molecule that was identical with thioredoxin in molecular weight and CAA composition in the absence of thioredoxin only very low levels of the transfer of the sulfo group to thiols was observed as in chlorella thiosulfonate reductase activity that reduced glutathionesso to bound sulfide could be detected in e coli this enzyme used reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and mg but did not require the addition of ferredoxin or ferredoxin nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reductase although in chlorella the thiosulfonate reductase appears to be a different enzyme from the sulfite reductase the e coli thiosulfonate reductase and sulfite reductase may be MICs of the same enzyme
593,an AC factor with phospholipase a activity has been isolated from vipera berus venom phospholipase activity was studied on PLT phospholipid and on brain cephalin the venom factor showed a potent AC activity mug impaired the clotting of ml of citrated recalcified plateletpoor plasma the anticoagulant inhibited clotting by antagonism to phospholipid the antagonism constant kan m demonstrated the high affinity of the inhibitor for phospholipid as with other phospholipases a the venom factor was thermoresistant but very sensitive to photooxidation both activities anticoagulant activity and phospholipase activity were not markedly dissociated by either denaturation or neutralization processes slightly different curves of photooxidative inactivation of both MICs suggested the presence on the molecule of two very close sites responsible for phospholipase and AC MICs the inhibitor effect on coagulation was independent of the hydrolysis process in fact lysoderivatives and fatty acids resulting from CR hydrolysis with the venom factor were as AS as the native phospholipids moreover phospholipase a from other viperidae venom which did not have anticoagulant activity produced similarly active lysoderivatives this showed that the cleavage of the betaacyl bond does not interfere with the activity of phospholipid a possible mechanism of clotting inhibition by the venom factor was proposed owing to its high affinity for phospholipid the inhibitor would complex phospholipid at its protein binding site impairing the normal arrangement of coagulation protein factors and consequently their activation the positive charges of the inhibitor pi could bind with phosphoryl or carboxyl groups of phospholipid making them unavailable for protein IB the complex formation involves a loss of dissociating capacity of the enzyme towards its substrate this required an additional interaction of the inhibitor with a coagulation protein factor the inhibitor could be removed from the complex by TPS antibodies permitting recovery of normal phospholipidprotein interaction the role of calcium in the complex has not yet been elucidated this venom factor affords a useful tool for investigating the phospholipidclotting protein interaction
594,the relationship of enzymatic activity to organelle development and organelle number during differentiation of the metanephric kidney in the mouse was approached from several experimental directions PSA analyses of marker enzymes for peroxisomes catalase and damino acid oxidase mitochondria cytochrome oxidase and lysosomes acid phosphatase were performed on kidneys at ages from days prenatal to AD these data were correlated with a morphometric analysis of populations of peroxisomes and mitochondria in differentiating cells of the proximal tubule postnatal development of the metanephric kidney was found to be accompanied by a rapid increase in both the specific activity of catalase and the number of peroxisomes per mu in the PT tubule during the first weeks of postnatal growth elaboration of the endoplasmic reticulum er was seen to parallel the increase in number of peroxisomes to which segments of er were often in close apposition extensive interactions between segments of er and peroxisomes were readily visible in mu sections viewed in the HV EM in contrast to peroxisomes neither mitochondria nor lysosomes followed a similar pattern of net organelle increase suggesting that a defined population density of mitochondria and lysosomes may exist in the PT tubule at birth prior to complete development of the kidney
595,the use of hydroxyapatite to absorb antibodybound steroid and thus separate free and antibodybound steroid during radioimmunoassay has been examined using three steroid antisera to testosterone to hydroxyprogesterone and to E(2) for all three antisera studied the separation was shown to be independent of length of time in contact with hydroxyapatite up to h temperature variations from degrees degrees and ph over the range the presence of protein affected the absorption of antibodybound steroid but this effect could be overcome by the addition of increasing amounts of hydroxyapatite further increase in the amount of hydroxyapatite added had no effect on the separation of free and bound steroid sodium phosphate buffers of molarity greater than m eluted antibodybount steroid from hydroxyapatite but trishc buffers up to molarities of m had no effect hydroxyapatite when used as a dry powder had the same effects as suspensions no effect on the crossreactivities of the antisera used could be demonstrated when hydroxyapatite was used and plasma testosterone assays on plasma samples using hydroxyapatite gave essentially the same results as assays on the plasma using a coatedtube assay hydroxyapatite can also be successfully pumped along small bore plastic tubing without settling and can thus be used in automated immunoassay systems
596,anaerobic reduction of the flavoprotein adrenodoxin reductase with nadph yields a spectrum with long wavelength absorbance nm and higher no epr signal is observed this spectrum is produced by titration of oxidized adr with nadph or of dithionitereduced adrenodoxin reductase with nadp both titrations yield a sharp endpoint at nadph added per flavin reduction with other reductants including dithionite excess nadh and catalytic nadp with an nadph generating system yields a typical fully reduced flavin spectrum without long wavelength absorbance the species formed on nadph reduction appears to be a twoelectroncontaining complex with a low KB between reduced adrenodoxin reductase and nadp designated arhnadp titration of dithionitereduced adr with nadph also produces a distinctive spectrum with a sharp endpoint at nadph added per reduced flavin indicating formation of a fourelectroncontaining complex between reduced Ad reductase and nadph titration of Ad reductase with nadh instead of nadph provides a curved titration plot rather than the sharp break seen with nadph and permits calculation of a potential for the ararh couple of v close to that of nadph v Ox adrenodoxin reductase binds nadp much more weakly kdiss x m than does reduced Ad reductase with a single binding site the preferential binding of nadp to reduced enzyme permits prediction of a more positive oxidationreduction potential of the flavoprotein in the presence of nadp a change of about v has been demonstrated by titration with safranine t from this alteration in potential a kdiss of x m for binding of nadp to reduced adrenodoxin reductase is calculated it is concluded that the strong IB of nadp to reduced adr provides the thermodynamic driving force for formation of a fully reduced flavoprotein form under conditions wherein incomplete reduction would otherwise be expected stopped flow studies demonstrate that reduction of adrenodoxin reductase by equimolar nadph to form the arhnadp complex is first order k s when a C1 excess of nadph is used a second apparently first order process is observed k s which is interpreted as replacement of nadph for nadp in the arhnadp complex comparison of these rate constants to catalytic flavin turnover numbers for reduction of various oxidants by nadph suggests an ordered sequential mechanism in which reduction of oxidant is accomplished by the arhnadp complex followed by dissociation of nadp the absolute dependence of nadphcytochrome c reduction on both adr and adrenodoxin is confirmed
597,the effects of a maternal diet b cyclicadenosinemonophosphate cyclic amp and c clofibrate on hepatic lipogenesis in fetal rats were studied the exp diets contained protein carbohydrate adequate vitamins and minerals in addition the fatcontaining diets were supplemented with either CO corn oil or cholesterol OA acid in the clofibrate FF studies wv of the ethyl ester was added to a stock ration or to fatfree diet lipogenesis was measured in liver slices incubated with cpyruvate cacetate or ho in addition activities of lipogenic enzymes were measured in cytosol fractions from liver homogenates the effecs of the experimental diets on liver composition were also examined lipogenic activity was higher in fetal than in maternal liver when corn oil was added to the maternal diet fatty FAS in FL did not decrease as it did in maternal liver maternal fasting decreased fetal fatty acid synthesys by when measured with c and less than when measured with ho although the addition of cholesterol to the maternal diet decreased cholesterol synthesis in maternal CL no such decrease was observed in FL changes in enzyme activities paralleled alterations in lipogenesis in maternal but not in fetal liver CO FF or fasting increased the rate of transfer of linoleate from the dam to the fetus however accumulation of linoleate in fetal liver did not correlate with a decreased rate of fatty FAS as it did in maternal liver maternal hepatic glycogen stores were depleted by fasting but glycogen levels in FL remained high under these conditions
598,the rumen flagellate sphaeromonas communis showed a significant increase in population density to h after the host sheep commenced feeding followed by a reduction in numbers to the prefeeding level T3 a further to h the lifehistory of the organism was shown to consist of a motile flagellate which germinated to produce a vegetative stage comprising a limited rhizoidal system on which up to three reproductive bodies were borne together with in vitro other spherical bodies of unknown function in vivo the reproductive bodies were stimulated to liberate flagellates by a component of the diet of the host the vegetative stage strongly resembled that of certain species of aquatic phycomycete fungi and the flagellates may therefore by zoospores flagellates liberated in vivo lost their motility within to h and developed into the reproductive vegetative phase producing a rapid decrease in numbers of flagellates conditions of maximum flagellate production ph degrees c presence of co absnece of oxygen approximated to those found in the rumen the organism was cultured in vitro in an undefined medium in the absnece of bacteria and other flagellates
599,a study was implemented to quantitate the hydrolase and transgalactosylase activities of betagalactosidase e coli with lactose as the ATP and to investigate various factors which affect these activities at low lactose concentrations the rate of galactose production was equal to the rate of glucose production the rate of galactose production relative to gl however dropped dramatically at lactose concentrations higher than m and production of trisaccharides and tetrasaccharides began galactoseglucose ratios of about and respectively were found for these two types of OS at least five different trissacharides were formed and their patterns of formation showed that they probably utilized both lactose and allolactose as galactosyl acceptors allolactose was produced in amounts proportional to gl at all lactose concentrations ratios of allolactoseglucose were about analyses of various data including a reaction analyzed at very early times showed that the L1 means of production of allolactose and the only means initially was the direct enzymatic transfer of galactose from the position to the position of the glucose moiety of lactose without prior release of glucose from the enzyme it was shown however that allolactose could also be formed in significant quantities by the transfer of Gal to the position of free gl and also by hydrolysis of preformed trisaccharide a mechanism which fits the initial velocity data was proposed in which the steps involving the formation of an enzymegallactoseglucose complex the formation and breakage of allolactose on the enzyme and the release of gl all seem to be of roughly equal magnitude and rate determining various factors affected the amounts of transgalactosylase and hydrolase MICs occurring at high ph values greater than the transgalactosylasehydrolyase activity ratio increased dramatically while it decreased at low ph values less than at mid ph values the ratio was essentially constant the absence of mg caused a large decrease in the transgalactosylasehydrolase activity ratio while the absence of all but traces of na or k had no effect the anomeric configuration of lactose altered the transgalactosylasehydrolase activity ratios alphalactose resulted in a decrease of allolactose production transgalactosylase activity relative to hydrolase MICs glucose production while betalactose had the opposite effect
600,five male subjects with essential hypertension received chlorthalidone at each of four DLs and mgday for eight week periods each preceded by an eight week placebo period dosage order was randomized and doubleblind during the last week of each AS and PL period an upright bicycle exercise study was carried out at three loads kpmmin for min each oxygen consumption at the maximal workload was of predicted at a heart rate of during placebo therapy increasing workloads were associated with a progressive increase in blood pressure heart rate and pressurerate index systolic pressure times heart rate with increasing doses of chlorthalidone up to mgday there was a progressive reduction in blood pressure and pressurerate index at mgday there were paradoxical increases in diastolic pressures heart rates and pressurerate indices above values observed at mgday with increasing doses of chlorthalidone there was a progressive increase in arterial blood co content and ph increasing workloads were associated with increased arterial blood lactate and decreased arterial blood lactate and decreased pHa the changes in lactate and ph were not different at the different dose levels the best antihypertensive effect in these exercising subjects was observed at a daily dose of mg of chlorthalidone the exercise response was useful in the determination of potentially adverse hemodynamic consequences of the larger dose of chlorthalidone
601,a study has been made on the changes in the enzymatic activity of ribonucleasearnasea exposed to highly acidic ph less than acqueous environment irreversible alterations of activity were observed when the protein was exposed to an acidic medium for a long period to h even prior to these changes in activity rnasea was found to form intermediates which had very nearly the same activity as the native protein the primary process in the acid denaturation of rnasea was observed to be deamidation of the protein leading to the formation of active chromotographically distinct derivatives the initial product of deamidation a monodeamidated derivative has been isolated by chromatography on amberlite xe this initial deamidation reaction proceeded with very high specificity the subsequent deamidation reaction is comparatively slower so that nearly of the native protein could be converted to this derivative before any subsequent deamidation took place this monodeamidated derivative has been designated rnaseaa the conversion of rnasea to rnaseaa was not accompanied by any changes in the primary structure other than the observed deamidation apart from the differences in chromatographic and electrophoretic mobilities rnaseaa was found to have very nearly the same activity and physicochemical properties as the native enzyme significance of this TPS and faster deamidation of rnasea in this denaturing medium as well as the biological significance of such deamidation reactions of proteins are discussed
602,to find out whether alkalitreated proteins posses nephrotoxic properties feeding studies were conducted with drastically treated soybean protein and casein and also with LAL lal the amino acid known to be formed in protein subjected to high ph at elevated temperature the feeding of synthesized lal to rats at dietary levels of ppm and above induced typical renal changes called nephrocytomegalia no such changes or any other indications of toxicity were observed however upon feeding much higher levels of lal up to ppm when provided as the proteinbound compound in alkalitreated casein or soybean protein when set free by complete acid hydrolysis lal induced considerable renal activity comparable to that of the synthetic compound these results indicate that alkali treatment of proteins does not induce nephrotoxic properties provided that the compound remains proteinbound some nephrotoxic activity was observed however with peptideboound lal in breakdown products molecular weight less than of alkalitreated casein but considerably less than that of the free compound lalanalyses in blood urine and feces of rats fed free or proteinbound lal indicated a positive correlation between intestinal absorption and nephrotoxic potential no renal changes were encountered upon FF diets with ppm synthetic lal to mice hamsters rabbits quail dogs or monkeys which suggest a species specificity of lalinduced renal changes in rats
603,the gammaglutamyltransferase ec gammaglutamyltranspeptidase gammagtp activity in hepatoma induced by methyldimethylaminoazobenzene medab was fold higher than that of NL and high activity was also found in bovine HCC carcinoma gammagtps from these malignant tissues responded more and showed broader specificity to gammaglutamyl group acceptors than those from normal tissue such as bovine rat and mouse liver and bovine kidney three species of gammagtp were isolated from bovine kidney by deaecellulose chromatography whereas only two species were isolated from bovine hepatocellular carcinoma the carcinoma lacked the least acidic enzyme species appropriate gammaglutamyl group acceptors stimulated moreacidic enzyme species more than lessacidic species in both tissues the fractions separated from the hepatoma were stimulated more than those of kidney by gammaglutamyl group acceptor the enzymes from normal tissues responded similarly to a gammaglutamyl group acceptor irrespective of the difference in their activity thus gammagtps of malignant tissues appear to be more versatile for amino acid transport both qualitatively and quantitatively in these properties the enzyme of mouse fetal CL which showed the highest activity in the last period of pregnancy resembled the enzymes of malignant rather than normal tissues the activity of hepatic gammagtp is not parallel with the rate of cell proliferation during normal development
604,the role of the adrenal cortex in the pathogenesis of hypertriglyceridaemia associated with the intake of oral contraceptive agents containing oestrogen has been investigated in rats BL ADX reduced the activity of hepatic enzymes regulating lipogenesis acetyl coa carboxylase FAS and decreased plasma triglyceride concentrations on the other hand the administration of high dosage corticosterone induced the activity of hepatic enzymes with consequent elevation in serum triglyceride C2 in animals with intact adrenals the administration of oestradiol a raised plasma triglyceride levels b enhanced the activity of hepatic enzymes and c increased the adrenal cortexbody weight ratio the effects a and b were not observed when both adrenals were removed prior to oestrogen therapy high dosage corticosterone replacement was found to be essential for the oestradiol to produce its effects on hepatic enzymes and TG levels the results suggest a regulatory role for the adrenal SC in the homeostasis of plasma TG and that the hypertriglyceridaemia induced by the oestrogen containing preparations might be secondary to alterations in adrenocortical function
605,the effects of penbutolol hoe d a new nonselective betareceptor blocking agent were studied in patients with moderate hypertension initially it was shown that mg given orally once or twice daily tended to lower blood pressure and PP rate both at rest and following submaximal work in prolonged trials months mgday were required to produce an acceptable antihypertensive effect penbutolol had no effect on the normal increase in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline on standing nor did it alter basal urinary catecholamine excretion submaximal work caused no significant change in CA before treatment but there was a marked rise both in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline during treatment with penbutolol in short term studies there was a fall in plasma renin by hours after oral administration of penbutolol mg which persisted for hours prolonged treatment with penbutolol mg twice daily inhibited renin production under basal conditions and following submaximal work as well as lowered basal urinary aldosterone excretion in one patient slight asthmatic symptoms appeared after treatment for months with penbutolol in other respects penbutolol was well tolerated
606,immune complexes formed between a homogeneous rabbit antibody to type iii pneumococcal polysaccharide and a series of OS of varying size derived from it were prepared and tested for their ability to fix guinea pig hemolytic complement antibody and either tetra hexa or octasaccharide formed only monomeric antibodyhapten complexes and did not show any complement IB a dodecasaccharide and a sugar residues oligomer formed dimer and trimer immune complexes these complexes were also unable to fix complement however as the size of the sugar oligomers was increased to about sugar residues per oligosaccharide molecule or more the resulting complexes exhibited substantial complement IB concomitant with the formation of antigenantibody aggregates higher than trimers on the other hand an independent study carried out with the same material suggested changes in the conformation of the fc moiety in the antibody molecule upon addition of oligosaccharide ligands as small as a residue unit since the resulting complexes hardly ehibited any complement binding ligandinduced conformational changes in the fc part of the antibody molecule appears to be an insufficient condition per se for triggering complement fixation
607,the selective use of different neuroleptics in the treatment of schizophrenia by some psychiatrist according to the greater need for a sedative antidelusional or activating effect is supported only by some uncontrolled clinical observations most extensive controlled studies done until now showed no significant differences among neuroloptics in their therapeutic efficacy the hypothesis that these drugs have specific and selective actions therfore cannot be accepted in the single patient it seems more rational to choose the right dosage schedule instead of the RA drug though the T0 of the metabolism of these drugs remains the most interesting approach to the problem of the individualization of the therapy the results of these studies have until now been disappointing eg plasma levels of chlorpromazine correlated weakly with clinical improvement in clinical practice an important element in the process of choosing is still the incidence of side effects and in fact at the moment the drug of choice can only be the drug best tolerated by the patient
608,chlorophyll ide formation from protochlorophyll ide that is normally inactive was demonstrated in etioplast CM isolated from maize and barlley plants the process being dependent on intermittent illumination and the addition of nadph the addition of nadph to the membranes was shown to result in the conversion of inactive protochlorophyll ide absorbing at about nm into a forms with lightabsorption maxima at about and nm both of which disappear when chlorophyll ide is formed on illumination the temperaturedependence of the activation process and its response to a variety of reagents were examined from these the conclusion is drawn that sh groups are involved in the activation but in the AS complex these are unavailable for reaction with sh reagents evidence is presented for the occurrence of glucose phosphate dehydrogenase activity within etioplasts and the suggestion is made that the oxidative PP pathway can provide the nadph required for chlorophyll biosynthesis during the early stages of greening
609,the MICs of citrate synthase nadlinked and nadplinked isocitrate dehydrogenase were measured in muscles from a C1 number of animals in order to provide some indication of the importance of the CAC in these muscles according to the differences in enzyme activities the muscles can be divided into three classes first in a number of both vertebrate and invertebrate muscles the activities of all three enzymes are very low it is suggested that either the muscles use energy at a very low rate or they rely largely on anaerobic glycolysis for higher rates of energy formation second most insect flight muscles contain high activities of citrate synthase and nadlinked isocitrate dehydrogenase but the MICs of the nadplinked enzyme are very low the high activities indicate the dependence of insect flight on energy generated via the CAC the flight muscles of the beetles investigated contain high MICs of both isocitrate dehydrogenases third other muscles of both vertebrates and invertebrates contain high activities of citrate synthase and nadpliniked isocitrate dehydrogenase many if not all of these muscles are capable of sustained periods of mechanical activity eg heart muscle pectoral muscles of some birds consequently to support this activity fuel must be supplied continually to the muscle via the circulatory system which in most animals also transports oxygen so that SE can be generated by CR oxidation of the fuel it is suggested that the low MICs of nadlinked isocitrate dehydrogenase in these muscles may be involved in oxidation of isocitrate in the cycle when the muscles are at rest a comparison of the maximal activities of the enzymes with the maximal flux through the cycle suggests that in insect flight muscle nadlinked isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyses a nonequilibrium reaction and citrate synthease catalyses a nearequilibrium reaction in other muscles the enzymeactivity data suggest that both citrate synthase and the isocitrate dehydrogenase reactions are nearequilibrium
610,nicotine perfused through the coronary circulation of the isolated atropinized cat HR elicits antidromic activity in the cardiac sympathetic nerves the pattern of discharge varies in a complex fashion with dose at low concentrations activity may last up to min whereas at high doses the antidromic response may last only a few seconds sympathetic transmitter is released into the perfusion fluid there is dissociation between the amount of transmitter that overflows from the heart and the total antidromic activity with increasing dose of nicotine with smaller doses of NIC the magnitude of the antidromic activity probably indicates the level of depolarization of the nerve terminal i.t. of greater doses of nicotine causes still greater transmitter release but not the generation of antidromic impulses due presumably to persistent depolarization below a critical level during the NIC infusion and immediately afterwards the antidromic response to acetylcholine and the effector responses associated with the adrenergic transmitter PR by acetylcholine and sympathetic nerve stimulation were blocked the rates of recovery of these responses were similar with a halftime of to min although the antidromic response to kcl was blocked during the nicotine infusion it recovered more rapidly within min the antidromic response to kcl tended to exceed control C2 it is proposed that nicotine causes a prolonged depolarization of the membrane of the adrenergic nerve terminal the site of action of nicotine the basis of its prolonged action and the interrelationship of this depolarization with transmitter release and intracellular uptake are discussed
611,the first committed step of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in salmonella typhimurium was shown to be catalyzed by three isoenzymes of deoxydarabinoheptulosonic acid phosphate dahp synthase mutations in each of the genes specifying the isoenzymes were isolated and mapped arog the structural gene for the phenylalanineinhibitable isoenzyme was linked to gal and aroh the structural gene for the tryptophaninhibitable isoenzyme was linked to aroe arof the structural gene for the tyrosineinhibitable isoenzyme was linked to phea and tyra which specify the phenylalanine and tyrosinespecific branchpoint enzymes respectively the phenylalanineinhibitable isoenzyme was the predominant dahp synthase in wildtype cells and only the tryosineinhibitable isoenzyme was completely repressed as well as inhibited by low C2 of its allosteric effector the dahp synthase isoenzymes were separated by chromatography on diethylaminoethylcellulose with a phosphate gradient which contained enolpyruvate phosphate to protect the otherwise unstable phenylalanineinhibitable isoenzyme no crossinhibition of either the tyrosine or phenylalanineinhibitable isoenzyme was observed at inhibitor concentrations up to mm the tryptophaninhibitable isoenzyme was partially purified from extracts of a CS lacking the other two isoenzymes and shown to be inhibited about by mm tryptophan a preliminary study of interference by tryptophan in the periodatethiobarbiturate assay for dahp suggested a combined effect of tryptophan and erythrose phosphate or an aldehydic compound resulting from Kd of erythrose phosphate by periodate
612,the kinetics of the ndemethylation of benzphetamine EM meperidine and methadone have been studied in microsomes isolated from livers of the fetal stumptailed macaque macaca arctoides during the last third of gestation the apparent km for each substrate did not change during this time period values were similar to those from livers of adult african green monkeys the vmax for each substrate when expressed per mg of microsomal protein did not change during the last third of gestation ndemethylase activity vmax per g of liver increased during the last third of gestation as did the content of microsomal protein cytochrome p concentration and liver weight the amount of cytochrome p per g of CL was greater in whole homogenates of the left physiological lobe than in those of the right physiological lobe of fetal liver obtained near term no differences occurred in whole homogenates of the separate lobes of adult CL this observation suggests that a differential capacity for drug and possibly steroid metabolism may exist between the two physiological lobes of fetal CL
613,although cerebral angiography should be approached with caution in the diagnosis of inflammatory cerebrovascular disease there are some characteristic angiographic findings which may be helpful for classification and differential diagnosis the PT cerebral arteries are favourably affected by basal meningitis and thrombangiitis obliterans with resulting stenoses and occlusions whereas those inflammations originating from neighbouring skull structures mostly involve the intracavernous parts of the carotid i.a. the tuberculous and mycotic arteritis prefer the supraclinoid carotid siphon peripheral vascular changes are found in luetic endangiitis necrotizing and toxic angiitis and in collagenoses simultaneous involvement of the temporal arteries is of great diagnostic importance demonstrating the SVR character of the inflammatory process in hortons arteritis it can be a pathognomonic finding infectious endocarditis some mycoses and malaria may lead to embolic occlusion of CBF vessels mycotic aneurysms mostly have a broad base or a fusiform shape and do not prefer the localizations of congenital aneurysms angiographically abscesses tuberculomas and viral encephalitis may result in circumscribed hypervascularized areas the characteristic angiographic findings are exemplified and discussed on the basis of cases of inflammatory cerebrovascular disease tuberculosis pneumococcal and unspecific bacterial meningitis syphilis mycosis takayasusyndrome panarteritis nodosa temporal arteritis
614,when hrifampicin is incubated with rat liver microsomes or rat liver homogenate minor amounts are bound irreversibly to protein this effect does not depend on the presence of nad nadh nadp or nadph rifampicin is autoxidized at physiological ph the product of autoxidation rifampicinquinone if incubated with Al shows a much greater irreversible binding to the protein than the parent compound rifampicin hence it is concluded that rifampicin may bind irreversibly to proteins in a nonenzymic reaction after autoxidation to rifampicinquinone rifampicinquinone also binds irreversibly to rna and polyllysine if incubated with these compounds this suggests that free amino CG of protein or rna are involved in the binding h after dosage of hrifampicin mgkg to rats sd pmol are bound irreversibly to mg CL rna pmol to mg CL protein and pmol to mg protein in BB tissue microsomal nadphcytochromcinquinone to rifampicin the km of this reaction is m induction of the nadphcytochrome c reductase by pretreatment of rats with mgkg rifampicin over days results in a corresponding increase of increase of rifampicinquinone reduction these results suggest that microsomal nadphcytochrome c reductase prevents accumulation of higher amounts of possibly toxic rifampicinquinone by reduction to rifampicin
615,two highly purified cellulases ec iia and iib were obtained from the cellulase system of trichoderma viride both cellulases split cellopentaose retaining the betaconfiguration of the anomeric carbon atoms in the hydrolysis products at both ph and the km values of cellulases iia and iib for cellotetraose were different but their vmax values were similar and those for cellooligosaccharides increased in parallel with chain length both cellulases produced predominantly cellobiose and glucose from various cellulosic substrates as well as from higher cellooligosaccharides cellulase iia preferentially attacked the holoside linkage of rhonitrophenyl betadcellobioside whereas cellulase iib attacked mainly the aglycone linkage of this cellobioside both cellulases were found to catalyze the synthesis of cellotriose from rhonitrophenyl betadcellobioside by transfer of a glucosyl residue possibly to TC produced in the reaction mixture they were also found to catalyze the rapid synthesis of cellotetraose from cellobiose with accompanying formation of cellotriose and glucose which seemed to be produced by secondary random hydrolysis of the cellotetraose produced the capacity to synthesize cellotetraose from TC appeared to be greater with cellulase iib than with cellulase iia
616,lipoprotein lipase activity has been found in the milks from severals species where it is assumed to result from leakage from the mammary gland into milk the function of the enzyme in the gland is apparently to assist in the transfer of blood lipoprotein triacylglycerol fatty acids into milk triacylglycerols bovine skim milk is one of the richest sources of lipoprotein lipase and this enzyme has been purified extensively fold by AC the lipase has a molecular weight of about is inhibited by PS m sodium chloride apolipoprotein ci apolipoproteinserine and apolipoprotein ciii apolipoproteinalanine the enzyme is activated by apolipoprotein cii apolipoproteinglutamic acid serum and by heparin to which it also binds the lipase is highly specific for the primary esters of acylglycerols and exhibits a slight stereospecificity for the sn ester in preference to the snester bovine milk also has separate activity toward monoacylglycerols human milk contains a SS stimulated lipoprotein lipase with many of the characteristics of the enzyme in bovine milk as well as an enzyme stimulated by bile salts which resembles the sterol ester hydrolase of rat PJ the assay CF purification characteristics and substrate specificities of these enzyme are discussed
617,among the amino acids which can be solubilized to give a concentration of mm at near physiological ph histidine and proline caused a CR hemolysis of P0 calf but not of AD cow CRC within to minutes at degrees c while hydroxyproline valine and serine resulted in a partial lysis of calf cells threonine glutamine and glycine were ineffective in this communication emphasis has been focused on the mode of the lytic process by histidine which was found to be affected by several governing parameters including the ph temperature and the extracellular salts in the solution unlike human red cells suspended in isotonic histidine both calf and cow cells lost little na and k ions in the presence of mm histidine both calf and cow cells displayed an instantaneous uptake of histidine amounting to to mumolesml rbc followed by a slow influx rate of to mumolesml rbc x min the extent to which histidine entry was allowed by the cell was counterbalanced by cl efflux resulting in little NC in cell volume prior to hemolysis moreover histidineinduced hemolysis can be prevented by mm or lower pcmbs without a discernible effect on histidine influx suggesting a possible membrane lesion or damage at the outer surface of the cell hemolysis induced by histidine decreased substantially when a calf reached two months of age at which time the red cells containing the fetal hemoglobin are virtually depleted the results of hemoglobin electrophoresis obtained during this postnatal period revealed that those cells resistant to histidine hemolysis almost invariably contain the adult type hemoglobin suggesting a selective specific action of the amino acids on the fetal cells
618,the action of snake venom phospholipases a in IN human erythrocytes was investigated in detail the basis phospholipase from agkistrodon halys blomhifii was found to induce both hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and total cell hemolysis under certain experimental conditions the hydrolytic action of the basic enzyme was found to consist of two sequential events a hydrolysis of of the total cell ph osphatidylcholine without any evident hemolysis and b complete hydrolysis of the remaining phosphatidylcholine followed closely by extensive phosphatidylethanolamine hydrolysis and finally with onset of hemolysis attack on the phosphatidylserine at ph and mm ca only stage a occurred however a slight elevation of the ph of incubation to ph andor inclusion of mm ca in the reaction mixture caused both events a and b to occur the addition of gl limited the action of the enzyme to stage a under any reaction conditions an investigation showed that enzymically induced hemolysis occurred under conditions where the intracellular atp levels were lowered data are presented which suggest that stage b is mediated by in influx of ca into the cell when the levels of atp are low interestingly the phosphllipase from naja naja venom pakistan yielded results similar to those observed with the basic enzyme from agkistrodon venom however the enzyme from crotalus adamanteus and the acidic enzyme also present in the agkistrodon venom produced only slight hydrolysis or hemolysis under any of the conditions studied other species of erythrocytes eg guinea pig monkey pig and rat were tested but only those from guinea pig behaved similarly to the human cells pig monkey and rat erythrocytes underwent very limited hydrolysis and hemolysis it is evident that the use of these phospholipases to probe the localization of phospholipds in ghosts must be approached with caution certain facets of this problem are discussed
619,erythroid regeneration was studied in lethally irradiated mice given transplants containing equivalent numbers of haemopoietic stem cells ie cfu from fetal CL neonatal marrow or AD marrow AD marrow was taken from normal control mice whose cfu for the most part were not in AS cell cycle as well as from phenylhydrazinetreated groups whose cfu were in similar state of proliferation ie approximately in dna synthesis as those derived from fetal liver and neonatal marrow splenic and femoral radioiron fe incorporation were measured at intervals after transplantation and were found to begin earliest in mice given fetal liver then in animals given neonatal marrow and latest in recipients of AD marrow IP reticulocytes showed a similar DP of recovery the data reported herein suggest that the differences in erythroid regeneration evoked by transplants of fetal liver neonatal marrow or AD marrow are not solely attributed to the degree of proliferation in the pluripotential SC compartment these data may however suggest a shorter Td for cells comprising the fetal and newborn committed erythroid compartments
620,electrical and mechanical activity were recorded from totally isolated whole porcine stomachs perfused with HB stagnant complete ischemia was then produced by closing the gastric artery and vein for various periods of time up to h T3 a given period of ischemia blood was recirculated for min and then pentagastrin was injected into the gastric artery the vagus nerve was also electrically stimulated at various stages of anoxia and recirculation after up to min of ischemia stomachs were able to demonstrate electrical control activity of low frequency after min of blood recirculation T3 i.t. of PG electrical control activity rapidly became normal when ischemia lasted min or longer recirculation of blood did not induce reappearance of ECA but pentagastrin i.t. produced a normal response after ischemia of min duration or longer recirculation and pentagastrin had no effect in previously ICM stomachs the response to VS occurred only in the stomachs responding to pentagastrin
621,"theory is presented relating to the binding of an effector to two states of a protein acceptor coexisting in equilibrium the problem is treated in terms of the four possible cases which specify relations between numbers of binding CS and intrinsic binding constants relevant to the acceptor states it is shown that a distinction between these cases may be possible on the basis of the form of a plot of unbound effector concentration versus the constituent equilibrium coefficient which may be calculated from the sedimentation coefficient of the protein constituent particularly noteworthy in this respect is the finding that a turning point may exist in this plot for defined conditions with systems in which IB CS are not conserved and binding affinities are altered on polymer formation the latter type of system is exemplified by studies on methaemoglobin a in m sodium acetate ph in the absence of added organic phosphate effectors a dimertetramer equilibrium operates governed by an association constant of x mol determined from sedimentation equilibrium results correlation of sedimentation velocity and equilibrium results shows that addition of adenosine triphosphate atp results in its binding to one site on each of the dimeric alpha beta and tetrameric alpha beta species with intrinsic binding constants and mol respectively it is also shown that 2,3-DPG perturbs the dimertetramer equilibrium in a similar way to atp"
622,human arylsulfatase a cerebrosidesulfate sulfohydrolase ec exhibited microheterogeneity on isoelectric focusing in PAGE pure urinary enzyme gave bands of activity with pi values of and whereas purified liver enzyme yielded six equally spaced bands from pi to detection of enzyme in the gel was made by either methylumbelliferyl sulfate or nitrocatechol sulfate crude enzyme preparations from human liver kindey placenta BB and testis showed the sixbanded DP with varying amounts of activity in the different bands the banding pattern of cultured human fibroblast extracts was distinctive in addition to activity in the area of bands a sharp band at pi was observed with both enzyme stains this latter band was also present in MLD FB extracts however in this case the band did not appear when the TPS arylsulfatase a stain was used enzyme bands and from urine were isolated by extraction of the gel the three bands refocused in their initial positions showed nearly identical enzymatic activities toward methylumbelliferyl sulfate mitrocatechol sulfate CBS and ascorbic acid sulfate and demonstrated equivalent immunological competence by antibody titration the banding DP of urinary arylsulfatase a was unchanged with neuraminidase treatment whereas bands of the liver enzyme were converted to bands by this treatment it appears that bands are due to sialylation of arylsulfatase a but that bands are probably due to some other type of postribosomal protein modification
623,physostigmine in mm concentration at ph produces reversible contractures of up to po tension output in frogs whole toe muscle or in fiber bundles of these muscles at ph the mm physostigmine contracture output is only about po the mm ph contractures are essentially unaffected by lack of external ca complete depolarization of the fibers detubulation by glycerol treatment and degrees c AT these results and other evidence indicate that physostigmine produces contracture by directly releasing activator ca from the sarcoplasmic reticulum sr pretreatment of muscles with mm procaine reduces physostigmines capacity to produce contracture evidently by means of a competitive inhibition at sr sites the above results indicate similarities between physostagmine and caffeine contractures but the physostigmine action differs in that it is reversible and especially it lacks the ability strongly characteristic of caffeine to sensitize a muscle to produce a RCC the internal action of physostigmine requires that it be permeant and since it is a weak base pka this property is provided by its uncharged base but once internal where the ph most of the drug will be protonated and it may act on the sr in this form in contrast with caffeine which since its pka is about acts on the sr as uncharged base
624,in the reactions used to break heparin down to mono and oligosaccharides androsugars are formed at two stages the first of these is the wellknown cleavage of heparin with nitrous acid to convert the nsulfated dglucosamines to anhydrodmannose residues this reaction has been studied in detail it is demonstrated here that only low ph less than reaction conditions favor the deamination of nsulfated dglucosamine residues the reaction proceeds very slowly at ph or above on the other hand nunsubstituted amino sugars are deaminated at a maximum rate at ph with markedly reduced rates at ph or ph at RT solutions of nitrous acid lose onefourth to onethird of their capacity to deaminate amino sugars in h at all phs a low ph nitrous acid reagent which will convert heparin quantitatively to its deamination products in min at RT is described and a comparison of the effectiveness of this reagent with other commonly used nitrous acid reagents is presented it is also shown that conditions used for acid hydrolysis of heparin convert approximately onefourth of the liduronosyluronic acid sulfate residues to a anhydrouronic acid this product is an artifact of the reaction conditions and its formation represents one of several pathways followed in the acidcatalyzed cleavage of the glycosidic bond of the sulfated lidosyluronic acid residues
625,oxyhemoglobin dissociation curves odc from zero to full saturation were developed from tests performed on whole blood from various groups of diabetic and nondiabetic healthy subjects p at invivo ph was slightly but significantly lower than normal in ambulatory nonacidotic uncomplicated juvenile diabetics vs mm hg p less than despite increased red cell diphosphoglycerate dpg concentrations in diabetic erythrocytes vs mumolegm hb p less than this combination of changes is in keeping with the presence of increased proportions of hemoglobin aic in insulintreated diabetics the position of the odc was positively correlated with the dpg concentration p less than which varied in response to fluctuations in plasma concentration of inorganic phosphate pi p less than optimal metabolic control may lead to a normalization of the odc in association with increased concentrations of red cell dpg and p when the diabetes was uncontrolled the odc was usually unchanged during the acidotic phase because the lowered ph balanced the effect of diminished dpg concentration on the odc T3 correction of acidosis the disproportion between erythrocyte dpg and ph became quite prominent accompanied by a corresponding fall in p vs mm hg p less than following ketoacidosis with a persistently lowered pi it may take up to one week for dpg to return to an approximately normal level and the p will be impaired for the same period a diphosphonate ehdp known to enhance tubular phosphate reabsorption in man was given to nonacidotic insulintreated diabetic and healthy volunteers for days it caused a significant increase in mean pi and p in both healthy and diabetic subjects r p less than when a dietary supplement of dibasic calcium phosphate was given to diabetic subjects for days a significant increase in p also occurred vs mm hg p less than it is recommended that the diabetes diet be supplemented by dibasic calcium phosphate to prevent the GABA effect of a low concentration of pi on red cell oxygen delivery
626,spraguedawley rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital artificial ventilation was given by a starling pump respirator via a tracheal tube intracellular ph of cardiac muscle was determined by means of the indirect procedure of measuring the distribution of dimethyloxazolidinedione dmo in intra and extracellular spaces dmomethod rats were injected ip with mval potassiummagnesiumaspartate g body weight and rats served as controls using a SRA the following relationships were obtained animals injected with potassiummagnesiumaspartate pha log paco phi log paco phi pha control animals pha log paco phi log paco phi pha at a pco of torr a pha of and a phi of was obtained at an pHa of the phi was the results of the control group are written in brackets the experiments demonstrate an increase in the intracellular buffer bases C2 of potassiummagnesiumaspartate this effect can be recognized by a concomitant increase in the intracellular ph of compared to the control group
627,the influence of the red cell concentration of diphosphoglycerate dpg mumolesg erythrocytes on the cobohr effect ph varied by co at constant base excess and the fixed acidbohr effect ph varied by fixed acid or base at constant pco was studied in human blood at plasma ph values ranging between ph and ph elevation of red cell dpg concentration leads to a numerical decrease of the cobohr coefficient referring to plasma ph the fixed acidbohr coefficients are numerically smaller than the corresponding cobohr coefficients and exhibit a maximum at normal red cell dpg concentrations the bohr coefficients referring to red cell ph are distinctly higher than those referring to plasma ph especially at high dpg levels this is due on the one hand to the physicochemical properties of the IN red cell membrane and on the other hand to a dpginduced decrease in the ratio deltaphcelldeltaphplasma from the results it is concluded that dpg exerts a dual effect on the bohr coefficients of whole blood which is mediated by the direct effect of dpg on the allosteric properties of hemoglobin as reflected by changes of the bohr coefficients referring to red cell ph and by the effect of dpg on deltaphcelldeltaphplasma
628,a screening procedure is presented which allows the isolation of yeast mutants typ tir with highly efficient utilization of exogenous deoxythymidinemonophosphate dtmp greater than data are given concerning the phenomenon of dtmp utilization in GA i the ability of s cerevisiae to incorporate exogenous dtmp was found to already to be a wild type feature of this yeast ie apparently not to be due to any mutation such as typ tup tmp per or tum consequently these mutations are interpreted as amplifiers of a pregiven wild type potency so far eight stages of dtmp utilization were detected as classified by the optimal dtmp requirement with dtmp biosynthesis blocked of the corresponding mutant strains isolated all of them fit well into a mathematical series of the type n x n where the product term for n represents the dtmp requirement mugml of the best dtmp utilizing wild type strain found ii amplification of the dtmp utilizing potency obviously is due to any genetically determined alteration of the yeast dtmp uptaking principle itself or of physiological processes accompanying the monophosphates uptake iii the functioning of dtmp uptake requires acidic less than or equal to ph conditions in the yeast cells outer environment iv some yeast typ and typ tlr mutants were found to exhibit a more or less pronounced sensitivity towards exogenously offered dtmp the response of a sensitive CS towards inhibitory concentrations of the nucleotide apparently is coconditioned by the presence or absence of thymidylate biosynthesis with dtmp biosynthesis blocked the dtmp mediated inhibition is a permanent one and finally leads to the death of a cell with a functioning thymidylate biosynthesis in contrast the inhibition is only temporary v yeast typ or typ tlr strains were observed to dephosphorylate exogenous dtmp to thymidine due to a phosphatase activity which cannot be eliminated at ph mm inorganic phosphate conditions in the GM this dtmp cleavage obviously occurs outside the cell and does not seem to be correlated both to the monophosphates uptake and to the phenomenon of dtmp sensitivity the destruction of dtmp does not disturb dtmp dnaspecific labelling
629,the protontransfer reactions of yeast pyruvate kinase ec were studied protontransfer from c of phosphoenolpyruvate to water occurs only in the presence of the phosphorylacceptor adp proton transfer from c of Pyr to water occurs only in the ADP however the proton transfer in the latter case occurs times faster than phosphoryl transfer this supports a mechanism in which PT precedes phosphoryl transfer in the reverse reaction of Pyr kinase the characteristics of protontransfer reactions of yeast pyruvate kinase were compared with those previously reported for rb muscle pyruvate kinase robinson jl and rose ia j biol chem the phprofiles and the divalent cation dependencies were similar for frupactivated yeast Pyr kinase and the muscle enzyme pyruvate enolization by yeast pyruvate kinase has an absolute requirement for atp in contrast to enolization by the muscle enzyme which proceeds when atp is replaced by pi or other dianions fructosebisphosphate was shown to affect the catelytic steps of yeast pyruvate kinase in addition to the binding of substrates its role depends on the divalent cation used to activate the enzyme
630,the localizations of acid phosphatase acpase and thiamine pyrophosphatase tppase activities were studied in the placental labyrinth of the cat during the last days of gestation acpase activities were observed essentially in the syncytiotrophoblast and in the interstitial inert substance sii that separates maternal from foetal tissues reaction product was localized in lysosomes multivesicular HB and in the network of smoothmembraned tubules which open on the cell surface of the syncytiotrophoblast facing the sii the sii exhibit a strong activity probably of syncytiotrophoblastic origin tppase activities were found in the ST rarely in the GA but always in the lumen of the network of smoothmembrande tubules the sii shows a moderate activity these tppase positive tubules being frequently observed very close to the golgi cisternae it is proposed that they arise from the GC and convey phosphatases to the sii after phosphotungstic acid IF at low ph luminal surface coat of maternal endothelium is always strongly and continuously visualized while the BPM of the syncytiotrophoblast facing the sii is never stained staining is intense in the lumen of tubules and continuous with the stain of the sii acpase activity of the sii could be implicated in enzymatic Kd of maternal molecules during their transfer from maternal to foetal blood the sii may correspond to the immunological buffer zone at the interface between maternal and foetal tissues
631,changes in the fine structure of the GM following exposure to graded concentrations of ethanol were studied in dogs ml of and volvol were instilled i.g. for min mucosa from the midbody and midantrum along the greater curvature was examined by CS and electron microscopy ethanol produced a gradation of changes in the surface epithelial cells and in the lamina propria without affecting the parietal cells and chief cells ethanol produced widened and irregular ICS while and disrupted the apical CM with concomitant exudation of mucin into the gastric lumen these changes were more severe after ethanol the tight junction between cells remained IN following SE to the lower concentrations of ethanol but focal separation of cell junctions was observed in severely damaged areas quantitation of protein sodium and potassium concentrations in the gastric contents revealed marked increases following SE to ethanol which correlated with the concentration these studies provide additional morphological data on the relationship between structural changes and functional CA induced by agents which break the gastric mucosal barrier
632,the genetic trait of responsiveness which refers to the capacity for induction of cytochrome p and numerous monooxygenase activities by certain aromatic hydrocarbons is known to segregate almost exclusively as a single AD gene among progeny of AGA crosses originating from the responsive cbl and the nonresponsive dba inbred mouse strains in this report the allele for responsiveness is shown to be associated with a increases in the apparent ks values for metyrapone bound to reduced p b increases in the ethylisocyanide difference ratio deltaadeltaac increases in the deltaa per mg of microsomal protein but not in the deltaa per mg of protein from the reduced pethylisocyanide complex d an approximately nm hypsochromic shift in the spectral maximum in the nm region for the reduced pmetyrapone complex e an approximately nm hypsochromic shift of the absorption maximum in the nm region but not of the maximum in the nm region for the reduced pethylisocyanide complex and f larger increases in the deltaa than in the deltaa per mg of microsomal protein for the reduced pethylisocyanide complex as a function of increasing ph all of these phenomena are felt to be associated with the genetically regulated induction of liver microsomal cytochrome p by polycyclic aromatic compounds whereas increases in the total hepatic p content appear to be expressed almost exclusively as a single autosomal dominant trait the increase in apparent ks value for metyrapone bound to reduced p appears to be expressed additively the reason for this finding is unclear the increase in apparent ks value for MET in methylcholanthrenetreated rats is known to occur even when the induction process is presumably blocked by treating the rat concomitantly with cycloheximide several lines of evidence in this report indicate that although total p content does not increase in cbln mice treated with methylcholanthrene plus cycloheximide hepatic p induction does occur p induction does not occur in dban mice under these same conditions these results indicate that cytochrome p induction is relatively resistant to the inhibition of protein synthesis and that a responsive animal treated with methylcholanthrene plus cycloheximide cannot be considered experimentally the same as a genetically nonresponsive animal treated with methylcholanthrene alone
633,oxygen and co dissociation of duck blood was studied in blood samples equilibrated with known gas mixtures at the birds body temperature degrees c and analyzed in the van slyke manometric apparatus and in ph electrodes at various ph values between and the hill plots yielded straight and parallel lines over a wide range of o saturation the hill coefficient being half saturation pressure p at ph was torr the bohr effect factor was buffering properties were analyzed by equilibrating blood samples with gas mixtures of different pco at degrees c the buffer value for whole blood in the range of co was mmollph the buffer value for true plasma mmollph the co dissociation curve constructed using the buffer values had a Mw of mmolltorr in the pco range from to torr the co content of oxygenated blood at pco torr was mmoll the haldane effect factor at pco torr equalled mmol of combined co per mmol hbo with the values of po pco and ph measured in arterial blood of undisturbed and unrestrained resting ducks effective dissociation curves for both o and co were constructed assuming a metabolic rq of these curves are expected to resemble closely the actual in vitro dissociation curves of resting ducks
634,selective recruitment of antigensensitive cells asc into the spleen as a method of inducing specific suppression was attempted by i.v. of either da or Le spleen cells hr before a da x lewisf renal allograft into a lewis or da recipient either with or without a splenectomy this led to suppression of rejection in the da recipient and delayed rejection in the Le recipient splenectomy produced a minimal augmentation effect assay of graftversushost gvh reactions in da x lewisf rats by a popliteal node assay showed that injection of allogeneic da or Le SP cells hr before the CA significantly reduced the reaction produced by node lymphocytes but not spleen lymphocytes suggesting a loss of asc from the lymph nodes lewis SP allografts did not produce such a significant reduction in the gvh reactivity of da node lymphocytes as intravenous Le cells whereas da spleen allografts led to an increased gvh reactivity of Le node lymphocytes from these studies it is not possible to attribute the suppression produced by the intravenous i.t. of allogeneic cells to selective recruitment of antigensensitive cells to the spleen
635,an analysis of cryptorchids by history or examination with a TC treated at memorial hospital between and is presented twentyfive patients had the cryptorchid state repaired at ages four to years either spontaneously or by orchiopexy or HT ipsilateral or contralateral one intrascrotal testis tumors developed four to years later twenty cryptorchid patients presented with ipsilateral inguinal eleven abdominal seven or contralateral intrascrotal two tumors there were pure seminomas embryonal carcinomas nine teratocarcinomas and one reticulum cell sarcoma five year survival rates as estimated by the productlimit method were for the unrepaired cases and for the repaired cases the survival seems to follow histologic type and anatomical stage whether the testis is within the scrotum or not five year survival similarly estimated was in the seminomas and in the other PT twelve of thirteen survivors including nine with seminoma received postoperative irradiation to the regional lymphatics and eleven were without recurrent RT for periods ranging from six to years
636,in the longterm ovariectomized rat the secretion of lh has a pulsatile character in such rats no difference was observed between morning and afternoon lh secretion the administration of phenoxybenzamine an chiadrenergic blocker resulted in depressed plasma lh levels chimethyltyrosine chimt an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase had no effect on plasma lh levels whereas bismethylhomopiperazinilthiocarbonil disulphide fla an inhibitor of dopaminicbetahydroxylase induced decreased plasma lh levels and disappearance of the pulsations the same effect was observed after the administration of AP a dopaminic receptor stimulating drug whereas the administration of hydroxyaminopyrrolidone ha which blocks dopamine release significantly raised plasma lh levels scopolamine a cholinergic muscarinic receptor blocking drug had no effect on plasma lh C2 whereas mecamylamine a cholinergic nicotine receptor blocking agent decreased them these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the pulsatile release of lh in the longterm ovariectomized rat is caused by the stimulating activity of adrenergic and cholinergic probably nicotinic systems and the inhibitory activity of a DA system
637,it is difficult to sum up the justifications for pulmonary transplantation in man as out of cases carried out up to now only the patient derom has survived months in fact analysis shows that all of the other cases cannot be taken into consideration as there were technical problems or the receivers were nearly in the threws of death and this was the case of the patient salvator two important problems remain to be resolved first of all that of obtaining grafts in good condition in fact the sole source of donors remains irreversible comas and it is known that after hours of artificial respiration the lung has undergone irreparable damage it is therefore necessary to develop a reliable method for preservation present experimental results show that lungs preserved for hours and regrafted into other animals are not only functional in the immediate but the scintigraphic scanning graphs after a month are comparable with those in control animals studies of coagulation have demonstrated that pulmonary rejection is characterised before infiltration by MNC cells by L1 coagulation disorders in the treated animals AAR crises are preceded a few days earlier by hypercoagulability and a fall in circulating platelets these findings have enabled one by the addition of appropriate AC treatment to overcome the rejection crises without any other therapy than the basic classical treatment immuran corticosteroids under these conditions the few specialised centres are therefore authorised to again attempt human pulmonary transplantation
638,several formulations of BG agar with an added hs indicator were evaluated results were optimum with variations of a basic formula consisting of g of tryptic soy agar difco g of lactose g of sucrose mg of phenol red g of SA g of ferric ammonium citrate g of STS pentahydrate and mg of brilliant green dye per liter brilliant green dye was added T3 sterilization of the other components this formulation supported good growth of all of strains of salmonella tested normal biochemical types formed pink colonies with black centers and an hsnegative s choleraesuis formed pink colonies without black centers of other bacteria tested only enterobacter klebsiella and a few citrobacter strains showed significant growth in h when lactose was omitted from the formulation a lactosefermenting strain formed pink colonies with black centers and differentiation of salmonella from the enterobacterklebsiella groups was equally good addition of xylose g and llysine hydrochloride g to the above formulation improved differentiation between salmonella and the few citrobacter strains that grew and produced more intense blackening in salmonella colonies addition of an HS indicator to BGA formulations aided in identification of salmonella colonies especially in mixtures with other bacteria these media were judged to give better differentiation of salmonellae from other bacteria than hektoen agar with added novobiocin mgliter
639,the nerve growth factor ngf S1 of s ngf was isolated by chromatography at high ph on qaesephadex it has the same TPS ngf activity as betangf isolated at acid ph showing that this activity is an intrinsic property of the subunit and is independent of the pathway of dissociation continued SE of the ngf subunit to high ph resulted in an increase in the amount of the minor species betangf and the formation of a new species betangf of even lower isoelectric point these two species and the original major species of the preparation beta were isolated by isoelectric focusing all three species had the same TPS ngf activity but differed in their ability to reform s ngf the beta species was onefifth as competent as beta while beta was unable to regenerate s ngf addition of alpha and gammasubunits to betangf decreased the amount of ngf protein required to produce one biological unit of activity in the bioassay but had no effect when added to betangf the interactions between the subunits in s ngf therefore determine in part the TPS activity of the ngf subunit
640,cattle brain SC was homogenised in mol sucrose and centrifuged at x g the supernatant contains the majority of enzymes participating in protein turnover cathepsin ec phosphoprotein phosphatase ec and acid phosphatase ec they were separated by chromatography on sephadex g in neutral buffer the cat was purified up to fold by gel filtration on sephadex and column PACE the ph optimum of cathepsin was at degrees c no decrease of activity was measurable during min the km was found to be mgml casein hammarsten the molecular weight by GF and exclusiongel electrophoresis was about corresponding to the cat from human liver barrett aj biochem j the sedimentation constant sw is comparable with the values of proteinase of different origin and the composition is similar with respect to the high proportion of acidic amino acids the phosphoprotein phosphatase can be further purified by chromatography on hydroxyapatite and by column electrophoresis the ph optimum of phosphoprotein phosphatase was about ph at degrees c no decrease of activity was measurable during min the km was mgml casein isoelectric the ph optimum of acid phosphatase was about at degrees c no decrease of activity was measurable during min the km was mumol for sodium phenolphthalein diphosphate all three enzymes slowly lost their activity during several weeks at degrees c apparently by self digestion in the cold
641,water and creatine contents were studied in rat skeletal muscle mitochondria after their min incubation in creatine solutions ph or the content of water and creatine in mitochondria was found to be higher at ph than at ph the creatine content correlated with the water content structural creatine analogues containing aminogroups with pka greater than or equal to or carboxyl groups inhibited the infusion of creatine into mitochondria more strongly than substances having aminogroups with pka less than the penetrating form is creatine amphiion the effect of ph on the permeability is probably due to the activation of the creatine transmitter rat skeletal muscle mitochondria contain creatine kinase at both sides of the inner membrane this conclusion is based on the fact that under conditions supplying the direct course of the creatine kinase reaction the incubation medium contains ca and creatine ph adp produces the stimulation of mitochondrial QO2 up to the oxygen exhausting in a polarographic unit similarly adp irreversibly stimulates mitochondrial respiration in the presence of mm edta if edta and adp are added T3 the preincubation of mitochondria in creatinecontaining medium and after accumulating small amounts of ca by mitochondria
642,an isolated perfused canine lung preparation in which determinants of vascular caliber could be individually controlled was developed the relation of pulmonary arterial pa A-V pv and alveolar pa pressures was such that pa greater than pa greater than pv throughout the whole lung the addition of isoprenaline to the perfusate abolished vascular reactivity once stability was reached vascular crosssectional area remained acceptably constant for hours as judged by normalized conductance the influence of perfusate hematocrit blood gas tensions and ph on pressureflow relations was then studied in isolated canine lungs the hematocritvascular conductance relation was derived at constant perfusion pressure conductance varied linearly with hematocrit over a range of to mean pulmonary ABG tensions were po mm hg pco mm hg and ph acute respiratory acidosis po mm hg pco mm hg ph and LA and hypoxemia po mm hg pco mm hg ph did not significantly alter this relation transformation of the conductancehematocrit data indicated that hematocrit was the most important determinant of relative apparent viscosity of the blood both acute respiratory and LA failed to significantly increase relative viscosity within the range of hematocrit usually found in secondary polycythemia
643,binding of radioactivity from cthiourea tu to rat lung protein was found to occur in vitro two binding sites are present one possesses low affinityhigh capacity while the other is characterized by high affinitylow capacity in vitro IB of ctu to lung protein can be antagonized by the presence of either unlabeled congeners alphanapthylthiourea or phenylthiourea or thiolcontaining compounds cysteine reduced glutathione conversely depletion of lungreduced glutathione by means of DEM administration results in elevated protein binding prior administration hr of a sublethal dose of tu which renders tolerance to a subsequent lethal dose in vivo results in a decrease in in vitro binding of radioactivity from ctu to lung protein in addition immature rats which are less sensitive to the edematogenic effect of tu bind less radioactivity from ctu to lung protein when the drug is administered in vivo these results suggest a correlation between ctu IB to lung protein and the pathophysiological effect of the drug in the lung
644,this report is an attempt to study the renal handling of chromium under in vitro conditions and to relate this to the actions of the ion in the production of nephrotoxicity renal slice techniques were employed in these studies and were used to examine the effects of chromium on various renal transport processes in addition the accumulation of chromium by the renal tissue has also been studied marked accumulation by renal cortical slices of the rat was observed when crlabeled chromate or dichromate was added to the bathing solution some metabolic inhibitors interfered with this uptake process in addition some substrates metabolized by renal tissue reduced the accumulation of cr the use of cr dichromate and crchromate as well as alterations in the bathing solution ph indicated that in the rat chromium can interfere with renal transport processes but that the oxidation state of this metal is not important on the other hand in the rb a greater interference with cr uptake was noted at lower bathing solution phs this is interpreted to mean that chromate is the effective inhibitor in this species

646,for the second time the authors have found a new entomophagous nematode parasitic in syrphidae the first species which was described as syrphonematidae nov fam is living in the duct of various aphidophagous species of syrphidae this one has been found in the hemocoel of adults of helophilus TVT fabricius and h pendulus linneaus eristalinae with aquatic rat tailed larvae it seems to belong to the genus iotonchium allantonematidae which was known as yet only by the freeliving stages this work could bring the proof that the genus iotonchium is really parasite of insect as it was supposed by t goodey and j b goodey the three distinct forms which are living in the body cavity of the host are briefly described the life cycle which differs from those of all other allantonematidae is discussed this species requires further studies especially on the freeliving stages which have to be obtained for the comparative study of the morphology of the various forms and for life PH
647,bonemarrow transplantation bmt from an unrelated hlaphenotypeidentical mlcnegative donor was performed in a year old woman with severe longlasting AA in vitro assays failed to demonstrate humoral or cellular sensitization of the recipient against donortype antigens following conditioning with cyclophosphamide prompt but only transient engraftment of the transplant occurred accompanied by signs of mild graftversushostdisease gvhd of the CL the results of a second bone marrow transplantation from the same donor cannot be evaluated due to early death of the recipient it is concluded that bone marrow from unrelated hla and mlcidentical donors may engraft without severe gvhd rejection of the VG in our patient may have been related to greater antigenic differences that can be expected to exist between hla and mlcidentical unrelated individuals than between hla and mlcidentical siblings however insufficient preparative IS with cyclophosphamide due to severe hepatic hemosiderosis appears equally likely as the cause of graft AAR the possibly increased risk of graft AAR or severe gvhd should not preclude the use of unrelated hla and mlcidentical marrow donors when histocompatible sibling donors are not available but more potent immunosuppressive regimens than the cyclophosphamide protocol may be necessary to ensure permanent engraftment
648,regional enteritis crohns disease and ulcerative rectocolitis both non specific inflammatory diseases of the bowel might be diseases with a common etiology but with clinical features corresponding to a different tissular response to a noxious factor both diseases are however characterized by distinct clinical radiological histological peculiarities evolution also is different as appears from the rarity of malignant degeneration in CD and its frequence in ulcerative colitis a psychological support seems to be classical in ulcerative colitis but is on the contrary unusual in regional ileitis besides the interference of psychological factors in the outbreak of an ulcerative colitis besides the infectious and genetic theories the immunological theory appears as one of the most interesting and promising in a significant percentage of cases of ulcerative colitis anticolon antibodies are evidenced which exhibit a crossed reaction with bacterial antigens especially with those of escherichia coli besides this humoral immunity a cellular immunity exists also lymphocytes of patients with ulcerative colitis behave as a toxic agent towards colic tissue cultures this cytotoxicity parallels the course of the disease and provides an explanation for the sometimes dramatic therapeutic effects observed C2 of immunosuppressive drugs and antilymphocytic serum moreover colic antigen can block this cytotoxicity the immunologically active portion of this antigen may be isolated and its administration in patients with ulcerative colitis may perhaps induce a TPS IS and influence the evolution of the disease
649,the multiple forms of cathepsin a ai aii and aiii purified from the lysosome fraction of rat liver by sephadex g and deaesephadex chromatographies were studied comparatively forms ai aii and aiii were stable between ph and and had ph optima for cbzgluphe at and respectively these activities were rapidly lost on heating above degrees their isoelectric points were at and and the michaelis constants for cbzgluphe were calculated as and x m respectively activity was inhibited by ag au hg iodine and pchloromercuribenzoate pcmb diisopropyl fluorophosphate dfp phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride pmsf toluenesuffonyl fluoride tsf and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds were inhibitory at a concentration of m soybean trypsin inhibitor pepstatin leupeptins and antipain were not GABA while chymostatin caused slight inhibition no distinct difference was observed in the effects of these compounds on the multiple forms of cathepsin a despite differences in the molecular weights of these forms and respectively in immunodiffusion analysis cat ai aii and aiii which had been treated with edta dithiothreitol pcmb and a high concentration of nacl gave the same precipitin patterns as the untreated enzymes but treatment with m urea caused a slight alteration of the DP after sdstreatment mm or more the precipitin lines of these multiple forms fused and gave a single MZ L1 this suggests that the different forms of the cathepsin a are all composed of subunits which are immunologically identical or closely related and that the subunits are mainly bound by hydrophobic forces this conclusion is supported by results obtained by poliacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sds
650,proximal tubular transport of ldihydroxyphenylalanine LD and its derivatives were studied in the rat kidney by microperfusion and capillary perfusion techniques in situ with the use of microperfusion techniques CT it was found that LD lmethoxyhydroxyphenylalanine Tyr and lphenylalanine rapidly disappeared from the perfusate the rates of reabsorption were calculated to be x x x and x molcmsec respectively in contrast lalphamethyldopa and dopamine were only slightly reabsorbed the permeability coefficients were calculated to be x and x and x cmsec respectively the rate of reabsorption of LD was greatly reduced in the presence of lphenylalanine in the perfusate but was not affected by ddopa with the stopflow microperfusion technique with simultaneous capillary perfusion the zero net flux transtubular concentration difference deltac of labeled dopa was measured when the initial concentration of mm labeled ldopa was perfused the luminal concentration fell to a plateau level of mm after a contact time of seconds ie deltac was mm the net flux was much less than the efflux suggesting the presence of a sec or passive back flux of ldopa the deltac of LD was not influenced by the decarboxylase inhibitor mk and monoamine oxidase inhibitor pheniprazine but was significantly reduced by nacn thus the reabsorption of ldopa in the PCT tubule is an active process with great structural specificity
651,graftversushost reactions of parental cells in f hybrids were studied with two unrelated inbred strains of mice that differed at the mouse histocompatibility locus wanemic f recipients were compared with lethally irradiated normal f recipients both sets of recipients were populated by marrow and SP cell grafts from parental and f donors most wanemic f recipients were cured by parental and f cell grafts except b SP even T3 to months they showed little or no effect from gvh reactions lethally irradiated normal f recipients tolerated parental marrow grafts almost as well but gave dramatically different results with parental spleen grafts seventynine of irradiated f recipients of parental SP grafts died within month unlike lethally irradiated recipients wanemic recipients have substantial numbers of their own cells along with the donor cells in their lymphoid tissues these f lymphocytes may interact with parental lymphocytes in vivo to restrain reactions against f allogeneic antigens
652,the therapeutic effectiveness of corticoids in transplantation in autoimmune conditions and in numerous diseases in which the pathogenic role of hypersensitivity reactions is invoked is perfectly established on the empirical basis of clinical cases the T0 of the effects of corticoids on the immunological response is on the contrary very fragmentary it comes up against numerous difficulties especially against the differences in susceptibility from one species to another the lymphoid cells have cytoplasmic and nuclear receptors for CSs the fixation of corticosteroids on lymphocytes inhibits the synthesis of nucleic acids and raises the intracellular level of cyclic amp corticosteroids decrease the mobility of polymorph leukocytes in the presence of a chemotactic CS- at high doses they disturb phagocytosis by marcophages oppose the degranulation of mast cells and polymorph WBCs and the cytotoxic action of sensitised t lymphocytes in vivo corticosteroids have little effect on the production of antibodies primary of secondary response do not modify the immunological SM by through an antiinflammatory effect abolish the peripheral manifestations of late hypersentsitivity reactions CSs enable the treatment of acute rejection crises in transplantation they have a symptomatic effect on type i and iv gel and cooms hypersensitivity reaction their activity is less regular in the other phenomena of hypersensitivity
653,human erythrocyte ghosts were solubilized in wv sodium dodecyl sulphate at ph i moli at a loading of mg of proteinml of column volume all of membrane proteins were adsorbed to a column of cpad ncarboxypropionylaminodecylsepharose at ph i mol and room temperature degrees c many proteins were subsequently desorbed by raising the ph or by including sodium dodecyl sulphate continuously in the eluting buffer experiments with a series of adsorbents homologous with cpadsepharose in which the length of the hydrocarbon chain was varied provided strong evidence of hydrophobic interactions in addition to ionic interactions in the binding of these proteins to cpadsepharose elution with increasingph gradients at different concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulphate showed that glycophorin the L1 SGP was eluted in the void volume at recoveries close to when the detergent concentration was greater than or equal to wv protein e the L1 protein was desorbed late in the ph gradient even at a high wv concentration of the detergent and was always incompletely desorbed the maximum REC recorded being Sp the MW polypeptide pair did not behave in a welldefined manner and was found widely distributed among the effluent fractions under all the conditions that were tested
654,studies on malaria and on a b balabacensis and a minimus responses to ddt spraying were conducted in a forested hilly area in northern thailand in a first phase baseline data were collected from july to march in a second phase the study area received five round of ddt spraying over a period of two years and at the same time all malaria infections received radical treatment during this twoyear period of field operations entomological and epidemiological observations were continued the studies carried out in the second phase showed that malaria transmission decreased under the applied optimum antimalarial measures but was not interrupted human ecology and population movement inside the forest especially during the dry season contributed to a great extent to this result the transmission occurring in the early part of the monsoon season clearly indicates the importance of the timing of ddt spraying a b balabacensis appeared to be transmitting malaria all the year round in the deep forest but only in the monsoon season in the forest fringe the vectorial capacity of both vectors was estimated separately for indoor and outdoor populations the prespraying values obtained for a b balabacensis were much higher thaan for a minimus T3 ddt spraying a b balabacensis showed a decrease in vectorial capacity estimated at times for the indoor population and times for the outdoor population a minimus on the other hand showed a much smaller decrease estimated at and times for the indoor and outdoor populations respectively
655,the molecular basis of intracellular metabolism of nutrients and its control is quite well understood in animal cells comparable knowledge about solute entry into cells is still lacking as in contrast to metabolism no chemical reactions seem to be directly associated with the known nutrient transport nevertheless translocations of sugars and amino acids across the plasma membrane are specific and controlled processes biologically as well as chemically recent advances in techniques for isolation of plasma CM have made it feasible to study transport properties of animal cells without the complications encoutered in viable cells this RPA has been applied to sugar and amino acid transport in PMs of several tissues and IN transport systems for dglucose dfructose neutral lamino acids and dipeptides have been demonstrated this demonstration of intact transport systems in an in vitro setting accomplishes the first step in the direction of molecular isolation of transport systems furthermore the information obtained about the transport mechanism catalyzed by some systems has settled controversies on AS nutrient transport for example electrogenic cotransport of sodium and dglucose or of sodium and neutral lamino acids has been shown to form the basis for active sodiumdependent absorption of these nutrients a consequence of this type of mechanism is interaction between sugar and amino acid transport via the common charged cosubstrate sodium moreover different types of transport systems for the same ATP have been demonstrated in the luminal and contraluminal regions of the plasma membrane of epithelial cells which explains unidirectional transepithelial transport the luminal membrane contains sodiumdependent active transport systems and the contraluminal membrane passive facilitated DWI systems in vivo the lower intracellular sodium potential would result in concentrative nutrient uptake from the lumen but would not influence exit on the contraluminal side variations in the electrical components of the sodium potential which have not been measured may explain apparently contradicting results on AS sugar and amino acid transport with various tissue preparations
656,coenzyme a coa transferase from peptostreptococcus elsdenii has been purified and crystallized and some of its properties have been established the work was facilitated by a newly developed coupled and continuous spectrophotometric assay in which the disappearance of added acrylate could be followed at nm the ratelimiting conversion of acetyl and betahydroxypropionyl coa to acrylyl coa by coa transferase was followed by the nonratelimiting conversion to betahydroxypropionyl coa by excess crotonase thus a small priming quantity of acetyl coa served to generate acrylyl coa which by hydration generated betahydroxypropionyl coa this product then served to generate more acrylyl coa in cyclic fashion the net result was the coa transferaselimited conversion of acrylate to betahydroxypropionate the purified transferase has a molecular weight of and is composed of two subunits of each as determined by disc gel electrophoresis shortchainlength monocarboxylic acids are substrates whereas dicarboxylic or betaketocarboxylic acids are not the reaction kinetics are typical of a pingpong bi bi mechanism composed of two half reactions linked by a covalent enzyme intermediate incubation of the transferase with acetyl coa in the absence of a fatty acid acceptor yielded a stable intermediate which by absorption spectrophotometry radioactivity measurements reduction with borohydride CR with hydroxylamine and catalytic activity was identified as an enzymecoa compound kinetic constants for coa GOT are final TPS activity umg of protein corresponding to x mumol of acrylate G1 per mumol of transferase km for acrylate x m km for acetyl coa betahydroxypropionyl coa x m
657,the IB of various radioisotopically labeled organic compounds to rat CL and lung was investigated in vitro pieces of rat lung and slices of rat liver were incubated at degrees c under a nitrogen atmosphere in a modified krebsringer phosphate solution ph containing the compound to be studied of the neutral compounds investigated digitoxin digoxin and dexamethasone were highly bound to both liver and lung tissue whereas the degree of binding of amitrole erythritol and ouabain was or less the weak acids which were bound to the greatest extent in both liver and lung were phenobarbital pentobarbital and diphenylhydantoin barbital was poorly bound and there was no evidence for the binding of dimethyloxazolidinedione or paminohippuric acid in either tissue IB of the CG and the barbiturates directly paralleled their lipid solubilities the degree of binding of neutral compounds and Ka to lung and liver tissue did not vary greatly with concentration even though broad concentration ranges were studied this was also true of the weak base morphine on the other hand the binding to CL and lung of the organic bases nicotine pilocarpine damphetamine lidocaine erythromycin and chloroquine did vary with concentration the QA compound C10 was bound only to liver and this binding also varied with concentration two additional quaternary ammonium compounds tetraethylammonium and nmethylnicotinamide were not significantly bound to either tissue comparisons on the basis of equal content of solids revealed that the binding of diverse organic compounds in liver is greater than or equal to that in lung
658,a crude cell extract from a mixed bacterial culture growing on parathion an organophosphate insecticide hydrolyzed parathion c at a rate of nmolmin per mg of protein this rate of enzymatic hydrolysis when compared with chemical hydrolysis by n sodium XTT at c was times faster eight of commonly used organophosphate insecticides were enzymatically hydrolyzed with this enzyme preparation at rates ranging from to nmolmin per mg of protein seven pesticides were hydrolyzed at rates significantly higher to times faster than chemical hydrolysis the ph optimum for enzymatic hydrolysis of the eight pesticides ranged from to with less than of maximal activity expressed at ph maximal CEA occurred at c the crude extract lost its activity at the rate of only day when stored at c eight organic solvents ranging from methanol to hexane at low concentrations stimulated enzymatic hydrolysis by to whereas at higher concentrations mgliter they inhibited the reaction to parathion metabolites PNP hydroquinone and diethylthiophosphoric acid at up to mgliter concentrations did not significantly influence CEA
659,a study has been made of the interrelations between rhythmical exopodite beating in different larval stages and swimmeret beating in poastlarval stages of the lobster homarus gammarus data on exopodite beat cycle durations have been used for statistical comparisons of exopodite performance within one larva and also between different stages of larval OD interexopodite comparisons reveal clear bilateral differences table although there is no consistently favoured relationship tables and there are significant differences in cycle duration between the first three developmental stages with a slight increase at the first moult and a marked decrease at the second table however within each stage the repeat frequency exhibits little NC table therefore it appears that changes in swimming behaviour occur discontinuously in development and are associated with the larval moults it is suggested that changes in beat frequency and especially the faster beating in stage iii may represent responses to changed loading conditions table measurements of swimmeret beating in postlarval lobsters have been analysed in terms of cycle durations and inter and intrasegmental phase relations swimmeret beating patterns are very regular figure but not restricted to a narrow range of frequencies table a intersegmental phase lag remains constant around figure independent of beat frequency figure similarly the powerstrokereturnstroke ratio of approximately figure shows no significant rho with cycle duration figure differences emerge in the performance of larval exopodites and postlarval swimmerets table b although the possibility cannot be excluded that the larval exopodite oscillator in some way influences the developing action of the postlarval swimmeret system
660,quantitative ristocetininduced PLT aggregation of normal plateletrich plasma prp decreased with time after prp preparation an increase in p h of the prp with time proved to be responsible for this finding DWI of cofrom the plasma is the prime determinant of the change in ph since a complex combination of AF influences co diffusion surface areatovolume relationship capping mixing etc the change in ph is variable with time thus quantitative ristocetin aggregation should be ph controlled a simple device for maintaining prp ph constant by control of the ambient pco was designed and found effective in keeping both ph and quantitative ristocetin aggregation constant over a prolonged period of time it can be adapted for use in platelet aggregation studies employing other reagents the ph dependence of ristocetininduced platelet aggregation is consistent with other data supporting an elctrostatic interaction between the platelet von willebrand factor and ristocetin we favor a model wherein ristocetin neutralizes some of the platelets negative change and permits the von willebrand factor to bridge sites on separate platelets to induce agglutination
661,the effect of acute alterations of plasma sodium concentration pna on renal sodium excretion unav was investigated by three types of experiments on anaesthetized dogs a a local increase in pna at one kidney was produced by infusion of hypertonic saline directly into its artery while SVR levels of pna were stabilized by haemodialysis b systemic levels of pna were lowered by exchange transfusion of blood for an equal volume of saltfree dextranindextrose solution the results were contrasted with those observed after similar exchanges but using dextraninsaline solution c the level of pna was altered by varying the sodium concentration of a saline solution infused at a fixed rate either intravenously or into one renal i.a. all three types of experiment suggest a dependence of unav on pna analysis demonstrated that this relationship was not due to contemporary changes in packed cell volume plasma solids concentration plasma potassium concentration blood pressure or plasma pH the distribution of these variables did not NC with pna except for plasma hydrogen ion concentration moreover the relationship persisted when data were selected to exclude clearance periods in which the value for any variable had shifted past the group mean obtained before pna was altered the fall in unav at low C2 of pna could be attributed to a fall in glomerular filtration rate gfr but the progressive rise in unav seen as pna exceeded mmole occurred despite a fall in gfr and no apparent change in the mean filtered load of sodium these results suggest that the increased sodium excretion accompanying raised C2 of pna is due to reduced tubular reabsorption of sodium
662,when the number of pfc present in the spleen was measured at hr intervals after immunizing with an optimally immunogenic dose of type iii pneumococcal polysaccharide sssiii maximal numbers of pfc were attained days after immunization thereafter the number of pfc decreased rapidly by contrast serum antibody levels which were measured in the same mice using a farr test reached peak values days after immunization and then declined much more slowly than did the number of pfc two AF were found to contribute to this disparity first experiments conducted with splenectomized mice showed that extrasplenic antibody synthesis which began between days and T3 immunization and peaked on days to accounted for nearly onethird of the total amount of SS antibody produced second the average rate of antibody synthesis by pfc increased through day after immunization and then declined antigenantibody dissociation tests showed that the avidity of the serum antibody obtained to days after immunization was the same moreover during the same interval all the antibody detected by the farr test was of the igm class thus a change in avidity or class of immunoglobulin after day did not account for the disparity observed the clearance rate of antibody injected iv into nonimmune and immunized mice was studied the data obtained indicated that accelerated clearance of antibody was occurring prior to day after immunization however after day the antibody clearance rate was constant and was the same as that found when antibody was injected into nonimmune mice these findings affirmed the results of previous studies showing that treadmill neutralization was not important in determining the serum antibody levels present T3 immunization with an optimally immunogenic dose of sssiii
663,the socalled method of acupuncture anesthesia uses a series of techniques selection of patients psychotherapy premedication adjuvants morphinomimetics local anesthetics choice of points very varied whose specificity has not been demonstrated mechanical or electrical stimulation with very differents depending on the schools the effects of these procedures are inconstant they are slowly established at best they are manifested by a hypoesthesia which is more or less widespread and is not accompanied by any antireflex protection the action of the organisms different functions is not known in detail there are no statistical studies in the strict sense of the term in man it can be roughly estimated that out of surgical patients chosen about undergo the MI in acceptable conditions in the western world the cases although nothing is concealed in hanoÃ¯ as well as in peking are difficult and should only be handled by experienced anesthetistsresuscitators with knowledge of AP certain of the methods advantages only appear in comparison with bad chemical anesthesia atoxicity simplicity economy others are practically investions anallergic effects antiinfections antishock or at least abuse of language the disadvantages apart from the inconstancy of effectiveness the absence of protection the duration of induction consist of lack of standardization of techniques difficulties of animal experiments and the lack of rational explanation of the mechanism of action
664,since abnormalities in the renal handling of sodium and water in both the proximal and distal tubule have been described in primary hypothyroidism this study was undertaken to examine renal tubular hydrogen secretion in this disorder metabolic acidosis was induced in hypothyroid rats h and their age matched controls c by the administration of an oral ammonium chloride load of g hkg for three days on day animals were prepared for clearance and acidbase studies receiving an infusion of ringers solution of mlhr g during surgery and the exp procedure a decrease in gfr p less than and a doubling in FE of sodium p less than were observed in h rats the lowest blood ph and average bicarbonate concentration and the excretion of chloride were similar in the two groups indicating that the acid load was reabsorbed and led to similar degrees of systemic acidification urine flow also was comparable in the two groups minimal urine ph after nhcl was in h and in c p less than ammonium excretion was p less than lower in h than in c the defect in urine acidification in h was only partially corrected after days on a low sodium diet and doca administration for days fractional bicarbonate excretion at normal blood ph and bicarbonate concentration was not different in the two CG these data indicate that hypothyroid rats have a mild defect in urine acidification and that it is localized predominantly in the distal tubule
665,in deltachymotrypsin the CR of methionine towards pnitrophenacyl bromide is strongly reduced when the alphaamino group of isoleucine has been acetylated since acetylation of isoleucine brings deltachymotrypsin to a conformation similar to its ALP one this suggests that methionine should present an impaired reactivity in the alkaline conformation of the protein it is indeed observed that its chemical CR as a CF of ph depends on the ionization state of the alphaamino group of isoleucine pkapp at degrees c as does the structure of the enzyme reciprocally T3 chemical reaction of methionine with hydrogen peroxide isoleucine presents a slower rate of reaction with fluorescamine than when methionine is free as a result of methionine oxidation the apparent pk of the alkaline transition is shifted from to about at degrees c this is reflected in the disappearance of the lag phase previously observed for the initial activity of the enzyme when it is incubated at alkaline ph eur j biochem the absence of chemical reactivity of methionine in the alkaline state of the enzyme is confirmed by the appearance of a lag phase in the reaction of the protein with iodoacetate after an incubation at ALP ph such a lag phase does not appear when this incubation is carried out at neutral ph since this lag phase is similar to that which shows up in the activity during the isomerization of the enzyme from its alkaline to its neutral state the present data are interpreted as implying a concerted movement of isoleucine and methionine during this isomerization process they also indicate that in the alkaline form of the enzyme methionine has moved back into the interior of the protein since the spectroscopic properties of the zymogen and of the highph form of the enzyme are similar they suggest that Met occupies in the alkaline conformation of the enzyme a similar position as it does in the zymogen
666,qsqt is usually determined by the oxygen method the standard equation for calculation of percentage shunts is therefore see article in the case for an fio of i and when pao is greater than mm hg the equation can be expressed in terms of the difference in partial pressures of oxygen between the alveolus and the i.a. see article the determination of qsqt then necessitates apart from calculation of pao measurement of the o content of mixed venous blood taken from the pulmonary artery when an indwelling catheter for the sampling of mixed venous blood is not available samples of SVC blood can be used instead the error thereby introduced into the calculation of qsqt is debatable strictly only the sampling of mixed A-V blood permits precise determination of qsqt as long as the variations in qsqt more than its real value at a give time are worth supervising superior VC blood gives a rather satisfactory approximation various graphs relating qsqt to pao or to the alveoloarterial difference have been proposed and are discussed the other methods of determining qsqt are also looked at the value of determination of the shunt during nonhemodynamic edema and especially in the patient under artificial ventilation with peep is emphasised

669,in the course of examining the etiology of the luckÃ© renal adenocarcinoma of the frog rana pipiens it was found that organs of the normal adult contain bacteriolytic enzymes these enzymes all satisfied the six criteria for the identification of lysozymes and at least eight forms were separable by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis their qualitative and quantitative distribution was organspecific all eight isozymes were found in normal kidney while CL and spleen contained seven forms skin six ovarian egg five and SS two in quantitative assays using a radial diffusion test spleen had the greatest lysozyme concentration followed in descending order by kidney liver skin and ovary serum contained very low amounts in terms of CEA per animal ovary was the highest ranking organ as such a large number of lysozyme isozymes has not been reported in any other organism their origins and functions are considered in the context of their presence in an ectotherm
670,administration of hhydroxysafrole to rats or mice resulted in the formation of hepatic dna ribosomal rna and proteinbound h derivatives alkaline digestion of the hprotein released to of the h as a derivative that was identified as methylmercaptoisosafrole by its cochromatography in five solvent systems with the synthetic compound hydroxysafrole was metabolized at a low rate by rat and mouse liver cytosols in a phosphoadenosine phosphosulfatedependent reaction to a derivative presumably the sulfuric acid ester that was captured by its reaction with rna likewise hydroxysafrole was Ox at a low rate by rat and mouse liver microsomes to hydroxysafroleoxide in a reduced nicotinamide adenine CpG phosphatedependent reaction both of these electrophilic metabolites are candidate ultimate carcinogenic derivatives of hydroxysafrole the electrophilic reactivities of various safrole derivatives with nucleosides were determined to be in the order of oxosafrole greater than acetoxysafrole greater than acetoxysafroleoxide greater than hydroxysafroleoxide greater than safroleoxide greater than or equal to oxosafroleoxide the major reactions were generally observed with guanosine a major reaction product of acetoxysafrole and guanosine monophosphate yielded hydroxyisosafrole under very mild acidic conditions these data further substantiate the previous characterization of this reaction product as oisosafrolylguanylic acid the syntheses of oxosafrole dehydrosafrole hhydroxysafrole and the oxed
671,we have previously reported the sequential appearance in hyperimmunized rabbits of three distinct types of antifluoresceincombining sites that can be distinguished by the characteristic ICD cd of the bound hapten fluorescein such induced cd depends on the configuration of the surrounding residues and in the case of antifluorescein can be localized to the configuration of the subsite which binds the hydroxyxanthenone moiety of fluorescein in the present investigation we have studied the fine structure of both autologous and heterologous recombinant sites and of the free chains by measuring the induced cd of bound hapten heavy chain dimers at ph bound fluorescein that displayed a weak negative cd band which is different from that observed in any of the native antibodies no induced cd was observed with light chains thus the hydroxyxanthenone subsite does not exist intact in any of the isolated chains fluorescein bound to purified autologous recombinants when studied at ph exhibited cd spectra very similar to those observed for the original antibodies most significantly fluorescein bound to purified heterologous recombinants prepared in all possible combinations showed cd spectra most similar to those exhibited by sites from which the heavy chain was derived thus the microenvironment of the subsite appears to be due primarily to the heavy chain
672,in connection with the physiologic process of digestion the requirements for an enzymebased drug are stated quick PR of highly active enzymes in the duodenum is a prerequisite of physiological stimulation of the pancreatic excretory function digestive potency is regarded as a suitable gauge for comparing of results in largescale in vitro scanning our own in vitro and in vivo studies have borne out the possibility of transferring in vitro findings to the therapeutic value of this compound as shown by our investigations quick release of highly active enzymes in vitro is coupled with a high degree of bioavailability in fermento DU as a result normalization or reduction of the lipid content of faecesas a sign of therapeutic efficacyis seen in patients with pancreatic excretory insufficiency statistical evaluation resulted in the following a statistically significant p less than increase in lipase activity in the DU juice in vitro after addition of one capsule of fermento duodenal lipase activity in vivo after minutes is significantly different from all other values a statistically significant p less than drop in the amount and lipid content of faeces following the treatment with fermento duodenal
673,ionization effects on the binding of the potential TS analogues phosphoglycolate and phosphoglycolohydroxamate appear to be attributable to the changing state of ionization of the ligands themselves therefore it is unnecessary to postulate the additional involvement of an ionizing residue at the active site of triosephosphate isomerase to explain the influence of changing ph on ki in the neutral range the binding of the competitive inhibitor inorganic sulfate is insensitive to changing ph in the neutral range chloroacetol sulfate synthesized as an activesitespecific reagent for triosephosphate isomerase is used to provide an indication of the pka of the essential carboxyl group of this enzyme previously described activesitespecific reagents for the isomerase were phosphate esters and their changing state of ionization accompanied by possible changes in their affinity for the AS site may have complicated earlier attempts to determine the pka of the essential carboxyl group from the ph dependence of the rate of inactivation being a strong monoprotic acid chloroacetol sulfate is better suited to the determination of the pka of the carboxyl group chloroacetol sulfate inactivates triosephosphate isomerase by the selective esterification of the same carboxyl group as that which is esterified by the phosphate esters described earlier from the ph dependence of the rate of inactivation of yeast triosephosphate isomerase the apparent pka of the activesite carboxyl group is estimated as
674,it was discovered that the product of a mix containing the enzyme creatine phosphokinase cpk and either glutathione gsh or cysteine caused platelets to adhere together in vitro this platelet adhesive factor paf was formed as cpk CEA declined an alternative method for the destruction of enzyme activityheat at degrees calso resulted in the formation of an invitro AS paf which was both less SD and active than its chemically produced counterpart assay of the PLT adhesive potency of the cpkgsh mix using human platelets revealed a wide variation in the response of different individuals platelets to standard quantities of paf the nature of this preparation of paf was investigated by both biochemical and biophysical means including ion exchange chromatography electrophoresis amino acid analysis and analytical ultracentrifuge studies evidence is presented that paf is the product of the disruption of the dimeric structure of the cpk molecule paf was found to adhere to paper under the conditions of electrophoresis imposed and also to cause sephadex beads to bind together characteristics which suggested that the platelet adhesion reaction was probably a biophysical process red and white cells were not similarly affected the feasibility of this novel concept for the initiation of platelet adhesion as a naturally occurring process was supported by the results of animal experiments in which a statistically depression of platelets in the SVR circulation followed the intravascular administration of paf the possible relevance to man of this basic mechanism in relation to exercise and disease processes including ideopathic and posttraumatic thrombosis atherogenesis and dysbaric AN of bone is discussed
675,when the competitive inhibitor benzeneboronic acid bba forms a complex with alphachymotrypsin ec protons are released in the acidic ph region the proton release can be measured by a difference potentiometric technique the proton release is also observed in chymotrypsinogen a but not in trck dip and anhydrochymotrypsins based on these observations a simple procedure to estimate the equilibrium constants of the trigonaltetrahedral interconversion of bba is proposed thermodynamic parameters of the ionization of his and of each step involved in bba binding can be estimated from the temperature dependence of the proton PR those of his are essentially the same as those of imidazole in water regarding the interconversion of bba on the enzyme the value of delta s is similar to delta s not equal to of the deacylation step of nonspecific substrates and delta h is remarkably reduced from that for the ionization of bba in water the enthalpic gain of enzymic process is suggested to be due to the change of the proton acceptor which is water in the case of the ionization of bba in water to imidazole on the enzyme
676,evidence is presented to show that an optical isomer of phenylhydantoin is subject to racemization interconversion in different buffer systems with phosphate buffers in the ph range of it appears that the buffercatalyzed racemization reaction is due solely to catalysis by divalent phosphate GA base catalysis other buffers studied include arsenate imidazole triethanolamine and pyrophosphate when phenylhydantoin the ndeethylated metabolite of ethotoin was administered to dogs in an earlier investigation the observation was made that somewhat more than the theoretical quantity mole percent of the dose of the substances recovered from urine had the rconfiguration the principal metabolite was rphenylhydantoic acid formed stereospecifically in a ringopening reaction of rphyenylhydantoin by DHP ec the results of the present in vitro study support the hypothesis that in vivo the interconversion of the optical isomers of phenylhydantoin can be catalyzed by buffering components of the mammalian physiological system and that the catalytic activities of the endogenous buffer components can account for the racemization and ultimate metabolism of the sisomer of phenylhydantoin by dihydropyrimidinase
677,a sucrase from honey bees apis mellifera which precipitates between ammonium sulfate saturations of and mg protein per millilitre and which makes up the major portion of the sucrases of honey bees was purified to homogeneity as shown by several criteria a large part of the sucrase was found in the head while most of the rest was in the abdomen a small amount was in the thorax the enzyme precipitated between the same values of ammonium sulfate saturation as did the sucrase in honey and honey sucrase exhibited kinetics very similar to those of this enzyme the enzyme was found to be a relatively nonspecific alphaglucosidase and was shown to have transglucosidase activity the production of glucose from SU was rectilinear when plotted by the hofstee method at low substrate concentrations but decreased at high sucrose concentrations the production of fructose was rectilinear throughout the concentration range used the production of both gl and rhonitrophenol when rho nitrophenyl alphadglucoside was the ATP was linear by the hofstee plot these effects were found to be due to transglucolysis and a mechanism of action is proposed amino acid and amino sugar analyses indicated that the sucrase was a glycoprotein the molecular weight was found to be between and by three different methods and an sow value of s was obtained there was no evidence for S1 structure tests of the enzyme under various denaturation conditions did not reveal any unusual stabilities the sucrase bound very tightly to a hydrophobic column IAA decreased the activity of the sucrase but a C1 concentration was needed to bring about a activity loss reducing agents caused some activity declines diethyl pyrocarbonate G1 the enzyme
678,a faecal suspension in sodium chloride solution incubated anaerobically at degrees c for h showed excellent survival of all the main groups of faecal bacteria all faecal incubation systems studied generated large amounts of ammonia particularly those in which bacterial counts fell during incubation as normal faeces contain negligible amounts of urea this ammonia must have been generated from sources other than urea ammonia was also generated by faeces delivered by sodium chloride enema and by ileostomy fluid indicating that the phenomenon is not confined to distal colonic contents ammonia generation by incubated faeces was inhibited by prior autoclaving of the sample but not by sterilization with gammairradiation generation of ammonia by incubated stool was accompanied by release of large amounts of organic anion and a fall in ph these observations are interpreted as evidence that ammonia generated within the colon in situ is not derived exclusively from urea but also from bacterial deamination of amino acids peptides and proteins simultaneously bacterial activity generates C1 amounts of organacid the presence of living bacteria is not essential for ammonia generation provided that bacterial enzymes are present bacterial generation of organic solute in faeces which have left the body is sufficiently rapid to cast serious doubts on the validity of faecal centrifugation or other timeconsuming techniques involving lengthy handling of faeces as methods of obtaining extracellular faecal fluid for measurements of organic constituents or ammonia
679,mechanisms of lubrication of human synovial joints have been analysed in terms of the operating conditions of the joint the synovial fluid and articular cartilage in the hip and knee during a walking cycle the load may rise up to four times body weight in the knee on dropping one metre the load may go up to time body weight the elastic modulus of cartilage is similar to that of the synthetic rubber of a car tyre the cartilage surface is rough and in elderly specimens the centre line average is mum the friction force generated in reciprocating tests shows that both cartilage and synovial fluid are important in lubrication the viscosityshear rate relationships of normal synovial fluid show that it is nonnewtonian osteoarthrosic fluid is less so and RA fluid is more nearly newtonian experiments with hip joints in a pendulum machine show that fluid film lubrication obtains at some phases of joint action boundary lubrication prevails under certain conditions and has been examined with a reciprocating friction machine digestion of hyaluronate does not alter the boundary lubrication but trypsin digestion does surface active substances lauryl sulphate and cetyl ammonium bromide give a lubricating ability similar to that of synovial fluid the effectiveness of the two substances varies with ph
680,earlier findings have shown that in experimental animals rat and in man inhaled carbon disulphide cs reversibly inhibits the nonspecific oxidative drug metabolism caused by hepatic microsomal enzymes very little is known concerning the underlying mechanism the present investigations were undertaken to throw CS on this question T3 addition of an nadphregenerating system to liver microsomes isolated from AD female wistar rats the oxidative ndemethylation of aminopyrine was measured under simultaneous SE to cs by quantitatively determining the formaldehyde obtained the resulting data were evaluated using enzymekinetic parameters according to lineweaverburk following acute SE to low and mediumgrade cs concentrations ppm h the DP of inhibition in rat CL microsomes is identical to that obtained in normal liver microsomes to which cs had been added this finding seems to suggest that the inhibitory process under in vivo and in vitro conditions is based on one and the same molecular mechanism upon addition of cs the in vitro pattern of inhibition corresponds to a strong mixedtype inhibition it is concluded from the enzymekinetic behaviour that cs attacks at two different CS of the enzyme molecule IB to the first site is followed by inhibition as evidenced by the rise of km after saturation of this site a second site is occupied resulting in a reactivation and beyond this an activation of enzyme SO as shown by the decrease of km cs exhibits a high affinity for the first site and a low affinity for the second site IB at the first site is reversible the possibility that the active centre in the enzyme molecule is the site where binding of the inhibitor occurs is ruled out a continuous decrease of vmax at increasing inhibitor concentration is causally related with the formation of an ES inhibitor complex the cs added to the microsomes can be eliminated by helium gas this is followed by the return of the original enzyme activity it is concluded from this behaviour that under in vitro conditions cs itself rather than its metabolites acts as the inhibitor oxygen treatment of the microsomecontaining reaction mixture enhances the inhibition in substratefree control mixtures addition of cs was followed by the dosedependent formation of formaldehyde a causal explanation is not readily available at this time
681,yellow and white mutants of the strains nocardia pellegrino sn r have been isolated regarding their morphological and physiological properties the mutants are MZ with the wild type bacteria with the exception of their pigmentation and lipid composition however the pigment composition number rfvalues and spectra of the pigment components of the yellow mutant is MZ with that of the wild type as a consequence the modified pigmentation of the yellow mutant cannot be explained by an altered pigment synthesis the wild type cells and the mutant sn g contain three main pigment components designated as i ii and iii components ii and iii posses a marked indicator character and show a bathochromic shift in solutions of ph or higher components ii and iii contain PET groups which are able to react with acetic acid yielding acetylated products after acetylating no bathochromic shift in alkali occurs intact cells of the wild type retain their orangered pigmentation in buffer solution with a phvalue of or higher cells of the yellow mutant however change the yellow color immediately after the alkali treatment to orangered this new color is MZ with that of the wild type and can be changed to yellow by placing the cells into n hcl regarding these facts it seems to be very probable that the functional groups of the pigment components ii and iii are differently bound in the wild type and mutant cells in the mutant they are accessible to oh ions yielding a bathochromic shift while in the wild type cells oh ions are unable to provoke this shift it seems to be also probable that different lipids in the two strains are responsible for the binding of the pigments so far known this is the first observation about the occurence of pigment mutants with an altered pigment IB site in the cells
682,large numbers of taste buds are distributed over the BS of the channel catfish ictalurus punctatus with the barbels having an especially high density lalanine as well as certain other amino acids are taste stimuli in this animal epithelial tissue obtained by gentle scraping of the barbel surface was fractionated by differential centrifugation a sedimentable fraction p was prepared that was enriched in lohalanine binding activity the plasma membrane marker enzyme nucleotidase and the mitochondrial marker succinate cytochrome c reductase but not the microsomal marker nadh cytochrome c reductase binding of lohalanine was measured using a millipore filter method in which correction for nonspecific binding was also determined time temperature and ph for measuring CBA were established at the optimal ph of the kd for lalanine is x m the first order dissociation rate constant at degrees is x s and at degrees it is x s the second order rate constant for association is between and m s reversibility of the IB interaction was also demonstrates by the rapid displacement of bound lhalanine by a large excess of unlabeled lalanine that the IB does not represent incorporation into protein was confirmed by the lack of effect of puromycin the amounts bound of several other chemostimulatory amino acids werealso determined
683,to clarify the properties and functions of a TR inhibitor from japanese barley in comparison with the inhibitor from pirkka barley an inhibitor was isolated from the barley hordeum distichum l var emend lamark by extraction with nacl AS fractionation and repeated chromatography on deaecellulose and cmcellulose the final purified preparation of the inhibitor was found to be homogeneous by both chromatographic and electrophoretic analysis the inhibitor was thermostable and was stable over the broad ph range from to no inhibition was observed by heavy metal ions and many reagents at m except that PCMB caused a loss of activity the inhibitor was subjected to isoelectric focusing at ph and its molecular weight was calculated to be by SDS-PAGE the apparent dissociation constant for the complex between the inhibitor and trypsinec was x m with CS as a substrate one microgram of purified inhibitor inhibited mug of pure trypsin in the hydrolysis of alphanbenzoyldlargininepnitroanilide by chemical modification of arginyl residues in the inhibitor with CHD the inhibitor was shown to be an Arg inhibitor the inhibitor contained relatively many basic amino acids and few half cystines as compared with pirkka barley trypsin inhibitor
684,ADCC cellmediated cytotoxicity mediated by peripheral BL was studied in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus polyarteritis nodosa sjogrens syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis the target cells were chicken erythrocytes coated with rb antichicken EA antibody antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxic activity was normal in sjogrens syndrome and rheumatoid ICA but significantly decreased p is less than in active SVR lupus erythematosus and in two patients with polyarteritis nodosa a partial regeneration of antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxic activity was obtained by treatment with pronase and dnase followed by overnight incubation sera from patients with SVR lupus erythematosus inhibited ADCC cellmediated cytotoxic activity of normal lymphocytes the inhibitory activity was studied by TPS immunoadsorption and sucrose density geadient UC removal of igg but not igm greatly reduced inhibition inhibitory AF were present in s and heavier fractions containing igg five SVR lupus erythematosus patients were studied serially to determine if improvement in clinical status could be correlated with a decrease in SS inhibitory factors as studied by inhibition of normal antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxicity indeed a greater serum inhibitory capacity was found in each patient during periods of greater SLEDAI
685,we have previously shown that blood transfusions can immunize a dog and lead to rejection of a subsequent marrow graft despite lethal TB irradiation tbi sensitization to histocompatibility antigens induced by two prior transfusions of whole blood could be overcome by a regimen of procarbazine and antithymocyte SS ats preceding tbi the current study investigated a whether this regimen could abrogate sensitization induced by six weekly transfusions given from days to preceding a marrow graft and b whether platelet survival studies and two in vitro tests of immunity could predict marrow VG rejection all donorrecipient pairs were histoincompatible unrelated and of different breed twentytwo recipients received platelet concentrate transfusions and eight received whole blood transfusions recipients were given r tbi and a VG of marrow and IP blood leukocytes from the transfusion donor on day three of recipients given procarbazine mgkg iv on days and and ats mlkg subcutaneously on days and rejected their grafts whereas of dogs not given procarbazine and ats rejected their grafts p less than SS lymphocytotoxic antibodies IP leukocyte migration inhibition and in vivo donor PLT REC and survival were studied in those recipients receiving six weekly transfusions and in other recipients receiving a single donor transfusion months before marrow grafting no significant correlation was found among these in vitro and in vivo tests of sensitization sensitization to marrow grafts was not reliably detected by the presence of cytotoxic antibodies or leukocyte migration inhibition platelet survival however was positively correlated with the results of marrow grafting in of evaluable recipients p approximately
686,propranolol at a dose mgkg which did not alter tailflick RL by itself did not alter the ed of morphine when given min prior to the narcotic propranolol at doses of and mgkg given min prior to naloxone challenge did not significantly alter the frequency of naloxone induced jumping hr after morphine pellet implantation the ed of naloxone in morphine pelleted mice was not altered by treatment with propranolol at and hr after pellet implantation naloxone caused hyperactivity in mice when administered hr after morphine pellet implantation an injection of mgkg propranolol min prior to naloxone did not block this hyperactivity in addition administration of mgkg of propranolol every hr to rats during withdrawal from morphine failed to alleviate the withdrawal syndrome as evidenced by changes in either body weight or water NI these data suggest that the betaadrenergic blocking agent propranolol does not alter the antinociceptive activity or lessen the withdrawal syndrome of morphine in rodents
687,the magnitude of the electric dipole vector of human serum albumin as measured by the dielectric increment of the isoionic solution is found to be a CS monotonic indicator of the number of moles up to at least of long chain fatty acid complexed the sensitivity is about three times as great as it is in bovine albumin new methods of analysis of the frequency dispersion of the dielectric constant were developed to ascertain if molecular shape changes also accompany the complexing with fatty acid direct twocomponent rotary DWI constant analysis is found to be too strongly affected by cross modulation between small systematic errors and physically significant data components to be a reliable measure of structural modification multicomponent relaxation profiles are more useful as recognition patterns for structural comparisons but the equations involved are illconditioned and solutions based on standard leastsquares regression contain mathematical artifacts which mask the physically significant spectrum by constraining the solution to nonnegative coefficients the magnitude of the artifacts is reduced to well below the magnitudes of the spectral components profiles calculated in this way show no evidence of significant dipole direction or molecular shape NC as the albumin is complexed with mol of fatty acid in these experiments albumin was defatted by incubation with AT at physiological ph which avoids passing the protein through the ph of the nf transition usually required in defatting addition of fatty acid from soluion in small amounts of ethanol appears to form a complex indistinguishable from the native complex
688,the growth of avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv in chick A6 at different ph values in the range demonstrated that although the virus was released at a much faster rate at the higher ph values the titre tended to drop more quickly at the acid ph values the virus was released more slowly but reached a maximum titre similar to that at the higher ph values and showed only minimum reduction in infectivity up to hours post inoculation the stability of virus in tissue SC medium was shown to be directly related to ph being more stable at the acid ph values the degree of cytopathogenicity induced in CK cells following infection with ibv was directly related to the ph at which the cells were incubated occurring earlier and more extensively in cells at the higher ph values cell macromolecule synthesis in chick kidney cells was inhibited following infection with ibv and was apparently due to cell damage and death
689,the approach to the problem of oncogenesis of tumorigenic viruses is compared and analyzed from the position of the altshteinvogt hypothesis and from that of the general theory of oncogenesis advanced by the present author in contrast to the hypothesis of altshteinvogt dealing mainly with the problem of oncogene origin the GA theory of oncogenesis not only defines concretely the origin of the oncogene and the essence of its product but also makes it possible to understand why when and how integration of the oncogene with the genome of the cell leads to the transformation of the cell into a benign cell and when into a malignant tumour cell an analysis of the essence of the oncogene TPE from this standpoint shows that an integration similar in its mechanism but differing in polarity of the genome of other viruses with the cell genome should lead to the formation of a corresponding antiviral SD lifelong immunity or also to the emergence of pseudoautoimmune disease of the type caused by slow viruses
690,endplate potentials epps were recorded from frog sartorius NM junctions under conditions of decreased transmitter release to T0 the effect of repetitive stimulation on augmentation and potentiation of transmitter release the magnitudes and time constants of decay of augmentation and potentiation were determined both following a primary conditioning train and following an identical secondary conditioning train applied from to sec after the primary conditioning train the magnitude of augmentation following the AA conditioning trains was increased over that following the primary conditioning trains even though augmentation with a TC of decay of about sec had decayed to insignificant levels before the ON of the secondary trains this increase in augmentation was not due to a change in its rate of decay during the secondary trains the increased magnitude of augmentation can be described as arising from an expression factor which for conditioning trains of impulses at sec has an initial magnitude of sd of observation the magnitude of augmentation is increased times and decays approximately exponentially with a time constant of sd of observation sec the expression factor thus decays about ten times slower than augmentation doubling the number of impulses in the primary conditioning train from to led to a sd of observation times increase in the magnitude of the expression factor estimated by placing a impulse secondary conditioning train sec after the primary conditioning train the expression factor while increasing the magnitude of augmentation had little or no effect on the magnitude of potentiation or on trasmitter release in the absence of augmentation the expression factor decayed about twice as slowly as potentiation the time constants characterizing the decay of potentiation were greater following the secondary conditioning trains than following the primary conditioning trains the increased TC for the decay of potentiation can be described as arising from a time constant factor which for conditioning trains of impulses at sec has an initial magnitude of sd of observation the TC of potentiation is increased times and decays approximately exponentially with a time constant of sd of observation sec the TC factor decayed about three times slower than potentiation doubling the number of impulses in the primary conditioning train from to led to a sd of observation times increase in the magnitude of the time constant factor estimated by placing a impulse secondary conditioning train sec after the primary conditioning train
691,the capacity of benorylate an ester of acetylsalicylic acid and paracetamol to reduce fever in children was compared with that of the components as such or as a combination the series of cases studied consisted of patients between the ages of months and years with rectal temperatures above degrees c temperatures were recorded at and min and and hrs after the administration of the drug the antipyretic effect of combined acetylsalicylic acid mgkg and PAR mgkg was superior to the effect of benorylate with a dose of mgkg and even of mgkg as well as better than the effect of either drug CT acetylsalicylic acid mgkg and paracetamol mgkg CT produced a significantly greater antipyretic effect than benorylate with a dose of mgkg given in a dose of mgkg benorylate seems to have a significant antipyretic effect however this effect is clearly smaller than that of either of its components acetylsalicylic acid or paracetamol therefore benorylate is probably not suitable to be used as a general antipyretic agent in children
692,the mechanisms of the low availability of endogenous folates in OJ and the inhibitory effects on the availability of pteroylheptaglutamate pteglu caused by OJ supplements were investigated in man by the use of simulated orange juice containing the principal components citric acid malic acid etc with several different phs the endogenous folates in orange juice were identified as mainly methyl reduced derivatives of pteroylpolyglutamates pentaglutamate tetraglutamate monoglutamate and the rest were triand diglutamates the availability of pteglu is decreased to by supplementation with g concentrated OJ ph and to and by the supplement of g and g citric acid ph respectively neutralization of g citric acid to ph largely reverses the inhibitory effect on the other hand the availability of pteroylmonoglutamate pteglu is not influenced by a supplement of OJ or citric acid the results suggest that the low availability of pteglu is due to the inhibition of intestinal conjugase caused by the low ph these observations suggest that ph of foodstuffs may be an important factor in the absorption of polyglutamate forms of folate
693,nine strains of bacteroides fragilis were cultivated in stirred fermentors and tested for their ability to produce betalactamase there was a correlation between formation of betalactamase and high values of the minimal inhibitory concentration against betalactam antibiotics b fragilis strain b was used for optimizing the production of betalactamase the highest bacterial yield was obtained in a proteose peptoneyeast extract medium optimal conditions for growth and betalactamase production were obtained at c and ph the betalactamase was released into the surrounding medium during the growth period to about osmotic shock released about of the total activity and remaining activity was found in the cytoplasmic fraction ATP profile studies on four betalactamaseproducing strains showed that the enzymes were mainly cephalosporinases they are inhibited by cloxacillin pchloromercuribenzoate and iodine analytical isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel gave an isoelectric point of for three of the strains and for one comparison with betalactamases from aerobic GN species with regard to isoelectric points showed no similarities also the molecular weight of the betalactamase from CS b of indicates that this is a new class of betalactamase
694,cholinesterase activities in the hearts and ganglia of an oyster crassostrea virginica and a venerid clam macrocallista nimbosa were measured and compared tissue extracts were partially purified by AS fractionation followed by gel column chromatography enzymatic activity was assayed spectrophotometrically substrates were acetyl butyryl and propionylthiocholine atc btc ptc kinetic constants characterizing each enzyme were derived at all ATP concentrations the hydrolysis rates of both clam enzymes were in the order btc greater than ptc greater than atc with oyster enzymes the ranking was atc greater than or equal to ptc greater btc the specific activities of oyster heart and ganglion enzymes were similar in contrast clam ganglion extracts were times more active than clam heart extracts and with any ATP had greater activity than either oyster enzyme all enzyme preparations proved to be homogeneous on the bases of constant substrate activity ratios in successive column fractions and of intermediate velocities with mixed substrates six cholinesterase inhibitors were tested the specific acetylcholinesterase antagonist bw c was much more effective against oyster enzymes while the specific antibutyrylcholinesterase isoompa almost totally inhibited calm enzyme activity but had little effect on oyster eserine was the most effective inhibitor of both enzymes in conclusion the enzymes in oyster tissues are acetylcholinesterases while clam enzymes are butyrylcholinesterases nevertheless clam ganglion esterase is sifficiently AS to hydrolyze the physiological substrate acetylcholine these results explain the longobserved differences in isolated heart pharmacology between ostreid and venerid bivalves
695,the titration behavior of individual tyrosine residues of myoglobins has been studied by observing the ph dependence of the chemical shifts of czeta and cgamma of these residues in natural abundance of c fourier transform nmr spectra at mhz in mm sample tubes at degrees of cyanoferrimyoglobins from sperm whale horse and red kangaroo a comparison of the ph dependence of the spectra of the three proteins yielded specific assignments for the resonance of tyr sperm whale and tyr sperm whale and horse selective proton decoupling yielded TPS assignments for czeta of tyr of the cyanoferrimyoglobins from horse and kangaroo but not the corresponding assignment for sperm whale the ph dependence of the chemical shifts indicated that only tyr and tyr are titratable IMT residues even at ph tyr did not begin to titrate the titration behavior of c zeta and cgamma of tyr of sperm whale cyanoferrimyoglobin yielded a single pk value of the ph dependence of the CS of each of the resonances of tyr of the cyanoferrimyoglobins from horse and sperm whale could not be fitted with the use of a single pk value but was consistent with two pk values about and furthermore the resonances of czeta and cgamma of tyr broadened at high ph the titration SMB of the tyrosines of sperm whale carbon monoxide myoglobin and horse ferrimyoglobin was also examined a comparison of all the experimental results indicated that tyr is exposed to solvent tyr is not exposed and tyr exhibits intermediate SMB these results for myoglobins in solution are consistent with expectations based on the crystal structure
696,single equimolar oral doses of bacampicillin and ampicillin were given to HS on a crossover randomized basis data were interpreted in terms of a compartment pharmacokinetic open MM intestinal absorption of bacampicillin was found to be faster and more complete than that of ampicillin yielding an increase in bioavailability of to as measured by the area under serum levels curve the urinary excretion and absorption rate constants after the administration of bacampicillin much higher and sharper peaks were achieved in the serum and in the tissue water than after the administration of ampicillin the maximum bactericidal dilution mbd of the SS samples taken hr T3 the administration of the antibiotics against strains of diplococcus pneumoniae was higher following bacampicillin p less than as was the mbd of the to hr urine specimens against strains of escherichia coli further clinical trials are required to accurately assess the possible greater therapeutic effectiveness of bacampicillin than of ampicillin
697,metiamide an histamine hreceptors antagonist has been used to treat a case of zollingerellison syndrome characterized by a long standing diarrhea an important gastric hypersecretion and a moderatly elevated plasma gastrin but without digestive ulceration at the dose of mg per day metiamide induced a complete suppression of acid secretion an effect which lasted for days after stopping the drug accordingly and since the only finding at time of LAP was a small lymph node enlarged with endocrine M1 tissue the stomach was left intact and metiamide pursued during the first months of chronic administration of metiamide acid secretion was maintained at levels below pcent of initial values ulteriorly however although dosages of metiamide were increased acid hypersecretion resumed and a duodenal ulcer developed total gastrectomy was then performed months after the beginning of metiamide in spite of the failure of metiamide treatment the long term follow up of this case of zollingerellison syndrome allowed us to get theoretical and practical informations
698,we have discussed two patients who had renal tubular acidosis complicated by hypokalemia the first patient had a distal acidifying defect circumstantial evidence has been presented suggesting that SE to toluenediisocyanate or toluenediamine played a role in the pathogenesis the acidosis and the hypokalemia of this patient were easily corrected by the administration of small amounts of sodium bicarbonate without potassium supplementation the second patient had an interstitial nephritis of unknown etiology and presented with moderate renal insufficiency renal tubular acidosis and PT as well as distal acidifying defects the proximal tubular dysfunction was associated with general aminoaciduria and glucosuria this patient required large quantities of both alkali and potassium to correct the electrolyte CA the mechanisms of potassium wasting in proximal and distal RTA are reviewed a classification is presented of cellular defects that may underlie the different renal acidifying defects attempts to distinguish between pump and permeability defects from urinary pco levels must take into account the simultaneous hco concentration since large pco elevations require the presence of ample hco in the urine permeability defects may impair urinary acidification by either abnormal back flux of h out of the lumen or increased influx of hco into the lumen in studies of acidification in vitro amphotericin b causes increased h permeability and has little effect on hco permeability toluenediamine causes a marked permeability defect which is reversible but remains to be defined in terms of the ion species hco or h affected at times hyperchloremic acidosis is caused by distal defects in net acid excretion that occur without impairment of the h gradient in certain patients with hypoaldosteronism for example distal JH may be reduced without NC in the force of the h pump
699,a vaccinium myrtillus anthocyanosides preparation equivalent to of anthocyanidins demonstrated significant vasoprotective and antioedema properties in exerimental animals in rabbits the skin capillary permeability increase due to chloroform was reduced both after ip mgkg and oral administration mgkg of anthocyanosides their activity was more lasting in comparison to rutin or mepyramine and this did not seem to be due to a specific antagonism towards inflammatory process mediators such as histamine or bradykinin experiments carried out in rats demonstrated that vacinium myrtillus anthocyanosides were effective both in skin capillary permeability test as well as on vascular resistance of rats fed a p factor deficient diet in the former test ERP doses were in the range of mgkg by oral route in both the animal species investigated anthocyanosides were twofold more active when compared to the flavonoid rutin vaccinium myrtillus anthocyanosides by oral route inhibited carrageein paw oedema in rats showing a DR relationship an antioedema activity was detected also after iv or topical application
700,the mechanisms responsible for the transient respiratory alkalosis which follows clinical hemodialysis were evaluated by studying the VE response to carbon dioxide in chronic uremic patients and in unanesthetized normal and chronic uremic goats a significant increase in sensitivity to co was found in acidotic uremic patients immediately within min following hemodialysis p less than sensitivity to co returned to the predialysis value within h lung volume and maximal breathing capacity were unchanged a similar increase in sensitivity to co was seen in nonacidotic uremic goats following hemodialysis in the goats these changes in sensitivity could not be explained by changes in cerebrospinal fluid acidbase status adding sufficient urea to the dialysate to prevent a fall in plasma urea concentration eliminated this increase in sensitivity to co in both uremic patients and goats these results suggests that the transient respiratory alkalosis following hemodialysis is due to an increase in the sensitivity of the VE response to carbon dioxide and is a consequence of dialysisinduced osmotic disequilibrium
701,an association between VH and two rheumatic disease syndromes has been observed twentynine patients manifested a transient polyarthritis sometimes associated with a rash group i ten patients were seen with a multisystem disease group ii histologic evidence of arteritis or glomerulonephritis was present in seven of ten patients with multisystem disease liver tissue from patients showed morphologic evidence of hepatitis with viral features in of patients in GI and in of patients in group ii hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag andor antibody to hbsag were detected in sera of all patients abnormal liver functions were present in twelve group i patients and group ii patients became jaundiced rheumatoid factor was present in sera of seven patients in each group the third component of complement c was depressed in patients in group i and patients in group ii the C4 c was decreased in of group i and of group ii patients synovial fluid c was decreased in of GI and of group ii patients fluids articular inflammation in patients with transient polyarthritis responded in three to seven days to aspirin acetominophen andor bedrest alone and rashes disappeared spontaneously patients with multisystem disease generally had a prolonged illness and responded somewhat unpredictably to prednisone or a combination of prednisone and cyclophosphamide
702,we have examined the effect of k depletion on csf hco homeostasis in awake rats the relationship of csf hco to arterial hco in metabolic acidbase disturbances is displaced is an upward direction and has a significantly increased slope in kdepleted vs control rats vs results of partial krepletion experiments with peripheral acidbase balance held constant suggest that the effect is k TPS the kdepleted animals also exhibit a wider csfarterial pco difference than controls vs mmhg when csf hco is shown as a function of csf pco the data of kdepleted rats are no longer displaced when compared to controls but still have a significantly greater slope vs this increased slope is interpreted to reflect enhanced hco movement from blood to csf at high arterial hco analysis of our data and observations from the literature in conditions of mixed acidbase disturbances suggest that csf hco is determined by a csf pco and b the level of arterial hco when the latter is greater than the normal csf hco
703,blood gases lactic acid concentrations and ph were measured in arterial and mixed venous blood in moderately conditioned standardbred horses T3 a standardized exercise load of km in T2 seconds samples were obtained at rest immediately T3 exercise and at and minutes after exercise PaO(2) and mixed venous oxygen tension increased after exercise reaching peak values at minutes arterial oxygen tension returned to the resting preexercise value by T2 and mixed A-V oxygen tension by minutes arterial carbon dioxide tension decreased immediately after exercise reaching its lowest value at T2 and returned to resting value by minutes mixed A-V carbon dioxide tension reached its highest value immediately after exercise then decreased to less than the resting value reaching its lowest value by minutes and returned to normal by T2 lactic acid concentration increased immediately after exercise reaching its highest value at T2 and returned toward normal by minutes arterial ph decreased immediately after exercise reaching its lowest value at T2 and returned to normal by minutes mixed venous ph reached its lowest value immediately after exercise then began to increase and returned to normal by minutes the decrease in mixed venous ph was more pronounced than that in arterial blood since in addition to the increase in lartic acid there was a considerable increase in mixed PvCO2
704,four homogeneous antibodies to type viii pneumococcal polysaccharide s were isolated from the serum of a single rabbit by AC on an s immunoadsoebent by utilizing gradient elution with cellobiose and nacl the binding properties of these antibodies were determined by a radioimmunoassay with ibovine gammaglobulins cellobiose a disaccharide unit of s was the immunodominant group of each of the four antibodies but each antibody bound to this disaccharide with different relative affinities the amino acid sequences positions of three of the four antibody CS chains were each different both in FR and first HV region sequences the fourth antibody CS chain has a blocked amino terminus these findings indicate that antibodies elicited by a relatively simple antigen and examined at one time during the course of immunization in a single rb may exhibit common specificities for an oligosaccharide determinant yet have different IB affinities for that determinant as well as different primary structures in the complementarity hypervariable regions and FR regions
705,hemopoietic grafts following r of total body irradiation were carried out between canine littermates homozygous or heterozygous for lymphocyte defined ld antigens of the L1 histocompatibility complex mhc in all but five of the pairs studied ld homozygous dogs were also homozygous for serologically defined sd antigens of the mhc results of transplants were compared with previous results obtained in littermate pairs matched or mismatched for the mhc two groups of recipients were studied of ld homozygous recipients in group given grafts from ld heterozygous donors died between and days and two survived more than and days the most frequent cause of death was graftversushost disease gvhd survival was significantly shorter p less than than that of dogs given grafts from matched littermates and not different p congruent to from that of dogs given grafts from mismatched littermates survival of ld heterozygous recipients in group given grafts from ld homozygous donors was not different from that of dogs in group p congruent to the results indicate that the ld loci detected by mixed leukocyte culture are not the principal determinants within the mhc that are responsible for gvhd
706,cardiac slowing during elevated intracranial pressure icp could be due to direct activation of central nervous system cns centers or it may be AA to baroreceptor reflexes G1 by the associated pressor response in five pentobarbitalanesthetized dogs when icp was raised to mmhg the heart rate decreased beatsmin se this cardiac slowing occurred when icp was elevated after sinoaortic denervation bpm and also during elevated icp when changes in arterial pressure were prevented beatsmin these results indicate that the cardiac slowing is largely of cns origin in dogs given morphine with pentobarbital to achieve slower HR rates raising icp to mmhg by leftsided intracranial balloon inflation led to cardiac dysrhythmias in of dogs by contrast raising icp to mmhg by rightsided intracranial balloon inflation only produced progressive sinus bradycardia these responses were related to a combined enhancement of vagal and sympathetic activity differences observed between right and leftsides balloon inflation may be partly related to asymmetrical engagement of the cardiac autonomic nerves the results suggest that leftsided intracranial lesions are more likely to produce cardiac dysrhythmias
707,in mice rendered morphinedependent by pellet implantation for days the administration of pargyline hours after pellet removal intensified narcotic abstinence SMB particularly the narcotic withdrawal jumping response pargyline mgkg ip caused a to fold increase in the incidence of jumping in mice withdrawing from morphine hours T3 removal of the pellet whereas this effect was not observed hour after the injection of pargyline or in animals still implanted with the morphine pellet the median effective dose ed of pargyline required to elicit withdrawal jumping in mice implanted with morphine decreased with increasing PCS dependence the ed for hours was about onesixth that after hours of implantation additionally pargyline potentiated naloxoneprecipitated withdrawal jumping as evidenced by a reduction of the naloxone ed by approximately onehalf administration of other MAO-A inhibitors such as pheniprazine iproiazid or tranylcypromine failed to alter the indicence of jumping in dependent mice undergoind abrupt morphine with drawal further dopamine receptor stimulation by amphetamine pheniprazine or amantadine antagonized the pargylineinduced jumping response these data suggest that the increased incidence of withdrawal jumping observed after pargyline in morphinedependent mice is not related to monoamine oxidase inhibition but rather to a possible pargylineinduced decrease in dopaminergic activity
708,AA cultures of embryonic rat fibroblasts neupert et al exp path were cultured in and o concentration at ph and for or days the acid mucopolysaccharides were isolated and fractionated by alcohol precipitation papain digestion cpcprecipitation and fractionation after the microtechniques of svejcar and robertson see kittlick and neupert exp path cells and medium were investigated together the results were related to cell density and compared with the glucose and lactate values see kittlick and neupert exp path concerning the question of interrelations of mpssynthesis and glycolysis a survey on literature is given our own test results were as follows hypoxia o did not influence mpstotal synthesis depending on cell density the individual mps fractions were different in their reaction to hypoxia hyaluronic acid and heparan sulphate in the mpspattern showed other behaviour than chondroitin sulphate and dermatan sulphate respectively at low cell density hypoxia effectuated increase in hyaluronic acid and decrease in chondroitin sulphate and dermatan sulphate respectively at high cell density hypoxia effectuated decrease in hyaluronic acid and increase in chondroitin sulphate and dermatan sulphate respectively possible relationship to processes in the tissue is discussed
709,the observed static difference spectrum produced by inositol hexaphosphate binding to methemoglobin is the sum of a very fast and a slow spectral transition the more rapid absorbance NC is too fast to be measured by stopped flow techniques whereas the slow NC exhibits a halftime in the range to s from the ph dependence of the rapidly formed difference spectrum and from a series of heme ligand binding studies the rapid phase is interpreted to reflect a localized tertiary conformational change which immediately accompanies inositol hexaphosphate IB and results in a selective increase in spin and reactivity of the beta chain heme groups in contrast the slow phase appears to reflect a first order isomerization process which involves only a small portion less than of the hemoglobin molecules and results primarily in a marked alteration of the spectral properties of the alpha chains with little change in spin while the rapid spectral transition cannot be directly related to the overall quaternary transition which occurs during oxygen binding to ferrous deoxyhemoglobin the slow spectral transition may represent the abortive formation of a deoxyhemoglobin alike conformation which is inhibited in both rate and extent by the presence of water molecules bound to the heme iron atoms
710,experiments were performed on the smooth muscle cells of rabbit a pulmonalis using the microelectrode technique no spontaneous electrical or mechanical activity was recorded in normal krebs solution the currentvoltage relation in these smooth muscle cells showed marked rectification no changes in the P0 were observed due to the anodal or cathodal stimulating currents strong depolarization of the muscle cells produced only local potentials on the cathelectrotone which never developed into a spike noradrenaline gml caused depolarization of the mv in the muscle cell membrane and a considerable contraction of the muscle strip as well under such conditions the contractile apparatus of the muscle cells became sensible to the resting potential level anodal stimulation was accompanied by relaxation of the muscle strip whereas cathodal stimulationby its contraction the alphaadrenoblocking agent phentolamine blocked the effect of noradrenaline evidencing the fact that noradrenaline exerted its excitatory action on the smooth muscle cells of the a pulmonalis through the alphaadrenoreceptors
711,tumor incidence was studied in dimethylhydrazine dmh injected male rats assigned at weaning to isoenergetic caseinsucorse deits containing or protein with or without urea twenty rats fed each diet were given weekly intraperitoneal injections of dmh mgkg body weightweek for the first weeks and were given saline of dmhinjected rats necropsied after weeks were necropsied during the nd or final week of the experiment adenocarcinomas of the small and C1 intestine were larger and significantly more numberous in rats fed and dietary protein keratin producing papillomas of the sebaceous glands of the external ear were observed first at weeks in dmhinjected rats fed protein these were subsequently observed in some rats from all dmhtreated groups as time PD the ear PT increased in size and number in all CG but the greatest incidence was in the group fed protein no PT were observed in salineinjected rats urea FF did not increase the number of PT nor cause changes in ph urease activity or ammonia concentration of contents of the colon or cecum or blood cholesterol as dietary protein increased cecal ammonia concentrations rose while both colon and cecal ph dropped HPB urea and cholesterol reose as dietary protein was increased dmhtreated rats had significantly higher concentrations of colon and cecal ammonia and lower blood cholesterol altough the rats fed protein gained significantly less weight during to weeks of feeding their WG was significantly higher during to weeks no PT were found in rats necropsied at weeks
712,the activities of citrate synthase and nadlinked and nadplinked isocitrate dehydrogenases were measured in nervous tissue from different animals in an attempt to provide more information about the citric acid cycle in this tissue in higher animals the activities of citrate synthase are greater than the sum of activities of the isocitrate dehydrogenases whereas they are similar in nervous tissues from the lower animals this suggests that in higher animals the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction is farremoved from equilibrium if it is assumed that isocitrate dehydrogenase activities provide an indication of the maximum flux through the citric acid cycle the maximum glycolytic capacity in nervous tissue is considerably greater than that of the cycle this suggest that glycolysis can provide SE in excess of the aerobic capacity of the tissue the activities of glu dehydrogenase are high in most nervous tissues and the activities of aspartate aminotransferase are high in all nervous tissue investigated however the MICs of alanine aminotransferase are low in all tissues except the ganglia of the waterbug and cockroach in these insect tissues anaerobic glycolysis may result in the formation of alanine rather than lactate
713,unlike chloroplasts submitochondrial particles are not uncoupled by nigericin kcl or nhcl also the uncoupling effect of lipophilic anions is largely independent of the addition of weak bases low concentrations of permeant anions cause a shift of the steadystate energy level rather than a cycle of energy utilization the degree of inhibition of atp synthesis by tetraphenylboron is larger than required for the uptake of the anion lipophilic anions such as bromthymolblue bromcresolpurple and anilinonapthalene sulphonate cause a phindependent uncoupling in submitochondrial particles at concentrations of and mum respectively the passive interaction of bromthymolblue and bromcresolpurple appears as a phdependent distribution between two phases atp causes a phindependent slight shift in the anion distribution with negligible anion accumulation addition of amines to energized submitochondrial particles results in two types of effects uptake of amines and uncoupling while in chloroplasts amine uptake and uncoupling are closely associated this is not the case in submitochondrial particles the uncoupling effect is observed only with lipophilic and not with hydrophilic amines and the degree of uncoupling increases with the lipophilicity of the amines the amine uptake on the other hand is accompanied by negligible uncoupling while the uptake of amines is dependent on the presence of nonpermeant anions such as cl the uncoupling effect is independent of cl furthermore the amine uncoupling is markedly enhanced by lipophilic anions the view is discussed that the uncoupling effect of lipophilic anions and lipophilic amines in submitochondrial particles is due to a catalytic SE dissipation rather than to a stoichiometry energy utilization the molecular mechanism of uncoupling presumably involves a cycling of charges after a perturbation of the membrane structure
714,a monolayer reaction system employing tripropionin and siliconized glass beads was used to study the effects of TDC and colipase on the catalytic activity interfacial stability and interfacial affinity of porcine PL b ec the stability and catalytic activity of lipase at the beadwater interface are governed by the same two ionizable groups with pka values in the absence of cofactors of and colipase alone or with bile salt caused only a slight perturbation of these values at low concentrations to mm taurodeoxycholate increases the stability of lipase by fold at higher concentrations to mm but still below its critical micelle concentration taurodeoxycholate prevents the adsorption of lipase to the beadwater interface this appears to be the major mechanism by which this bile salt inhibits lipolysis colipase exerts small positive effects on lipase stability and catalytic activity more importantly colipase enables the adsorption of lipase in the presence of bile salt thereby reversing the inhibition
715,cmirex was given iv and po to female rhesus monkeys macaca mulatta and radioactivity was measured in plasma urine and feces at intervals after dosing and in tissues when animals were killed graphical analysis of plots of the logarithm of plasma concentration vs time was used to provide estimates of the values of the firstorder rate constants required by the proposed pharmacokinetic models a basiclanguage program fitkin was used to obtain numerical solutions to the differential equations for each MM and to adjust the estimates to obtain a normalized least squares fit of several models postulated a mammillary fourcompartment opensystem MM providing for the urinary excretion of mirex from a V1 and for the fecal excretion of mirex from a fast tissue compartment yielded theoretical data in agreement with observed values this MM predicted that the accumulation of mirex into fat would be retarded by the presence of a slow tissue compartment so that distribution equilibrium would take about half a year from that time to the end of a year projection little decline in the quantities of mirex was predicted for any compartment sequestration in fat and a lack of metabolism were responsible for the long biological halflife of mirex in the rhesus monkey
716,catecholamines substituted to agarose were synthesized in various ways norepinephrine and isoproterenol were linked to paminobenzamidohexyl agarose by an azo linkage to the catechol ring norepinephrine was also couple to hexyl agaros via the amino group forming an amino guanidino or amido bond biological activity of the immobilized catecholamines was determined by assessing their abilities to interact with adenylate cyclase in several membrane preparations and IN preparations of erythrocytes in dog heart membranes stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the catecholaminegels could be accounted for by leached hormone which had been released from the gels in frog erythrocyte membranes leaching was minimal and no significant stimulation of adenylate cyclase was observed agaroseimmobilized catecholamines however competitively inhibited isoproterenol stimulation of adenylate cyclase in these erythrocyte membranes indicating that catecholamines which are bound to agarose interact with the betaadrenergic receptors as antagonists rather than agonists when tested on IN frog erythrocytes agarose immobilzed catecholamines did not increase the intracellular C2 of cAMP although isoproterenol caused as fold rise in these levels similarly when tested for antagonist activity in the intact cells the agarosecatecholamines failed to inhibit the stimulation of cyclic amp caused by isoproterenol the difference observed in the betaadrenergic antagonist activity of the agarosebound catecholamines in membrane preparations and IN cells can be attributed to steric factors which could have prevented the access of the beadbound ligands with the surface of the cell or to the possibility that receptors might be buried in the membrane matrix
717,the effect of MA of h duration on cardiac output blood pressure HR rate and hepatic and renal blood flow has been studied in the rat in anaesthetized rats blood pressure and heart rate fell linearly with blood ph in both shamoperated and nephrectomized rats there was no significant difference between the two CG in the effect of acidosis on either variable cardiac output showed a significant fall with increasing acidosis in the conscious rat estimated hepatic blood flow in conscious rats showed a significant positive correlation with blood ph in both shamoperated and nephrectomized animals there was no significant difference in estimated hepatic blood flow between the two CG of animals at any blood ph in conscious rats increasing acidosis caused a progressive decrease in estimated renal blood flow it is concluded that the increase in the previously described apparent renal contribution to lactate removal in the acidotic rat cannot be explained by any circulatory effect mediated by the kidney the possible relevance of the findings to lactate homeostasis is discussed
718,lethally irradiated male and female hybrids parental strains and the third party strain a mice were inoculated with reciprocal hybrid marrow from donors of the same sex a graftversushost reaction was produced against hy antigens of reciprocal hybrids although the late mortality in inbred strain males was generally greater than that of females without further tests this difference was not automatically attributable to an x or a y chromosome disparity hybrids did not recognize the qualitative difference in antigenicity of their reciprocals but they were able to recognize the quantitatively greater antigenicity of their parental strains and a hybridversusparental CS reaction occurred the graftversushost reaction in the third party strain a mice was significantly more severe than that produced by hybrid marrow in their reciprocal hybrid recipients but significantly less severe than that produced in the parental strains the relationship between antigenicity and responsiveness was such that the severity of the graftversushost reactions masked the maternal influences observed with other reciprocal hybrids
719,in previous studies it was found that change in the concentrations of ca h and hpo in the incubation medium altered the rates of synthesis of dihydroxyvitamin d ohd by isolated renal mitochondria obtained from ddeficient chicks the present studies demonstrate that raising the medium concentration of k from to mm leads to a fold increase in rate of ohd synthesis by isolated chick mitochondria that the magnitnitude of this kdependent stimulation is enhaced by optimal concentrations of calcium pca and phosphate ppi mm but not by ph from to that the effect is not produced by similar changes in media na concentration and that the stimulatory effect of k is not blocked by ruthenium red and inhibitor of calcium transport and of the calciumdependent stimulation of mitochondrial oh d synthesis it was also found that valinomycin a kspecific ionophore enhanced the sensitivity of the mitochondrial CYP17 activity to k in the presence of valinomycin an increase of pk to was sufficient to cause a significant stimulation of ohd synthesis it was concluded that changes in the ion content of the mitochondrial matrix space regulated the activity of the alphahydroxylase
720,increasing concentrations of chloride were found to increase the resolution between two visible absorbance spectral transitions associated with acidification of ferricytochrome c analysis of a variety of spectral and viscosity measurements indicates that protonation of a single group having an apparent pk of and an intrinsic pk of about displaces the methionine ligand without significantly perturbing the native globular conformation analysis of methylated ferricytochrome c suggests that protonation of a carboxylate ion most likely a heme propionate residue is responsible for MSD of the methionine ligand addition of a proton to a second group having an apparent pk of displaces the histidine ligand and unfolds the protein from a globular conformation into a random coil it is most likely that the second protonation occurs on the imidazole ring of the histidine ligand itself chloride is proposed to perturb these transitions by ligation in the fifth coordination position of the heme ion such ligation stabilizes a globular conformation of ferricytochrome c at ph and degrees
721,the influence of the carbon dioxidebicarbonate buffer system on anaerobic energy production during severe hypoxia was studied in isolated RA hemidiaphragms of rats when the tissue was incubated in a ringer solution containing mm hco aerated with co in n at ph the lactate production and lactate content of the tissue increased at an extracellular tissue bath ph of the lactate production was stimulated when carbon dioxide and bicarbonate were changed to and mm respectively this stimulatory effect disappeared when these values were lowered to and mm at ph the stimulatory effect of the carbon dioxidebicarbonate system persisted when the buffer value was lowered from to mm by changing the system from an open ie continuous gas equilibration to a closed one ie without any gas phase decreasing the glucose in the media from to mm reduced the lactate production and abolished the stimulatory effect of the carbon dioxidebicarbonate system there was no direct effect of this system on the glycolytic enzymes ie lactate production and activity of phosphofructokinase of homogenates
722,the influence of some drugs on the effect of morphine on the threshold pressure required to elicit peristalsis in the guinea pig ileum in situ was studied in order to test the hypothesis that this effect of morphine is mediated by catecholamine PR tachyphylaxis to this effect of morphine was confirmed pretreatemnt with two mgkg doses of reserpine and hrs before the experiment significantly reduced the effect of morphine on the pressure threshold the iv administration of mgkg dldopa reestablished the effect of morphine in reserpinized animals to the level of the UT controls pretreatment with guanethidine mgkg decreased and even prevented this effect of morphine phentolamine i.c.v. mgkg also significantly inhibited the effect of morphine neither dci nor propranolol influenced this morphine effect pretreatment with reserpine guanethidine or phentolamine reduced the basic pressure threshold needed to elicit peristalsis the possibility that the decrease of local circulation induced by hypotenison would reduce the local concentration of morphine was rejected because the same doses of guanethidine or phentolamine did not modify the effect of hexamethonium given iv in this preparation all these results support the idea that the effect of morphine on intestinal peristalsis is mediated by a catecholamine acting on alphareceptors eg norepinephrine
723,dayold male broiler type chicks were used to study the effect of ppm dietary vanadium on fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis and turnover in vivo after feeding the experimental diets for weeks body weight and liver weight of chicks fed ppm vanadium were significantly less than those of the control chicks and liver total lipid and cholesterol tended to be slightly higher than the C2 of the control chicks c acetate was administered intravenously and the specific activities of plasma and liver total lipid cholesterol and fatty acid were determined at and hours T3 the injection plasma total lipid and cholesterol were significantly higher than the levels in the control chicks the rate of incorporation of cacetate into plasma and liver total lipid cholesterol and fatty acid was higher in chicks fed vanadium than the control group at any of the time being tested after the i.t. there was a significant increase in the hepatic CCE activity among chicks fed ppm vanadium whereas there was no significant change in acetate thiokinase activity turnover rate of plasma total lipid and fatty acid in vanadium fed chicks was lower than the control the kcat of plasma cholesterol determined by administering ccholesterol and periodically measuring the TPS activity of plasma cholesterol was higher in chicks fed vanadium than in those fed the basal diet
724,a detailed kinetic analysis has been performed of a multistep inactivation of chloroplasts the kinetic MM suggested involves the formation of cp forms differing in stability and activity a comparison of the kinetic MM with the exp data shows that the mechanism of inactivation of isolated pea chloroplasts consists of at least two forms displaying different activity in the hill reaction and different stability in solution the effect was studied of the nature of the buffer and destruction products on the kinetics of chloroplast inactivation in the process of ageing in phosphate buffer where the concentration of phosphate exceeds mm the effect of the destruction products of chloroplasts on their inactivation is insignificant the ph dependence on the inactivation kinetics suggests that the ph region from to affects only the rapid kinetic process resulting in the increase in the cp activity irreversible inactivation of chloroplasts is phindependent the temperature dependence of the irreversible inactivation kinetics has been studied and the activation parametres of this stage have been determined possible molecular mechanism of the limiting stages of the inactivation of isolated chloroplasts are discussed which can explain the kinetic data obtained
725,the esr mÃ¶ssbauer and visible spectra of the undecapeptide of ferricytochrome c hpp were measured for both the solid peptide and solutions of the peptide at ph and at the low ph the iron exists in the hpp in the HS species at neutral and ALP phs the lowspin ferric species predominate the results of these measurements support the previous suggestions concerning the ligands in the fifth and sixth position of hpp at the neutral and alkaline phs the spectra of lyophilized preparations of hpp show the presence of both high and LS ferric species the T0 of the mÃ¶ssbauer spectra of the lyohilized preparations as function of temperature shows that there exists a spinspin equilibrium between the two spin states the relative amounts of the two components vary with the preparation in these preparations there exist two components one of which exists in the equilibrium mixture and the second in the highspin form
726,patients with cirrhosis of the liver and control patients were studied before and after a protein load g protein per day during one week an eeg was recorded and a visual assessment of frequency pattern was performed venous admixture was estimated during hyperoxia according to the eeg frequency DP the patient group with cirrhosis was subdivided into those with eeg slowing after the protein load n and those without n the following results were obtained resting arterial blood gases did not change in either group there was a significant increase of the aad difference between alveolar p and peripheral arterial p in cirrhotics and controls the increase in aad was significantly larger in those cirrhotics showing eeg slowing compared to those without eeg slowing or to the controls fractional venous admisture increased significantly in those cirrhotics showing eeg slowing there was no significant change in those patients who did not show eeg changes or in the controls
727,activities of choline acetyltransferase chac glutamate decarboxylase gad and IMT hydroxylase th enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of acetylcholine ach gammaaminobutyric acid gaba and catecholamines respectively were measured in the cochlea and cochlear nucleus of the guinea pig chac activity in the OC third turn was pmole ach formedminmg protein chac and was higher than in turn chac chac activity was higher when the preparation included the inner hair cell region than when not gad activity in samples of turn and combined was low nmole gaba formedminmg protein gad all enzymes were low in auditory nerve chac gad and th pmole dopa formedminmg protein in the cochlear nucleus the values were chac gad and th the findings on the CSD of chac activity in the OC fit the hypothesis that the OC nerve fibers are ACh because of low gad in the cochlea gaba is unlikely to be transmitter in the organ of corti similarly it is unlikely that ach gaba or a catecholamine is a transmitter between the AEP nerve and the cochlear nucleus
728,a method is described for the extensive purification of acid deoxyribonuclease acid dnase and its TPS inhibitor from beef liver the existence of which had been only supported by indirect evidence by the use of insolubilized acid deoxyribonuclease eight other proteins interacting with the enzyme have been detected one of them molecular weight was identified as responsible for phosphodiesterase activity which is often a contaminant of dnase preparations acid dnase free of phosphodiesterase and its inhibitor have been obtained as homogeneous proteins as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the molecular weight of acid dnase and its inhibitor are respectively and those of other proteins range from to the properties of beef CL acid dnase are similar to those described for the enzymes extracted from other sources the same alteration of dnase kinetics by this inhibitor as that previously demonstrated with an impure protein has been confirmed the sigmoidal shape observed at ph for the plot of initial rate versus substrate concentration progressively disappears with increasing ph we have also demonstrated that rna which inhibits the acid dnase through a competitive binding to the catalytic site is able like the ATP to reverse the IB of inhibitor to the enzyme
729,receptors for peptide hormones and neurotransmitters are integral components of the plasma membrane of cells which serve to couple the external milieu to the intracellular regulators of metabolism these macromolecules are usually high molecular weight glycoproteins and in many cases appear to have more than one subunit capable of binding the hormone the interaction of the hormone or neurotransmitter with its receptor is rapid reversible and of high affinity and specificity many receptors exhibit cooperative properties in hormone IB or biological function the concentration of receptors on the membrane is a function of continued synthesis and Kd and may be altered by a variety of factors including the hormone itself the fluid mosaic nature of the membrane may allow hormone receptors and effectors to exist in free floating states further investigations of the hormonereceptor interaction will no doubt yield new insights into both the mechanism of hormone action and membrane structure and function
730,the phdependence of the h to h exchange between water and ch CG of purine adenine methyladenine methyladenine hypoxanthine guanine xanthine as well as ch CG of imidazole and benzimidazole was studied it was shown that within the phranges where the majority of molecules under study are nonionized the values of observed rate constant kobs do not depend on ph beyond these ranges the values of kobs are increased or decreased depending on the type of ionizaiton of the compound under study in appropriate ph range the observed ph dependence of the h to h exchange is in a good quantitative agreement with ylide mechanism of the exchange reaction according to this mechanism the hh exchange takes place in nprotonated forms of the purine derivatives and in zwitterions with positive charge on n the ylide mechanism of the exchange reaction is also suggested by the fact that the true exchange rate constants k of protonated forms of the studied compounds calculated from the values of kods rises linearly with the increase of their protonation constant kathe tenfold increase of ka leads to about fourfold rise of k the knowledge of h to h exchange mechanism in ch groups of purine derivatives allows to estimate alterations of reactivity of the purine residues in polynucleotides and nucleic acids depending on their conformation
731,peptide i hpheglyhisphenophealapheome hydrolyzed by chymosin with kcat s and km mm ph inhibited competitively peptide ii hleuserphenonlealaleuome hydrolysis by chymosin with ki mm at ph in REF conditions mm peptide m acetate buffer ph the TPS activities of porcine pepsin and chymosin on peptide i were nm s and nm s per mg of enzyme this difference in specific activity for peptide i allowed development of a chymosinindependent pepsin assay for mixtures of these enzymes in addition peptide ii with a TPS activity of nm s and nm s per mg of porcine pepsin and chymosin provides an alternative to measurement of milk clotting for measurement of chymosin and pepsinlike activities in commercial rennets hydrolysis products of peptide ii by chymosin exhibited one ionized group of apparent pk of and a molar absorption coefficient change of at ph and at nm from measurements of the kinetic constants kcat and km from ph to with peptide ii chymosin activity depends on the protonation of one group of apparent pk in the free enzyme rennet powder proved to be fairly SD T3 a month storage at c within the same period a crystalline chymosin solution kept at c lost to of its activity
732,a group of proteins was readily extracted at neutrality from trichloroacetic acid precipitates of staphylococcal CF supernatants while alphatoxin was dissolved and G1 by treating the precipitate with m urea with acidic buffers or by heating to degrees c at neutrality heat activation of the precipitate produced a relatively pure alphatoxin with a molecular weight of alphatoxin was eluted together with three other proteins on hydroxyl apatite chromatography and evidence was obtained for an association between the four proteins on isoelectric focusing a haemolytic fraction was obtained at ph probably due to acid activation of the precipitate formed at the cathodic end of the column the alphahaemolytic fractions with pis of and were shown to consist of alphatoxin only when analyzed by acrylamide electrophoresis in the presence of SDS the haemolytic component with a pi of contained two additional components of molecular weights of and chromatography of this material on sephadex g showed that alphatoxin and the two proteins appeared as a high molecular complex
733,the graftversushost gvh reactivity of uremic and control SP cells was studied by popliteal CL node assay in the rat the reaction evoked by cells from animals with severe uremia was conspicuously weaker than that evoked by control cells the magnitude of the gvh reaction induced by control cells was directly proportional to dose while with the uremic cells the same increases in dose led only to insignificant increases in the strength of the gvh reaction when mixtures of syngeneic control and uremic cells were used the gvh CR of the control cells was suppressed the activity of uremic spleen cells can be enhanced restored by removal of the subpopulation of cells Ad to glass wool the gvh reaction induced by uremic cells so treated became directly proportional to dose the removal of the Ad cell population from the uremic spleen cell suspension also led to the disappearance of the suppressor effect in mixtures of control and uremic cells these results indicate that a decrease in gvh activity of rat uremic spleen cells is due to an increase in suppressor cell activity in the uremic spleen cell population
734,the adsorption of c alkylated glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle to condensed monolayers of phosphatidic acid was investigated under a variety of conditions the rate constant for association at degrees c depended on ionic strength at imm the rate constant was min at imm it decreased to min the apparent association constant kass for adsorption at imm was x m and was strongly influenced by subphase changes in ph and ionic strength measurements of kass at degrees and degrees c gave a value for the apparent enthalpy change on adsorption of kjmol calculations of the apparent change in free energy and apparent entropy change for the adsorption process gave values of kjmol and jkmol respectively decreasing the amount of phosphatidic acid in the monolayer by replacement with phosphatidylcholine caused the shape of the adsorption isotherm to change from apparent hyperbolic to sigmoid subphase changes in ph or ionic strength did not affect the shape of the adsorption isotherm however adsorption of enzyme on monolayers of phosphatidic acid in the presence of mmcacl was sigmoid in nature it is concluded that glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase binds to condensed charged monolayers by multiple electrostatic interactions at low concentrations of phosphatidic acid in the monolayer or in the presence of ca this occurs in a twostep process and depends on lateral DWI of phosphatidic acid for strong binding to take place
735,the activities of adenylate and guanylate cyclase and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase were determined during the aggregation of human blood platelets with thrombin adp AA acid and EN the activity of guanylate cyclase is altered to a much larger degree than adenylate cyclase while cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterease activity remains unchanged during the early phases of thrombinand adpinduced PLT aggregation a marked activation of the guanylate cyclase occurs whereas aggregation induced by arachidonic acid or epinephrine results in a rapid diminution of this activity in all four cases the adenylate cyclase activity is only slightly decreased when examined under identical conditions platelet aggregation induced by a wide variety of aggregating agents including collagen and platelet isoantibodies results in the PR of only small amounts of guanylate cyclase and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and no adenylate cyclase the guanylate cyclase and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities are associated almost entirely with the soluble cytoplasmic fraction of the platelet while the adenylate cyclase if found exclusively in a membrane bound form adp and epinephrine moderately inhibit guanylate and adenylate cyclase in subcellular preparations while AA and other unsaturated fatty acids moderately stimulate fold the former it is concluded that the activity of PLT guanylate cyclase during aggregation depends on the nature and mode of action of the inducing agent the activity of the membrnae adenylate cyclase during aggregation is independent of the aggregating agent and is associated with a reduction of activity and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase remains unchanged during the process of platelet aggregation and release furthermore these observations suggest a role for unsaturated fatty acids in the control of intracellular cyclic gmp C2
736,using lysozymelysate of micrococcus lysodeikticus cell wall coupled with sepharose several bacteriolytic enzymes were purified from crude S9 of animal and microbial origin quail eggwhite HM and salivary lysozymes ec were adsorbed onto the adsorbent at ph and eluted with m nacl at ph by means of these treatments lysozymes were purified fold with activity recoveries of and the quail lysozyme thus purified was shown to be discelectrophoretically homogeneous some bacteriolytic enzymes of microbial origin were also highly purified by using this affinity adsorbent a bacterial lysozyme from bacillus sp ml showed high affinity for the ligand and was not eluted under the conditions mentioned above but was recovered by elution with m guanidinehcl at ph resulting in a fold increase in the specific activity a pseudomonaslytic enzyme from streptomyces sp p was easily released from the adsorbent by elution with m nacl at ph a staphylolytic f enzyme from s griseus s and a chitinase ec from yam both of which were completely inert toward m lysodeikticus cell wall passed through the adsorbent column a modified ligand in which muramic acid and glucosamine residues were noacetylated failed to adsorb any of these animal and bacterial lysozymes some of the enzymatic properties and bacteriolytic action spectra of these purified enzymes are also described in this paper in comparison with those of hen eggwhite lysozyme
737,lysyl oxidase activity of human normal skins derived from the frontal thighs of subjects showed large variations and the mean value was sd cpmg of wet weight tissue the age of lesion affected the lysyl oxidase activity in postburn scars granulation tissues showed a fairly low activity however the activity increased sharply within months and reached a significantly higher value than that of NS the high level of activity continued for up to years then gradually decreased to normal range after years or so lysyl oxidase activity was detected only after m urea treatment of tissues BZ oxidase activity also showed large variations in both normal skins and postburn scars with mean values of sd and sd mmolg of wet weighth respectively no rho was observed between lysyl oxidase and BZ oxidase MICs the granulation tissues showed significantly high values of benzylamine oxidase activity in contrast to the low values of lysyl oxidase activity
738,three patients with profound hypothermia were treated by rewarming on partial bypass two surivived and have normal mental and metabolic functions the resuscitation of the hypothermic patient should be approached with enthusiasm since the outcome is often much better than expected from initial vital signs and neurologic examination to avoid VVI fibrillation the patient should be handled gently and an effort should be made to keep the patient well oxygenated and the ph normal blood gases should be measured often and corrected for temperature the potassium concentration and hydration status of the patient should also be monitored closely the rewarming of profoundly hypothermic patients can readily be accomplished with a pump oxygenator and heat exchanger the indications for this method are not established from our small experience and the few cases reported in the literature certainly ventricular fibrillation is a compelling indication patients with frozen extremities might also benefit from this method since theoretically tissue salvage would be increased finally those patients who do not respond rapidly to external rewarming may be at less risk of ventricular fibrillation if rewarmed on bypass
739,a simplified system consisting of nadph feadp edta liposomes nadphcytochrome c reductase and tris hcl buffer ph has been employed in studies of the generation of singlet oxygen in nadphdependent microsomal lipid peroxidation the light emitted by the system involves deltag type molecular oxygen identifiable by its characteristic emission spectrum and its SMB with betacarotene the generation of another excited species a compound in the triplet state could be demonstrated in this system by changes of light intensity and emission spectra which arise from photosensitizer dibromoanthracene sulfonate eosin rosebengalmediated energy transfers chemiluminescence in the visible region was markedly quenched by various radical trappers and by an inhibitor of nadphcytochrome c reductase but not by superoxide dismutase during the early stage of lipid peroxidation the intensity of CL was proportional to the square of the concentration of lipid peroxide these characteristics suggest that singlet oxygen and a compound in the triplet state probably a carbonyl compound are generated by a selfreaction of lipid peroxy radicals
740,dihydrofolate reductase has been purified fold to apparent homogeneity from a trimethoprimresistant strain of escherichia coli rt using a procedure that includes methotrexate affinity column chromatography determinations of the molecular weight of the enzyme based on its amino acid composition sedimentation velocity and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis gave values of and respectively an aggregated form of the enzyme with a low specific activity can be separated from the monomer by GF treatment of the aggregate with mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol results in an increase in enzymic activity and a regeneration of the monomer also multiple molecular forms of the monomer have been detected by polyacrylamide gel PACE the unresolved enzyme exhibits two ph optima ph and ph with DHF as a substrate highest activities are observed in buffers containing large OCs in mm imidazolium chloride ph the specific activity is mumol of dihydrofolate reduced per min per mg at degrees folic acid also serves as a ATP with a single ph optimum of ph at this ph the km for folate is mum and the vmax is of the rate observed with DHF as the substrate monovalent cations na k rb and cs inhibit dihydrofolate reductase at a given ionic strength the degree of inhibition is a function of the ionic radius of the cation divalent cations are more potent inhibitors the i of bacl is mum as compared to mm for kcl anions neither inhibit nor activate the enzyme
741,the hypothesis that a neural depressive action is related to the antihypertensive effects of beta blockers has been evaluated in essential hypertensive male patients through the circulatory response to noxious stimuli the pressor reaction to MA was primarily mediated by cardiac stimulation beta receptors activation that to cold by vasoconstriction alpha receptors activation arithmetic and cold were tested to separate the effects of IP beta blackade from possible neural and other influences after propanolol mg per day for wk the baseline pressure was reduced appearance peak and disappearance time of the circulatory reaction to either stimulus was not altered the pressor effect of arithmetic was decreased in an extent proportional to the reduced rise of cardiac output and pressure during cold reached the pretreatment C2 through an augmented increase of V1 resistance our findings indicate that propranolol depresses only the circulatory reactions mediated through beta receptors activation and provide no evidence of effects other than beta blockade
742,the small intestine is a well documented lung in mouse and human gvhd and diarrhea is a prominent part of the clinical gvhd syndrome although a plethora of SVR immune deficits has been documented in gvhd the integrity of the small intestinal immune system has not been investigated a correlation has not been demonstrated between systemic immune dysfuction and the incidence of lymphomas in mouse gvhd survivors if gastrointestinal immune deficiency exists in mouse gvhd its possible relationship to gvhd lymphomas frequently abdominal should be investigated gvhd was produced in newborn bla c blka females x balbc males mice house in a specific pathogenfree environment by the ip inoculation of male balbc spleen cells control mice received syngeneic SP cells twenty gvhd and control mice were sacrificed at weeks and specimens of duodenum were removed for routine histologic and immunofluorescent examination all but one gvhd mouse had virtually absent duodenal iga and igm DU cellular fluorescence was demonstrated in all controls a significant duodenal immunoglobulin deficit has been demonstrated in weekold gvhd mice the relationship of this finding to gvhd diarrhea wasting and neoplasia remains to be determined
743,gammaglutamyl transpeptidase an enzyme that catalyzes gammaglutamyl transfer from gammaglutamyl compounds to amino acid and peptide acceptors and which is known to be localized in the membranes of many epithelial cells was found in a variety of lymphoid cells the lymphoid cell enzyme is located on the cell surface and exhibits substantially the same ATP specificity as the enzyme found in epithelial cells human and rat but not mouse lymphocyte gammaglutamyl transpeptidase was stimulated by treatment of the cells with mitogens normal human peripheral bcells were more AS than tcells but the reverse relationship of activities was found in CLL leukemia lymphocytes human lymphoblastic lines vary markedly in activity in general cell lines with b and tcharacteristics from patients with lymphoproliferative diseases had much lower activities than those of bcell lines derived from normal subjects the highest activity found was in a human myeloma line AS in synthesis of an immunoglobulin light chain the data indicate that gammaglutamyl transpeptidase is a surface marker reflecting differentiation in normal and neoplastic cells
744,shapes of the contractions induced by k acetylcholine ahc histamine and ba consisted of the phasic contraction pc and the subsequent tonic contraction tc pcs by k ach and histamine are initiated by the release and the passive influx of ca whereas that by ba is only initiated by the release of ca tcs by k ach and histamine are maintained by the AS influx of ca whereas that by ba is maintained by the active influx and the release of ca storage sites of ca in the cell membrane of this preparation can be divided into three the first the second and the third which contain the loosely the less loosely and the tightlybound ca respectively k releases ca to elicit contraction from the first division ach or histamine does so from the first and second divisions and ba does so from all of the three divisions based on the influence of high kdepolarizing bath solution on the relaxations by isoproterenol iso and papaverine pap and the effects of iso and pap on the shapes of contractions by k ach ba and exogenous ca the following assumptions were made antispasmodic action of iso is produced by inhibition of cell membrane inhibition of release and influx of ca whereas that by pap is due to this inhibition followed by inhibition of the muscle contractile system with the increase of concentrations the effects of iso and pap on the concentrationaction curves of the contractions by k ach ba and exogenous catable ii suggest that the parallel shift to the right of the curves of k ach and ba is due to the PET antagonism between the antispasmodics and the mobilization of ca produced by the contracting agents
745,six patients not previously treated with CP seropositive RA arthritis and highly AS synovitis of one or both knee joints were treated with g of benorylate suspension twice daily for a period of days prior to synovectomy blood samples were taken at scheduled times during administration of the drug at operation synovial fluid and tissue samples were taken and their salicylate paracetamol and benorylate content measured plasma levels of salicylate and paracetamol were in GA significantly higher than the concentration of these metabolites in the synovial fluid benorylate was found in the synovial tissues concentrated especially in the highly inflamed synovial villi it is probable that benorylate and its metabolites penetrate the synovia but further studies are needed to determine if the metabolites are concentrated in the different synovial cell layers in the same way as benorylate itself it is possible that part of the clinical effect of benorylate is due to its presence in the synovial tissue and that it has a direct effect in vivo on the synovial membrane it is also possible that the pharmacokinetic properties of benorylate permit it to enter cell layers inaccessible to its metabolites
746,an endopolygalacturonic acid transeliminase ec released by osmotic shock of erwinia rubrifaciens cells has been purified to near homogeneity fold by column chromatography on diethylaminoethylcellulose phosphocellulose and hydroxyapatitecellulose followed by isoelectric focusing it has a molecular weight of sw of s an isoelectric point of ph ph optimum of and a temperature optimum of c and requires ca with an optimum concentration of to mm mg could not substitute for ca tyrosinyl residues seem essential for enzyme catalysis based on rapid inactivation by tetranitromethane the enzyme prefers unmethylated polygalacturonic acid as the ATP cleaving alphaglycosidic linkages randomly to form unsaturated galacturonides at a vmax of mumol of productmin per mg of protein and a km of mg of polygalacturonic acid per ml over of the enzyme activity is released from osmotically shocked e rubrifaciens cells unlike e rubrifaciens transeliminase is not released from erwinia carotovora cells by osmotic shock treatment but enzyme activity is detected in the culture medium the PR of the enzyme is reduced fivefold by the addition of dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate the hypersensitive reaction in tobacco leaves was induced within min T3 injection of less than mug of purified e rubrifaciens transeliminase single cells of tobacco in suspension SC are readily killed by the enzyme whereas tobacco protoplasts remain unaffected when treated in the same manner these results indicate that endopolygalacturonic acid transeliminase is a constitutive enzyme possibly located in the periplasmic space of the e rubrifaciens cell and releases enzyme into the culture medium in the presence of ATP the release of the enzyme in tobacco tissue and the transeliminative cleavage of plant cell wall components may be steps leading to hypersensitivity of the tobacco tissue
747,experiments carried out to examine the effects of nicotine and tar on the extent of and subjective reactions to cigarette smoking it was confirmed that sm rate commercial lownicotine cigarettes as less strong and less satisfying than their usual brands since such cigarettes deliver reduced amounts of tar as well as of NIC an experiment to distinguish between the two was carried out with special cigarettes ratings of strength were directly related to nicotine but were not affected by tar the numbers of cigarettes smoked fell slightly as their estimated delivery of NIC increased but tar had no effect on this index the urinary excretion of nicotine was correlated with the rated yields of NIC for the different cigarettes but there was also evidence that subjects tended to adjust their manner of smoking so as to titrate their doses of NIC the results are interpreted as indicating a role for nicotine but not for tar in the maintenance of cigarette smoking behavior and as support for the view that less harmful cigarettes should have a high yield of nicotine relative to tar
748,when rats were exposed to immobilized cold stress adrenaline content in the adrenal gland as well as noradrenaline content in the BS were reduced drastically while noradrenaline content in the atria was not altered by the application of AS oral administrations of taurine gkgday for days prevented the stressinduced decline of adrenaline in the adrenal gland and this preventive effect could not be duplicated by the administration of lisoleucine or MET in hypophysectomized rats the AS also induced a significant fall in adrenaline content of the adrenal gland however taurine administration did not show significant preventive effects on the decline in adrenal CAs the immobilized cold stress induced a significant increase in blood sugar and this increase was antagonized by pretreatment with taurine taurine had no significant effects on the stressinduced increase in the activity of adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase and the turnover rate of adrenaline in the adrenal gland measured by the rate of decline of this amine following alphamethyltyrosine administration the administration of taurine in both in vivo and in vitro inhibited the release of adrenaline from adrenal medullary LG but that of dopaminebetahydroxylase was not significantly affected the stressinduced elevation of the blood level of corticosterone was not affected by taurine administration these findings indicate that taurine antagonizes the stressinduced elevation of blood sugar by reducing adrenaline output from the adrenal gland the regulatory mechanism most likly involves the inhibition of adrenaline release from adrenal medullary granules possibly by stabilizing the membrane of the granules
749,injection of an homogenate of identified neuron r into the hemocele of aplysia produced a weight increase of within min control injections of several other identified neurons or of seawater were ineffective the weight increase occurred even when the animals were maintained in hyperosmotic seawater the activity of the r TH was retained after acidification to ph and heating to degrees c but activity was destroyed by proteolytic digestion with pronase dialysis in cellulose dialysis tubing resulted in a significant loss of aion on sephadex g nominal exclusion limits daltons activity was present in the partially included volumes but was absent in the totally excluded or totally included volumes the data support the notion that r contains one or more hormones involved in ionic regulation or water balance the results of bioassays of r extracts subjected to different treatments are consistent with the hypothesis that activity is due to one or more SD polypeptides of relatively low molecular weight
750,transmitter PR r at a synpase in aplysia californica can be analyzed in terms of a model with the following parameters a the available pool of transmitter f the fraction of available pool released by a presynaptic action potential m the rate of transmitter mobilization into the available pool d the rate constant of demobilization of transmitter from the available pool in the present paper we show that beginning with an analysis of the recovery from depression of the second of a pair of disolated epsps separated by a series of intervals of about sec and assuming that the recovery is due to refilling of a depleted a it is possible to estimate resting equilibrium values of these parameters changes in these parameters when a new equilbrium state is reached after prolonged stimulation eg stimuli at sec can then be quantitatively determined the increased rate of transmitter release observed during and T3 repetitive stimulation is the consequence of increases in f and m with changes in a passively following and there are significant correlations among certain resting parameters and between the values of certain resting parameters and these parameters upon stimulation preparations with a C1 resting f tend to have a relatively small resting a S9 with a large resting f or m tend to increase these less with stimulation than preparations with smaller resting values of these parameters preparations with large stimulusdependent increases in f tend to have large stimulusdependent increases in m
751,since immunological events were found to be pathogenetically involved in various forms of glomerulonephritis CSs and immunosuppressive drugs were introduced in the treatment of nephritis however as opposed to the findings in the paediatric nephrotic syndrome controlled and multicentric trials with IS therapy revealed disappointing results in the management of renal disease in adults significantly better results under IS therapy were seen only in the nephrotic syndrome based on the socalled no changes or minimal changes nephritis in chronic membranous and PGN the clinical course in the treated group was not statistically different from that of the untreated group in some disorders of connective tissues such as systemic lupus erythematosus polyarteritis nodosa and wegeners granulomatosis corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents seem to exert a favourable effect on the course of renal disease encouraging results concerning the combined use of IS drugs anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors in mesangiocapillary membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and rapidly progressive nephritis have also been presented several factors such as incomplete IS druginduced antigen tolerance and increased immune complex formation as a consequence of inhibited antibody production may contribute to the fact that many patients with different forms of nephritis do not benefit from longterm immunosuppressive therapy
752,the phdependence is considered of a reaction between e and s that proceeds through an intermediate es under briggshaldane conditions ie there is a Css in es and so greater than et where so is the initial concentration of s and et is the total concentration of all forms of e reactants and intermediates are assumed to interconvert in three protonic states e equilibrium es eh equilibrium ehs eh equilibrium ehs but only ehs provides products by an irreversible reaction whose rate constant is kcat protonations are assumed to be so fast that they are all at equilibrium the rate equation for this model is shown to be v dpdt kcatetsoakmbcda so where km is the usual assembly of rate constants around ehs and ad are functions of the form hk kh in which k and k are in a the molecular ionization constants of es in b the analogous constants of e in c and d apparent ionization constants composed of molecular ionization constants of e or es and assemblies of rate constants as in earlier treatments of this type of reaction which involve either the assumption that the reactants and intermediate are in equilibrium or the assumption of peller alberty j am chem soc that only eh and ehs interconvert directly the phdependence of kcat is determined only by a the phdependence of km is determined in general by bcad but when reactants and intermediate are in equilibrium c identical to d and this expression simplifies to ba the phdependence of kcatkm ie of the rate when so less than km is not necessarily a simple bellshaped curve characterized only by the ionization constants of b but is a complex curve characterized by dbc various situations are discussed in which the phdependence of kcatkm is determined by assemblies simpler than dbc the special situation in which a kcatkmph profile provides the molecular pka values of the intermediate es complex is delineated
753,a method for determination of HFA fiat and gl gliat incorporation into AT in vitro in needle biopsy specimens of human fat has been developed mg of subcutaneous fat is incubated in an albumin buffer containing a physiological spectrum and concentration of fatty acids and glucose release of glycerol and fatty acids to the incubation medium and incorporation of labelled palmitic acid and labelled glucose into extracted AT lipids are determined simultaneously the labelled fatty acids are found in the fatty acid part and the labelled gl only in the glycerol part of extracted diglycerides and triglycerides these glycerides are completely recovered and indicated fiat and gliat values methodological errors for all vaiables are about all processes increase linearly with tissue weight and incubation time fiat and gliat increase linearly with increasing concentration of a physiological spectrum of fatty acids constant fractional incorporation the method is simple and several analyses from one subject can be performed on one day with a minimum of discomfort to the patient
754,interactions between the benzodiazepine derivatives diazepam and oxazepam and the narcotic analgesics morphine and methadone were evaluated on locomotor activity and in the tailflick and HP tests for analgesia in the mouse the doserelated stimulation of locomotor activity by morphine was reduced by diazepam and OX at doses which alone had no effect on locomotor activity however only oxazepam reduced the doserelated stimulation of locomotor activity by methadone the observed decreases produced by diazepam and oxazepam were comparable in magnitude to those produced by naloxone stimulation of locomotor activity by damphetamine was not affected by either diazepam or OX doseresponse curves for locomotor activity were also determined with morphine and methadone administered intraventricularly as before diazepam and naloxone given ip decreased the stimulation of locomotor activity produced by morphine but only naloxone affected methadonestimulated locomotor activity neither diazepam oxazepam nor naloxone reduced the BB or plasma levels of hmorphine or hmethadone in contrast to the results on locomotor activity neither of these benzodiazepines significantly modified the doseresponse curves of morphine or MTD in either test for analgesia the mechanisms involved in the observed interactions on locomotor activity may be related to the influences of benzodiazepines and narcotic analgesics on motor efferent pathways summating in such a manner as to interfere with the ability of the mice to locomote the present results demonstrate that prominent interactions occur between members of the benzodiazepine and narcotic analgesic classes these interactions are dependent upon both the specific combination of drugs administered and upon the test procedure
755,the effect of surface charge upon the kinetics of monovalent cation translocation via a twosite mechanism is investigated theroretically according to the model dealt with typical relations are expected for the dependence of the kinetic parameters of the translocation process upon the concentration of a polyvalent cation differing essentially from those derived for the case in which the membrane carries no excess charge even when a polyvalent cation does not compete with the substrate cation for IB to the translocation sites apparently competitive inhibition may occur when the membrane is negatively charged the model is tested experimentally by studying the effects of the polyvalent cations mg sr ca ba and al upon rb uptake into yeast cells at ph a good applicability is found equimolar concentrations of polyvalent cations reduce the rate of the rb uptake into yeast cells in the order mg less than sr less than ca less than ba less than al the conclusion is reached that the reduction in the rate of rb uptake caused by the polyvalent cations applied results mainly from screening of the negative fixed charges on the membrane surface and binding to these negative CS rather than competition with rb for the transport sites the results of our investigation indicate the affinity of the alkalineearth cations for the negative fixed charges on the surface to the yeast cell membrane increases in the orther mg less than sr less than ca less than ba probably mainly phosphoryl CG determine the net charge on the membrane of the yeast cell at a medium ph of
756,soluble succinate dehydrogenase prepared by butanol SE reacts with nethylmaleimide according to firstorder kinetics with respect to both remaining AS enzyme and the inhibitor concentration binding of the sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme prevents its alkylation by nethylmaleimide and inhibition by oxaloacetate a kinetic analysis of the inactivation of alkylating reagent in the presence of succinate or malonate suggests that nethylmaleimide acts as a sitedirected inhibitor the apparent firstorder rate constant of alkylation increases between ph and indicating a pka value for the enzyme sulfhydryl group equal to at degrees c in mm trissufate buffer certain anions phosphate citrate maleate and acetate decrease the CR of the enzyme towards the alkylating reagent succinatephenazine methosulfate reductase activity measured in the presence of a saturating concentration of succinate shows the same phdependence as the alkylation rate by nethylmaleimide the mechanism of the first step of succinate oxidation including a nucleophilic attack of substrate by the activesite sulfhydryl group is discussed
757,the oxidationreduction potential e for the couple Ox lipoamide dehydrogenaseelectron reduced lipoamide dehydrogenase has been determined by measurement of equilibria of these enzyme species with lipoamide and dihydrolipoamide or with Ox and reduced azine dyes e is v at ph and deltaedeltaph is v in the ph range to values for e the oxidationreduction potential for the couple electron reduced enzymeelectron reduced enzyme were obtained from measurements of the extent of dismutation of electron reduced enzyme to form mixtures containing oxidized and electron reduced enzyme e is v at ph and deltaedeltaph is v in the ph range to spectra of oxidized enzyme and electron reduced enzyme do not show variations with ph over this range but the spectrum of the electron reduced enzyme is phdependent with the molar extinction at nm changing from m cm at ph to m cm at ph the phdependent changes which are observed in the absorption properties of the electron reduced enzyme are consistent with the disappearance of a charge transfer complex between an amino acid side chain and the oxidized flavin at the lower ph values with the apparent pk of the side chain at ph it has been suggested that the nm absorbance of electron reduced enzyme is due to a charge transfer complex between thiolate anion and Ox flavin and we propose that the thiolate anion is stabilized by interaction with a protonated base the thermodynamic data predict that the amount of electron reduced enzyme formed when the enzyme is reduced by excess nadh will be phdependent with the greatest amounts seen at low ph values these data support earlier evidence matthews rg wilkinson kd ballou dp and williams ch jr in flavins and flavoproteins singer tp ed pp elsevier scientific publishing co amsterdam that the role of nad in the nadhlipoamide reductase reaction catalyzed by lipoamide dehydrogenase is to prevent accumulation of inactive electron reduced enzyme by simple reversal of the reduction of electron reduced enzyme by nadh
758,administration of cortisol to fetal rabbits resulted in a inhibition of pulmonary de novo fatty acid synthesis from acetyl coenzyme a coa p less than this was associated with inhibition of acetylcoa carboxylase ec activity p less than and a tendency towards decreased activity of FAS there was no effect on pulmonary microsomal HFA elongation activity CS and electron microscopic examination of the apex of the right lung of control and cortisoltreated animals revealed changes consistent with accelerated lung maturation in the treated animals the in vitro activities of acetylcoa carboxylase and FAS were similar in rb lung and thus acetylcoa carboxylase activity does not appear to be rate limiting for de novo fatty acid synthesis in lung no significant change in the activity of enzymes associated with de novo HFA synthesis of microsomal fatty acid elongation was found in fetal brain T3 cortisol exposure however in a parallel study on fatty FAS in fetal liver cortisol administration resulted in a increase in FAS activity p less than the finding of cortisolinduced inhibition of de novo HFA synthesis in fetal rabbit lung may be related to the known GABA effect of cortisol on lung growth in the fetus
759,ninetynine percent nenriched flavins were synthesized and their proton decoupled n resonances were observed the enriched EDC were nriboflavin nriboflavin nriboflavin phosphate nriboflavin phosphate and n flavin adenine dinucleotide n lumiflavin and n lumichrome by comparison of their spectra and from th nuclear overhauser effect data each n resonance peak could be assigned to each n nucleus the order of the chemical shifts well corresponds to that of the calculated pielectron densities the n nucleus gives the most intense inverted peak and the n nucleus a small noninverted peak by changing ph from neutral to ALP the chemical shift and the intensity of signal were mostly affected in the n resonance of riboflavin phosphate the n signal of flavin adenine CpG showed a fairly C1 downfield shift with the increase of temperature these observations can be well interpreted by the chemical structure and the proposed conformation of riboflavin phosphate and FAD
760,the dissociation constants ka values of NE lne and seven other agonists acting on alpha adrenergic receptors in rabbit aorta strips were determined by analysis of concentrationresponse data before and after fractional inactivation of receptors with dibenamine in experiments to determine ka values propranolol was added to block activation of beta receptors and cocaine to block the neuronal uptake mechanism the ka of lne and the ka of a second agonist when determined on paired strips from the same aorta were used to calculate the relative affinity and the relative efficacy er of the second agonist as compared to lne the validity of the method used for determining ka and er values was supported by the following findings the dissociation constant kb of the competitive antagonist phentolamine determined with each of the agonists was the same as that determined with lne the ka determined for lne was independent of the fraction of active receptors remaining q after i.c.v. with different concentrations of dibenamine the kb of phentolamine determined with lne as the agonist was the same before and after fractional inactivation of receptors T3 inactivation in paired strips by equal exposures to dibenamine the q value determined with each agonist was the same as that determined with lne the mean ka value for lne was x m the mean relative affinities of the agonists for the alpha receptor were lne lepinephrine lphenylephrine lnorphenylephrine epinine dopamine lalphamethylnorepinephrine dlalphaethylnorepinephrine the mean er of each agonist was not significantly different from that of lne except for lnorphenylephrine with an e of and dlalphaethylnorepinephrine with an er of the results are discussed from the standpoint of structureactivity relationships
761,purine nucleoside phosphorylase and adenosine deaminase ada were studied in normal red blood cells and lymphocytes and in the cells of a family with a child with a defective tcelland normal bcell immunity in the propositus no purine nucleoside phosphorylase np activity could be detected in her CRC and lymphocytes while the ada activity was somewhat increased the np activities of the father mother and brother of the propositus are in the nu/+ range the decreased activity of np was not only found for the substrate inosine but also when guanosine or xanthosine were used as substrate the mode of inheritance is AR with ST gel electrophoresis no np activity could be detected in the patients haemolysate the electrophoretic patterns of np from the father mother and brother of the patient seem to be the same as for normal np with six bands of np activity the nucleoside phosphorylases of the father mother and brother of the patient were characterized by an increased km for the ATP inosine normal ph optimum and a decreased heat stability
762,following treatment with RES or alternatively with a combination of phenothiazines randolektil majeptil a druginduced parkinsonoid reaction was provoked in rats twenty min before decapitation muci dglucosecu was i.v. concentration and radioactivities of glutamic acid glu glutamine gln serine ser and glycine gly were assayed in some regions of brain and in CL separation was performed by a combination of paper electrophoresis and chromatography or by an automatic amino acid analyzer after reserpine the concentrations of serine and glycine were increased tenfold while their specific MICs decreased by the same factor the interconversion serineglycine was not affected the concentration of glutamic acid was reduced while its specific activity remained constant T3 phenothiazines the concentrations of serine and glycine in brain were also increased but their specific activities were decreased to a different degree this indicates an additional effect on the serinesynthesis from glucose the interconversion serineglycine was also altered the concentration of glutamic acid was decreased but specific activity was constant except in the thalamus region tested the influence of both treatments on CAA turnover in CL differed from the observed impairment of brain metabolism possible correlations between the changes in amino acid metabolism catecholamines and the neurologic parkinsonian PS are discussed

765,distribution of a new betaadrenergic blocking agent hcarteolol in mice was studied by whole body autoradiography the CSD of radioactivity was observed in all organs except the eyes and brain with particularly high specific activities in the kidneys liver gall bladder and content in the intestines within a short time after either oral or intravenous administration the radioactivity was then promptly eliminated from all tissues and organs and excreted almost entirely in the urine and bile propranolol is known to be distributed at a high concentration in the brain whereas the concentration of h carteolol detectable in the brain was slight in the adrenal gland the radioactivity was localized in the medulla radioactivity was detected also in the stomach contents after the i.v. the distribution of radioactivity in the fetus through the placenta was less than that in the major organs of the mother mouse and the beta of the activity was more rapid in the fetus than in mother these findings indicate that carteolol and its metabolites do to some extent pass through the bloodbrain barrier and placenta
766,the prompt recognition and management tables and of chemical burns of the upper extremity may prevent injury to the deep structures of the hand and may make the difference between satisfactory rehabilitation and crippling deformities immediate irrigation with water is the single most important treatment that can be carried out and should be continued for at least an hour and often for several hours depending on the severity of the injury precious time should not be wasted hunting for a specific neutralizing agent hydrofluoric acid injuries and phosphorus injuries are the two exceptions to this principle T3 copious irrigation and dÃ©bridement small superficial burns may be treated without dressings or topical therapy large partialthickness burns are best treated with sulfamylon burn cream and then with with biologic dressings until healing is achieved fullthickness injuries of limited extent should be excised and skingrafted to regain maximum function and more extensive burns treated in a nonexicisional regimen
767,we have examined the bacteriochlorophyll reactioncenter complex of chlorobium limicola f thiosulfatophilum strain tassajara our results indicate that the midpoint potential of the primary electron donor bacteriochlorophyll of the reaction center is mv at ph while that of cytochrome c is mv there are two cytochrome c hemes per reaction center and the lightinduced oxidation of each is biphasic t of less than mus and approximately mus we belive that this indicates a two state equilibrium with each cytochrome heme being either close to or a little removed from the reactioncenter bacteriochlorophyll we have also titrated the primary electron acceptor of the reaction center its equilibrium midpoint potential at ph is below mv this is very much lower than the previous estimate for green bacteria and also substantially lower than values obtained for purple bacteria such a lowpotential primary acceptor would be thermodynamically capable of direct reduction of nad via ferredoxin in a manner analagous to PS i in chloroplasts and bluegreen algae
768,plasma levels of chlorpromazine cpz of its metabolites and prolactin were measured repeatedly in chronic schizophrenic patients the patients were studied while on chronic PTZ medication chlorpromazine in other phenothiazines in during weeks on placebo and during weeks of cpz treatment the findings were compared with those obtained during acute cpz treatment in patients who had received similar cpz doses but no previous longterm phenothiazine medication plasma cpz levels were similar in the chronic and the acute CG and so was their relation to dose in neither group was therapeutic effect related to plasma cpz level in these chronic patients in contrast to findings during acute cpz treatment neither prolactin level nor the appearance of parkinsonian symptoms was related to plasma drug level in the chronic group both these effects were less pronounced during the period on cpz which followed the placebo than were the corresponding effects during cpz treatment in the acute group since plasma cpz levels of the two groups were similar these differences may be due to an acquired tolerance of the nervous system to some of the antidopaminergic effects of the drug
769,the effect of dlpropranolol on diethoxycarbonyldihydrocollidineinduced exp porphyria was studied dlpropranolol a betaadrenergic blocking agent with nonspecific membrane effects partially inhibited diethoxycarbonyldihydrocollidineinduced deltaaminolevulinate synthetase activity both in rats and in chick embryo liver cells in SC in rats dlpropranolol decreased urinary ALA and porphobilinogen but no change occurred in the h urinary excretion of total porphyrins and in the concentration of porphyrins in the liver in cultured chick embryo liver cells treated with DDC dlpropranolol decreased accumulation of porphyrins in the medium dpropranolol oxprenolol and quinidine acted like dlpropranolol in chick embryo CL cells in culture treated with diethoxycarbonyldihydrocollidine pindolol practolol and lidocaine had no effect phenobarbitone had a synergistic effect on the induction of ALA synthetase by DDC in cultures of chick embryo liver cells this induction was partially inhibited by propranolol however the increased accumulation of porphyrins in the medium caused by diethoxycarbonyldihydrocollidine was inhibited by the addition of phenobarbitone this inhibited induction was further decreased by propranolol most of our results indicate that the drugs tested act mainly by their effects on membranes
770,BPM vesicles were isolated from a subline of l mouse fibroblasts grown on defined medium in the absence of serum these vesicles were not significantly contaminated by mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum the isolation procedure a modification of that originally developed by mckeel and jarett mckeel dw and jarett l j cell biol employs mechanical homogenization in isotonic medium followed by differential centrifugation the resultant plasma membrane vesicles take up radioactivity when exposed to uniformly labeled nucleosides two subfractions of the plasma membrane were isolated distinguished by their differing activity of nucleotidase and nakstimulated atpase two well known plasma membrane enzyme markers uptake of nucleoside radioactivity was extensively studied in one subfraction it was linear with time and membrane concentration over ranges used for the studies apparent km values for uptake of radioactivity from adenosine inosine and UR were mum respectively uptake of radioactivity from all three nucleosides exhibits a broad ph optimum from ph to ph but falls off rapidly at lower ph nethylmaleimide was an effective inhibitor of uptake of radioactivity from all three nucleosides uptake of radioactivity from uridine is more sensitive than uptake of radioactivity from the purine nucleosides adenosine inhibited uptake of radioactivity from inosine more than from uridine inosine inhibited the uptake of radioactivity from adenosine but uridine did not caffeine and methylaminopurine riboside nmethyladenosine differentially inhibit uptake of radioactivity from adenosine and inosine and thus the vesicles apparently possess seperate transport systems for uptake of radioactivity from purine nucleosides and from UR
771,when grown in a mineral medium with yeast PCW or yeast glucan as the sole carbon source bacillus circulans wl produces walllytic enzymes in addition to nonlytic beta leads to and beta leads to glucananases the lytic enzymes were isolated from the SC liquid by adsorption on insoluble yeast glucan in batch operation after digestion of the glucan the mixture of enzymes was chromatographed on hydroxylapatite on which the lytic activity could be resolved into one lytic beta leads to glucanase and two lytic beta leads to glucanase was further purified by chromatography over diethylaminoehtylagarose and carboxymethyl cellulose its specific activity on pustulan was units per mg of protein the enzyme moved as a single protein with a molecular weight of during SDS electrophoresis in slab gels hydrolysis of pustulan went thorugh a series of oligosaccharides leading to a mixture of gentiotriose gentiobiose and glucose the enzyme also produced small amounts of gentiobiose from laminarin and pachyman and on this basis its lytic activity on yeast cell wallswas attribut beta leads to linked oligosaccharides were not detected the lytic beta leads to glucanase has an optimum ph of pustulan hydrolysis followed michaelismenten kinetics a km of mg pustulan per ml and a v of microequivalents of glucose releasedmin per mg of enzyme were calculated the enzyme has no metal ion requirement the lytic beta leads to glucanase differs in essence from the nonlytic beta leads to glucanase of the same organism by its positive action on yeast PCW and yeast glucan and its much lower specific activity on soluble pustulan
772,twelve unselected males suffering from documented coronary insufficiency and moderately severe angina submitted to graded multistage treadmill ET on separate days hr after a single dose of or mg of acebulolol a cardioselective beta blocker control measures included random allocation of patients to each of balanced sequences of administration standardized doubleblind conditions and variance analysis for latinsquare design with repeated measures on each subject performance was evaluated by measuring time elapsed until anginal pain peak heart rate peak product of heart rate and blood pressure and peak oxygen consumption mean values for all criteria were significantly atered by mg of acebutolol seven out of twelve patients were classified as responders ie exercise duration increased or more the response T3 AC was correlated with the performance on PL in the base of exercise duration peak heart rate and peak product of heart rate and blood pressure it is concluded that performance criteria are useful predictors of response to beta blockade and acebutolol is a potent antianginal agent when judged by an objective treadmill exercise test
773,in previous reports methamphetamine was shown to depress tyrosine hydroxylase th activity in the rat CS to evaluate further the mechanism of this decrease in th activity CEA was measured in the rat corpus striatum and substantia nigra after repetitive and singledose methamphetamine administration following repeated doses of methamphetamine nigral th activity decreased and reached of controls at hr and returned to normal at hr striatal th activity decreased to of control at hr and returned toward normal at hr when methamphetamine was administered every hr for hr and then discontinued nigral th activity returned toward control levels days prior to recovery of striatal th activity methamphetamine initially increased striatal dopamine C2 at hr of control dopamine C2 then decreased in parallel with striatal th activity but failed to increase as the enzyme recovered concurrent administration of chlorpromazine with methamphetamine prevented the methamphetamineinduced decrease in nigral and striatal th activity and striatal dopamine C2 the results indicate that the methamphetamineinduced depression of striatal and nigral th activity may be related to increased stimulation of dopamine receptors in the striatum
774,uptake of the hepatodiagnostic dye BSP into isolated HCs was studied with special regard to the kinetics of transport the following results were obtained the uptake of BSP follows michaelismenten kinetics only at low substrate concentrations with an apparent km mum and v nmol x mg protein x min at higher BSP concentrations a second mechanism of uptake is observed as indicated by the deviation from linearity in the lineweaverburk plot the activation energy of uptake was found to be kcalmol at mum bromosulfophtalein uptake is independent of metabolic energy and of the na gradient across the membrane taurocholate does not inhibit uptake while indocyanine green inhibits competitively at low bromosulfophthalein concentrations and activates uptake at high bromosulfophthalein concentrations greater than mum CAA reagents such as dinitrofluorobenzene mersalyl nethylmaleimide and dithionitrobenzene which modify specific PET groups did not affect uptake at a concentration of mum no ph optimum for BSP uptake was observed in the physiological ph range adsorption of BSP to the CL cell membrane has two distinguishable CS with affinities k x m and k x m and binding capacities n nmolmg protein and n nmolmg protein adsorption is inhibited by indocyanine green the results do not indicate the mediation of bromosulfophthalein uptake by a carrier protein and are consistent with the hypothesis that bromosulfophthalein is bound in an energyconsuming process to a translocating site possibly in the undissociated form or as ion pair the consecutive transfer across the membrane appears to require little additional energy
775,tolerogenic doses of hapten DNP dnpcoupled type pneumococcal polysaccharide dnplyss totally abolished the antidnp rosetteforming cell rfc response to primary immunization with dnphemocyanin in mice while lightly substituted antigen dnplyss had little effect both antigens suppressed secondary antidnp rfc responses to dnpklh limiting doses of dnplyss preferentially suppressed antibodysecreting cell levels and had less effect on rfc dnplyss was fold more potent in blockading primary rfc in vitro than dnplyss whereas both antigens were equally ERP in blocking AA rfc these results suggest that the sensitivity of primed b lymphocytes to inactivation by dnplyss is related to their high avidity for antigen furthermore this appears to be largely due to a high density of immunoglobulin receptors on primed cells since the affinities of primary and AA rfc for monovalent hapten were indistinguishable treatment of primarily immunized mice with dnplyss h before CA abolished of rfc therefore the reduction in rfc levels in tolerant mice may be due to cellular blockade by persisting tolerogen however it seems unlikely that simple blockade of antigenreactive cells is the sole mechanism operative in this system
776,the safety and efficacy of halothane anaesthesia were investigated in caesarean sections using halothane added to a mixture of no o the administration of HAL was initiated before intubation and terminated immediately prior to delivery only one patient reported memories from the operation the mean apgar score min after delivery was significantly better than that in caesarean sections in which a mixture of no o was used in caesarean sections the halothane concentrations were examined after halothane had been given for exactly min after intubation it was found that halothane reached and passed the placenta T3 only min the levels in the maternal i.a. and umbilical vein were comparable the levels in the maternal artery maternal vein and umbilical vein were markedly higher than in the umbilical i.a. which indicated an accumulation of halothane in the foetal tissues however due to the vigour of the newborn halothane concentrations min T3 birth were very low the halflife of HAL in the maternal circulation was approximately min with the described method of administration blood gas determinations which were made in seven newborns proved satisfactory
777,the reaction between carboxyhemoglobin and reduced microperoxidase mp hbco mphb mpco recently reported by us has been further studied by generating species hbco hbco and hbco in the stopped flow cuvette by the reaction of dithionite with the species of the general formula hboxcoyx y in the presence of microperoxidase it has been possible to determine the stepwise co dissociation rate constants l l l and l the overall co dissociation rate constant l which is the same in this system as l is not affected by diphosphoglyceric acid the activation SE of the reaction is cal in degrees range the ratio deltaldeltaph is approximately in to ph range the kinetic data indicate that compared to hbo the contribution to the cooperativity of the dissociation rate constants of carboxyhemoglobin is greatly reduced the liganddependent differences in the reactions of hb with co o and no suggest that in the combination reactions the ligand plays an AS role in the ratelimiting step
778,the development of obesity hyperinsulinemia and six hepatic lipogenic enzymes in avya mice were compared to that in aa mice correlation between body weight liver weight plasma insulin concentration and activities of hepatic enzymes was analyzed in the avya mice body weight CL weight and PI level increased steadily as the mice aged in the aa mice the change of these three parameters was much slower plasma insulin concentration in aa mice did not increase until eight months of age compared with aa mice avya mice had higher phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and fatty acid synthetase MICs at two months of age lower CCE glucosephosphate dehydrogenase and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase MICs at three months of age lower citrate cleavage enzyme and glucosephosphate dehydrogenase and higher acetyl coa carboxylase activities at five months of age and higher malic enzyme citrate cleavage enzyme and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase MICs at eight months of age there were significant correlations between PI level and body weight and between PI level and the activities of malic enzyme and CCE in avya mice the correlation between body weight and malic enzyme and citrate cleavage enzyme activities disappeared after the analysis was adjusted for plasma insulin level
779,in urethaneanaestetised rats intraventricular icv i.v. of histamine mug elicited doserelated rises in both the resting blood pressure and HR rate these cardiovascular effects of histamine were antagonised in a dosedependent manner by icv pretreatments with the histamine hreceptor antagonists mepyramine and mug and diphenylpyraline and mug i.c.v. with the histamine hreceptor antagonist metiamide and mug icv failed to modify either of the responses a doserelated antagonism of the hypertensive response to histamine icv was elicited by phentolamine and mug icv but the positive chronotropic effect was not modified by this pretreatment the cardiovascular responses to histamine icv were abolished by mecamylamine mgkg iv and greatly reduced by hydroxydopamine x mug icv but only the tachycardia was significantly modified by atropine mug icv and propranolol mgkg iv propranolol mug icv BL vagotomy or acute bilateral adrenal demedullation failed to modify the cardiovascular responses to histamine icv the results suggest that histamine is able to modify the resting blood pressure and heart rate by independent central modes of action which involve CE adrenergic and cholinergic mechanisms
780,the formation in vitro of prostaglandins e d and falpha from arachidonic acid by rabbit kidney medulla homogenate or microsomal fraction is markedly affected by the composition of the incubation medium employed optimal biosynthesis is obtained in m potassium PB with the optimum ph being under these conditions prostaglandin formation is linear up to AA acid concentration of mum the initial rate of formation of prostaglandin e prostaglandin d is times higher than that of prostaglandin falpha reduced glutathione mm did not affect the biosynthesis by medulla TH and produced only small stimulation of the biosynthesis by microsomal powder hydroquinone produced a small stimulation at a low concentration of mm and a strong inhibition at concentrations of mm or higher addition of bovine SS albumin reduced the microsomal biosynthesis of prostaglandins by approximately addition of boiled homogenate or boiled x g supernatant produced small stimulation of microsomal biosynthesis while x g supernatant not boiled caused small inhibition which was not doserelated it appears that rabbit kidney prostaglandinsynthetase converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins e and falpha in comparable amounts without apparent need for a cytoplasmic soluble cofactor or TPS reducing agents
781,it was the aim of the present study to elucidate the mechanisms involved in TPS IMT hydroxylase th and dopamine betahydroxylase dbh induction by potassium depolarization and cholinomimetics in rat superior cervical ganglia kept in organ SC the effect of high mm potassium concentration on intact ganglia seems to result in a dual action a a specific induction of th and dbh via PR of acetylcholine from preganglionic cholinergic nerve terminals b a nonspecific effect on terminal adrenergic neurons resulting in a general increase of protein synthesis as indicated by the increase in DDC ddc and monoamine oxidase mao activities in decentralized superior C2 ganglia potassium depolarization failed to produce the specific th and dbh induction although a small increase in ddc activity persisted carbamylcholine acetylcholine and NIC at concentrations of m elicited a selective induction of th and dbh both in IN and decentralized ganglia via nicotinic receptor stimulation bethanechol predominantly stimulating muscarinic receptors had no significant effect on th activity a h pulse of m carbamylcholine produced optimal induction of dbh and th h and h later respectively longer exposure to carbamylcholine resulted in a significantly smaller rise in th activity
782,the binding of several TCs to human SS albumin was studied using difference spectrophotometry and a spectrophotometric probe hydroxybenzeneazobenzoic acid difference spectra observed for the interaction between the probe and human serum albumin were similar to probebovine SS albumin spectra but were less intense for a given concentration of probe and did not reach saturation as quickly difference spectra for the TCs were dependent on the characteristics of the ring substituents more hydrophobic substituents on the d and c rings tended to give more intense difference spectra but chargetransfer complexing may also have been involved since methacycline with a methylene group in the position showed the most intense spectra of the compounds studied solvent perturbation ph and urea studies tended to confirm that something other than hydrophobic binding of the tetracyclines was involved drugprobe displacement studies showed that methacycline gave the greatest probe displacement followed by doxycycline CTC OTC and tetracycline this order of MSD of the anionic probe indicates that both hydrophobic and chargetransfer binding are involved experiments with calcium ion and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid showed that the difference spectra obtained with the tetracyclines and human SS albumin were not the result of metallic bridgechelate formation
783,kinetic studies were carried out on the ring opening of the quaternary nitrogen cation coralynium ion i to yield acetylpapaverine iii on the cyclization of iii to yield i and on a photochemical reaction undergone by i in aqueous solutions exposed to visible light from the results it was concluded that a i and iii are in facile equilibrium in aqueous solution but appreciable amounts of iii do not exist in dilute solutions with ph values below b the photochemical reaction of i in water presumably a photohydration can be reversed by lyophilization by heatiing and by increasing the ph of solutions to values greater than c the photochemical reaction of i can be inhibited by protecting the aqueous solutions from visible light and the rate in the presence of light can be reduced by increasing the concentration of i in the solution and d although the chloride and sulfoacetate salts of i react identically and have similar solubilities in water it is possible to prepare more concentrated and hence more stable solutions of the sulfoacetate salt by including sodium XTT in the solvent the solubility of coralyne chloride remains about the same in dilute sodium hydroxide as in water
784,T3 recalling the major role of CAs in the genesis of irreversible shock the antishock action of glucocorticosteroids owing to properties which are alphablocking is discussed in this work the works of lillehei on the effectiveness of CSs in different types of shock are summarized and discussed as well as numerous works which have followed and a synopsis of which done in in the annales de lanesthÃ©siologie francaise is presented since then following new exp facts whereas numerous contradictions have appeared in the clinical and exp realms the possible mechanisms of action of CSs in shock are looked at by emphasizing the relationships between corticosteroids and shwartzmans phenomenon in particular a hypothesis on a probable central action of GC is proposed following exp works carried out by h laborit et coll finally the author presents a personal experiment in HS in the rabbit where the adjunction of corticosteroids had no effect on the different parameters such as the decrease in paco hyperlactacidemia and the liberation of betaglycuronidase in the blood mortality being practically the same in the controls and in the animals submitted to corticosteroid therapy
785,adrenergic agonists produced a characteristic and definite decrease in the amplitude of spontaneous contractions and tone of the isolated rabbit jejunum effect of phenylephrine was abolished either by phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine relaxation induced by EN and by norepinephrine was inhibited after combined treatment with phentolamine and propranolol phentolamine alone diminished the response to epinephrine and to norepinephrine but the diminution for EN was greater indicating that epinephrine has a greater affinity for alpha than for betareceptors in the rabbit jejunum stimulation of the betareceptors by isoproterenol was inhibited by propranolol oxprenolol sotalol and pindolol but the block was incomplete the activity of these four betablockers in preventing the GABA response to isoproterenol was as follows inidolol greater than or equal to oxprenolol greater than propranolol greater than sotalol this demonstrates the fact that not all betaadrenergic blocking agents possess an identical pharmacologic spectrum of activity also it can be suggested that the betareceptors of jejunum differ in specificity from those of other organs
786,the method of estimating the intralysosomal ph by measuring the distribution of cmethylamine in lysosomes isolated from the livers of triton wr treated rats has been critically examined in lysed lysosomes methylamine is bound to the membrane fragments but this binding can be completely suppressed by increasing the concentration of monovalent cations in the medium in intact lysosomes the IB of cmethylamine is only partly inhibited by monovalent cations at degrees c the accumulation of cmethylamine in intact lysosomes is progressively inhibited as the concentration of methylamine is increased a similar inhibition of cmethylamine accumulation is obtained with nhcl similar values for the intralysosomal ph were obtained from measurements of the distribution of methylamine dimethylamine and TMA which are accumulated in the lysosomes and of dimethyloxazolidinedione which is excluded the breakdown of endocytosed ilabelled bovine SS albumin by intact isolated lysosomes is much less sensitive to the ph of the medium than the breakdown of added protein by lysed lysosomes the intralysosomal ph has been estimated by comparing the rate of breakdown of endocytosed ilabelled albumin in intact lysosomes as a function of medium ph with that of added ilabelled albumin by lysed lysosomes at different ph values the values obtained agree well with those calculated from the distribution of cmethylamine MA and nhcl inhibit the breakdown of ilabelled albumin in intact lysosomes particularly at high medium ph but have no effect on the breakdown by lysed lysosomes it is concluded that a ph difference across the lysosomal membrane more acidic inside than outside is maintained by the presence of indiffusible negatively charged groups within the lysosomes and by the permeation across the lysosomal membrane of protons together with permeant anions or of oh in exchange for anions
787,lipid synthesis as measured by the incorporation of acetate or ho into slices of foetal liver is much higher than in slices of adult CL and shows a peak at about twothirds of gestation at this time the synthesis from glucose was low and reached a peak days later the changes in the activity of atp citrate lyase which mirrored acetate incorporation and the effect of glucose and Pyr on acetate corporation into lipid suggests that some of the lipid synthesis occurs via intramitochondrial acetylcoa production from acetate despite this lipid synthesis was not inhibited by hydroxycitrate the low rate of synthesis from glucose at twothirds of gestation is ascribed to the low activity of pyruvate carboxylase at this time and a role for a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in providing oxaloacetate for lipogenesis is proposed the activity of fatty acid synthetase broadly agreed with the changes in lipid synthesis whereas the activity of acetylcoa carboxylase was barely sufficient to account for the rates of lipid synthesis in vivo acetate and shortchain fatty acids are likely to be the major precursors for lipid synthesis in vivo
788,the method of dna ALP elution was applied to a study of the formation and resealing of dna singlestrand breaks T3 irradiation of human fibroblasts with ultraviolet CS uv the general features of the results were consistent with current concepts of dna excision repair in that breaks appeared rapidly after uv and resealed slowly in NF whereas breaks did not appear in those cells of patients with xeroderma pigmentosum xp that are known to have defects in dna repair synthesis the appearance of breaks required a short postuv incubation consistent with the expected action of an endonuclease cells of the variant form of xp characterized by normal dna repair synthesis exhibited normal production of breaks after uv but were slower than normal cells in resealing these breaks this difference was enhanced by caffeine a MM is proposed to relate this finding with a previously described defect in postreplication repair in these xp variant cells dna crosslinking appears to cause an underestimate in the measurement of dna breakage after uv
789,renal acidification was evaluated in patients with sicklecell disease hvss with both oral nhci and nahc and the results were compared to those of subjects with sicklecell trait hbas and controls the ph of arterial blood was normal in hbss subjects but their pc and hc were lower than those of controls in response to nhci six of hbss subjects had an abnormal minimal urine ph greater than and the entire hbss group had a higher mean value than did either controls or hbas subjects since none of the six hbss subjects had evidence of PT tubular CA it was concluded that they exhibited the syndrome of incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis only one of the six hbss volunteers with an abnormal response to nhci and two of seven with a normal response increased their urinary pc normally T3 bicarbonate loading pah clearance was significantly higher and in clearance tended to be higher in hbss subjects than in either controls or hbas subjects maximal concentrating ability was decreased in both sicklecell CG but more so in hbss no adverse effects occurred and no appearance or increase in per cent of sickled cells resulted from shortduration nhci acidloading no differences were found either in the clinical characterstics or in hematological renal and acidbase variables between the hbss subjects with and without a normal response to acidloading the mechanism for the observed renal acidification abnormality remains unknown
790,in patients undergoing ear operations associated with minimal bleeding plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration were studied before and during surgical procedure and in the postoperative state studies were performed in two groups one without n and one with betaadrenergic blockade by practolol n plasma renin activity increased significantly during halothane anaesthesia CT whereas the surgical manipulations did not further influence mean values significantly thus it seems to be established that anaesthesia per se influences RS on the other hand practolol does not show an inhibiting effect the plasma renin increase following anaesthesia is due to the hemodynamic including renal hemodynamic changes as well as to activation of the SAS changes in plasma aldosterone are variable for the greater part of patients with betaadrenergic blockade an increase during the operative procedure was found however in some patients especially in the control group plasma aldosterone was unchanged or decreased in spite of increasing renin values significantly lower PK in these cases seems to indicate the important contributing role of potassium for the shortterm regulation of aldosterone secretion PNa remained unchanged for the periods studied
791,physiological and pharmacological characteristics of the spontaneous motility of rat oviductal tracts the coiled oviduct plus its mesosalpinx isolated in proestrus estrus or metestrus are described the initial contractile tension recorded following isolation was comparable in the three stages of the cycle but its decrement with time was greater in metestrus than in proestrus the opposite being observed regarding the rate of contractions norepinephrine and phenylephrine depress motility in proestrus and metestrus but not in estrus the inhibition of motility during proestrus produced by added norepinephrine phenylephrine or isoproterenol was not modified by phenotolamine but was abolished by propranolol during estrus norepinephrine and phenylephrine inhibited tubal contractions of preparations incubated with phentolamine whereas it produced a distinct stimulation in the presence of propranolol it is concluded that a the rat mesosalpinx might play some role in the motility of the whole isolated oviductal tract b there are variations in the decrement with time of contractile tension and FC in different stages of the sex cycle c the effects of catecholamines upon the rat oviductal tract also varies within the cycle probably due to influences imposed by sex hormones
792,by in vitro experiments on rb bladder we reassessed the traditional view that mammalian UB lacks ion transport mechanisms since the ratio of actualtonominal membrane area in folded epithelia is variable and hard to estimate we normalized membrane properties to apical membrane capacitance rather than to nominal area probably muf approximately cm actual area a new mounting technique that virtually eliminates edge damage yielded resistances up to omega muf for rabbit bladder and resistances for amphibian skin and bladder much higher than those usually reported this technique made it possible to observe a transportrelated conductance pathway and a close correlation between transepithelial conductance g and shortcircuit current isc in these tight epithelia g and isc were increased by mucosal na isc approximately when na approximately aldosterone serosal hco and high mucosal h were decreased by amiloride mucosal ca ouabain metabolic inhibitors and serosal h and were unaffected by cl and little affected by V2 hormone adh physiological variation in the rabbits dietary na NI caused variations in bladder g and isc similar to those caused by the expected in vivo changes in aldosterone levels the relation between g and isc was the same whether defined by diet changes NK variation among individual rabbits or most of the above agents a method was developed for separately resolving conductances of junctions basolateral cell membrane and apical cell membrane from this gisc relation net na flux equalled isc net cl flux was zero on short circuit and equalled only of net na flux in open circuit bladder membrane fragments contained a nakactivated ouabaininhibited atpase the physiological significance of na absorption against steep gradients in rabbit bladder may be to maintain kidneygenerated ion gradients during bladder storage of urine especially when the animal is nadepleted
793,the influence of technological additives and the range of heating on the redox potential as well as on some quality features of canned meat was examined the experiments showed that the time of storage and the degree of heating of model preserves of meat influence on the redox potential the technological additions as polyphosphates ascorbic acid gelatine and mixtures of these substances influence less on the redox potential the analysis of each exp factor showed that on the secretion of meat juice occurring during can pasteurization or sterilization influence all experimental AF as the kind of heating the time of storage as well as the kind and the quantity of technological additives the highest secretion of meat juice was found in cans with addition of ascorbic acid cans with addition of gelatine had the smallest content of jelly and consequently the lowest secretion of meat juice it was also found a certain relation between the level of redox potential and the tested quality features of the MM meat preserves
794,two readily obtainable biological fluids ie urine and tears were investigated as possible substitutes for serum and WBCs for the PCD of taysachs disease tsd heterozygotes based on quantitative Hex a hex a determinations hexosaminidase isoenzyme patterns were determined by means of an automated deaecellulose microcolumn procedure for serum urine and tear samples from normals tsd carriers normal pregnancies carrierpregnancies and tsd children normal pregnancy and tsd carrier sera gave almost MZ Hex patterns with multiple intermediate peaks whereas urine and tear samples from normal pregnant women showed hexosaminidase isoenzyme patterns resembling those of NCs these results suggested that use of these fluids might eliminate the effect of pregnancy of the hex a ratio which occurs when serum is used as the test fluid in addition these fluids are most economical and simpler to obtain than a blood sample about urine samples from the various categories listed above were analyzed for hex a with both the heat denaturation and ph inactivation methods and the results compared with SS and leukocyte levels from many of the same individuals with either method the wide overlap between the urinary hex a normal and heterozygote ranges would require retesting with leukocytes of about of the subjects these results would preclude the use of urines as a suitable fluid for the MS of the ashkenazic jewish population for tsd heterozygotes
795,LA production by chick embryo fibroblasts occurs in the absence of exogenous gl fifteen to fold less LA is formed in the absence of glucose than in its presence nevertheless SS and ph stimulation enhances this residual lactic acid production to the same relative extent as when gl is present the amount of lactic acid formed cannot be accounted for by the catabolism of residual gl in the medium since its concentration is less than onetenth that of the lactic acid eventually produced moreover the residual glucose concentration remains constant or increases during the course of the experiment to a large extent LA accumulation in the absence of external gl is dependent on the presence of amino acids in the medium but CAA transport is not affected by the stimulatory agents used in this study the results suggest that treatments which stimulate cell multiplication also activate those enzymatic pathways which convert amino acids to pyruvic and thence to lactic acid
796,ultraviolet uvlightmediated formation of proteindna adducts in chinese hamster cell chromatin was investigated in an attempt to compare chromatin alterations induced in vitro with those observed in vivo three independent methods of analysis indicated stable proteindna associations a membrane filter CA which retained dna on the filter in the presence of high saltdetergent a sepharose b column assay in which protein eluted cincident with dna and a cscl density gradient equilibrium assay which showed both protein and dna banding at densities other than their respective native densities treatment of the irradiated chromatin with dnase provided further evidence that proteindna and not proteinprotein adducts were being observed in the column assay there is a fluencedependent response of proteindna adduct formation when the chromatin is irradiated at low ionic strength and is linear for protein over the range studied when the chromatin is exposed to differing conditions of ph ionic strength or divalent metal ion concentration the quantity of adduct formed upon uv irradiation varies susceptibility to adduct formation can be partially explained in terms of the condensation state of the chromatin and other AF such as rearrangement denaturation and dissociation of the chromatin components besides providing information on the biological significance of these types of uvinduced lesions this technique may be useful as a probe of chromatin structure
797,paramyosin samples obtained from the chowder clam mercenaria mercenaria by different SE techniques were studied using transient electric birefringence techniques the protein remain monomeric unaggregated in mm buffer solution at ph to and near ph at ph the molecules obtained by different extraction techniques exhibit rotational diffusion constants that indicate a difference in length between them with the probable native form of paramyosin being the longer species this difference in rotational DWI constant disappears at higher ph and in addition a large difference in dipole moment between the molecules observed at ph also disappears at high ph these results are used to hypothesize that the rodlike native paramyosin molecules have one or two partly flexible portions on their ends at one end of each molecule this portion probably contains excess basic amino acids which are charged at low ph to account for the higher dipole moment of this form of paramyosin at these low ph values at ph these portions of the macromolecule are not flexible and act as stiff parts of the rodlike molecules but they gradually become flexible at higher ph possible mechanisms for this NC in flexibility are discussed
798,hypophysectomy increases hepatic lipogenesis in cockerels in an attempt to find the possible hormonal mechanism for this we have examined the effects of hypophysectomy insulin and pituitary homogenates on hepatic lipogenesis insulin ukg injected intravenously simultaneously with glucosec tracer increased the amount of c found in liver lipids at min after the i.t. similarly insulin injected min before killing increased the incorporation of glucosec and acetatec by liver slices during a min incubation hypophysectomy increased lipogenesis within hours the effect of insulin was most pronounced in hypophysectomized cockerels the activity of the lipogenic enzyme acetyl coa carboxylase was similarly affected a homogenate of chicken pituitaries added to the medium reduced lipid synthesis from glucosec by CL slices this effect was larger in liver slices in which lipogenesis had been stimulated by insulin the increased rate of hepatic lipgenesis in hypophysectomized cockerels may be caused partly by increased hepatic sensitivity to the lipogenic action of insulin or by the removal of a direct inhibition by PIT hormones
799,previous reports have shown that fractionation of the nonsugar nondialyzable components of cane molasses yielded a fraction designated as a black phenoliccarbohydrate complex incorporation of of this complex into diets fed weanling male rats significantly increased the growth rate above that of rats fed the BD alone this T0 was conducted to determine the chemical nature and growth stimulating action of the black phenolcarbohydrate complex alkaline cleavage under nitrogen yielded a mixture of phenols and a carbohydrate fraction which was recovered by precipitation at ph in four volumes of ethanol the alkaline cleaved free hemicellulose was nondiayzable and stimulated growth when incorporated into rat diets at the C2 acid hydrolysis of the complex yielded an insoluble product identified as lignin and found to represent to of the entire complex the chemical nature of this ligninhemicellulose fraction and the previously reported growthenhancing acid resistant hemicellulose fraction isolated from various plant sources were found to be similar
800,the role of histamine as a mediator of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction was examined in IN anesthetized dogs antagonism of histamine vasoconstrictor h receptors with a classic antihistaminic drug chlorpheniramine failed to prevent or modify the pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia o blockade of histamine vasodilator h receptors with a newly synthesized blocking agent metiamide potentiated the vasoconstriction induced by hypoxia and prevented the normal increase in HR rate combined h and hreceptor blockade also did not prevent or reduce the hypoxic pulmonary pressor response although it did effectively abolish the cardiovascular actions of infused histamine in other dogs histamine infused mugkg per min during hypoxia att the pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by hypoxia the results imply that in the dog histamine does not mediate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction however histamine does appear to be released during hypoxia and it may play a role in modulating the pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia by opposing the hypoxia induced vasoconstriction the results also imply that histamine may be responsible for the increase in HR rate during hypoxia
801,morphologic and immunohistochemical studies by CS and electron microscopy indicated that basement membrane was removed during the process of involution of the mu breast removal of the basement membrane started days postweaning was maximal at days and correlated with degeneration of epithelial cells there was no evidence of phagocytosis of basement membrane so the removal of this antigen was attributed to enzymatic hydrolysis to determine the activity of breast homogenate on the specific basement membrane antigen insoluble basement membrane embedded in agarose gels was incubated with breast liver and kidney homogenates when basement membrane antigen was demonstrated by the specific antibody it was found that breast homogenate solubilized basement membrane but liver and kidney failed to solubilize basement membrane to quantify the reaction and determine some of the characteristics of the responsible enzymes insoluble basement membrane was labeled with i and the PR of radioactivity into the supernatant following incubation with extracts of involuting breast indicated hydrolysis of basement membrane extracts of breast homogenate extensively hydrolyzed labeled basement membrane if naturally occurring inhibitors were removed by previous washing whereas liver or kidney extracts prepared in a similar manner were devoid of activity the hydrolysis of basement membrane was time and concentration dependent and had a ph optimum the reaction was blocked by prior heating of the extract at degrees c for minutes removal of divalent cations and presence of diisopropylfluorophosphate a specific serine esterase inhibitor prolonged dialysis failed to remove the hydrolytic activity it is concluded that an enzyme system present in the involuting breast is capable of basement membrane hydrolysis
802,it is difficult to choose among the many drugs advocated for treating anxiety symptoms the barbiturates were the most commonly used antianxiety agents until recently but are being superseded by the benzodiazepines the latter are more effective than the barbiturates as shown in comparative clinical trials they are safer in overdosage deliberate or accidental and they are somewhat less likely to induce dependence the barbiturates have the additional drawback of interfering with the action of other drugs by inducing CL microsomal oxidising drug metabolising enzymes the major tranquilisers neuroleptics or antipsychotics are often of value in low dosage in patients with a previous PH of dependence on alcohol the barbiturates or the benzodiazepines TCAs are the treatment of choice in anxious and depressed patients and MAO-A inhibitors may be helpful in phobic patients the betaadrenoreceptor blocking agents such as propranolol often ameliorate somatic PS such as palpitations and tremor in the treatment of anxious patients it is important to remove causes for anxiety and to limit any course of drug treatment to a finite period both dosage level and dosage interval should be flexible benzodiazepines remain the drug treatment of choice
803,the IB of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadp dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase from beef liver cytoplasm was studied by several equilibrium techniques ultracentrifugation molecular sieving UF fluorescence two binding sites per dimeric enzyme molecule were found with slightly different dissociation constants and mum and fluorescence yields and a ternary complex was formed between enzyme isocitrate and nadph in which nadph KB was mum on the contrary no binding of nadph to the enzyme took place in the presence of magnesium isocitrate dialysis experiments showed the existence of nadp binding sitedimer with a dissociation constant of mum when nadph was present with the enzyme in the proportion of moleculedimer the dissociation constant of nadp was decreased fourfold reaching a value quantitatively comparable to the K(m) the kinetics of coenzyme IB was followed using the stoppedflow technique with fluorescence detection nadph binding to the enzyme occurred through one fast reaction k mum s dissociation of nadph took place upon nadp binding however equilibrium as well as kinetic data were incompatible with a simple competition scheme dissociation of nadph from the enzyme upon magnesium isocitrate binding was preceded by the formation of a transitory ternary complex in which the fluorescence of nadph was only about of that in the enzymenadph complex then interaction between the conenzymes and the involvement of ternary complexes in the catalytic mechanism are discussed in relation with what is known about the regulatory role of the coenzyme carlier m f and pantaloni d biochemistry
804,the rate of color development of a tetrazolium formazan is shown to be inversely proportional to the dielectric constant of the solvent medium and directly proportional to the hydrogenbonding capability of solvent mixtures having the same dielectric constant the geometric isomers of the formazans have different absorbance maxima and the wavelength of maximum absorbance of a mixture of formazans in different solvents depends upon which isomer predominates in that solvent the transsynisomer blue form of blue tetrazolium has a maximum absorbance at nm in dimethylformamide while the transantiisomer red form absorbs at nm in methanol the absorbance maxima of the corresponding isomers of the formazans of triphenyltetrazolium occur at and nm respectively water andor methanol to a lesser extent are important in the stabilization of the transantiisomer since the small size of these two substances allows them to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds with one or both nitrogen atoms of the azo linkage thereby preventing the formation of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding exhibited by the transsynisomer the formazan produced by the reaction of CSs with tetrazolium in strongly basic media can lose a reduction unit and be reoxidized to the tetrazolium this reaction is solvent dependent and occurs at a much faster rate in CF than in alcohol usp
805,the preparation and use of carbonylbis lmethionine pnitrophenyl ester as a reversible crosslinking reagent for insulin are described the reaction of equiv of reagent with zinc insulin in dimethylformamide in the presence of triethylamine yields as one of the products nalphaa nepsilonbcarbonylbismethionylinsulin cbminsulin the cbminsulin was characterized by end group analysis and by the products formed on tryptic and chymotryptic cleavage it possessed of the immunological and of the hormonal activity of insulin treatment of cbminsulin with cyanogen bromide cnbr in formic acid for h resulted in nearly complete removal of the Met bridge to yield insulin a small amount of a side product was removed on deaecellulose at ph to give an overall recovery of insulin of oxidative sulfitolyses of cbminsulin gave the hexassulfonate which was reduced with dithiothreitol to yield reduced cbminsulin the latter compound containing sulfhydryls exhibited a phdependent circular dichroic spectrum the form at ph exhibited a spectrum typical of random coil which was converted to a form at ph which was characterized by a negative extremum at nm the NC in the spectrum at nm with ph was characterized by an apparent pka of studies on the reoxidation of reduced cbminsulin were performed at ph values between and and at protein concentrations of mgml the best yields ca of the correctly paired disulfide bonds were obtained in reoxidations at ph at protein concentration of mgml cbminsulin which had been isolated from reoxidation at high ph of the reduced cbminsulin was cleaved by cnbr to yield a fully AS insulin in an overall yield of from the reduced cbminsulin
806,the bone marrow reactions that is decrease of nucleated cell counts and increase of red blood cell counts of mouse bone were observed hr T3 injection of endotoxin and peaked after hr these reactions were significantly inhibited when diphenhydramine promethazine antihistamines chlorpromazine antiserotonin or cyproheptadine antihistamine and antiserotonin was given min before endotoxin such bone marrow reactions were also induced with histamine or serotonin and peaked hr after administration the histamineinduced changes were inhibited by prior treatment with diphenhydramine these reactions were also produced by injection of a small amount of both histamine and serotonin whereas no change was found when mice were given a single injection of a larger dose of histamine or serotonin these results indicate that histamine and serotonin released in mice at the initial stage after endotoxin synergistically trigger the bone marrow reactions which then continue in the presence of further mediators antihistamines and antiserotonins are considered to hinder the whole process of reactions produced by endotoxin
807,in cases fetal blood analysis fba was done in the last minutes before birth together with blood sampling from the umbilical artery ua immediately after delivery before the first breath using the measured phvalues we investigated the relationship between these variables in particular the degree of influence of considerable caput succedaneum on phvalues in peripheral blood our investigation was performed during the time just before delivery when the disturbance of blood circulation in the presenting fetal part whuld have the highest influence on phvalues measured from IP blood samples we kept in mind especially the critiques of fba by wulf et al and assali as other authors have concluded we found a high degree of correlation between the ph evaluated by fba and that determined in the umbilical artery blood the coefficient of rho was phact r phqu r the relationship between the corresponding phvalues in peripheral fba and arterial ua blood is given in fig a and fig b the correlation of quadrants showed for the actual ph as well for the phqu p less than as derived form this a high degree of correlation between the phvalues can be seen the mean phvalues were see article of the children had a severe or moderate caput succedaneum fig a and b show the relationship between CE and peripheral phvalues in these cases again a good correlation between the phvalues was observed as in the whole collective the coefficient of rho was phact r phqu r caput succedaneum seems to have only minimal influence on the ph of blood obtained from the presenting fetal part these results lead us to conclude that blood sampling from the presenting fetal part in the second stage provides almost indentical phvalues as in the central FB
808,oxygen and carbon monoxide kinetics of glycera dibranchiata monomeric hemoglobin have been studied using laser photolysis air flash and stopped flow techniques the reactions of this hemoglobin with both ligands were found to be more rapid than the corresponding reactions involving myoglobin and were also biphasic in nature the rate constants being approximately an order of magnitude different for the fast and slow phases in each case no ph or hemoglobin concentration dependence of the pseudofirst order rate constants was apparent between ph and and in the concentration range of to mum heme both fast and slow pseudofirst order oxygen combination rate constants varied linearly with oxygen concentration between and mum a first order slow EC50 was also noted which was linearly dependent on heme concentration and inversely dependent on oxygen concentration this reaction has been shown to be due to a replacement of oxygen by carbon monoxide the presence of this reaction is a result of the high affinity of glycera monomer for carbon monoxide as shown by the partition coefficient mr approximately ana an equilibrium KB of the order l x m
809,we have measured co fluxes across phosphate solutions at different carbonic anhydrase concentrations bicarbonate concentration gradients phosphate concentrations and mobilities temperature was degrees c the ph of the phosphate solutions was we found that under physiological conditions of ph and pco a facilitated diffusion of co occurs in addition to free diffusion when a sufficient carbonic anhydrase is present and b a concentration gradient of hco is established along with a pco gradient and c the phosphate buffer has a mobility comparable to that of bicarbonate when the phosphate was immobilized by attaching mmlong cellulose particles no facilitation of co diffusion was detectable a mechanism of facilitated co diffusion in phosphate solutions analogous to that in Al solutions was proposed on the basis of these findings bicarbonate diffusion together with a facilitated proton transport by phosphate diffusion a mathematical model of this mechanism was formulated the co fluxed predicted by the model agree quantitatively with the experimentally determined fluxes it is concluded that a highly effective proton transport mechanism acts in solutions of mobile phosphate buffers by this mechanism co transfer may be increased up to fivefold and proton transfer may be increased to fold
810,i embryonicchick tendon cells were pulselabelled for min with cproline and the clabelled polypeptides were chased with unlabelled proline for up to min isolation of subcellular fractions during the chase period and their subsequent analysis for bacterial collagenasesusceptible clabelled peptides demonstrated the transfer of PC polypeptides from rough to smooth microsomal fractions and thence to the extracellular medium parallel analyses of golgienriched fractions indicated the involvement of this organelle in the secretory pathway of procollagen sodium dodecylsulphatepolyacrylamidegel PACE of the clabelled polypeptides present in the golgienriched fractions demonstrated that the procollagen polypeptides were all present as disulphidelinked progamma components when similar kinetic studies of the intracellular transport of procollagen were conducted with embryonicchick cartilage cells almost identical results were obtained but the rate of translocation of cartilage PC was significantly slower than that observed for tendon procollagen when hydroxylation of procollagen polypeptides was inhibited by alphaalphabipyridyl the nascent polypeptides accumulated in the rough microsomal fraction when cells were pulselabelled for min with cproline and the label was chased in the presence of colchicine secretion of procollagen was inhibited and an intracellular accumulation of PC clabelled polypeptides was observed in the golgienriched fractions the energydependence of the intracellular transport of procollagen was demonstrated in experiments in which antimycin a was found to inhibit the transfer of procollagen polypeptides from rough to smooth endoplasmic reticulum it is concluded that procollagen follows the classical route of secretion taken by other extracellular proteins
811,i have tried to bring out some of the important methodological problems found in examining the effectiveness of drugs used in the control of druginduced parkinsonism by referring mainly to studies in which i have taken part i hope i have shown that the whole topic is far less well understood than is often assumed the main points may be summarized as follows there is doubt as to whether many of the drugs used in controlling druginduced parkinsonism are really effective the results of many studies are conflicting many studies contain serious flaws in design methods for assessing EPS are not well developed we are ignorant of the way in which druginduced EPS change spontaneously there is a clear need for further research in this area to improve techniques of assessment to provide basic information on druginduced syndromes and to rigorously examine the tau of the drugs used in controlling them
812,dopamine is a directacting catecholamine with a short halflife that has many advantages in treating visceral hypoperfusion states such as shock and refractory heart failure unlike other inotropic drugs dopamine directly dilates the MES renal and CBF vessels and redirects blood flow to essential viscera this DA effect is prominent with doses of mugmin in adults and is attenuated by phenothiazines and haloperidol at doses of mugmin dopamine also has a significant betaadrenergic inotropic effect increasing myocardial contractility the inotropic effect is equivalent to that of isoproterenol epinephrine and norepinephrine but tachycardia tachyarrhythmias and angina may be less frequent with dopamine in doses greater than mugmin dopamine is a vasoconstrictor with pressor effects usually equivalent to that of norepinephrine dopamine dilates pupils does not dilate bronchi and does not shunt blood from viscera to skeletal muscles as does isoproterenol because dopamine increases myocardial +dP/dt selectively redistributes perfusion to essential viscera and allows a pharmacologic titration of effect it is a logical firstchoice catecholamine for treatment of shock and refractory HF
813,as the effect of antibiotic treatment of maxillary sinusitis has been questioned the elimination of bacteria from sinus secretions was studied during antibiotic treatment penicillin v azidocillin tetracycline or doxycycline was administered to patients with maxillary sinusitis samples of sinus secretion were aspirated both before treatment and days after the ON of treatment when the antibiotic concentration was below the upper limit of mic for sensitivity group bacterial growth was present in practically all samples when the antibiotic concentration equalled or was above this limit there was no bacterial growth in about half of the samples a prerequisite for antibiotic effectelimination of bacteriais that the antibiotic concentration is well above the mic of the bacteria at the site of infection the choice between bactericidal or bacteriostatic antibiotics appeared unimportant bacterial survival in the maxillary sinus despite a high antibiotic concentration in the sinus illustrates that mic values determined in the laboratory do not always mirror the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics in vivo
814,to determine the influence of exercise on CBF blood flow we ran swine at mph and at grades on a treadmill for min at moderate and severe C2 of exercise measuring heart rate cardiac output and aortic pressure via implanted probes we injected mum radiolabeled microspheres via the left atrium before and during exercise we measured their CSD by gamma spectrometry determining total cerebral blood flow regional blood flow and ratio of flow to gray and white matter heart rate cardiac output and aortic pressure rose progressively with increasing exercise total cerebral flow resembled that reported in humans ie it did not NC significantly with exercise regional flow distribution also failed to NC significantly with exercise the ratio of gray to white matter flow did not change except to the cerebellum where it rose significantly from resting values at both moderate and severe exercise gray matter received more flow than white matter during all three conditions of observation CBF blood flow was remarkably constant during even severe exercise
815,the electrondense capsule tip apical cap of sea anemone and coral spirocysts is of a different structure than the capsule wall the capsule wall is composed of a double layer of fiberlike materials which cross each other at roughly right angles the innermost layer is characterized by numerous serrations the tips of which project into the lumen of the capsule within each serration a band of finely crossstriated material encircles the capsule at RA angles to its longitudinal axis the membrane lining the lumen of the capsule appears to be continuous with the wall of the undischarged thread the outer capsule wall layer consists of closely spaced microfilaments cnidofilaments which are oriented in the longitudinal axis of the capsule the cnidofilaments appear to merge with the apical cap material contrary to some previous reports in the literature it has been found that spirocysts normally discharge by eversion as do nematocysts the relationship of the capsule wall substructure to the spirocyst discharge process is discussed
816,dichlorocyclopropylphenoxymethylpropanoic acid win was readily absorbed after p.o. in rats rhesus monkeys and human volunteers peak concentrations of drug in plasma were attained within hr of medication the timeconcentration curve of administered drug was biphasic in monkeys and men while in rats the kinetics of a onecompartment model were observed CSD studies of clabeled drug in the rat showed that most of the radioactivity was excreted in the feces and that significant quantities of c were sequestered by depot fat monkeys and human subjects both eliminated win primarily through the kidneys the drug was excreted in rat bile and human urine both as the free acid and conjugated with glucuronic acid at physiological concentrations win was extensively bound to rat monkey and HP proteins a gaschromatographic method for the analysis of drug in plasma urine or bile gave a linear relationship between PH ratios and concentrations in the range of mugml
817,daily evaluations of newly detected ketoacidotic diabetics showed the bohreffect of haemoglobin to be decreased by while EA dpg was decreased below mumolesg hb dpg correlated strongly with ph during acidosis and with plasma inorganic phosphate pi subsequently to the first insulin administration oxygen affinity of haemoglobin measured as p act ph was unchanged in ketoacidosis compared to the time however p act ph fell striking p less than and remained decreased up to days depending upon the resynthesis of dpg in relation to pi the hillcoefeficient in reflecting the Mw of the oxygen dissociation curve was diminished in ketoacidosis p less than and decreased further after phnormalization p less than there was a close association of n with dpg p less than and additionally with pi at dpglevels below mumolesg hb based on these findings a decreased EA oxygen release of one fifth during acidosis and more than one third T3 phcorrection can be hypothesised in view of the intimate relation of pi to the oxygen transport system it is suggesed that treatment of ketoacidosis should include pisugstitution
818,alphadmannosidase alphadmannoside mannohydrolase ec has been purified to homogeneity as demonstrated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation the molecular weight of the enzyme is approx the protein appears to contain subunits with molecular weights of and the enzyme was immobilized on sepharose and the properties of the coupled and free enzyme were compared both were stable up to degrees c with rapid loss of activity between degrees c both retained activity in m urea and of the original activity could be restored in the coupled preparation by removal of the urea the ph maximum of each form was approximately the same with the maximum of the immobilized enzyme shifted slightly to a lower ph the coupled alphadmannosidase presented in this report offers the possibility of digesting high molecular weight substrates such as glycoproteins with the advantages of recovering C1 quantities of digested substrate REC of the active glycosidase and digestion at high temperatures and under conditions that denature many proteins
819,local po was measured in the cat cortex on adjacent sites with a Pt multiwire surface electrode both during Css conditions and with varying arterial oxygen supply concomitantly po in the sinus sagittalis was recorded continuously through the vascular wall under normoxia and Css conditions local tissue po values varied between o torr and almost arterial levels of torr in accordance with theoretical calculations with increased arterial oxygen supply local tissue po as measured on agjacent CS was found to react fairly differently linear increases in local tissue po as compared with arterial po as well as constant levels or only very small increases were recorded the constancy of local po local po autoregulation was caused by local vasoconstriction with reduced supply of arterial oxygen however tissue po dropped in all studied sites down to hypoxia and anoxia po autoregulation during a decrease in arterial po as described by bicher could not be found
820,this T0 shows that the staff working in an operating room is repeatedly being exposed to appreciable doses of halothane vapours a continuous measurement of the concentrations in the ambient air gave results ranging from to ppm summits from to ppm were noted the inhaling of HAL was evidenced by the presence of brominated metabolites in the urine of the staff a mean mgl was found with women anaesthesists therefore it is quite possible that the halothane spread in the air should be held responsible for the discomfort felt in particular by anaesthesists to prevent this risk of chronic intoxication by those vapours there ought to be a device permitting either to evacuate them outside or to collect them while regenerating the polluted air through an AS carbon filter if one has not got at ones disposal an airing system offering over renewals of fresh air per hour the fitting up of a permanent control device equipped with warning CS and bell is also justified
821,the determinants of the lung clearance of streptococcus pneumoniae klebsiella pneumoniae escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus were studied in normal mice after SE to an aerosol of viable bacteria and mtclabeled dead bacteria the fraction of bacteria in lungs that remained viable h after exposure were s pneumoniae k pneumoniae e coli s aureus the rate of physical removal of bacterial particles kmc was determined from the NC in lung mtc counts with time kmc ranged between and h and and was similar in all species the rate of mucociliary clearance and of intrapulmonary bacterial killing kk kmc was calculated from the change in bacterial counts with time in animals that had received tetracycline to inhibit bacterial multiplication kk the rate of intrapulmonary killing was obtained by subtraction of kmc from kk kmc the calculated values for kk were s pneumoniae h k pneumoniae h e coli h s aureus h the rate of intrapulmonary bacterial multiplication kg was estimated from the relationship of bacterial counts in tetracycline and nontetracyclinetreated animals assuming that tetracycline altered only kg kg expressed as the Td was s pneumoniae min k pneumoniae min ecoli min s aureus infinity no multiplication the data indicate that the marked differences in the clearance of these species from the normal mouse lung result from the interaction of differing rates of in vivo bacterial multiplication and killing
822,a CT of castor oil in overdoses of lipophilic drugs gave a strong clinical impression that it was effective in speeding up REC therefore animal experiments were undertaken to confirm that castor oil acts as a ligand in ethchlorvynol poisoning and that its use reduces coma time serial SS levels of ethchlorvynol were obtained from dogs given ethchlorvynol mgkg CT and the same dose dissolved in castor oil mlkg in a crossover fashion the result was a reduction of peak serum levels and of the halflife of the drug when the castor oil solution was used in order to mimic the clinical situation more closely a further crossover T0 was undertaken using ethchlorvynol mgkg alone and the same dose followed by castor oil mlkg repeated qh this showed no delay in reaching peak SS concentration and no reduction of Cmax however it did show a per cent reduction in the halflife of the drug this NC is statistically significant and supports the continued use of castor oil in lipophilic drug overdose
823,the effect of cimetidine a new histamine hreceptor antagonist on gastric acid secretion stimulated by a homogenised meal was studied in six normal volunteers using an in vivo intragastric titration technique the subjects were studied twice no more than h apart receiving either cimetidine mg or PL in random order cimetidine administered either men before three subjects or with the meal three subjects significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion in all the subjects throughout the period of study min after food total acid secretion decreased by and respectively when the drug was taken with the meal absorption was slower mean peak blood level mumoll min after dosing than when administered on an empty stomach mean peak blood level mumoll min T3 dosing blood cimetidine concentration correlated significantly p less than with percentage inhibition of acid output and the calculated concentration resulting in inhibition of gastric acid secretion ic was mumoll secretion of gastrin in response to food was unaffected by cimetidine the results suggest that mg cimetidine effectively inhibits foodstimulated acid secretion and that the BA of the drug may be affected by the timing of dosage in relation to meals no unwanted effect were observed
824,the binding of ilabelled human growth hormone to the g microsomal membrane fraction prepared from the livers of normal female rats was dependent on time temperature ph membrane concentration and concentration of ilabelled hGH at degrees c binding reached a steady state after h with the mean maximal specific IB being of the tracer initially added dissociation of ilabelled human growth hormone from the CM after addition of excess of unlabelled hormone was relatively slow with a halftime greater than h only minor degradation of the ilabelled human growth hormone was observed during incubation with membranes for or h at degrees c similarly no significant NC in the ability of CM to bind human growth hormone was evident after preincubation of the CM for or h specificity studies showed that up to of the ilabelled human growth hormone bound could be displaced by mug of unlabelled hormone ovine prolactin also showed considerable competition for the binding site nonprimate growthhormone S9 ovine bovine porcine and rat and nonrelated hormones insulin thyrotropin lutropin and follitropin all showed negligible competition scatchard analysis of the IB data was consistent with two classes of binding site with binding affinities of x x m and x x m and corresponding binding capacities of fmolmg of protein and fmolmg of protein these studies provide data which in general are consistent with the criteria required for hormonereceptor interaction however proof of the thesis that the humangrowthhormonebinding sites in female rat liver represent physiological receptors must await the demonstration of a correlation between hormone IB and a biological response
825,the role of peroxidasemediated bacterial killing by rb alveolar macrophages was examined during h of incubation in vitro alveolar macrophages ingested and killed greater than of the streptococcus faecalis proteus mirabilis or streptococcus pneumoniae present in the incubation mixture preincubation of alveolar macrophages with inhibitors of catalase aminotriazole or sodium nitrite did not alter their bactericidal potential iodination of ingested zymosan particles a peroxidasedependent and hydrogen peroxidedependent reaction was not observed in spite of vigorous phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages furthermore iodination by AM macrophages was not significantly increased when peroxidasecoated zymosan particles were ingested the results suggest that hydrogen peroxide may not be available to the phagocytic vacuole for microbial killing since tetrazolium dye reduction reflects the activity of an oxidase responsible for stimulated oxygen consumption by polymorphonuclear leukocytes this reaction was also measured rabbit AM macrophages incubated with latex particles did not exhibit an increased dye reduction compared with resting cells the absence of significant stimulation of tetrazolium dye reduction indicates that the oxidase reaction does not occur in the proximity of the phagocytic vacuole of alveolar macrophages
826,mÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy has been used to study the heme iron in various states of cytochrome pcam from the camphorhydroxylating system of the bacterium pseudomonas putida native camphorfree pcam contains lowspin ferric iron part of which approx is converted to the highspin ferric state upon addition of camphor the mÃ¶ssbauer spectra of the camphorfree enzyme s equals and of the HS component s equals of the camphor complex have been successfully simulated using a model based on crystalfield theory and simple convalency considerations the native lowspin ferric state of pcam forms a complex with phenylimidazole with small changes in the g values and mÃ¶ssbauer spectra these changes can be accounted for consistently in the crystalfield model referred to above the addition of putidaredoxin to the camphorcomplexed oxidized pcam decreases the intensity of the HS component and changes its quadrupole splitting the reduced form of pcam contrins highspin ferrous iron both in the presence and absence of camphor the complex of reduced pcam with molecular oxygen is diamagnetic and has a combination of quadrupole splitting and isomer shift that is unusual for a ferrous complex but strongly resembles that of oxyhemoglobin these results are compatible with the bound superoxide feo MM proposed for oxyhemoglobin weiss j j nature reduced pcam and its complexes oxypcamco are all found to be analogous in some respects to the corresponding hemoglobin complexes
827,sixteen dry holstein cows were assigned four groups combining either or calcium and ph of either or in a x factorial arrangement of treatments to study the effect of diet calcium and pH ph on voluntary NI of dry matter mineral metabolism and blood constituents the day experiment was started days prepartum and completed dpp voluntary dry matter ingestion tended to be higher with higher calcium and pH lower ph diets calcium nutriture was improved by more acid diets more total calcium was apparently absorbed and g when the diet contained calcium but the calcium diet resulted in a higher apparent percent absorption and during the dry period an increased apparent absorption and g and utilization of diet calcium occurred with the higher calcium treatment at days postpartum magnesium and phosphorus utilizations were improved with lower diet calcium although experimental treatments had no significant effect on blood minerals SS calcium decreased dpp a better calcium nutriture was provided by the higher calcium diets when the diets maintained a positive balance for magnesium and phosphorus
828,a series of substituted dihydroxypyrazoloalphapyrimidines containing various aromatic phenyl e pyridyl f pbromophenyl g pchlorophenyl h pacetamidophenyl i ptolyl j mtolyl k methylenedioxyphenyl m or naphthyl n or nonaromatic hydrogen a nitro b bromo c or chloro d substituents in the position was synthesized and tested as inhibitors of xanthine oxidase the compounds am were synthesized by condensation of the appropriate aminosubstituted pyrazole with diethyl malonate in alcoholic sodium methoxide and NT of the resulting enol sodium salts as inhibitors of xanthine oxidase en greater than acd congruent to allopurinol greater than b the arylsubstituted EDC en were times better xanthine oxidase inhibitors than allopurinol using hypoxanthine as substrate and times better using xanthine as ATP as evidenced by a comparison of ki values the inhibition by all EDC an was totally reversible and of the noncompetitive or mixed type a T0 of the ph dependence of xanthine oxidase inhibition by aeg and allopurinol indicated that the aryl substituents facilitated IB to the enzyme these and the above results show that the EDC reported here inhibit xanthine oxidase by a mechanism which is significantly different from that of allopurinol
829,to study the variations of blood constituents during water deprivation rats were deprived of water from six to twelve days control and rehydrated animals were also included in the study a significant increase was observed in sodium chloride and hematocrit throughout the experiment calcium bicarbonate and pco increased at days of treatment potassium inorganic phosphorus ph BE and blood buffer capacity did not NC in the course of the experiment rehydrated animals recovered to control levels in all the studied components except for ph and base excess which increased somewhat plasma volume changes could explain only partially electrolyte R2 the dehydration reaction is considered to be the main mechanism responsible for these changes unchanged hematocrit levels in water deprived animals suggest that after days of water ED there is no further loss of plasma water bicarbonate and pco changes showed a good relationship and may account for unchanged ph and base excess values
830,to analyze the toxic effects of carbromal it was necessary to have information on the concentrations of carbromal and of its metabolites in the organism this information can be obtained by a simple method based on gaschromatography that allows rapid specific sensitive and quantitative estimation of carbromal and of its hypnotically active metabolites bromoethylbutyramide and ethylbutyrylurea employing different detectors flame ionisation or EC detector the limit of detection for carbromal and of its two metabolites was nmolesg of tissue the method was used to study in rats the absorption and beta of carbromal including biotransformation of carbromal to bromoethylbutyramide and ethylbutyrylurea both metabolites significant amounts of which were found in SS and brain distribute evenly between serum and brain as does carbromal both metabolites were detectable in the organism for a longer time than carbromal carbromal was given orally to healthy volunteers at a dose of g nmoles highest serum concentrations nmolesml were found min T3 ingestion serum concentrations declined rapidly twentyfour hours later of the values were present in the SS beside carbromal considerable amounts up to nmolesml of bromoethylbutyramide were detected but only small amounts nmolesml of ethylbutyrylurea peak concentrations of these metabolites were recorded h after ingestion of carbromal as was the case in rats both metabolites were present in the organism for a longer time than carbromal
831,ca is a powerful inhibitor ki is congruent to mum of basal and prostaglandin e pgestimulated adenylate cyclase atp pyrophosphatelyase cyclizing ec activity in membranes obtained from homogenized human platelets ca but not the ionophore a decreased vmax of the reaction without an effect on the ks for atp neither atp nor pge affected ki for ca in intact platelets a induced ca influx and markedly inhibited pgestimulated rise in adenosine cyclic monophosphate camp levels guanylate cyclase gtp pyrophosphatelyase cyclizing ec activity was mainly found in the soluble fraction greater than both soluble and membrane bound enzymes were stimulated by mn and ca and inhibited by zn adenylate and guanylate cyclase activity were both present in a membrane fraction cyclase activity were both present in a membrane fraction which contained ca activated atpase activity and accumulated ca from the medium in the presence of atp and oxalate other evidence indicates that these CM originated in large part from the dense tubular system of the platelets it is proposed that concurrent inhibition of adenylate cyclase and stimulation of guanylate cyclase facilitates the direct initiating effect of ca on platelet secretion and aggregation
832,the optimal quantity and quality of protein for lowbirthweight infants is undefined in this study well appropriateforgestational age lowbirthweight infants weighing gm or less were grouped in three gestational age categories t to weeks t to weeks t to weeks each group was assigned randomly to either banked human milk bm or to one of four isocaloric formulas varying in quantity and quality of protein but not in mineral content or in fat content formula gm of protein per ml parts bovine whey proteins to parts bovine caseins formula gm of protein per ml formula gm of protein per ml formula gm of protein per ml caloric intake was kcal mlkgday for the formulas human milk was fed at mlkgday in order to attain a caloric intake approximately equal to that of the formulas no significant differences were found in the rate of growth in CR length in femoral length in head circumference or in rate of gain in weight from time of regaining birthweight to time of discharge at gm BUN urine osmolarity total serum protein SS albumin and serum globulin varied directly with the quantity of protein in the diet f f greater than f f greater than bm blood ammonia concentration varied with both quantity and quality of protein in the diet f f f greater than f bm metabolic acidosis was more frequent more severe and more prolonged in the infants fed the caseinpredominant formulas ff than in those fed the whey proteinpredominant formulas f f
833,illumination causes the extrusion of protons from halobacterium halobium cell env vesicles as a result of the action of CS on bacteriorhodopsin the protonmotive force developed is coupled to the active transport of na out of the vesicles the lightdependent ion fluxes in these vesicles were studied by following changes in the external ph in the fluorescence of the dye dipentyloxadicarbocyanine in the na content of the LDV and in hdibenzyldimethylammonium dda accumulation during na efflux and dependent on the presence of na inside the LDV the initial lightinduced h extrusion is followed by h influx which results in net alkalinization of the medium at ph greater than when the na content of the LDV is depleted the original net of the medium is restored and C1 deltaph develops accompanied by a decrease in the electrical potential data reported elsewhere suggest that the driving force for the transport of some amino acids consists mainly of the electrical potential while for others it comprises the na gradient as well glutamate transport appears to be energized only by the na gradient the development of the na gradient during illumination thus plays an important role in energy coupling the results obtained are consistent with the existence of an electrogenic hna antiport mechanism hna greater than in h halobium which facilitates the uphill na efflux the lightinduced protonmotive force thereby becomes the driving force in forming a na gradient the presence of the proposed hna antiporter explains many of the lightinduced ph effects in IN h halobium cells
834,the level of fc receptor rosetteforming lymphocytes fcrfl was examined in spleen and CL node cell suspension from neonatal da and bn rats inoculated within hr of birth with either allogeneic l exp or syngeneic control lymphoid cells in addition these levels were compared to fetal and neonatal animals that received no i.t. the indicator cells ea were sheep erythrocytes sensitized with onehalf concentration of the highest dilution of rb SRBC igga which agglutinated an equal amount of suspension of e care was taken to exclude scoring macrophages by injecting colloidal carbon at least hr before killing the test animals the SP of day da fetal rats exhibited a level of fcrfl similar to that of animals having received adult syngeneic cells at birth by day thereafter the level of fcrfl did not vary appreciably between these two groups however as early as DAI there was a significantly greater number of fcrfl in the spleen of experimental da neonates compared to controls the lymph nodes of experimental animals did not exhibit a significantly greater number of fcrfl until day with both tissue compartments peaking at day and remaining significantly higher than controls until death in neonatal bn animals significantly higher levels of fcrfl in experimental animals were not evident as early and peaked later day in both tissue compartments but again these differences remained until death cytotoxic alloantisera demonstrated that on days and most if not all of the fcrfl were host in origion in both da and bn gvhd with a very significant host plasma cell response in such gvhd animals onemicron tissue section revealed the presence of a great number of plasma cell especially prominent in the medulla of lymph NO with the cortex of lymph nodes and WG pulp of the spleen markedly depleted of lymphocytes indicative of cytotoxicity
835,the dose dependence of the acute effects of ethanol upon liver intermediary metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in rats ethanol was given ip in doses of and gkg in equal volumes mlkg the liver was freezeclamped min T3 injection and multiple metabolites were measured in the perchloric acid extract of the tissue each group showed a significantly different pattern of metabolites redox states and phosphorylation potentials although the rate of ethanol disappearance at least between the two highest dose CG was not significantly different the mitochondrial free nadnadh ratios and the cytoplasmic free nadpnadph ratio were paradoxically most reduced with the lowest dose of ethanol and became progressively more oxidized with increasing dose once established the differences in these ratios between the groups tended to persist with time relatively independent of the concentration of ethanol in a somewhat different DP the phosphorylation potential atpadpp remained at the control level in the lowdose group but was significantly elevated in the two higherdose groups the results therefore show distinct and complicated dosedependent patterns of intermediary metabolism that cannot be explained CR by any one hypothesis but that imply significant dosedependent effects of ethanol upon intermediary metabolism not directly related to nadh production
836,further evidence that the uptake of chexylamine determined by centrifugal filtration of spinach chloroplast thylakoids through silicone fluid layers gives precise estimations of lightinduced h concentration gradients deltaph is presented deltaph was independent of the amount of thylakoids used or of the concentration of hexylamine moreover hexylamine uptake was sensitive to the osmolarity of the suspending medium internal h concentration hin is proportional to the rate of electron flow when CS intensity was used to vary these parameters proportionality was still observed in the presence of and mum gramicidin d when however hin and electron flow were varied by increasing the concentration of gramicidin d at constant CS intensity the rate of electron flow was approximately proportional to hin the phosphorylation efficiency pe ratio falls with decreasing CS intensity or increasing concentrations of the phosphorylation inhibitor deoxyphlorizin the proportionality between the rate of electron flow and hin allows the calculation of the rate of nonphosphorylating basal electron flow if hin under phosphorylating conditions is known the contribution of basal electron flow a consequence of passive efflux of h from the thylakoids to the overall rate of electron flow increases as the rate of phosphorylation decreases pe ratios calculated using rates of electron flow from which the basal component has been subtracted are constant a calculated pe ratio of about is obtained it is shown that the reciprocal of the phosphorylation efficiency should be proportional to hin when these parameters are varied using CS intensity this relationship was verified and provided an estimate of the pe at infinite hin this value was these results provide further evidence that a h electrochemical gradient serves to couple photophosphorylation to electron flow and that the rate of phosphorylation is proportional to hin that is three h are translocated out of thylakoids for each adenosine triphosphate formed
837,the effect of back diffusion of h pon the potential difference pd ER r and short circuit current isc of spontaneously secreting and burimamideinhibited amphibian gastric mucosae were studied in vitro when back diffusion of h was induced by the passage of an electrical current of mua per cm from the secretory s side of ph to the nutrient side n for min the spontaneously secreting mucosae showed small decreases in pd leads to mv and isc leads to mua per cm but no significant change in r in the burimamideinhibited mucosae there were marked and significantly greater decreases of pd leads to mv r leads to ohms cm and isc leads to mua per cm when back DWI of h was induced by establishing a concentration gradient of h from s leads to n or by exposing the secretory surface to sodium taurocholate with secretory ph the burimamideinhibited tissue demonstrated significantly greater depression of the electrical parameters than the secreting mucosae intracellular ph measured by the dimethoxyazolidinedione method was significantly higher in the histaminestimulated tissues than in the metiamideinhibited tissues these studies strongly suggest that the secretory status of the mucosa and hence its acidbase status are important determinants in the tolerance of the tissue to exogenous back diffusion of h the measure of absolute loss of h from the mucosal solution CT may not be an adequate assessment of the gastric mucosal barrier
838,the effect of timolol versus propranolol on hypertension hemodynamics and plasms renin activity was evaluated in men after two weeks of PL men received timolol to mg daily and nine men received propranolol to mg daily for five weeks in a doubleblind randomized study the men then received PL again for two weeks right HR catheterization was performed in all patients after two weeks of the first placebo and after five weeks of timolol or propranolol equipotent doses of timolol and propranolol were equally effective in significantly lowering supine and upright systolic and diastolic blood pressure and HR rate recorded on an outpatient basis equipotent doses of timolol and propranolol caused similar hemodynamic effects including similar significant depression of cardiac index equipotent doses of timolol and propranolol caused similar marked depression of plasma renin activity the hypotensive action of timolol and of propranolol was unrelated to their effect on plasma renin activity
839,transmitter PR at mg depressed frog neuromuscular junctions can be described using binomial statistics the number of quanta m released by the nerve terminal action potential is directly proportional to the mean probability p that a quantum will be released and the number of quanta available for PR n guanidine or tetraethylammonium tea increased m and n but had no effect on p at junctions depressed by dtubocurarine both compounds enhanced the amplitude of the initial endplate potential caused an accelerated rate of fade of endplate potential amplitudes and raised the steadystate level of endplate potential amplitude this finding was interpreted to mean that DTG and tea increased transmitter mobilization and may be related to the increase by the compounds of the parameters n if so then the data support the idea that n represents the number of quanta available for release rather than the number of transmitter PR sites in the terminal membrane neither compound affected the power relationship between cao and transmitter PR when plotted on a double logarithmic basis the Mw of the line relating cao to increased transmitter release was a relationship not altered by the drugs thus the compounds had no effect on the fundamental interaction between ca and transmitter release CS in contrast to cao the power relationship between increased transmitter release and the concentration of drug in the bathing solution was for guanidine and for tea because of this finding it was concluded that the EDC increased transmitter release by mechanisms other than or in addition to increasing ca conductance
840,a doubleblind controlled trial based on women undergoing abortus provocatus was employed to study whether the frequency of side effects C2 of the anaesthetic ketalar ketamine could be reduced by a concurrent dose of rohypnol flunitrazepam the control group was given ketamine CT the dosage of ketamine was mgkg body weight supplemented if necessary by mgkg in combination with either mg flunitrazepam or PL no other anaesthetics were used on several counts the combination of ketamine and flunitrazepam was proved to reduce the adverse reactions seen with ketamine alone motor restlessness and confusion in the awakening state occurred with significantly less severity and frequency amnesia for dreams was significantly more frequent memory of dreams was often unpleasant T3 ketamine alone the influence on pulse rate was significantly smaller and no significant changes in systolic blood pressure were seen whereas a significant increase occurred with ketamine alone less pronounced fluctuations in diastolic blood pressure occurred with the combination ketamineflunitrazepam respiratory rate increased significantly with both treatments but respiratory minute volume was lower with the ketamineflunitrazepam combination
841,according to recommended international standards edible fungi are blanched before salting and freezing a study was conducted on the solution losses of lactarius rufus due to blanching weight losses changes of DM raw fat total nitrogen amino nitrogen and ash contents as well as the ph value were determined when various methods of blanching were used min blanching at degrees c was able to inactivate catalase and peroxydase while min blanching was needed for inactivating polyphenoloxydase totally after blanching there were of spores left during the min blanching in water five times the quantity of mushrooms the losses of dry matter were about when doubling the quantity of blanching water the losses increased to fold the doubling of blanching time had no significant influence on the losses the soluble DM content of blanched mushrooms was less than of that of the fresh total nitrogen of fresh mushrooms was equal to that of the blanched but the amino nitrogen decreased to one tenth by blanching the mineral element content of blanched mushrooms was about the half of that of the fresh blanching caused a slight decrease in the ph value the necessity of the blanching of all edible fungi before freezing was discussed
842,the solubility of fatty acids in aqueous solutions containing bile salts and lysolecithin at ph values between and was studied both the acyl and acyl isomers of LL increased the solubility of fatty acids to the same extent the order of solubility being linoleic greater than OA greater than elaidic greater than palmitic greater than stearic the influence of the products of phospholipolysis of lecithin on palmitic acid solubility was determined on a molar basis lysolecithin was more effective than were bile salts in promoting the CMS of the fatty acid in bile salt solutions in which the phospholipid concentration was constant on a molar basis in solubility of palmitic acid decreased linearly with the progressive replacement of lecithin by lysolecithin palmitic acid was solubilized to the same extent on replacing lecithin with lysolecithin on a constant weight basis in bile salt solution containing lysolecithin and OA in equimolar amounts the solubility of palmitic acid was similar to that in bile salt solution containing lecithin in equivalent proportion the results are discussed in relation to the action of phospholipolytic activity on the intestinal absorption of fatty acids in sheep
843,the intensity of light scattering from suspensions of membrane fragments prepared by sonication of beef heart mitochondria in the presence of edta at ALP ph esmp was determined at and degrees with CS of wavelength nm the dissymmetry ratio z i degrees ci degrees c where i degrees c and i degrees c are the scattering intensities at and degrees extrapolated to zero particle concentration and corrected for reflectance effects was used to calculate particle size from the rayleighgansdebye theory an average particle diameter d of nm was obtained within the range of particle diameter nm determined previously by electron microscopy this average diameter determined by light scattering is a useful parameter for characterization of esmp particle size we propose the term light scattering average particle diameter dls for this parameter the refractive index of esmp was determined to be by measurement of scattering intensity in buffer solutions of varying SU concentration the value of z was independent of sucrose concentration in this determination showing that the particles are osmotically inactive toward SU the values of average particle diameter dls and of refractive index fall within the range of validity of the rayleighgansdebye theory for which CS scattering changes are attributable solely to dimension change rather than to change in particle refractive index uptake of water accompanying energylinked salt uptake in esmp was calculated from light scattering changes to be mul of homg of protein compared with mul of homg of protein measured by dextran inaccessibility measurement of light scattering changes provides a rapid and sensitive method for determining volume changes of esmp the magnitude of the volume change observed during energylinked water and salt uptake and the initial degree of hydration suggests that esmp are analogous to polyelectrolyte gels with regard to sorption of strong electrolytes and that the donnan formulation for ion exchange equilibria may be usefully applied to these processes in esmp
844,lesional pulmonary edema caused by substances which are directly caustic for the gastrointestinal pathways strong acids and bases inhaled vomit are opposed by their immediate and LT gravity with those due to cardiotropic medicamentatous toxins or volemic overloading which lead to curable pulmonary edema material and human AF in favour of accidental intoxication are compensated for by the fact that many toxins produce vapours which are strongly irritant for the upper respiratory pathways this prevents prolonged exposure and therefore wards off edema drug intoxication by ingestion can lead to pulmonary edema by relative or absolute volemic overload by allergic accidents or by immaturity of the enzyme degradation systems it seems to us that the notions of neurological and metabolic toxic edema should be abandoned in lesional edema the treatment is that of the ARDS the combination of pethidine promethazine and chlorpromazine gives good immediate results owing to careful followup hemodynamic pulmonary edema should most frequently be avoided
845,the feasibility of using isoelectric focusing for the separation of primate pituitary growth hormone from prolactin and for the characterization of polymorphic forms of these hormones was explored in a ph gradient extracts of both human and cynomolgus monkey pituitaries were each resolved into growth hormone components and at least prolactin components as shown by radioimmunoassay in narrower gradients of ph units greater resolution was achieved the principal growth hormone components were well separated from the principal prolactin components but there was overlapping of some minor components a partially purified human prolactin preparation was found to contain prolactin components one of which had a prolactingrowth hormone ratio of clinical grade human growth hormone was also resolved into at least prolactin and growth hormone components many of which had higher pi values than those found in PIT extract under the conditions used both growth hormone and prolactin were found to be polymorphic with respect to isoelectric point some of the human prolactin components were found to contain less than growth hormone by radioimmunoassay monkey growth hormone containing prolactin was isolated these findings demonstrate that isoelectric focusing is useful for the preparation of both growth hormone and prolactin which are essentially free of one another furthermore the polymorphic forms were repeatedly found in S9 obtained by several methods and from different species suggesting that these forms are not artifacts
846,a chromatinbound protease active in m nacl m urea or m urea alone was demonstrated in rat liver kidney testes brain rabbit bone marrow chicken reticulocyte and ehrlich ascites chromatin chicken erythrocyte chromatin did not possess any detectable proteolytic activity in salt and urea the proteolytic activity of rat CL chromatin in salt and urea was found to be independent of the methods of chromatin preparation the protease can be inhibited by the serine specific reagents phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and diisopropyl fluorophosphate and the alkylating reagent carbobenzoxyphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone in the presence of organic solvents at mm concentration the inhibitions of chromatinbound protease in rat liver by these compounds are irreversible on the other hand carbobenzoxyphenylalanine and pnitrophenyl acetate were shown to be reversible inhibitors of rat liver chromatinbound protease the application of these inhibitors during the dissociation of chromatin by salt and urea may be useful to researchers interested in purifying various chromosomal proteins or to those researchers doing reconstitution studies with labile chromatins
847,reserpine induces pontogeniculooccipital wave activity similar to that seen in the cat during the rapid eye movement phase of sleep this action of reserpine was blocked by the monoamine oxidase inhibitors pheniprazine harmaline and clorgyline but not deprenyl or its demethylated analog T3 a single dose mgkg of either pheniprazine or harmaline the time course of antagonism of the effect of reserpine was in good correspondence with inhibition of MA oxidase but not with restoration of the serotonin content of several regions of the BB harmaline had a reversible effect while that of pheniprazine persisted for weeks clorgyline in low doses mgkg at which it is a TPS inhibitor of type a monoamine oxidase antagonized the action of reserpine for over weeks deprenyl and its demethylated analog failed to suppress the reserpineinduced waves even at times the dose of clorgyline when they should have completely inhibited type b MAO-A in contrast to antagonism of reserpine suppression of REM by these monoamine oxidase inhibitors could be temporally dissociated from their inhibition of the enzyme it is concluded that suppression of the induction of pontogeniculooccipital waves by reserpine T3 administration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors is a specific effect of these drugs and is related to inhibition of type a MAO-A suppression of rapid eye movement sleep is probably a nonspecific effect and not related to inhibition of the enzyme
848,six strains of virus were recovered from the blood andor liver of five clethrionomys gapperi ochraceus trapped in southeastern massachusetts during biological antigenic and physiochemical properties of these isolates are reported usa ma was selected as the reference strain this strain was identical by complementfixation and neutralization tests to whitneys c gapperie virus usa from NYS and was related to but distinct from an unpublished agent johnsons microtus montanus enterovirus usa m isolated in june from voles trapped in klamath county oregon usa ma was resistant to lipid solvents and acid ph and was SD at temperatures of c c and c virus was detected over a day observation period in four species of mosquitoes inoculated with usa ma although there was no evidence of infection or replication and transmission attempts by bite failed NT antibody was detected in cg gapperi and c g ochraceus in various habitats throughout the state
849,at columbiapresbyterian medical center during the sixyear period there were cases of sepsis from gramnegative pathogens of these originated in the urinary tract of these patients dieda mortality rate of percent there were deaths among the patients with sepsis from GN organismsa mortality rate of percent previously in the and periods the mortality rates had been percent and percent respectively the lowered mortality rate during for urologic sepsisshock was associated with improved management procedures a preventive measures such as postponement of urologic instrumentation and surgical intervention in patients infected with drugresistant urea splitters until the infection is under control with emergency surgical patients being treated by susceptibilitytested drugs to control possible postoperative complications b early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis and immediate administration of bactericidal antibiotics parenterally c immediate restoration of fluidelectrolyte balance with monitoring of renal and pulmonary functions and metabolic acidosis and d early administration of large pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids with monitoring of the MC and use of betaadrenergic isoproterenol
850,in pseudomonas aeruginosa the synthesis of histidase urocanase and amidase is severly repressed when succinate is added to a culture growing in pyruvate ammonium salts medium when growth is nitrogenlimited catabolite repression by succinate of histidase and urocanase synthesis does not occur but succinate repression of amidase synthesis persists amidase synthesis is not regulated in the same way as histidase synthesis by the availability of other nitrogen EDC for growth growth of p aeruginosa strain paci in succinate histidine media is nitrogenlimited since this strain is defective in a histidine transport system when methylammonium chloride is added to succinate histidine media growth inhibition occurs mutants isolated from succinate histidine methylammonium chloride plates were found to be resistant to catabolite repression by succinate even in ammonium salts media it is suggested that the hut genes of p aeruginosa may be regulated in the same way as in klebsiella aerogenes by induction by urocanate and activation by either the cyclic ampdependent activator protein or by glutamine synthetase
851,the characteristics of ca transport across the excitable membrane of paramecium aurelia were studied by measuring ca influx and efflux the intracellular concentration of free ca in resting p aurelia was at least ten times less than the extracellular concentration ca influx was easily measurable at degrees c but not at degrees c the influx of ca was stimulated by the same conditions which cause membrane depolarization and ciliary reversal addition of na and k which stimulate ciliary reversal resulted in a fold increase in the rate of ca influx an externally applied pulsed electric field macm of electrode surface caused the rate of ca influx to increase times with the extent of stimulation dependent on the current density and the PW ca influx had the characteristics of a passive transport system and was associated with the chemically or electrically triggered ca gating mechanism which has been studied electrophysiologically in contrast ca efflux appeared to be catalyzed by an AS transport system with cells previously loaded at degrees c with ca ca efflux was rapid at degrees c but did not occur at degrees c this AS ca efflux mechanism is probably responsible for maintaining the low internal ca levels in unstimulated cells
852,the effects of neuraminidase and phospholipase c on the contractility and the ca binding of guinea pig taenia coli were investigated potassium contracture or histamineinduced contracture of taenia coli was inhibited by treatment with neuraminidase though acetylcholineinduced contracture was not treatment with phospholipase c markedly inhibited the contracture induced by isotonic potassium histamine or acetylcholine by treatment with neuraminidase for hr about mumol mg wer wt of sialic acid was released from taenia coli this corresponded to twofifths of total content of sialic acid by treatment with phospholipase c for hr a similar amount of sialic acid to that produced by neuraminidase treatment was released the scarchard plot of cabinding was a biphasic pattern indicating the presence of two types ofthe ca binding site with different affinity constants neuraminidase produced a decrease in the amount of bound ca the scatchard plot of ca IB changed to a monophasic DP indicating the disapperance of thel ow affinity ca IB site phospholipase c caused a decrease of bound ca the scatchard plot also indicated the disappearance of the low affinity ca binding site from these results we speculated that sialicacid residue of surface membrane of the muscle cell was first site in the ca influx mechanism
853,the thermodynamics and molecular basis of energylinked conformational changes in the cytochrome aa and atp synthetase complexes of the mitochondrial membrane have been studied with spectrophotometrical and fluorometrical techniques ferric cytochrome aa exists in two conformations high spin and low spin the equilibrium between these states being controlled by the electrical potential difference across the mitochondrial membrane the conformational change is brought about by an electrical fielddriven binding of one proton per aa to the complex at ph the concentration of the two conformations is equal at a membrane potential of mv corresponding to about kcalmole the high to low spin transition in ferric aa is also induced by hydrolysis of atp in which case two molecules of aa are shifted per atp molecule hydrolyzed this is in accordance with translocation of two protons across the mitochondrial membrane coupled to hydrolysis of atp as proposed in the chemiosmotic theory of oxidative phosphorylation the conformational transition in cytochrome aa is not an expression of the formation of a highenergy intermediate or reversal of the energytransducing pathway of oxidative phosphorylation but is presumably the basis of allosteric control of the activity of cytochrome oxidase by the energy state of the mitochondrion this control is exerted by a RII mechanism in which the electrical potential difference controls the conformation and redox properties of the heme centres and thereby the rate of oxygen consumption the synthesis of one molecule of atp by oxidative phosphorylation is energetically equivalent to the work done in carrying two electrical charges across the entire mitochondrial membrane fluorescence changes of aurovertin bound to atp synthetase reveal that the electrical membrane potential induces a conformational change in the f portion of the enzyme which is probably associated with dissociation of the NK f inhibitor protein this conformational NC is energetically equivalent to the work done in carrying one electrical charge across the mitochondrial membrane a model is proposed for the mechanism of the electrical fieldinduced conformational changes in the cytochrome aa and atp synthetase complexes and the significance of these changes in the mechanism and control of mitochondrial energy conservation is discussed
854,hypercapnic acidosis ph inhibits the lipolytic response of canine subcutaneous adipose tissue to iv infused noradrenaline na by per cent or more the response to sympathetic nerve stimulation on the other hand is only reduced by per cent during acidosis the fate of intravenously infused hlabelled na ug x kg x min for min was not significantly altered by acidosis the rate of disappearance of unmetabolized na from the arterial plasma after an infusion was the same at ph and and the calculated increase in circulating na during infusions was ngml at both phs iv infusion of na increases adipose tissue blood flow an effect which is att by acidosis there was a significant correlation p less than between AT blood flow and the lipolytic response at normal ph preventing the nainduced increase in blood flow by constant flow perfusion reduced the lipolytic response at normal ph the degree of inhibition by acidosis of the lipolytic response to iv na was significantly reduced from to per cent p less than when the adipose tissue was perfused at constant flow these data suggest that adipose tissue blood flow is important in determining the lipolytic response to iv na probably by influencing the delivery of na to the tissue the marked inhibition by acidosis of lipolysis due to iv infused na therefore appears to be the combined effect of a direct antilipolytic effect of acidosis and a decreased delivery of na to the AT due to the att blood flow response
855,the effects of premedication on gastric juice volume and ph were evaluated in five CG of pediatric patients undergoing elective surgical procedures group control received no premedication group was given morphine sulfate and pentobarbital as premedicants the other CG received in addition to morphine and pentobarbital atropine group scopolamine group or glycopyrrolate group after endotracheal intubation gastric aspirates were examined for volume ph and color neither premedication with morphine and pentobarbital nor addition of atropine or scopolamine to the premedication significantly altered volume in patients treated with glycopyrrolate volume was reduced to less than a third of that of patients in group p less than and the percentage of phs higher than was significantly greater than in other groups the incidences of unobtainable samples and samples with phs higher than were greatest with atropine per cent p less than and glycopyrrolate per cent p less than in per cent of the bilestained specimens phs were below it is concluded that because of its selective inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretions glycopyrrolate appears superior to other anticholinergic drugs the reduction of gastric juice volume and pH produced by glycopyrrolate would have important clinical implications in case of accidental aspiration it is also concluded that bile IF of gastric contents is not a reliable indicator of gastric juice ph
856,isolated biopsy specimens of human peripheral arteries and veins preincubated with h noradrenaline na to label the neural stores of na were used to study the betaadrenoceptors previously found to increase the secretion of hna evoked by electrical field stimulation of the adrenergic nerves of this tissue the increase in nerve stimulation induced secretion of hna caused by mum isoprenaline was prevented by mum propranolol this betablocking drug by itself slightly but significantly depressed the secretion of hna caused by nerve stimulation in the absence of isoprenaline while the secretion of hna was not affected by known betaagonists it was dosedependently and reversibly increased by two different betaagonists the effect of isoprenaline on hna secretion was not altered by a selective betaantagonist but strongly reduced or abolished by a betablocking drug the results indicate that the betaadrenoceptors involved in the control of na secretion from the vasoconstrictor nerves of human omental blood vessels are only to a minimal extent stimulated by na secreted from the SN and therefore do probably not mainly serve to mediate local positive feedback control of transmitter secretion the receptors appear to be beta in nature
857,the vascular wall is rich in glucoseaminglicanes gag which form the basic ICS and determine its multiple functions using analytic and chromatographic methods the author examined hexauronic acid ha pentoses p sulphate groups and various derivatives of gag hyaluronic acid ha pentoses p sulphate groups and various derivatives of gag hyaluronic acid ha dermatansulfate ds keratansulfate ks chondroitinsulfate hs and cheransulfate hes in human aorta obtained from persons at the age of and over years of age ten aortas of each group were examined the studies showed that in the aortas of the adult persons the content of ha p HS ks and sulphate groups was considerably higher than that of the aourtas obtained form the young persons there was an impression that the AD factor affected substantialy the qualitative characteristics of gagwith advancement of age the lenght of polysaccharide chains was shortened and the degree of sulphatation was increased the accumulation of acid gag in the aorta of adult persons impaired the metabolism of substances between blood and tissue which enhanced the infiltration of the blood vessels with lipids and proteins especialy when there was a blood increase in their content hyperlipemia hypercholesterinemia ect
858,work on food planned by the um use and management section of the uk committe was limited to sources of protein because we agreed that more problems calling for research were likely to arise in getting adequate supplies of protein than of other types of food deer meat can be produced on land too Rg and exposed for sheep parts of the work on their metabolism and food requirements necessitated building a mobile laboratory the manner in which the nutritive value of maize is affected by changes in the ratios in which the component proteins are present stimulated similar studies on barley and groundnut there is good SQ protein in coconuts and leaves but its use in human food is restricted by the presence of fibre methods for separating protein from fibre and other deleterious components were improved in cooperation with scientists in india and nigeria the potential yield of proteindeficient foods eg cassava were ennobled by growing microorganisms on them with the addition of a cheap source of nitrogen
859,the rudermans preparation was utilized to investigate in situ some aspects of the muscular metabolism both at rest and during submaximal exercise upon BL sciatic nerve stimulation andor during perfusion with some vasodilators papaverine caffeine nicergoline bamethan o and gl uptake the production of lactate and the glycogen level of the muscle were studied the availability of acetoacetate modifies the muscular metabolism other fuels eg the ketone body itself are probably used for energetic purposes both under basal conditions and during exercise even in the presence of high glycogen concentrations in the tissues some vasodilators increase the utilization of other fuels in replacement of glycogen eg nicergoline some others increase the ulilization of glycogen itself eg bamethan and caffeine whereas others eg papaverine do not effect the biochemical parameters studied the present data confirm the importance both of the ATP availability and of the SP of drugs to interfere with some enzymatic systems which modulate the utilization of available substrates especially during exercise
860,auto and homo transplantation of the uterus and ovaries was studied in bitches divided into four groups group a served as a control in group b the omentopexy technique of autotransplantation was used this method did not prove very rewarding and all grafts were found to have degenerated and were nonfunctioning when relaparotomy was performed months Tx in group c auto transplantation with vascular anastomosis was performed in dogs yielding satisfactory results including one successful pregnancy and the delivery of healthy puppies in group d homotransplantation of the internal genital organs was performed in two sets of twin dogs no immunosuppressive treatment was used these grafts survived for a limited period as proved by the PET tests and xray examination but T3 months were found to be necrotic and degenerated VG CF and viability was established by xray examination cytology of vaginal smears the effect of gonadotropins on the grafted ovaries and finally relaparotomy undertaken T3 weeks and months
861,we describe a method for measuring the release of fatty acids from endogenous substrates of human platelet homogenates and membranes the method depends on the availability of lipids whose fatty acids are oddchained and therefore suitable as internal reference EDC that at the time of lipid extraction can be added to an incubation to permit subsequent quantification of the content of free fatty acids or fatty acids esterified to TPS lipids we found four types of lipolytic MICs in human platelets in homogenates at ph a triglyceride lipase operated as shown by the synchrony of triglyceride degradation and release of glycerol and those fatty acids that are the predominant constituents of triglycerides however enough arachidonic acid was released at this ph level to suggest some phospholipid breakdown since triglycerides hold relatively small amounts of this acid with membranous S9 in the ALP ph range there were two peaks of fatty acid release with accompanying degradation of phospholipids at ph where release of the saturated acids palmitic and stearic predominated their sum was times that of AA acid at ph the release of palmitic and stearic acids was only slightly below their peak values however the PR of arachidonic acid nearly equaled the sum of the saturated acids linoleic acid was not released in representative amounts by those reactions that released AA despite the overwhelming propensity of both to be esterified at the position of phospholipids pertinently the choline phospholipids are linoleicrich and the noncholine phospholipids linoleicpoor while both have a generous endowment of AA with this in mind we raise the possibility that the phospholipase a of human platelets is an endoenzyme because of its tendency to act on those phospholipids that are thought to comprise the inner layer of the CM
862,antifreeze glycoprotein which has previously been shown to be inactive in the presence of borate migrates electrophoretically as the borate complex presumably through formation of borate complexes with hydroxyl CG on the sugar side chains antifreeze glycoprotein mgml has been found to be CR AS in the presence of m borate at ph but inactive at ph a titration curve of ph versus the antifreeze activity of glycoprotein mgml in m borate showed a progressive decrease in antifreeze activity as the ph was increased concomitant with decreases in activity were increases in IB of borate at ph nearly mol of borate were complexed per glycotripeptide ultracentrifuge analyses showed similar molecular weights and laser quasielastic CS scattering showed similar diffusions at ph and in borate and in the absence of borate the IB of borate rather than a NC in conformation is thus directly related to the loss of antifreeze activity alkaline borate also decreased hemagglutinating activity of osage orange lectin and decreased the inhibition of the activity by the antifreeze glycoproteins
863,studies of the thermal stability of rat CL glucosephosphatase ec were carried out to further elevate the proposal that the enzymic activity is the result of the coupling of a glucosepspecific translocase and a nonspecific phosphohydrolasephosphotransferase inactivation was observed when micorsomes were incubated at mild temperatures between ph and the rate of inactivation increased either with increasing hydrogen ion concentration or temperature however no inactivation was seen below degrees in media as low as ph or at neutral ph up to degrees the thermal stability of the enzyme may be controlled by the physical state of the membrane lipids and the degree of protonation of specific residues in the enzyme protein microsomes were exposed to inactivating conditions and kinetic analyses were made of the glucosep phosphohydrolase activities before and T3 supplementation to sodium taurocholate the results support the postulate and the kinetic characteristics of a given preparation of intact microsomes are determined by the relative capacities of the transport and catalytic components before detergent treatment inactivation ie a decrease in vmax was accompanied by a decrease in km and a reduction in the fraction of latent activity whereas only vmax was depressed in disrupted S9 the possibility that the inactivating treatments caused concurrent disruption of the microsomal membrane was ruled out it is concluded that exposures to mild heat in acidic media selectively inactivate the catalytic component of the glucosephosphatase system while preserving an IN permeability barrier and a functional glucosep transport system analyses of kinetic data obtained in the present and earlier studies revealed several fundamental mathematical relationships among the kinetic constants describing the glucosep phosphohydrolase MICs of IN ie the system and disrupted microsomes ie the catalytic component the quantitative relationships appear to provide a means to calculate a velocity constant vt and a halfsaturation constant kt for glucosep influx the well documented differential responses of the rat CL glucosephosphatase system induced by starvation exp diabetes or cortisol administration were analyzed in terms of these relationships the possible influences of cisternal inorganic phosphate on the apparent kinetic constants of the intact system are discussed
864,electrocatalysis in fuel cells requires as well substances capable of catalyzing the anodic oxidation of fuels as catalysts for the cathodic reduction of oxygen several dyestuffs that catalyze oxygen reduction are known but up to now only one has been described as AS in anodic reactions all these dyestuffs are nchelates comparative studies have shown that chelates with other types of coordination in particular n ns and schelates are able to catalyze the reduction of oxygen though they are considerably less active than the ncompounds with a given type of coordination the nature of the central atom has a decisive influence on the catalytic activity of the dyestuff whereas substitution on the organic skeleton has only a slight effect thermal pretreatment of the nchelates can considerably increase their stability in electrolytes containing sulfuric acid all the exp results point to the conclusion that with electrocatalysts as with natural oxygen carriers the interaction essential for catalysis takes place between the oxygen and the central metal ion various assumptions may be made as to the nature of the ratedetermining step the cathodic reduction of oxygen can be regarded as redox catalysis or it can be considered from the standpoint of molecular orbital theory the models hitherto suggested for the mechanism of oxygen reduction are tested against the experimental results and a modified MM based on mo theory is put forward
865,the nethenoadenine derivatives of triphosphopyridine and reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotides tpn and tpnh epsilontpn and epsilontpnh have been synthesized and used as fluorescent probes to examine the pyridine nucleotide binding site of l DHF reductase epsilontpnh km mum was able to replace tpnh km mum in the enzymecatalyzed reduction of dihyrdofolate and both epsilontpn and epsilontpnh formed binary complexes with the enzyme that were SD to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the fluorescence of epsilontpn was enhanced and the emission maximum shifted from to nm when the nucleotide was bound to the enzyme the ethenoadenine moiety in epsilontpnh behaved similarily but the fluorescence changes were complicated by concurrent effects of binding upon the dihydronicotinamide fluorophore fluorescence enhancement titrations yielded values of and mum respectively for the dissociation constants of the enzymeepsilontpn and enzymeepsilontpnh complexes titration experiments based upon quenching of enzyme fluorescence gave similar values viz and mum for the dissociation constants of these complexes fluorimetric titration of the enzymetpnh complex with epsilontpn or of the enzymetpn complex with epsilontpnh failed to reveal the presence of a second pyridine nucleotide binding site the fluorescence enhancement of enzymebound epsilontpn or dihydrofolate was quenched when amethopterin or epsilontpn respectively was added to form a ternary complex these results provide information concerning the nature of the pyridine nucleotide binding site and its spatial relationship to the dihydrofolateamethopterin binding site
866,twenty patients with definite or CP rheumatoid arthritis and chronic knee effusions were each given an oral dose of g benorylate as the suspension synovial fluid and plasma samples were obtained up to hours after drug administration and assayed for their salicylate and benorylate content a mean peak benorylate plasma level of mugml occurred min after drug administration but declined rapidly and benorylate was virtually undetectable in the plasma min later the mean peak benorylate synovial fluid level of mugml occurred hours after drug administration but the concentration remained steady for at least a further hours a mean peak plasma salicylate level of mugml and mean peak synovial fluid salicylate level of mugml occurred hours after benorylate administration both C2 declined slowly over some hours this study shows that benorylate per se readily enters the synovial fluid in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and continues to accumulate there even when undetectable in the plasma it is possible that the lipophilic nature of the benorylate molecule facilitates its uptake by the inflamed synovial tissue
867,hnorethisterone beta betaepoxide a metabolite of norethisterone was incubated with several proteins and nucleic acids after min incubation nmol of the epoxide were irreversibly bound per mg albumin which contains free sulfhydryl CG proteins without shgroups such as concanavalin a gammaglobulin dna and rna did not irreversibly bind norethisterone epoxide a superoxide o generating enzyme system comprised of xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine was capable of catalyzing the irreversible IB of the parent compound norethisterone to albumin indicating that an oxidation product was formed which reacted with the protein when norethisterone epoxide was incubated for min with hepatic microsomes of rats in absence of nadph about nmol of the epoxide were irreversibly incorporated per mg microsomal protein this IB was increased to nmol by addition of a nadph regenerating system addition of glutathione and cytosol decreased only the nadphdependent protein IB phenobarbital pretreatment of rats induced this nadphdependent binding of norethisterone epoxide to microsomal protein by a factor of in presence of nadph binding of the epoxide to microsomal protein depended on substrate concentration used the results indicate that norethisterone epoxide is able to chemically react with proteins in addition hepatic microsomal enzymes convert the epoxide to another metabolite which also can react with proteins
868,individual young AD B/W mice were irradiated with r and hr later injected with x spleen cells obtained from a sexmatched parentalstrain donor the injected animals were then followed for a period of months and loss of body weight mortality rate and other signs of fatal graftvshost disease gvhd were recorded the donorrecipient strain combinations were selected in such a way as to provide genetic differences in the entire h complex the k or d regions CT the k or the d end and the central i regions alone the data obtained on only few combinations indicate that strong gvhd mortality rate within the first month T3 the injection occurs only in those donorrecipient combinations which differ in the entire h complex or in the k end k i regions much weaker gvhd mortality rate of only or less and death of individual mice spread over the entire observation period is observed when the donor and the host differ in either the k i or d region CT the degree of gvhd induced by three regions when taken singularly is about the same surprisingly the kregion gvhd was somewhat stronger in combinations of mutant strains in comparison with recombinantstrain combinations
869,the range of indications for beta blocking substances has extended to various fields of pathology vascular system endocrinology the discovery of some of their side effects give good reasons to try to find out whether they should have a place in psychopharmacotherapy and wheter they could meet its present requirements the initial target symptoms were anxietywhich being polymorphous can be at various degrees reactionnal to obviously stressing surroundings but which is also implied by structural distortions of personalityand psychosomatic manifestations if their site of actions was initially thought peripherical it now seems that their action is also central genuinely psychotropic anxiolytic and non sedative psychoanaleptic and at the same time stimulating and increasing the level of attention we have observed in some cases a reduction of sleep timethymoanaleptic increasing the incitement to action on the other hand they QS certain excitation states caused by appearence of badly controled anxieties this study contains three series of experiments conceived with a similar methodology
870,the s coupling factor of oxidative phosphorylation from alcaligenes faecalis has a latent adenosine triphosphatase atpase function that can be activated by heating at degrees c for min at ph in glycerol the TPS activity increases from to mumol min mg adenosine triphosphate atp is not required for stabilization at degreesc when glycerol is present activation involves displacement of the endogenous atpase inhibitor subunit epsilon subunit and readdition of this S1 results in deactivation in the deactivation process the atpase inhibitor subunit can be replaced by other cationic proteins such as protamine histones or polylysine mg and h also are effective deactivators the fact that every positively charged substance tested deactivated the enzyme suggests that the inhibitor S1 is complexed with the enzyme at a site containing a surplus of negative charges the activated enzyme is not labile but it is salt labile having a halflife of min in m ki at either or degrees c the G1 atpase is also inhibited by aurovertin chloronitrobenzooxadiazole nbd and by the crosslinking agent dimethyl suberimidate evidence for polymorphism comes from finding that the properties of the unactivated enzyme intrinsic atpase are different in many ways from the properties of G1 atpase with respect to the coupling AF ability to hydrolyze atp the data in this study suggest that there are at least four distinct functional allomorphs of this enzyme the latent enzyme which has no kinetically measurable atpase activity intrinsic atpase which is catalyzed by a small percentage of the molecular population that has been activated by some natural mechanism G1 atpase which has properties different from those of intrinsic atpase and aged activated atpase in which some of the properties km for substrate sensitivity to deactivation by mg and h spontaneously change within min

873,interest in nucleic acid hybridization stems mainly from its great power as a tool in biological research it is used in several quite distinct ways because of the high degree of specificity that they show hybridization techniques can be used to measure the amount of one TPS CS within a very heterogeneous mixture of sequences measurements of have been recorded in extension of this various properties of a specific sequence can often be studied secondly because the kinetics of nucleic acid hybridization are quite well understood it can be used to characterize both a pure sequence and a very complex mixture of sequences like the genome of a vertebrate thirdly again because of its specificity it can be used to measure homologies between different populations of nucleic acids lastly in conjunction with other techniques it can be used as a basis for the fractionation of nucleic acid populations and the purification of TPS sequences TPS examples of these applications are given with special reference to the organization of the genome in higher eukaryotes
874,a new flavin prosthetic group has been isolated in pure form from the electrontransferring flavoprotein of peptostreptococcus elsdenni its structure has been established as the fad derivative of methylhydroxyisoalloxazine see article proof of this structure has been obtained by chemical syntehsis of methylhydroxyisoalloxazine models and by stepwise Kd of the native compound to methyhydroxyalloxazine the orange chromophore is characterized by a strong absorption band with a maximum at nm xi m cm and a pk at due to the ionisation of the coh group the properties of a series of functionally substituted derivatives of OH flavins and lumichromes have been investigated to provide a basis for interpreting the effects of ph on the spectroscopic properties of the OH derivatives of fad and fmn the OH derivative of fad is bound by apodamino acid oxidase the complex shows no catalytic activity the hydroxy derivative of fmn is bound by apoflavodoxin to give a complex which has catalytic activity similar to that of native flavodoxin the complex is reversibly reduced by dithionite first to a relatively stable semiquinone and further to the dihydroflavin form
875,arginine decarboxylase which makes its appearance in lathyrus sativus seedlings after h of seed germination reaches its highest level around days the cotyledons containing about of the total activity in the seedlings at day the cytosol enzyme was purified fold from whole seedlings by steps involving manganese chloride treatment ammonium sulphate and acetone fractionations positive adsorption on alumina cgamma gel deaesephadex chromatography followed by preparative disc gel PACE the enzyme was shown to be homogeneous by electrophoretic and immunological criteria had a molecular weight of and appears to be a hexamer with MZ subunits the optimal ph and temperature for the enzyme activity were and degrees c respectively the enzyme follows typical MM kinetics with a km value of mm for Arg though mn at lower concentrations stimulated the CEA there was no dependence of the enzyme on any metal for the activity the ADC of l sativus is a sulfhydryl enzyme the data on cofactor requirement inhibition by carbonyl reagents reducing agents and pyridoxal phosphate inhibitors and a partial reversal by pyridoxal phosphate of inhibition by pyridoxalhcl suggests that pyridoxal phosphate is involved as a cofactor for the enzyme the enzyme activity was inhibited competitively by various amines including the product agmatine highest inhibition was obtained with spermine and arcain the substrate analogue lcanavanine homologue lhomoarginine and other basic amino acids like llysine and Orn inhibited the enzyme activity competitively homoarginine being the most ERP in this respect
876,ltyrosineoxoglutarate aminotransferase ec tat and other enzymes that transaminate tyrosine in rat liver cytosol have been separated into four fractions by isoelectric focussing one of the forms is probably identical to mitochondrial laspartateoxoglutarate aminotransferase ec masat the other three forms have pis of and and km values of and mm for IMT and alphaketoglutarate these ST forms have little or no asat activity rat liver tat is also separated into three peaks by hydroxylapatite each fraction gives only one peak of activity when electrofocussed separately in the frog three CG of peaks of tat activity have been separated by hydroxylapatite column chromatography the first group is connected with asat activity these peaks pis and are ST and have a km value for tyrosine of mm these fractions probably represent cytoplasmic asat sasat the second group of peaks has at least two subforms pis and km for IMT mm these forms probably represent masat the third group consists of three forms that resemble the L1 forms of rat liver tat these results indicate that heterogeneity is common to many aminotransferases and independent of regulation by GCs
877,when coleoylcoa was incubated with a pealeaf TH oleate was both incorporated into microsomal snphosphatidylcholine and released as the free fatty acid the proportion of oleate incorporated into this phospholipid was dependent on the relative amounts of thiol ester and microsomal preparation present in reactions at the concentrations of microsomal preparation and coleoylcoa used to study oleate desaturation the metabolism of the thiol ester was essentially complete T3 min incubation but the loss of label from snphosphatidylcholine oleate and the concomitant increase in radioactivity in the linoleate of this phospholipid proceeded at approximately linear rates over a min period the kinetics of labelling of unesterified linoleate was consistent with the view that this labelled fatty acid was derived from snphosphatidylcholine oleate desaturation required oxygen and with unwashed microsomal fractions was stimulated either by nadph or by the g supernatant washed microsomal preparations did not catalyse desaturation but actively was restored by the addition of nadph g supernatant or sephadextreated supernatant nadph could be replaced by nadh or nadp but not by nad microsomal fractions from mature and immature maize lamina and expanding spinach leaves also rapidly incorporated oleate from coleoylcoa into snphosphatidylcholine but desaturation of snphosphatidylcholine oleate was detected only with microsomal preparations from immature maize lamina it is proposed that leaf microsomal preparations posses an oleate desaturase for which snphosphatidylcholine oleate is either the ATP or an immediate F0 of the substrate
878,the enzymic utilization of oacetyllcarnitine other than via carnitine acetyltransferase ec was investigated in liver homogenates from rats sheep and dry cows an enzymic utilization of oacetyllcarnitine via hydrolysis of the ester bond to yield stoicheiometric quantities of acetate and lcarnitine was demonstrated and mumol of acetyllcarnitine were utilizedmin per g fresh wt of liver homogenates from rats sheep and dry cows respectively the acetylcarnitine hydrolysis activity was not due to a nonspecific esterase or nonspecific cholinesterase oacetyldcarnitine was not utilized the activity was associated with the EC outer mitochondrial membrane fraction from rat liver isolation of this fraction resulted in an eightfold purification of acetylcarnitine hydrolase activity the km for this acetylcarnitine utilization was mm and mm for rat and sheep liver homogenates respectively there was a significant increase in acetylcarnitine hydrolase in rats on starvation and cows on lactation and a significant decrease in sheep that were severely alloxandiabetic the physiological role of an acetylcarnitine hydrolase is discussed in relation to coupling with carnitine acetyltransferase for the relief of acetyl pressure
879,the IB characteristics of an igm waldenstrÃ¶mfr for the ligand phosphorylcholine has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopy upon phosphorylcholine addition igm fr exhibited enhancement of the tryptophanyl fluorescence which was associated with a red shift of the emission maximun nm the same properties were observed with the s igm subunits the association constant ka for phosphorylcholine was x m for igm fr and the s subunit as determined by fluorescence titration a value in agreement with the obtained by ED no significant decrease in the ka value was found in the presence of m urea in m urea the increase in fluorescence intensity was of the value obtained in the absence of denaturing agent in contrast only of fluorescence enhancement was noted upon IB in m guhc and no enhancement could be seen when the concentration of guhc was increased to m thus suggesting CR unfolding of the protein and subsequent loss of CBA the ph dependence study of the phosphorylcholine IB to igm fr indicated no significant differences in the fluorescence enhancement between ph and whereas at more acidic or alkaline ph values the enhancement became smaller at ph and no enhancement was seen suggesting no binding of the ligand a fact confirmed independently by ED when the spectroscopic properties of the igm fr were compared with those of murine myeloma proteins that bind the same ligand large differences were recorded in the amplitude of the phosphorylcholine induced enhancement of the fluorescnece and in the shift of the emission maximum wavelength this suggests that the human and murine proteins interact differently with the small ligand phosphorylcholine thus implying that the variable domains of these molecules are not MZ
880,thermal denaturation of japaneseradish peroxidase ec was investigated with respect to its spectrophotometric properties and effect on the enzymatic activity inactivation of the peroxidase occurred at temperatures higher than degrees and involved three processes ie dissociation of protohemin from the holoperoxidase a conformation change in the apperoxidase and the modification or degradation of protohemin the splitting process of protohemin from holoperoxidase as followed by the change in the absorption spectrum at high temperatures coincided with the degrease in the activity and it was found to be at least biphasic the regeneration of peroxidase on cooling to room temperature was essentially reversible at neutral ph while at ph and ph these processes were irreversible the irreversibility at acidic ph was mainly due to an irreversible NC in the conformation of the apoenzyme the difference spectrum of heattreated apoperoxidase exhibited a denaturation blueshift with negative maxima at and nm and the total protein fluorescence quantum yield qprotein increased by compared to that of the untreated apoenzyme on the other hand the irreversibility at alkaline ph was largely attributable to the modification of protohemin apoperoxidase was more resistnat to heat denaturation but the modification or degradation of protohemin in heated enzyme was greater at ALP ph than at acidic ph the pyridineferrohemochrome spectrum of peroxidase exhibited slight shifts of the maxima of the alphaband to shorter wavelength on heat treatment and the paper chromatogram showed the presence of a new derivative other than protohemin the modified product is probably vinylhydroxyethyldeuterohemin
881,the nasal resistance participates for almost p in the resistance of airways rva of the newborns whose respiration is mainly nasal the possibility of an oral respiration in case of partial or total occlusion of nasal way is almost null in order to determinate the effects of a NG suction of the rva normal infants prematures P0 babies were studied by plethysmographia the presence of the suction brought a systematic and significant increase of rva the coefficient of transformation p is less than in the nine infants for whom the resistant work wr was estimated is increased proportionaly to the increase of rva deltarva coef of transformation p is less than however the proportional increase of wr is not systematic superior for prematures and newborn baby and similar in one case these variations can be explained by various adjustments of the v the increase of work imposed by the presence of a NG suction cannot be underestimated in particular for the prematures
882,the RII properties of three key enzymes in the phenylalanine biosynthetic pathway deoxydarabinoheptulosonate phosphate synthetase dahp synthetase ec chorismate mutase ec and prephenate dehydratase prephenate hydrolyase decarboxylating ec were compared in three phenylalanineexcreting mutants and the wild CS of brevibacterium flavum regulation of dahp synthetase by phenylalanine and tyrosine in these mutants did not change at all but the specific activities of the mutant cell extracts increased to fold as reported previously chorismate mutase activities in both the wild and the mutant strains were cumulatively inhibited by phenylalanine and tyrosine and recovered with tryptophan while the specific activities of the mutants increased to fold like those of dahp synthetase on the other hand the specific MICs of prephenate dehydratase in the mutant and wild strains were similar when IMT was present while prephenate dehydratase of the wild CS was inhibited by phenylalanine tryptophan and several phenylalanine analogues the mutant enzymes were not inhibited at all but were activated by these effectors tyrosine activated the mutant enzymes much more strongly than the wildtype enzyme in mutant mm IMT caused fold activation km and the activation constant for tyrosine were slightly altered to a half and fold compared with the wildtype enzyme respectively while the activation constants for phenylalanine and tryptophan were fold higher than the respective inhibition constants of the wildtype enzyme the molecular weight of the mutant enzyme was estimated to be x a half of that of the wildtype enzyme the molecular weight of the mutant enzyme was estimated to be x a half of that of the wild type enzyme while in the presence of tyrosine phenylalanine or tryptophan it increased to that of the wildtype enzyme immediately after the mutant enzyme had been activated by tyrosine and then the tyrosine removed it still showed about fold higher specific activity than before the activation by tyrosine however on standing in ice the activity gradually fell to the initial level before the activation by tyrosine AS promoted the decrease of the activity on the basis of these results regulatory mechanisms for phenylalanine biosynthesis in vivo as well as mechanisms for the phenylalanine overproduction in the mutants are discussed
883,techniques and experiments are described concerned with the millisecond kinetics of eptdetectable changes brought about in cytochrome c oxidase by reduced cytochrome c and after reduction with various agents by reoxidation with o or ferricyanide some experiments in the presence of ligands are also reported light absorption was monitored by lowtemperature reflectance spectroscopy in the rapid phase of reduction of cytochrome c oxidase by cytochrome c less than ms approx electron equivalent per heme a is transferred mainly to the lowspin heme component of cytochrome c oxidase and partly to the eprdetectable copper in a slow phase less than s the copper is reoxidized and highspin ferric heme signals appear with a predominant rhombic component simultaneously the absorption band at nm decreases and the soret band at nm appears between the split soret band and nm of reduced cytochrome a on reoxidation of reduced enzyme by oxygen all epr and optical features are restored within ms on reoxidation by o in the presence of an excess of reduced cytochrome c states can be observed where the lowspin heme and copper signals are largely absent but the absorption at nm is maximal indicating that the LS heme and copper components are at the substrate side and the components represented in the nm absorption at the o side of the system on reoxidation with ferricyanide the nm absorption is not readily restored but a ferric highspin heme represented by a strong rhombic signal accumulates on reoxidation of partly reduced enzyme by oxygen the rhombic highspin signals disappear within ms whereas the axial signals disappear more slowly indicating that these species are not in rapid equilibrium similar observations are made when partly reduced enzyme is mixed with co the results of this and the accompanying paper are discussed and on this basis an assignment of the L1 epr signals and of the nm absorption is proposed which in essence is that published previously hartzell cr hansen re and beinert h proc natl acad sci us both the lowspin go and slowly appearing HS g signals are attributed to ferric cytochrome a whereas the nm absorption is thought to arise from ferric cytochrome a when it is present in a state of interaction with eprundectectable copper alternative possibilities and possible inconsistencies with this proposal are discussed
884,cephacetrile a parenteral cephalosporin was evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity clinical pharmacology and effectiveness in the treatment of severe infections the antibacterial activity against isolates was determined by an agardilution technique the mics were to mugml for GAS d pneumoniae and staph aureus mugml for e coli and klebsiellaenterobacter mugml for pr mirabilis and more than mugml for ps aeruginosa a few strains of klebsiella and e coli had mics of more than mcgml serum C2 after and g of im cephacetrile were respectively and mugml T3 hr and and mugml T3 hr serum levels after iv infusion of and g were respectively and mugml T3 hr and and mugml after hr urine C2 after and g im cephacetrile were respectively and mugml in the hr period and and mugml in the hr period renal clearance was mlmin m renal excretion was about of the dose hr after im injection cephacetrile was well tolerated when po im with lidocaine mild phlebitis occurred sometimes after iv infusions the clinical response evaluated in patients with severe systemic respiratory and urinary infections was good in all but two cases
885,testosterone betadehydrogenase can be enriched from streptomyces hydrogenans the enzyme dehydrogenizes testosterone with kmmum and estradiolbeta with kmmum to the corresponding ketoderivatives nad forms nadh with kmmum the enzyme is strongly inhibited by androstandione and alphamethyltestosterone the ki for alphamethyltestosterone is mum the CEA increases with increasing ph up to alkalimediated denaturation at about ph the optimum temperature is at degrees c if streptomyces hydrogenans is cultivated in the absence of steroids the specific activity of testosterone betadehydrogenase in the cytosol of the microorganisms amounts to mumg protein and increases up to fold if the cells are cultivated in the presence of certain steroids testosterone alphadihydrotestosterone betadihydrotestosterone E(2) and MT are very ERP inducers thus for the first time the ability of estradiolbeta to induce an enzyme synthesis in a microorganism is shown the steroiddependent induction is inhibited by testosterone acetate and rifamycin sv cyproterone however does not decrease the testosteronedependent enzyme induction of testosterone betadehydrogenase
886,two groups of patients comas of CE origin and serious digestive undernourished were submitted to an exclusive or a supplementary parenteral feeding for a short or a long period of time totaling over days the catheter was placed in p cent of the cases in a deep vein and was tunnellized eb trivemil used in those patients gives aminoacids lipids and glucides the caloric NI was completed by p cent glucose solutes if the average caloric intake was calories per day it was often above that figure since the feeding was combined with a nutripump EN feeding for p cent of the days the clinical tolerance was quite good on a biological level in addition to classic investigations analytic graphic records of lipid levels were made as well as a quantitative analysis of serous triglycerides and lipurias a T0 of sorbitol and nitrogen balances combined with chromatographies on the acidaminuria column an hepatic biological control was also made amnoniemia transaminases as well as a quantitative analysis of lactates pyruvates and minerals ironphosphorusmagnesium some of the results were checked by statistical studies no serious anomaly was detected lung and hepatic biopsies carried out upon patients did not apparently reveal any lipidic overloading the clinical and the biological investigation show that this complete nutriment is perfectly tolerated and assimilated
887,by takayasuonishis arteritis is meant an arteritic process with unknown aetiology which electively affects young women seemingly of prevalently asiatic stock the disease concerns almost exclusively C1 elastic arteries and presents clinically with early preocclusive symptomatology followed after a varying period by a picture of obstructive angiopathy here the most recent aetiopathogenetic findings are considered the diseases predilection for the young female together with certain clinical and exp observations suggest that a dysendocrine condition may have some pathogenetic responsibility at least in a favourable sense this responsibility is documented by the finding of high C2 of oestrogenuria during the entire cycle in patients suffering from the disease on the other hand the angiopathy localization in the large elastic arteries and in certain segments of the aortic arch and epiaortic trunks means that the role of topographic moments whould not be underestimated as regards infectious AF the tubercular and streptococcic continue to be of great importance even today neither acts directly however but by way of an abnormal immunitary reaction which they seem able to trigger off the infectious moment would thus appear to be related to the immunitary moment and the latter would seem to play the part of perpetuating the pathological V1 involvement promoted by contact of the organism with the aetiological agent
888,two rnases in bound forms associated with the microsomal membrane and with the ribosomes or unknown particles in pea root tissue were solubilized by subjecting the membrane to sonic oscillation in the presence of edta and kc and by treating the particles with edta respectively the rnases were than purified by deaecellulose and sephadex g column chromatographies the elution profiles of rnases from the columns were very similar no significant differences were observed in their electrophoretic mobilities in PAGE in molecular weight in activation by inorganic ions urea or phospholipid micelles or in the dependence of their activities upon ph the purified rnases were not different from the bound enzymes as regards activation by inorganic ions and urea and the dependence of the activity upon ph triton x stimulated the activity only if rnase was in a bound form associated with the microsomal membrane we propose that the two rnases may be the same molecular species and differ only in the form of association with intracellular structures
889,the effect of hydrochloric acid at ph on erythromycin stearate and commercial dosage forms of erythromycin stearate was studied under all conditions examined erythromycin was readily dissolved from the stearate as hydrochloride and rapidly lost its biological activity in solution the inclusion of pepsin in the test systems did not affect the results although formulation differences somewhat affected the rate of destruction acid lability was exhibited by all products examined except entericcoated tablets amounts of acid considered to be normal in the fasting stomach contents of adults during the time likely for a dose to remain in the stomach caused destruction within min T3 the shells started to rupture amounts of hydrochloric acid appreciably less than meq representing abnormally small quantities even in the fasting state caused destruction ranging from to of the doses in min these results are not reconcilable with published statements that the sensitivity of erythromycin to gastric acid is overcome by providing the antibiotic in the form of stearate salt
890,the purification of axonal membranes of crustaceans was followed by measuring enrichment in htetrodotoxin IB capacity and in na katpase activity a characteristic of these membranes is their high content of lipids and their low content of protein as compared to other types of plasmatic CM the axonal membrane contains myosinlike actinlike tropomyosinlike and tubulinlike proteins it also contains na katpase and acetylcholinesterase the molecular weights of these two enzymes after solubilization are and respectively the molecular weights of the catalytic subunits are for atpase and for acetylcholinesterase we confirmed the presence of a nicotine binding component in the axonal membrane of the lobster but we have been unable to find hnicotine IB to crab axonal CM the binding to axonal membranes og of the sodium channel has been studied in detail the dissociation constant for the binding of htetrodotoxin to the axonal membrane receptor is nm at ph the concentration of the tetrodotoxin receptor in crustacean membranes is about pmolmg of membrane protein times less than the acetylcholinesterase times less than the na katpase and times less than the nicotine IB component in the lobster membrane a reasonable estimate indicates that approximately only one peptide chain in constitutes the tetrodotoxin binding part of the sodium channel in the axonal membrane veratridine which acts selectively on the resting sodium permeability binds to the phospholipid part of the axonal membrane hveratridine binding to membranes parallels the EP effect veratridine and tetrodotoxin have different receptor sites although tetrodotoxin can repolarize the excitable membrane of a giant axon depolarized by veratridine veratridine does not affect the binding of htetrodotoxin to purified axonal membranes similarly tetrodotoxin does not affect the binding of hveratridine to axonal membranes scorpion neurotoxin i a presynaptic toxin which affects both the na and the k channels does not interfere with the binding of htetrodotoxin or hveratridine to axonal CM tetrodotoxin veratridine and scorpion neurotoxin i which have in common the perturbation of the normal SF-36 of the sodium channel act upon three different types of receptor sites
891,the adsorption of the enzyme gl oxidase ec to clays followed the DP described for other proteins as being ph dependent maximum adsorption occurred at or below the isoelectric point of the enzyme the amount of enzyme adsorbed to clay was influenced by the type of clay used and also the saturating cations initially adsorbed enzyme showed low specific activities and as amounts of enzyme adsorbed approached maximum stauration of clay TPS activities increased approaching that determined for free enzyme the adsorption of gl oxidase involved a temperatureindependent cationexchange mechanism and enzyme adsorbed to surfaces of clay could be desorbed in active form by elevation of ph of suspending solution this was followed by a slower temperaturedependent fixation probably by hydrogen bonding which resulted in protein being irreversibly adsorbed to clay surfaces it is proposed that on adsorption of gl oxidase to clay surfaces unravelling of the protein structure occurred which allowed penetration of protein into the interlamellar spaces of montmorillonite this proposal was based on the observed expansion of MMT to a and the decreases in amount of a secondprotein lysozyme adsorbed with extended incubation times of glucose oxidase clay complexes at ph
892,a simple reliable assay for SS and red cell folate is described it uses plain untreated liquid or powdered milk requiring no special handling or purification as binder such milk makes it possible to ignore endogenous serum folate binder since crude but not purified milk contains a factor which releases folate from serum binder it simplifies counting radioactivity by employing a gamma emitting isotope of pteroylglutamic acid pga namely the ityramide of pga like the hpga assay of givas and gutcho it permits the use of stable pga rather than unstable methyltetrahydrofolic acid methfa standards because it is carried out at ph a ph at which milk folate binder is unable to distinguish pga from methfa which is the predominat folate in human tissues the equipment required to do the radioassay is present in most diagnostic chemistry laboratories results are essentially identical to the generally accepted lactobacillus casel microbiologic method of folate assay except that false low results are not produced in the radioassay by antibiotics tranquilizers and chemotherapeutic agents three caveats in its use are the relative instability of ipga as compared to hpga the fact that various powdered milks differ widely in folatebinding capacity and that only about per cent of commercially obtained skim or powdered milk preparations appear to contain the substance which splits folate from SS binder
893,urinary output of na and k and volume of urine have been studied in conscious unrestrained waterloaded male rats following the intraseptal i.t. of CAs natriuresis and kaliuresis increased after injecting noradrenaline na the intensity being dose related the DR curve suggests that a monomolecular interacting takes place between na and pharmacological receptors present in the septal area no change was observed in diuresis systematic mapping of the septal area yielded about the same results for all sites except a zone located in the lateral nucleus that was more sensitive an alpha blocker dibenamine injected intraseptally before na showed an inhibitory effect while a beta blocker propranolol yielded a potentiation effect these same effects of the blocking agents were observed when adrenaline was used instead of na lidocaine which inhibits the reuptake of na showed an enhancement of the natriuretic and kaliuretic effect of na and the same effect was observed when the enzymatic destruction of na was prevented by nialamide an inhibitor of monoaminoxidase dopamine showed a natriuretic effect but no effect was observed on k and urine SO serotonin had no action on natriuresis kaliuresis and diuresis
894,a FW pseudomonas sp was grown in continuous culture under steadystate conditions in llactate succinate glucose or ammoniumlimited media under carbon limitation the nadh ie nad nadh concentration of the organisms increased exponentially from approximately to mumolg dry wt as the culture dilution rate d was decreased from to h organisms grown at a given d in any of the carbonlimited media possessed very similar C2 of nadh therefore under these conditions cellular nadh was only a function of the culture o and was independent of the nature of the SC carbon source d had no influence on the nadh content of cells grown under ammonium limitation in contrast cellular nadh concentration was not influenced by d in carbon or ammoniumlimited media in llactatelimited medium bacteria possessed mumol nadhg dry wt very similar levels were found in organisms grown in the other media the results are consistent with those of wimpenny firth that bacteria rigidly maintain a constant nadh level rather than a constant constant nadh nad ratio nadph ie nadp nadph and nadph levels were also not influenced by changes in the culture carbon source or in d in llactatelimited medium these concentrations were and mumolg cell dry wt respectively the nadphnadph ratio was much higher than the nadhnadh ratio averaging in carbonlimited cells
895,the kinetic study of a process is usually performed by measuring a convenient intensive property p as a function of time the affinity rule states that when a given process takes place under different external constraints eg different temperatures pressures ph values etc the various p versus time curves are related by an affinity transformation parallel to the time axis in other words the p versus log time curves are parallel and can be superimposed by translation the validity of the rule has been extensively tested in chemical and physiochemical processes but there is no evidence as yet that it extends to biological systems the present paper shows that the rule is indeed valid for the kinetics of growth of an escherichia coli culture at various temperatures and ph values more extended experiments are necessary to prove or disprove the GA validity of the rule in biological systems but its practical interest is evident whenever it is valid it will be possible from a very small number of measurements to predict the complete behavior of the system in a number of various external conditions
896,sheep ovarian beta hsdh has been purified about fold to a specific activity of iumg protein using deae cellulose chromatography AC on estroneamino caproatesepharose and a second deae cellulose chromatography the molecular weight is the ph optimum for activity is and the energy of activation is kcalmole the kinetics of the oxidation of estradiol and many analogues have been studied at various concentrations and in the presence of different amounts of coenzyme the data are in agreement with a compulsory order mechanism with the binding of nad as the first substrate sheep ovarian beta hsdh accepts subtituents in position c c c the ATP binding site is open in this region on the contrary the binding requirements are strict for the region of c since the presence of a c methyl group impairs binding and or oxidation of the steroid sheep ovarian and human placental beta hsdh have close analogies molecular weight ph optimum ATP IB site requirements their reaction mechanisms are different random for the placental beta hsdh compulsory order for the ovarian beta hsdh this can be explained by the effect of the coenzyme upon the IB of the ATP without effect on placental enzyme the coenzyme fixation enhances the affinity of the ovarian beta hsdh for any substrate
897,the reactions of rhus vernicifera monophenoldihydroxyphenylalanine oxygen oxidoreductase ec with the reducing substrates hydroquinone and ascorbic acid have been investigated with the stoppedflow technique rhus laccase appears to be present in two molecular forms with a phsensitive equilibrium constant regulating the relative concentrations of each species a MM for the reaction of rhus laccase with reducing substrates has been formulated the model is similar to one formulated earlier for the anaerobic reduction of laccase from polyporus versicolor andrÃ©asson le malstrÃ¶m bg strÃ¶mberg c and vÃ¤nngÃ¥rd t eur j biochem and accounts for the reduction also of this enzyme the essentials of the model are as follows electrons are taken up from reductants one at a time the type cu has a CE role in mediating the transfer of at least one of the electrons needed for the reduction of the cooperative twoelectron acceptor intramolecular reactions determine the concentrations of two molecular forms of the enzyme and influence the rate of reduction of the twoelectron acceptor the model which has been used for successful simulations of the anaerobic reduction of rhus laccase is capable of explaining the reduction of laccases also in the presence of the inhibitor f in addition the model gives an explanation of the behaviour of the laccases when reducing substrates and o are simultaneously present and is consistent with earlier observations of the poststeadystate reduction of the type cu and the twoelectron accetor holwerda ra and gray hb j am chem soc
898,direct evidence showing that a soluble form of elastin is the precursor of crosslinked elastin was obtained from pulsechase experiments using chick embryo aortas and by demonstrating the conversion of soluble elastin into crosslinked elastin in a CF system acetic acid extracts of embryonic chick aorta pulselabeled with clysine contain two radioactive proteins of molecular weights and which have been identified previously as soluble elastin and the proalpha chain of collagen respectively in pulsechase experiments the radioactivity incorporated in the soluble elastin during the PP with clysine disappeared during a hour chase with clysine and of that which disappeared was accounted for in the desmosines of alkaliinsoluble elastin the disappearance of the radioactivity from the soluble fraction and its appearance in the desmosines of elastin were inhibited by betaaminopropionitrile a specific inhibitor of the crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase in addition in vitro experiments it was shown that the radioactivity in the desmosines of elastin can arise from that present in an acidsoluble F0 protein this precursor protein is soluble elastin as demonstrated by the formation of desmosines when a homogeneous preparation of soluble elastin was incubated with purified lysyl oxidase
899,the hydrolysis of a series of depsipeptides demonstrates that the zinc neutral endopeptidases of bacteria are AS esterases esters such as bzglyopheala bzglyoleuala and faglyoleunh are hydrolyzed at rates three to eightfold slower than are their exact peptide analogues when hydrolyzed by TLN bacillus subtilis neutral protease and the neutral protease from aeromonas proteolytica ester hydrolysis by zinc neutral PRs follows the characteristic preference for hydrophobic amino acids adjacent to the site of cleavage discerned from the hydrolysis of peptide substrates removal of zinc from thermolysin abolishes the esterase activity of the native enzyme among the metals examined only co and zn restore esterase activity to any significant extent co restoring and zn of the native thermolysin activity the hydrolysis of esters and peptides by TLN does not differ with respect to either the IB or catalytic steps substrate specificity phrate profiles inhibitor and deuterium isotope effects are identical for both types of substrates
900,when absidia glauca was grown in minimal media with dmannitol as the only source of carbon an nad specific dmannitol dehydrogenase ec was induced the crude extract also gave evidence of mannitol kinase mannitolphosphate dehydrogenase phosphofructokinase and liditol dehydrogenase activity the heat labile purified preparation was judged enzymically homogeneous based on evidence derived from substrate specificity studies and activity staining following disc gel electrophoresis the enzymic monomer with a weight of about daltons slowly polymerizes when stored at degrees c giving a multiplicity of protein bands on electrophoresis distributed predominantly across a spectrum from dimer to pentamer with enzymic activity resident predominantly in even multiples of the monomer depolymerization occurred rapidly hours when a frozen preparation was brought to and held between and degrees c aggregate fragmentation with sodium dodecyl sulfate showed a timetemperature dependence terminating in a subunit component of daltons ph optimum for polyol oxidation occurs at naohglycine buffer while ketose reduction proceeded most rapidly at ph PB a RII role is suggested for this enzyme based on deadend inhibition by mannitol phosphate multiple enzyme forms and its locus at the initiation site for mannitol utilization the physiological relevance of lowtemperature aggregation to regulatory control remains to be established
901,the reliability of fiberoptic bronchoscopy as a method to study the bacteriology of the LRT was tested the procedure used was suction aspiration through the inner channel T3 topical anesthesia with lidocaine to detect contamination by oropharyngeal bacteria the aspirates were cultured in patients with no evidence of active infection comparison was made with results of transtracheal aspiration cultures and the aspirate was tested for the presence of an oral dye marker results with all methods of analysis indicated contamination with OP bacteria that were presumably introduced during instrumentation through the upper airways an additional factor studied was the effect of topical anesthetics analysis of aspirates showed that as much as per cent of the specimen was anesthetic solution lidocaine also proved toxic to lower respiratory tract pathogens although there were significant differences between bacterial species it was concluded that fiberoptic bronchoscopy as performed in this study does not reliably reflect the bacteriology of the lower respiratory tract
902,pertussis vaccine injected ip in doses known to cause hypersensitization resulted in a marked decrease in the number of mast cells from the peritoneal washings of rats and mice a significant reduction was obtained as early as one day after pertussis injection of ten billion cells in rats and was marked after to days a maximum reduction in the number of mast cells was obtained by a dose of billion cells there was no detectable histamine biological activity in the supernatant from peritoneal washings obtained T3 min min and hr from control and pertussistreated rats indicating that pertussis did not cause degranulation of mast cells in vivo the histamine content in the precipitated mast cell pellets from control rats was much higher than the corresponding histamine content from pertussistreated rats in rats and mice propranolol and other beta adrenergicblocking agents caused degranulation of mast cells in the peritoneal washings in vitro practolol was the least effective beta adrenergicblocking agent in degranulating mast cells catecholamines histamine hydroxydopamine methacholine and pertussis failed to cause any degranulation isoproterenol protected the mast cell against the degranulation induced by propranolol propranolol caused bluing in rat and mice skin when injected id mast cells from control and pertussisinjected rats were equally CS to propranolol in vitro the low REC of mast cells from the peritoneal washings of rats and mice is thought to be due to mobilization of mast cells away from the peritoneum
903,solutions of pure cannabinoids nine samples of herbal and two of resin cannabis one freshly prepared were stored in varying conditions for up to years exposure to light not direct sunlight was shown to be the greatest single factos in loss of CBs especially in solutions which should therefore be protected from light during analytical and phytochemical operations previous claims that solutions in ethanol were SD have not been substantiated the effect of temperature up to degrees was insignificant but air oxidation did lead to significant losses these could be reduced if care was taken to minimize damage to the glands which act as well filled well closed containers loss of tetrahydrocannabinol T3 exposure to light does not lead to an increase in cannabinol but air oxidation in the dark does it is concluded that carefully prepared herbal or resin cannabis or extracts are reasonably stable for to years if stored in the dark at RT
904,kinetics of mouse spleen colony forming units were studied after intraperitoneal injection of mugblody weight bacterial endotoxin s typhosa when these mice were used as unirradiated and sublethally irradiated donors it was possible to study the effect of the endotoxin injection upon the cells use of the treated mice as irradiated recipients of normal cells gave information about the host effect in treated unirradiated mice the total nucleated cell and the cfu counts were disturbed and days later a C1 fraction of the cfu were found in the dna synthesis s phase this meant that injection of endotoxin generated factors affecting the kinetics of the cfu and triggering the resting cfu into the proliferative cycle if then the mice were given supralethal irradiation and used as recipients of normal bone marrow cells more cfu seeded to the spleen as compared to normal recipients but the dip and the growth rate of the cfu were not changed hence the endotoxingenerated AF had been eliminated in days a total body sublethal irradiation by rad xray days T3 endotoxin i.t. reduced the postirradiation dip in the recovery curve of the cfu indicating that though the factors affecting the cell kinetics had been eliminated the cycling cfu behaved like a growing population during the first week the growth rate of the cfu remained the same as in control irradiated mice the growth rate of the SP cfu of the endotoxintreated mice slowed down during the second week and their selfreplicating ability was low fluctuations in the dna synthesizing fraction of the spleen cfu suggested a variability in the ratio of the length of the s phase and the cell generation time
905,a combination of two or more drugs may exert a drugdrug interaction in which case the effect can be potentiated or antagonized such synergistic effects are well known in the case of pyrabital barbital aminopyrine or irgapyrine phenylbutazone aminopyrine bucolome bcp a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent has the chemical structure of a barbiturate and also resembles the formula of pheylbutazone thus the influence of bcp combination on the pharmacological activities of various pyrazolone derivatives was examined bcp potentiated the analgesic and antipyretic effects of aminoantipyrine a methylaminoantipyrine ma aminopyrine am and isopropylaminoantipyrine ipa which were substituted by the alkylamino group at position of the pyrazolone ring this potentiation occurred when the dose of bcp exceeded that of the pyrazolones and was especially marked when combination ratio of bcp exceeded that of the pyrazolones and was especially marked when combination ratio of bcp and pyrazolone was mola the analgesic effects of AP an isopropylantipyrine ip and aminopropylone ap which were substituted by alkyl group or aminoacylamino group at position were not potentiated by bcp in any combination ratio most pyrazolones showed additive LD50 in their combination with bcp but acute toxicities of a and am which were potentiated in analgesic effects were decreased and antagonized when combined with bcp the plasma concentration of am was increased and prolonged by bcp while that of ip remained much the same these results suggest that the pharmacological activities are associated with certain molecular interactions between bcp and pyrazolones which are substituted by the alkylamino group at position of the pyrazolone ring
906,the ph dependencies of the apparent K(m) for oxidized glutathione and the apparent turnover number of yeast glutathione reductase ec have been determined at a fixed concentration of mm nadph in the range ph between ph and both of these parameters are relatively constant the principal effect of low ph on the kinetics of the enzymecatalyzed reaction is the observation of a phdependent ATP inhibition by Ox glutathione at ph less than or equal which is shown to correlate with the IB of oxidized glutathione to the oxidized form of the enzyme the catalytic activity of yeast glutathione reductase at ph is affected by the sodium acetate buffer concentration the stability of the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme at ph and degrees c in the absence of bovine SS albumin was studied as a function of sodium acetate concentration the results show that activation of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at low sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium acetate on a reduced form of the enzyme in contrast inhibition of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at high sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium acetate on the GSSG of the enzyme
907,the microsomal noxidation of phentermine ia to nhydroxyphentermine ib and to alphaalphadimethylalphanitrosobetaphenylethane ic was investigated maximum activities were obtained with microsomal g supernatant and microsomes fractions of rabbit liver in the presence of an nadph generating system incubation of ia with hepatic washed microsomes from a phenobarbitone pretreated rabbit increased the formation of ib and decreased that of ic but the total amount of noxidized metabolites ie ib ic was not affected the ratio of the metabolically produced ic to ib but not the total amount of noxygenated metabolites varied greatly depending of the liver microsomal fractions used in the incubation mixtures of ia more ib was produced from ia using g supernatant and conversely more ic was formed using the washed microsomes of the same liver the nitroso compound ic was metabolically reduced to ib and ib to ia by the hepatic g supernatant and soluble fraction under the same conditions washed microsomes had only limited reductive properties towards ic and ib nhydroxyphentermine ib was not metabolically Ox to ic when incubated with washed microsomes from rabbit liver the use of known carbonoxidation inhibitors showed that cytochrome p is not involved in the incorporation of oxygen at the nitrogen centre of ia the metabolic characteristics and kinetic behavior of the microsomal noxidation of ia supported a recently proposed mechanism explaining the independent formation of ib and ic from a common F0 resulting from metabolic noxidation of ia
908,the purposes of this monograph are to describe the postcranial skeletons of the earliest known mammals and to probe in so far as possible by osteological T0 biological questions concerning the habits and adaptations of these late triassic forms in this context information on the background of this investigation is useful studies of mesozoic mammals begun some years ago are based on rare and fragmentary fossils principally jaws and teeth these investigations have yielded a bare outline of some million years of mammalian evolutionabout twothirds of mammalian history no assessment of the important biological changes occurring during this time can ever be complete but major advances are possible as new discoveries provide material that is more complete or that represents a previously unknown evolutionary stage so tenuous is the evidence that at least some concepts are reevaluated with each discovery postcranial anatomy offers especially intriguing prospects for investigation because associated material that can be positively assigned to a taxon below subclass has been for the most part unknown and indeed even dissociated bones are a rarity since gg simpsons monographs of and progress in the T0 of mesozoic mammals has been largely dependent on new finds a major impetus to renewed investigation came from the discoveries of mesozoic mammals by walter kÃ¼hne in and during the immediate postwar years kÃ¼hne first worked on fissures in the carboniferous limestone quarries at frome somerset in southwest england where he collected a series of teeth of the problematical form haramiya and two triconodont teeth which were placed in the genus eozostrodon parrington the fissure faunas are generally thought to be of upper triassic rhaetic age kÃ¼hne although kermack musset rigney believe that the evidence is insufficient to determine whether the deposits are rhaetic or lower liassic after the war kÃ¼hne carried his explorations farther west eventually reaching the quarries at bridgend in glamorgan wales where he not only found more triconodont teeth in some quantity kÃ¼hne but also a symmetrodont tooth kÃ¼hne shortly after making these discoveries kÃ¼hne returned to germany and the work was continued by a team from university college london under the leadership of dr ka kermack
909,an organism that utilizes acetophenone as sole source of carbon and energy was isolated in pure SC and tentatively identified as an arthrobacter sp cellfree extracts of the acetophenonegrown organism contained an enzyme acetophenone oxygenase that catalysed an nadphdependent consumption of o in the presence of the growth substrate approx mol of o and mol of nadph were consumed per mol of acetophenone Ox cellfree extracts also contained an enzyme capable of the hydrolysis of phenyl acetate to phenol and acetate the amount of this esterase was increased markedly by growth on acetophenone the observed products of the acetophenone oxygenase reaction by crude cellfree extracts were phenol and acetate however inhibition of the phenyl acetate esterase by paraoxon resulted in the formation of phenyl acetate from acetophenone a degradative CS is proposed in which acetophenone is metabolized by an oxygeninsertion reaction to form phenyl acetate further metabolism occurs by hydrolysis of this ester the organism and extracts were shown to metabolize chlorinated acetophenones the environmental implications of this observation are discussed
910,a polyvalent conjugate fluorescein isothiocyanatelabeled antibody reagent containing serogroups a b and c conjugates was prepared this polyvalent conjugate gave a positive fluorescent antibody fa stain with stains of bacteroides melaninogenicus representing serogroups a b and c when additional strains strains of the three subspecies of b melaninogenicus were examined by the fa stain with a b and c and polyvalent conjugates nine strains of b melaninogenicus subsp intermedius failed to give a positive stain with any conjugate therefore an fa conjugate was prepared with the AS to one of these strains a all nine strains stained positively with this conjugate these nine strains were biochemically characteristic of b melaninogenicus subsp intermedius thus these strains were designated as a new serogroup serogroup c a new polyvalent conjugate containing serogroups a b c and c was prepared this polyvalent conjugate stained positively with representative strains from serogroups a b c and c the new conjugates failed to stain positively with other anaerobes and aerobes tested the four individual conjugates as well as the polyvalent conjugate may be used for a more rapid identification of b melaninogenicus than is possible by biochemical testing
911,the hydroxylase activities observed in extracts of pseudomonas putida orc T3 growth on orcinol and resorcinol as sole source of carbon have been purified to homogeneity both enzymes were shown to be flavoproteins and to contain approximately mol of fad for each polypeptide chain sw values for each enzyme are and are independent of the presence of their aromatic substrates molecular weight determinations under native approximately and denaturing approximately conditions indicated that they are monomeric the visible absorption spectra MZ but the CD spectra of the two proteins can be distinguished although each protein catalyzes the nadph and odependent hydroxylation of both orcinol and resorcinol the efficiency of the transformations of the substrates by the two enzymes is radically different furthermore resorcinol hydroxylase is much more versatile in the aromatic EDC it can utilize as substrates and effectors other properties of the enzymes which clearly establish their own identity include their serological characteristics and amino acid composition the latter property is particularly evident when the quantities of valine and alanine residues are compared the synthesis of each enzyme is also under different regulatory constraints being controlled by the substrate used for growth
912,acetylated derivatives of glucagon have been prepared by reacting this hormone under various conditions with acetic anhydride they have been chemically characterized by the use of a clabeled reagent by peptide mapping techniques following hydrolysis by pronase and chymotrypsin and by spectroscopy acetylation in sodium acetate ph results in a full substitution of the alphaamino group of the nterminal histidyl residue but in a partial about acetyl group per residue substitution of the epsilonamino group of the lysyl residue the monosubstituted on the alphaamino group and the disubstituted on both amino CG acetylated components have been separated by chromatography on deaecellulose and cmcellulose acetylation in sodium bicarbonate ph results in a complete substitution of both amino groups and of the hydroxyl groups of the tyrosyl residues and CR deacetylation of the oacetyltyrosyl residues occurs upon treatment with hydroxylamine mono di and tetraacetylglucagon are homogeneous when analyzed by disc gel electrophoresis di and tetrasubstituted derivatives show an increased mobility towards the anode ilabeled derivatives of acetylglucagon show higher distribution coefficients in the aqueous twophase dextranpolyethylene glycol system than do similar derivatives of glucagon acetylation decreases in parallel the ability of glucagon to stimulate the activity of adenylate cyclase and to bind to its receptors in liver cell membranes of the rat the biological potencies of the mono di and tetrasubstituted derivates are respectively about and that of native glucagon the IB properties of the material dissociated from the acetylglucagonreceptor complex suggest that the reduction in biological activity results from a decrease in the intrinsic affinity of the modified glucagon for the receptors as well as from the presence of small amounts of residual unreacted glucagon studies with ilabeled derivatives of glucagon indicate that acetylation decreases the rate of association and increases the rate of dissociation of the hormonereceptor complex
913,one inbred mouse strain cblkl has high galactosidase MICs in all tissues while another CS dbakl has low MICs determined by the bgs locus betagalactosidase from these two strains was partly purified by a fivestep procedure acidification AS precipitation gel filtration at two phs and isoelectric focusing no qualitative differences were found between the enzyme preparations from the two strains they had identical heat inactivation curves ph optima molecular weight and isoelectric points and the km values were very similar it thus seems that this genetic difference in enzyme activity probably cannot be explained by a R2 of the galactosidasespecific activity but rather reflects a difference in number of enzyme molecules eight different isoenzymes were separated from liver kidney and spleen each isoenzyme has a different electrophoretic mobility and there is a stepwise increase in molecular weight from to beginning with the protein having the lowest isoelectric point a likely interpretation is that the isoenzymes bind a smaller polypeptide in varying numbers in addition to the enzymatic polypeptide per se
914,we had the opportunity of studying an epidemic of autochthonous amoebiasis occurring in the autumn of in a small town of inhabitants km from grenoble attention was originally attracted by the occurrence in this town of two cases of hepatic amoebiasis and one of intestinal amoebiasis identified by rectoscopy systematic investigations coproctic examinations and serological tests for amoebiasis by indirect antibody fluorescence were then carried out on everyone in the locality with digestive disorders which were possibly referable to amoebiasis and on the other members of their families a total number of coproctic examinations were made and in two cases revealed the presence of vegetative forms of Eh in both cases the infestation provoked few symptoms asthenia vague abdominal discomfort intermittent and apparently banal diarrhoea on the other hand out of serological tests revealed positive results of which were equal to or greater than a titre of a level at which all risks of nonspecificity are virtually ruled out under our experimental conditions material reasons made it impossible to subject these cases to repeated faecal checks but in two of them at least the rectoscopic appearances were very suggestive of subacute intestinal amoebiasis moreover amoebic disease appears to be well confirmed by the results obtained among the patients as a whole by treatment with metroinidazole a variety of hypotheses on the origin of this epidemic have been put forward and then abandoned market garden produce receipt by certain families of exotic frut from overseas in actual fact water seems to be the point of departure for although specimens of water taken at different C2 in the water supply system failed to reveal the presence of a single amoeba bacteriological analyses during autumn showed signs of faecal contamination the locality which is situated at the foot of the chartreuse massif receives its water solely from springs but there is a holiday camp for the staff of an international airline situated above the main water catchment
915,the intestinal transfer of different tetracyclines dissolved in calcium and magnesiumfree krebs bicarbonate buffer solution ph was studied using the everted ileum of the mouse the rates of transfer of CTC and demethylchlortetracycline were less than those of tetracycline and oxytetracycline the latter EDC being transferred at the same rate addition of calcium and magnesium to the buffer greatly reduced the transfer of tetracycline this inhibition could be antagonized by edta the presence of iron also inhibited the transfer of tetracycline the inhibitory effect of these ions on tetracycline transfer seemed due to chelation of the drug glucosamine and acetylmethionine but not acetyl glucosamine diminished the intestinal transfer of TCs the former two agents did not influence the uptake of tissue fluids tetracycline was also transfered from the serous to the mucous coat in the noneverted intestinal sac of mice the above observations suggested that the absorption of tetracyclines was not due solely to passive diffusion
916,the disruption of a kidney cortex microsomal membrane preparation by a binary nonionic detergent was followed by using as markers the changes in total protein content and na katpase in a supernatant fraction both markers responded similarly to changes in ph microsome concentration and detergent concentration but responded differently for timedependent studies the na katpase activity was increased fold mumoles pimg proteinh ouabainsensitive by a single detergent treatment and fold ouabainsensitive by a sequential detergent treatment changes in the critical micelle concentration cmc were observed for varying detergent and protein concentrations which suggest interactions of monomeric detergent with the membrane the peak of na katpase activity occurred above the cmc which suggests the participation of micelles in releasing the enzyme from the CM hill plots of the protein released as the detergent concentration was varied showed a change in the slope near the cmc indicating a fourfold increase in the binding of detergent to CM as the detergent concentration is increased above the cmc these results suggest that the disruption of membranes by detergent involves the binding of detergent monomers to the membrane followed by the formation of comicelles of the detergent with segments of the membrane to complete the separation process
917,the division of the IS into humoral and cellmediated immunity is established in vertebrates moreover single manifestations of cellmediated immunity are observed in invertebrates too in protochordates eg a genetically fixed ability to recognize self and notself could already be demonstrated but the interpretation of this phenomenon as a preliminary stage of cellmediated immunity in vertebrates is not established yet especially by the investigation of the transplantation tolerance for example between mammalia and VPI vertebrates essential results as to the development of the IS in vertebrates could be obtained it is quite sure that the experimental findings obtained till now are not sufficient for giming a complete picture of the phylogenesis of immunologic reactivity but they very unanimously support the conception that nearly all of the nowadays living representatives of the vertebrates dispose of cellmediated immunity which is equal in its characteristic features and the small lymphocyte takes the central part in the cellmediated immune reactions of the vertebrates and the complexity of the lymphoid organs which is increasing in the course of phylogenesis leads to a quantitative but not to a qualitative NC
918,lipolysis and cyclic amp accumulation were studied in isolated rat fat cells at normal and decreased ph acidosis inhibited lipolysis and cyclic amp accumulation due to na noncompetetively maximal lipolysis mum na was inhibited by at ph and by at ph cyclic amp accumulation min after mum na was inhibited by at ph and by at ph between and minutes of incubation nastimulated lipolysis was linear at ph whereas a progressively increasing inhibition was seen at lower ph the ffa production was inhibited to the same degree as glycerol production by acidosis the fraction of ffa associated with the cells was the same at all phs thus we have no evidence that acidosis inhibits lipolysis via accumulation of ffa intracellularly nainduced accumulation of hcamp from hatp endogenously formed by prelabelling the cells with hadenine was inhibited by acidosis both in the presence and absence of theophylline in the incubation medium by and respectively at ph and by and at ph cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in homogenates of fat cells was inhibited by decreasing the ph whether measured at high or low substrate concentrations basal aca activity in a cell membrane fraction from fat cells was affected to a minor degree while nastimulated activity was inhibited by decreased ph the response to mum na at ph was inhibited by relative to control the results show that acidosis inhibits nainduced cyclic amp accumulation by interfering with the formation rather than the inactivation of the nucleotide since nainduced lipolysis is a cyclic ampmediated process it is suggested that at least part of the antilipolytic effect of acidosis is due to inhibition of cyclic amp formation
919,glutamate synthase from escherichia coli k exhibits nhdependent activity nhdependent activity is increased approximately fold in apoglutamate synthase lacking flavin and nonheme iron whereas glutamine plus oxoglutarate have the capacity to reoxidize the chemically reduced flavoenzyme no such reoxidation is obtained with oxoglutarate plus nh these results establish that the glutamine and nhdependent syntheses of glutamate occur by different pathways of electron transfer from nadph the nhdependent activity of native and apoglutamate synthase exhibits similar catalytic properties some properties of apoglutamate synthase are similar to those of glutamate dehydrogenase these properties include ph optima for synthesis and oxidative deamination of glutamate inactivation by alkylating reagents and pmercuribenzoate an enhanced rate of inactivation by alkylating reagents and pmercuribenzoate at low ph oxoglutarate protection against inactivation by pmercuribenzoate and reactivation of pmercuribenzoatetreated enzyme by mercaptoethanol oxoglutarate protects against alkylation of glutamate synthase by iodo cacetamide and reduces incorporation of methyl ccarboxamide into the small S1 of the enzyme
920,the total arylsulphatase activity and the relative MICs of lysosomal arylsulphatases a and b were measured in the liver of control rats and rats subjected to treatments that provoke hepatic autophagocytosis the total CL arylsulphatase activities were increased in starved and starved glucagontreated rats but not in shamoperated and hepatectomized rats arylsulphatases a and b in the mitochondriallysosomal ml fraction were separated by polyacrylamidegel electrophoresis at ph they were made visible by incubating the gels with pnitrocatechol sulphate as substrate and measured by quantitative densitometry in UT controls arylsulphatases a and b comprised and of the total arylsulphatase activity respectively the arylsulphatase aarylsulphatase b activity ratio was all experimental treatments produced a significant decrease in the percentage of lysosomal arylsulphatase present as the a form and an increase in that present as the b form and the activity ratio of arylsulphatase aarylsulphatase b declined the magnitude of these changes increased in the following direction starvation for hsham hepatectomy less than glucagon starvation less than subtotal hepatectomy these results indicate that the arylsulphatase aarylsulphatase b activity ratio in CL lysosomes of normal rats is maintained within rather narrow limits and this ratio declines during enhanced autophagocytosis these findings together with observations that suggest that arylsulphatase b may be a partially degraded form of arylsulphatase a are consistent with the view that the a form is more rapidly converted into the b form during autophagy owing to the digestive activity of the other lysosomal hydrolases present in autophagic vacuoles
921,KYN pyruvate aminotransferase was purified from rat kidney the purified enzyme had an isoelectric point of ph and a ph optimum of the enzyme was active with pyruvate as amino acceptor but not with oxoglutarate and utilized various aromatic amino acids as amino donors lamino acids were effective in the following order of activity histidine greather than phenylalanine greater than kynurenine greater than IMT greater than tryptophan greater than hydroxytryptophan the apparent km values were about mm mm and mm for histidine KYN and phenylalanine respectively km values for pyruvate were mm with histidine as amino donor mm with kynurenine and mm with phenylalanine KYN pyruvate aminotransferase activity of the enzyme was inhibited by the addition of histidine or phenylalanine the molecular weights determined by GF and sucrose density gradient centrifugation were approximately and respectively on the basis of purification ratio substrate specificity inhibition by common substrates subcellular distribution isoelectric focusing and polyacrylamidegel electrophoresis it is suggested that kynurenine pyruvate aminotransferase is identical with histidine pyruvate aminotransferase and also with phenylalanine Pyr aminotransferase the physiological significance of the enzyme is discussed
922,using a rapid ph electrode measurements were made of the flashinduced proton transport in isolated spinach chloroplasts to calibrate the system we assumed that in the presence of ferricyanide and in steadystate flashing light each flash liberates from water one proton per reaction chain we concluded that with both ferricyanide and methylviologen as acceptors two protons per electron are translocated by the electron transport chain connecting photosystem ii and i with methyl viologen but not with ferricyanide as an acceptor two additional protons per electron are taken up due to photosystem i activity one of these latter protons is translocated to the inside of the thylakoid while the other is taken up in ho formation assuming that the proton released during water splitting remains inside the thylakoid we compute he ratios of and for ferricyanide and methylviologen respectively in continuous CS of low intensity we obtained the same he ratios however with higher intensities where electron transport becomes rate limited by the internal ph the he ratio approached as a limit for both acceptors a working model is presented which includes two CS of proton translocation one between the photoacts the other connected to photosystem i each of which translocates two protons per electron each site presents a approximately ms diffusion barrier to proton passage which can be lowered by uncouplers to ms
923,many aspects of cell behaviour are regulated by the interaction of extracellular ligands with specific receptors exposed on the cell surface the receptors correspond to membrane proteins and expecially glycoproteins a key event in regulation is the transmission across the surface membrane of the information resulting from receptorligand interaction the activation of lymphocytes by PHA phytohaemagglutinin pha provides a convenient experimental model for the T0 of the molecular basis of receptorligand interaction and the molecular consequences of interaction the receptor mediating lymphocyte activation by pha is probably a unique glycoprotein which is present to the extent of about x moleculescell the phareceptor complex solubilized in sodium deoxycholate has a molecular size of about x the primary event in the activation process is probably an increase in the permeability of the surface membrane to ca this may be achieved by pha crosslinking patching the receptors to form a polar channel that permits an influx of ca
924,the poor correlation between clinical salicylate toxicity and serum blood C2 is reapproached in CS of recent evidence linking clinical severity with initial volume of distribution vd it is recognized that two variables alter salicylate vd in such manner that serum salicylate levels are misleading thus the change in vd is ND by present methods these variables are serum protein IB and the phdependent ionizedunionized ratio in the unbound salicylate fraction measurements of salicylate concentration in the cerebro spinal fluid csf would circumvent these variables but would be clinically impractical thus an alternative is sought to the inexact total serum salicylate levels and the impractical csf salicylate levels for assessment of the severity of salicylate poisoning this study indicates that in dogs serum unbound salicylate C2 closely reflect csf salicylate C2 even as a decrease in serum protein binding is in progress however serum unbound salicylate concentration does not reflect csf salicylate concentration as a decrease in serum ph is elicited csf salicylate actually increased as SS unbound salicylate decreased on the other hand SS unbound salicylate measurement would seem preferable to total serum salicylate measurements now used in that the total value decreased markedly as either protein binding change or acidosis produced a NC in distribution and the resultant increase in csf salicylate
925,the structure of the fab fragment of a human myeloma protein igg lambda new has been determined by xray crystallographic analysis to a nominal resolution of nm each of the structure subunits corresponding to the variable and to the constant homology regions of the light and heavy polypeptide chains contains two irregular betasheets which are roughly parallel to each other and surround a tighly packed interior of hydrophobic side chains the regions of the hypervariable sequences in the light and HCs occur in close spatial proximity at one end of the molecule defining the active site of igg new the role of these HV regions in defining the size and shape of the active site of different immunoglobulins is discussed on the basis of the threedimensional model of fab new several ligands that bind to the active centre of igg new have been used to obtain crystalline ligandfab new complexes which were investigated by difference fourier maps these studies are analysed in terms of the biological function and specificity of antibodies
926,the postulate that low intracellular ph acts as a preconditioner for the destructuve effects of hyperthermia degrees c was examined using a heatsensitive line of malignant cells derived from rat mammary gland sdb intracellular ph phi was measured indirectly from the distribution of the weak nonmetabolizable organic acid dimethyloxazolidinedione dmo between intra and extracellular water QO2 aerobic and anaerobic and anaerobic glycolysis of the cells were studied at normal phi ph or at low phi ph and at degrees c or degrees c over h in warburg manometers the ability of the cells to replicate in culture was examined T3 h or h incubation in the flasks the relationship between phi and extracellular ph phe depended upon the buffer system used and the exact ph in question no assumption regarding phi based only on phe measurement could be made at degrees c and low phi the pasteur effect became negative due to a relatively greater inhibition of anaerobic than aerobic glycolysis respiration was unaffected and cell replicative ability unimpaired at degrees c and normal phi QO2 was totally inhibited after h and the pasteur effect was decreased in this case due to a compensatory increase in aerobic glycolysis without alteration in anaerobic co production low phi in the presence of hyperthermia enabled cell respiration to continue at a reduced level with no further NC in glycolysis there was delayed cell replication after h at degrees c and inability to multiply following h hyperthermia low phi did not influence these results it is concluded that with these cancer cells phi values maintained in the region of ph unit below normal for h had no deleterious effect on the cells no sensitizing effect of the low phi for the destructive effect of hyperthermia on the cells was observed
927,the kinetic properties of the constitutive double TPS glu dehydrogenase nadpgdh and the inducible nadpspecific glutamate dehydrogenase nadpgdh of chlorella pyrenoidosa pringsheim t thermophilic CS in a deaminating reaction have been studied nadpgdh behaves in a deamination as a michaelismenten enzyme nadpgdh displays some lagperiod before a steadystate phase the duration of this lag depends on a substrate concentration besides that an effect of all the substrates on a heat inactivation of both gdh and a product inhibition have been studied all the substrates except the reduced cofactors protect effectively gdh from the heat inactivation especially the thermolabille nadpgdh on the contrary nadph promote the heat inactivation of both gdh the product inhibition analysis shows that the inducible nadpgdh acts in vivo as a synthetic enzyme in the previous paper v r shatilov et all dokl acad nauk ussr it was shown for the constitutive gdh that pcmb strongly inhibited a desamination and slightly if any affect an amination it this paper it is shown that action of pcmb on the amination depends on the presence of nad not nadp or lglutamate pcmb and nad affect tha amination in a strongly sunergetic manner some suggestions about the intracellular localization of chlorella gdh are made
928,the existence of two different dglucosephosphate dehydrogenases in pseudomonas fluorescens has been demonstrated based on their different specificity and their different metabolic regulation one enzyme is appointed to the entnerdoudoroff pathway and the other to the HMP a procedure is described for the isolation of that dglucosephosphate dehydrogenase which forms part of the entnerdoudoroff pathway ED enzyme a fold purification was achieved with an overall yield of the final preparation having a TPS activity of about mumol nadh formed per min per mg protein was shown to be homogeneous the molecular weight of the entnerdoudoroff enzyme has been determined to be by gel permeation chromatography and that of the other enzyme zwischenferment has been shown to be the pi of the entnerdoudoroff enzyme has been shown to be and that of the zwischenferment the entnerdoudoroff enzyme is stable in the range of ph to and shows its Vmax at ph the entnerdoudoroff enzyme showed specificity for nad as well as for nadp and exhibited homotropic effects for dglucose phosphate it is inhibited by atp which acts as a negative allosteric effector other nucleoside triphosphates as well as adp are also GABA the enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the axial hydrogen at carbon of betadglucopyranose phosphate to the si face of carbon of the nicotinamide ring and must be classified as bside stereospecific dehydrogenase
929,the effects of the analgesics sulfentanil r and FE on autonimic stability cardiovascular stability respiratory depression and postoperative behaviour were compared in a standardised anaesthetic technique twentynine patients undergoing neurological arteriographies were treated with one or more doses of mg fentanyl patients were treated with an initial dose of mg of sulfentanil followed by repeat injections of mg when necessary the analgesic potency of sulfentanil proved to be times that of fentanyl while in contrast to fentanyl the duration of the respiratory depression after sulfentanil did not differ significantly from the duration of optimal analgesia the effects of both drugs on blood pressure and HR rate were minimal autonomic stability was excellent no serious side effects were seen in any of the patients after sulfentanil analgesia the patients were more rapidly awake and lucid than after fentanylanalgesia further investigations with this new and promising drug seem to be of great interest
930,the effects of metoprolol a selective beta adr antagonist on blood pressure beta ARB antagoinst of isoproterenol and exercise tachycardia and plasma renin activity pra have been compared with those of placebo in HT the dose of metroprolol was mg three times daily for wk and thereafter mg three times daily for wk the mean decrease in blood pressure during treatment with metoprolol was sem mm hg in the lying position and mm hg after min in the standing position at a dose of to mgkg steadystate PC of metoprolol varied fold from to ngml between patients and correlated with the interindividual variability in isoproterenol antagonism r p less than and decrease in exercise tachycardia r p less than by contrast neither of these variables correlated with the dose of MET in mgkg MET decreased pra by and in the lying and standing positions respectively the decrease in the mean arterial blood pressure in the lying position was significantly correlated to the pra during the placebo period r p less than but not to the plasma steadystate C2 of metoprolol the degree of beta receptor blockade and the decrease in pra
931,the influence of bovine serum albumin and soluble rat CL proteins on the activity of rat liver microsomal delta and delta desaturases has been studied in the absence of bovine SS albumin the delta desaturase which converts stearoylcoa into oleoylcoa shows a nonlinear correlation between enzyme activity and protein concentration optimum concentrations of bovine serum Al have three main effects on the enzyme activity i establishes a linear relationship between CEA and protein concentration ii stimulates the CEA fold and iii raises the optimum substrate concentration from to mum a highly purified soluble liver protein of molecular weight also stimulated the enzyme activity and brought about a linear relationship between CEA and protein concentration it was concluded that the nonlinear kinetics were due to limiting amounts of substrate binding protein in the microsomal preparations the delta desaturase which converts linoleoylcoa into gammalinolenoylcoa was also stimulated by bovine serum Al and soluble liver proteins the significance of the fatty acidbinding proteins is discussed
932,the flow dependency of hepatic HB metabolism was examined in the isolated perfused rat liver at low flow rates mlming of liver hexobarbital clearance was found to depend on perfusion fluid flow whereas at higher flow rates drug clearnace approached flow independence calculation of the in vivo hepatic blood flow rate suggested that HB metabolism in vivo should be highly dependent upon flow blood flow in the conscious rat was measured by use of radiolabeled microspheres during acute SE to C2 of hypoxic hypoxia lowered po or carbon monoxide which resulted in equal alterations in arterial oxyhemoglobin content approximately oxyhemoglobin hypoxic hypoxia o caused a massive redistribution of flow away from the splanchnic area resulting in a decrease in hepatic blood flow carbon monoxide ppm was without significant effect on hepatic blood flow these data would appear to explain the relatively greater GABA potency of HH on drug metabolism in vivo since drug delivery to the liver is depressed by HH but unaffected by carbon monoxide SE
933,structural requirements for substrate binding to histidyltrna synthetase from salmonella typhimurium have been investigated using atp analogues ki values and the relative binding affinity of the enzyme for these analogues have been determined in the trna aminoacylation reaction the enzyme is highly specific for atp no binding was found for gtp ctp ttp and utp datp is a very poor substrate for acylation of trna with a km fold higher than that of atp binding of adenosine triphosphate requires interactions of the amino group of adenosine and the sugar moiety the and the positions of the ribose appear to be essential for recognition the phosphate groups enhance the binding amp is a noncompetitive inhibitor with atp the interaction of histidyltrna synthetase a dimeric enzyme with histidine and atp was examined by fluorescence measurements at equilibrium and by equilibrium dialysis IB with lhistidine is significantly tighter at ph than at ph while the atp binding is independent of ph the stoichiometry was measured at ph than at ph while the atp binding is independent of ph the stoichiometry was measured at ph by equilibrium dialysis and is mol atpmol enzyme and variably close to or mol histidinemol enzyme
934,the effect of propranolol phentolamine papaverine theophyline and ca administered in different combinations of their threshold doses on the relaxing effect of adrenaline was studied on an isolated segment of proximal jejunum of male cats it was established that phentolamine weakened the relaxing effect of adrenaline while propranolol had no effect on it papaverine potentiated the relaxinf effects of adrenaline both when po CT and in combination with propranolol or with phentolamine theophylline weakened the relaxing effect of adfrenaline and of the combination phentolamineadrenaline ca increased the smoothmuscle tone the interpretation of the results obtained leads to the fundamental conclusions that the relaxing effect of adrenaline on cat jejunum is more alpha than betaadrenergically determined and that the system of the cyclic amp participates in its realization at the smae time however the possibility of participation of other mechanisms is not excluded the smoothmuscle effect of papaverine and theophylline is not determined only by their inhibitory effect on phosphodiesterase
935,the modern treatment of patients in a precarious state requires the use of technical appliances which become more complex and more numerous day by day the data generated by these appliances together with the conventional measurements of physiological parameters carried out by the nursing ataff during care with the results of laboratory examinations and with medical physical examinations represent a raw material of information which tends to increase each year the repetitive and handwritten consigning of these data likewise their traditional laborious consultation no longer guarantees today the taking of rapid decisions concerning the patients now this rapid decisionmaking is at the centre of the functioning of presentday intensive medicine of the surveillance and optimal treatment of the patients of the PET organization of the intensive care unit and of the economic efficiency of the exploitation it seems locigal therefore to wish to avail of the resources provided by information science to resolve these problems the united states japan and certain european countries have done so our purpose is to give some examples of the european RPA
936,during penicillin treatment of an autolysin defective mutant pneumococcus we have observed three novel phenomena i growth of the mutant cultures is inhibited by the same concentrations of penicillin that induce lysis in the wild type ii mutant bacteria treated with the minimum growth inhibitory concentration of penicillin will lyse upon the addition of wildtype autolysin to the GM chloramphenicol and other inhibitors of protein synthesis protect the cells against lysis by exogenous enzyme sensitivity of the cells to exogenous autolysin requires treatment with penicillin or other inhibitors of cell wall synthesis eg dcycloserine or fosfonomycin since exogenous autolysin CT has no effect on bacterial growth iii treatment with penicillin or other inhibitors of cell wall synthesis causes the escape into the medium of a cholinecontaining macromolecule that has properties suggesting that it contains pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid forssman antigen each one of these three phenomena growth inhibition sensitization to exogenous autolysin and leakage of lipoteichoic acid shows the same dose response as that of the penicillininduced lysis of wildtype pneumococci on the basis of these findings we propose a new hypothesis for the mechanism of penicillininduced lysis of bacteria it is suggested that inhibition of cell wall synthesis by any means triggers bacterial autolytic enzymes by destabilizing the endogenous complex of an autolysin inhibitor lipoteichoic acid and autolytic enzyme escape of lipoteichoic acidlike material to the growth medium is a consequence of this labilization chloramphenicol protects bacteria against penicillininduced lysis by interfering with the activity of the autolytic enzyme rather than by depleting the concentration of the enzyme at the cell surface
937,in present T0 interactions of some adrenergic drugs with the binding of hnorepinephrine ne and response of some enzymatic systems in the heart of rats with pharmacological hyperthyroidism have been investigated binding of ne to cardiac particles was inhibited by isoproterenol propranolol and in lower concentrations by another betablocking drug trimepranol both in control and hyperthyroid NF in the same degree however after addition of nonradioactive norepinephrine m the degree of MSD was lower in hyperthyroid than in euthyroid group activity of adenylate cyclase was lower in hyperthyroid cardiac particles this difference remained preserved T3 stimulation by norepinephrine or naf the MICs of hormonesensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase were increased in preparation of hyperthyroid hearts the phosphorylase a activity was also increased in hyperthyroid cardiac particles there was no change in cardiac adrenergic binding sites properties in hyperthyroidism with the exception of less displacement of ne by nonlabelled hormone the results indicate that the increased lipolytic and phosphorylase a activities in hyperthyroid NF are not necessarily linked to elevated activity of adenylate cyclase
938,by employing spectrofluorometry and quantitative fluorescent histochemistry the norepinephrine ne content in the tissue and in the adrenergic nerves of VD of the rat T3 SD of the transmitters reserves with tyramine and their subsequent replenishment through incubation of the tissue with exogenous ne was measured the object of investigations was also the influence of ADs phthoracizine and imipramine and of the cholinolytic spasmolytin diphacyl on processes of the ne accumulation phthoracizine impramine and spasmolytin were found to capable of inhibiting accumulation of the exogenous ne in the tissue and in the adrenergic nerves of VD provided the mediator is present in the extraneuronal medium in a concentration of gammaml when the neurotransmitter was introduced into the medium in higher concentrations gammaml the antidepressents and cholinolytic did not produce the said effect a correlation of spectrofluorometric and quantitative fluorescenthistochemical findings was observed in cases when the tissue contained less than ie less than gammaml of the total ne reserves
939,determination of the effect of ph and temperature on pka partition and drug distribution coefficients in a series of common narcotics and their antagonists has shown that within the range of blood ph to encountered in the practice of anesthesiology marked differences of CSD of the drugs between a MM lipid octanol and water can occur when these data are considered in the CS of clinical experience with narcotics used in patients undergoing or recovering from surgical procedures a correlation between the depth and duration of narcosis or the efficacy of narcotic antidotes and ventilatory status is seen this correlation can be explained in part if the influence of blood ph on the probable cnsblood CSD of a given drug is taken into consideration support is given to this proposal by representative studies in the literature the very different drug CSD coefficients of two closely related narcotic antagonists naloxone and naltrexone correctly predicted the faster onset and shorter duration of the former which was confirmed by reported clinical observations
940,various properties of the steroid alphareductase have been examined in cellfree extracts of skin and of fibroblasts cultured from genital and nongenital skin from control subjects and from patients with several forms of male pseudohermaphroditism when alphahydroxyh pregnenone was used as substrate two alphareductase activities could be demonstrated in intact skin and cultured fibroblasts the major activity previously described for microsomes from human prepuce and extracts of cultured foreskin fibroblasts is characterized by a narrow ph optimum near and is limited to fibroblasts derived from genital skin a second activity not limited by the site of biopsy has been demonstrated over a higher and broader range of ph from to this CEA is found in both genital and nongenital skin and in fibroblasts cultured from all skin regions whereas there is wide variability in the activity at ph in genital skin fibroblasts the activity at ph to is similar in fibroblasts derived from all anatomical CS the two activities exhibit different kinetics with respect to steroid substrate and are also dissimilar in their subcellular distributions other properties such as coenzyme requirement steroid ATP specificity and instability with increasing temperature appear to be similar
941,the physician who understands the pathophysiology of angina pectoris can apply rational therapeutic measures based on an appreciation of the determinants of myocardial oxygen supply and demand most patients with angina secondary to coronary atherosclerosis can be treated conservatively using a systematic approach that includes correction or removal of underlying causes or precipitating factors and the judicious use of sublingual nitroglycerin in patients with more resistant angina use of oral or topical nitroglycerin or sublingual isosorbide dinitrite as well as propranolol can be advised aortocoronary bypass surgery can offer significant improvement in carefully selected patients with frequent angina poorly controlled by medical therapy the most important consideration in the treatment of angina is protection of coronary blood flow reserve by primary prevention of the atherosclerotic process itself all individuals from families prone to coronary artery disease should be evaluated for alterable risk AF the most important being cigarette smoking hypertension and hypercholesterolemia considering the high risk of unheralded sudden death in previously asymptomatic patients with coronary atherosclerosis angina can in a sense be considered a fortunate harbinger of coronary stenosis identifying candidates for secondary preventive measures aimed at retarding the progression of V1 disease more importantly angina serves as an index for detecting families at high risk of coronary artery disease in whom early application of primary prevention may afford a more promising outlook
942,a doubleblind random study compared the effects of lorazepam and pantopon an IM premedication in healthy women for uterine curettage d c anxiety as assessed by a selfrating test by the patient and by a trained observer showed a significant reduction at one and onehalf hours T3 lorazepam and a smaller reduction after pantopon which was not significant sedation was satisfactory with no significant difference between the two drugs in the change before and T3 the premedication lorazepam showed much more amnesia than pantopon p less than the patients who had lorazepam required higher doses of thiopentone for the operation and this in part led to longer intervals in REC times after lorazepam however it is suggested that lorazepam itself was partly responsible for the longer recovery pantopon was followed by more nausea vomiting and headaches than lorazepam the IM injection of lorazepam hurt more patients than did pantopon but other local complications were negligible and comparable in both groups the results of this study show that lorazepam produces better reduction of anxiety and much more amnesia than pantopon with comparable sedation and much less nausea and vomiting the only disadvantage of lorazepam is the lack of analgesia and therefore the need for more anaesthesia during the operation the conclusion is that lorazepam is a very satisfactory premedication and warrants more use as such
943,acetylcoa synthase ec propionylcoa synthase ec and butyrylcoa synthase ec were measured in subcellular fractions prepared by primary and densitygradient fractionation from AD rat brain by a method resulting in recoveries close to most of the activity of the three enzymes was recovered in the P2 fraction on subfractionation of this crude mitochondrial fraction with continuous sucrose density gradients most of the activity of the three enzymes was found at a higher density than nadisocitrate dehydrogenase and at about the same density as glu dehydrogenase confirming earlier reported data for acetylcoa synthase the finding that propionylcoa synthase and butyrylcoa synthase had about the same distribution in the gradients as acetylcoa synthase adds support to the hypothesis that mitochondria involved in the metabolism of these shortchain fatty acids all three of which have been shown to result in a rapid and high labelling of glutamine in vivo form a distinct subpopulation of the total mitochondrial population the three synthase activities were found to differ from each other in their rate of NC and their subcellular localization during rat BB development this in combination with the observation that in gradients of AD brain S9 the three MICs did not completely overlap suggests that the three synthase MICs are not present in the same proportion to each other in the same subpopulation s of mitochondria in the brain
944,the effects of unilateral and bilateral cryptorchidism and castration on serum concentrations of testosterone fsh and lh in adult male rats were examined the results provide no evidence for compensatory growth or OD of the remaining scrotal testes up to days after unilateral castration although the scrotal testis of unilaterally cryptorchid rats showed enlargement when compared with those of control rats p less than at days unilateral treatments had few significant effects on SS hormones but testosterone was increased on day p less than in unilaterally cryptorchid rats and on day p less than in unilaterally castrated rats compared with controls and fsh C2 were higher in unilaterally castrated rats on day p less than BL cryptorchidism caused an increase in SS fsh within days p less than and in serum lh by days p less than after surgery with both hormones reaching levels double those found in control rats p less than by day while testosterone levels were maintained at or above control values bilateral castration resulted in a marked decrease in testosterone levels p less than and a sharp increase in serum gonadotrophins fsh had nearly doubled p less than and lh had increased fourfold p less than days after castration their C2 reaching lh and fsh of control values by days p less than the observations support the hypothesis of a separate testosteroneindependent feedback system of the testis on the hypophysis
945,animal experiments were set up mainly to derive additional diagnostic data from the study of biochemical changes after acute head injury in standardized experiments guinea pigs were subjected in CG of to three identical head injuries each of either j or j intensity the trauma was likely to result in a concussion or contusion syndrome similar to that found in man animals served as controls during the min T3 injury observation and measurement of body functions did not reveal signs of a shocklike condition or hypoxaemia in the traumatized animals compared with control animals superficial anaesthesia probably did not influence the findings temperature and QO2 were altered significantly in all the animals receiving head injuries blood gas analysis showed a decrease of standard bicarbonate only after the j injury but even though hypoxaemia was not present diphosphoglycerate values and p increased compared with the control animals the fall of plasma lipid concentrations reported probably had to be seen as a sympathomimetic effect of the minor j trauma of special significance was the increased activity of malate dehydrogenase and ALD found only in the blood of severely traumatized animals as this could serve as an early diagnostic aid for evaluating head injuries
946,the kinetics of inactivation and reactivation of rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase have been studied as a function of ph and enzyme concentration at constant temperature in phosphate buffer from the enzyme concentration dependence we conclude that the minimal mechanism for inactivation involves a protonation step followed by isomerization to an inactive form and then dissociation to a species of onehalf the molecular weight other data indicate a subsequent isomerization of the dissociated form the ph and temperature dependence of the inactivation process shows that it is controlled by ionizable groups and that the apparent pk for these groups is temperaturedependent in such a way as to make the enzyme show the characteristic of cold lability below ph reactivation of the inactive enzyme occurs by a kinetically different pathway involving deprotonation of an inactive dissociated form to a form which may either isomerize to another inactive form or dimerize to the active enzyme a general mechanism is postulated in which the inactivation and reactivation processes are different aspects of the same mechanism this mechanism assumes four species two containing four subunits and two containing two subunits each of which can exist in a protonated and unprotonated form inactivation or reactivation induced by changes in ph or temperature reflect the kinetic establishment of a new steady state between these forms how the apparent pk values which control the CSD of the enzyme between protonated and unprotonated forms describe the phdependent characteristics of the enzyme is discussed in terms of the proposed mechanism
947,betadglucopyranosyls and repoxyethanes i and ii betadglucopyranosylr and sepoxypropanes iii and iv betadglucopyranosyl isothiocyanate v and betadgalactopyranosylepoxyethane vi are activesitedirected irreversible inhibitors of sweetalmond betaglucosidase b betadglucoside glucohydrolase ec formation of the covalent bond is preceded by the binding of these inhibitors in the active site of the enzyme this is testitified by the competitive character of inhibition of betaglucosidase component b by compounds ivi at the early period and by the protection of the enzyme from inactivation by its competitive inhibitors dglucose and dgluconolactone epoxides iiv are bound covalently with componet b at a molar ratio as shown with the aid of clabelled inhibitors the PR of the label from modified enzyme ei covalent by treatment with hydroxylamine suggests the formation of an ester bond between inhibitors iiv and the carboxyl group of the enzyme active site the ph dependence curve of the inactivation rate of betaglucosidase b is of a bellshaped form for v and of a sigmoid character for iiv and points to the involvement of the active site groups with pka and
948,the behaviour of the partial tensions of respiratory gases and the main parameters of acid base balance in hypoxaemic and eucapnic chronic bronchopneumopathics undergoing oxygen therapy has been assessed the patiests were subdivided into two groups the first consisting of subjects undergoing oxygen therapy CT the second of subjects having oxygen and iv theophylline at the same time two subgroups were also distinguished these consisted respectively of normochloraemic and hypochloraemic patients the purpose being to reveal whether electrolytic changes could be attributed to the concentration of chlorine evaluated in basal conditions the results obtained showed a disappearance of the hypoxaemic state without appreciable changes in paco in all patients in those undergoing oxygen therapy only also observed were increase in plasmatic h and reduction in ph diminution in hco and plasma na increase in plasma concentration of cl statistical significance of these data tendency of all values in the parameters considered to return to basal values upon suspension of oxygenation
949,the inhibition of shortcircuit current isc in isolated frog skin and the induction of surface potentials in lipid bilayer CM produced by the diuretic drug amiloride and a number of its chemical analogues was studied the major conclusions of our T0 are a the charged form of amiloride is the biologically AS species b both the magnitude of isc and the amiloride GABA effect are sensitive to the ionic milieu bathing the isolated skin and these two features are modulated at separate and distinct regions on the transport site c amiloride is very specific in its inhibitory interaction with the na transport site since slight structural modifications can result in significant changes in drug effectiveness we found that substitutions at pyrazine ring position greatly diminish drug activity while changes at position are less drastic alterations in the guanidinium moiety only diminish activity if the result is a change in the spatial orientation of the amino group carrying the positive charge d amiloride can bind to and alter the charge on membrane surfaces but this action cannot explain its highly specific effects in biological systems
950,the membranous guanylate cyclase of balb t fibroblasts was stimulated by a fraction of calf serum extracted by ether stimulation was observed with mg as the only bivalent cation in the presence of lubrol px the activator cochromatographed with free fatty acids and several of these were found to stimulate guanylate cyclase among the saturated fatty acids myristic acid had the highest activity stimulating activity diminished as the hydrocarbon chain of the fatty acid was lengthened or shortened introduction of an unsaturated bond enhanced the activation by the longer fatty acids this DP of specificity is similar to that observed for the effect of fatty acids on many other membranous functions under appropriate conditions fatty acids were found to stimulate guanylate cyclase activity in the absence of lubrol px the relationship among the effects of mg mn lubrol px and fatty acids on enzyme activity was examined on the basis of these studies it appears that fatty acids stimulate the enzyme by a mechanism different from nonionic detergents or mn
951,treatment of dba hd mice with bacterial endotoxin prior to transplantation of their SP and lymph node cells into IS akr hk mice prevented acute mortality from graftversushost gvh disease akr mice that received immunocompetent cells from untreated dba mice had a median survival time mst of days in contrast akr mice that received immunocompetent cells from endotoxintreated dba donors had an mst of days endotoxin treatment of akr recipients was not essential for preventing mortality from acute gvh disease chimerism was proved by demonstrating that the lymphoid cells of LT surviving akr mice had the characteristics of dba lymphoid cells as measured by their response in mixed leukocyte culture mlc tests SP cells from endotoxintreated dba mice were able to stimulate and to be stimulated by akr spleen cells in mlc assays furthermore spleen cells from endotoxintreated dba mice did not suppress the responses of dba or akr spleen cells in threeparty mlc tests
952,starfish asterias forbesi oocytes encased within their F2 cells mature spontaneously during a portion of the normal reproductive period when released from the ovary into seawater a previous report has shown that oocytes isolated in acidic seawater do not mature spontaneously but retain the capacity to do so when returned to normal seawater the object of this study was to determine the mechanism by which acidic ph reversibly blocks spontaneous oocyte maturation in isolated follicles incidence of spontaneous oocyte maturation in follicles isolated in acidic seawater decreased as ph decreased from to oocytes in which spontaneous maturation was inhibited asw at ph to underwent germinal vesicle breakdown with the addition of methyladenine oocytes isolated in acidic seawater ph or with IN follicle cells matured spontaneously when transferred immediately to normal seawater ph T3 four hours of the follicles incubated in seawater at ph matured spontaneously when returned to normal seawater as compared to less than of the follicles maintained at ph inhibition of spontaneous maturation was not reversible in the absence of the follicle cells oocytes isolated in acidic seawater with their follicle cells did not spontaneously mature when transferred to calciumfree seawater at ph the results obtained support the hypothesis that acidic seawater reversibly inhibits spontaneous oocyte maturation by interfering with the release of meiosisinducing substance from the F2 cells
953,rat urinary bladder carcinoma r grew readily in vitro in areas where saturation density occurred in the cultures occasional hemicysts were observed a modification of technique producing packed cultures resulted in the appearance of greater numbers of hemicysts four clonal isolates of r were also studied in packed culture clone b formed hemicysts in abundance clone d produced occasional hemicysts similar to the parent stock L1 no hemicysts were seen in cultures of clone a or clone c the number of hemicysts formed by clone b in packed SC was responsive to the ratio between cell number and volume of medium to serum concentration in the medium and to ph of the medium the last was of particular interest since a ph of enhanced and a ph of inhibited hemicyst formation the effects were all reversible on SEM microscopy we found welldeveloped cell membrane structures between contiguous cells in media with sufficient serum for hemicyst formation the articulations between cells were prominent with low serum concentrations hemicysts did not form and the intercellular articulations were less distinct we interpret the formation of hemicysts as an expression of fluid transport by epithelia a function that requires a constellation of differentiated characteristics within cells and in their level of integrated association
954,a method of preparation of mitochondria free of nuclear dna and its fragments by treatment of mitochondria with deaecellulose has been developed this method is based on binding nuclear nucleic acids and nucleoproteins to deaecellulose particles in the media used for isolation of mitochondria treatment with deaecellulose under the conditions described does not induce any visible degradation of mitochondria and mitochondrial dna the mitochondrial dna S9 obtained from beef and rat liver are represented with closed circular molecules of contour length about mu the methylcytosine content in beef and rat mitochondrial dna and mole respectively is twice as much as in corresponding nuclear dna besides mitochondrial dna strongly differs from nuclear ones by a lower degree of pyrimidine clustering the amount of mono and dipyrimidine fragments about mole in mitochondrial dna is times as large and the content of long pyrimidine clusters hexa and others is times as low as those in nuclear dna the methylation level and the pyrimidine clustering degree may be used as criteria for the purity of mitochondrial dna from nuclear dna
955,if bone marrow transplantation is to become widely applicable in the treatment of patients with leukemia and aplastic anemia the necessity to have a perfectly histocompatible donor must be overcome in an effort to define the roles of hla type and mixed lymphocyte culture mlc CR in the determination of successful engraftment and the occurrence of graftversushost disease gvhd we have attempted transplantation of a child with acute myeloblastic leukemia aml using an hla MZ mlcreactive sibling donor successful engraftment has been accomplished as documented by the appearance of multiple donor genetic markers in the recipient there is no evidence of severe gvhd the recipient is alive without evidence of leukemia and has returned to full activities mo T3 transplantation the recipient now produces lymphocytes which have the mlc CR that characterize the donors lymphocytes rather than that of her own pretransplant lymphocytes this experience demonstrates that successful bone marrow transplantation in patients with one can be accomplished in the face of mlc CR
956,the spectral characteristics of the phsensitive dyes neutral red nr and bromcresol purple bcp were utilized for studies of the changing intracellular ph phi of sartorius muscles from rana pipiens both during the course of an Pt and during REC metabolism subsequent to a train of twitches the information from the two dissimilar dyes correlated to confirm the methodology neither the fast realkalinization observed during a twitch nor the slow alkalizing phase of recovery metabolism was affected in an obvious manner when phosphocreatine pc hydrolysis was blocked by fluorodinitrobenzene fdnb iodoacetic acid iaa did inhibit the slow acidic phase of recovery metabolism the conclusion is made that alkalizing reactions other than pc breakdown must be considered as operative at these levels of activity hypertonic solutions altered twitch tension and time course without altering the phi shifts observed until approximately of the twitch amplitude was abolished multiple effects of hypertonic solutions as the muscle RPA tonic equilibrium are proposed
957,in order to evaluate the influence of the time interval on the second twin in twin deliveries we have used more precise criteria than have been used in the literature to date in the period from july to december twin deliveries in our hospital were analyzed in which both twins fulfilled the following criteria vertex presentation vaginal deliveries birth weight above g we analyzed various parameters in the clinical and pH score of the second twin CT as well as in comparison to the first twin the following points of view were considered the more sensitive aspect of morbidity was utilized by including the assessment of the state of the P0 rather than just mortality since caesarean sections in twins are often performed for a fetal indication short time intervals between the birth of both infants correlate intrinsically with a higher risk for the second twin therefore we considered only vaginal deliveries in order to exclude this intrinsic correlation by excluding infants below a birth weight of g the influence of the low birth weight of the second twin was eliminated the frequently occurring positional anomalies of the second twin will deteriorate the conditions independent of the time interval therefore we have considered only births from vertex presentations a comparison of the pH state demonstrated that the actual ph values in the umbilical i.a. blood of these second twins fig decrease statistically significantly with increasing time intervals this is also true for metabolic acidity phqu the differences of the actual ph values fig and the phqu values between the first and second twin decreases significantly also with an increasing time interval our results indicate that obstetricians according to the clinical conditions should accomplish the birth of the second twin as soon as possible T3 the birth of the first twin
958,when klebsiella pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide cpsk from type kasuya CS was injected intraperitoneally ip immediately before ip bacterial challenge the survival time of mice infected with salmonella enteritidis nub virulent strain was shortened and the mortality rate for mice infected with s enteritidis nub avirulent CS was enhanced the promotion of infection with s enteritidis nub by cpsk depended upon its dose the effect of cpsk being demonstrable up to as little as mug per mouse in the case of s enteritidis nub the effect of cpsk was detectable only when more than mug per mouse was injected as a result of enumeration of bacterial populations in the peritoneal washing blood liver and spleen it was revealed that cpsk promoted in vivo growth of s enteritidis nub and nub in addition cpsk enhanced the MR in mice infected with streptococcus pyogenes or streptococcus pneumoniae the peak cpsk effect on infection with s enteritidis nub was seen when given immediately before bacterial challenge the active substance responsible for the infectionpromoting effect of cpsk was neutral cpsk which is distinct from the o antigen and from acidic cpsk the typespecific capsular antigen S9 of neutral cpsk isolated from the other three strains of k pneumoniae exhibited a marked infectionpromoting effect comparable with that of S9 from the kasuya CS neutral cpsk with identical antigenicity to that from the kasuya strain has already been found to exert a strong adjuvant effect on antibody responses to various antigens in mice no parallelism exists between infectionpromoting activity and adjuvant activity of neutral cpsk

960,horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase was reacted with glyoxal at different ph values ranging from to at ph the enzyme undergoes a rapid activation over the first minutes of reaction followed by a decline of activity which reaches of that of the native enzyme chemical analysis of the inactivated enzyme after sodium borohydride reduction shows that argiine and lysine residues per mole are modified at ph the enzyme activity increases during the first hour of the reaction with glyoxal and then decreases slowly chemical analysis shows that arginine and lysine residues per mole are modified in the enzyme at the maximum of activation at ph the enzyme undergoes a fold activation chemical analysis shows that in this activated enzyme lysine and no arginine residues per mole have been modified steadystate kinetic analysis suggests that the G1 enzyme is not subjected to ATP inhibition and that its K(m) for ethanol is three times larger than that of the native enzyme the possible role of Arg and lysine residues in the catalytic function of CL alcohol dehydrogenase is discussed
961,location of electron transport chain components in cp membranes of chlamydomonas reinhardi y was investigated by use of proteolytic digestion with soluble or insolubilized trypsin digestion of intact membrane LDV with soluble TR inactivates the watersplitting system the dichlorophenyldimethylurea inhibition site of PS ii the electron transport between the two photosystems as well as the ferredoxin nadp reductase reduction of nadp with artificial electron donors for photosystem i could be restored however by addition of purified reductase to trypsindigested CM electron transfer activities of photosystems i and ii RCs were resistant to TR digestion either from outside or from within the thylakoids when active trypsin was trapped inside the membrane LDV by sonication and digestion carried out in the presence of trypsin inhibitor added from outside in the latter case the watersplitting system was also found to be resistant to digestion polyacrylamidebound insolubilized trypsin inactivated only the ferredoxin nadp reductase photosynthetically AS membranes obtained at different stages of OD showed a basically similar SMB toward trypsin
962,the influence of clonidine on alphaadrenoreceptors in the central NS of rats and mice has been investigated both functional events due to postsynaptic receptor stimulation flexor reflex activity MA and biochemical changes have been considered clonidine was less potent in stimulating the hindlimb flexor reflex activity of spinal rats than in inhibiting the alphamethyltyrosineinduced disappearance of noradrenaline in the spinal cord and in the whole brain of rats the increase in FR activity due to clonidine mgkg was virtually completely inhibited by phenoxybenzamine mgkg and haloperidol mgkg was partially inhibited by yohimbine mgkg and piperoxan mgkg and was not significantly inhibited by yohimbine mgkg and tolazoline mgkg the potentiation by clonidine of the apomorphineinduced locomotor stimulation of reserpinetreated mice was almost CR inhibited by phenoxybenzamine mgkg but was not significantly affected by yohimbine or mgkg and only slightly inhibited by tolazoline mgkg clonidine mgkg caused a considerable inhibition of the alphamethyltyrosineinduced disappearance of noradrenaline in the spinal cord and brain or rats and in the brain of mice this effect of clonidine was CR antagonized by yohimbine mgkg it was markedly antagonized by yohimbine mgkg piperoxan mgkg or tolazoline mgkg but not by phenoxybenzamine mgkg or haloperidol mgkg clonidine mgkg caused an inhibition of the accumulation of dopa T3 decarboxylase inhibition in the noradrenalinerich regions of the rat central nervous system this effect was counteracted by yohimbine mgkg piperoxan mgkg or tolazoline mgkg but not by phenoxybenzamine mgkg the postsynaptic functional effects and the biochemical effects of clonidine may be due to stimulation of different alphaadrenoreceptors since the two effects were inhibited differently by various alphaadrenoreceptor blocking agents and since the two effects were produced by different doses of clonidine the alphaadrenoreceptors mediating the PSA changes might be located on the noradrenergic neurones
963,transport properties of AS enzyme species can be studied effectively by layering a small band of enzymecontaining sample on a gel chromatographic column previously saturated with substrate the column is optically scanned at successive time intervals to yield profiles representing the appearance of chromophoric product or disappearnce of chromophoric substrate these profiles permit determination of the specific activity and rate of transport of the active species initial studies on mechanic of the technique establish the feasibility of accurately determining transport properties of AS enzyme species chromatographed on gel columns illustrative results are presented for lglutamate dehydrogenase and for homoserine dehydrogenase studied in both forward and reverse reactions it is shown that the partititon cross sections derived from the rates of motion of catalytic activity are the same as those determined by equilibrium saturation experiments which directly measure the degree of partitioning by the protein these results establish the validity of the technique for a variety of future studies active enzyme gel chromatography appears comparable in precision to the AS enzyme sedimentation technique at current stages of development
964,the administration of guanethidine to newborn rats has been shown to produce a permanent sympathectomy with potential advantages over immunosympathectomy and hydroxydopamineinduced chemical sympathectomy in this paper we report on a revised treatment regimen involving initiation of treatment mgkgday on day T3 birth and continuing for weeks animals treated by this protocol have a low mortality rate approx above salinetreated controls and no permanent growth deficit analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in and light microscopic examination of SCG of the guanethidinetreated animals indicate CR destruction of sympathetic neurons by the end of the second week of treatment during and after treatment there are no decreases in norepinephrine in whole brain of the treated animals norepinephrine C2 in peripheral tissues are markedly reduced at both and weeks of age stimulation of vasomotor outflow produces no increase in blood pressure in guanethidinetreated rats at or weeks of age indicating a CR and permanent functional denervation of the vasculature the adrenal PG of the guanethidinetreated animals are not destroyed but rather respond apparently by transsynaptic induction with increases in IMT hydroxylase and EN content interestingly despite the continued deprivation of a IP sympathetic nervous system in these animals adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase and epinephrine levels return to control C2 by weeks of age these data indicate that administration of guanethidine to P0 rats produces a very complete and permanent sympathectomy with significant advantages over immunosympathectomy and hydroxydopamineinduced chemical sympathectomy
965,investigation of some phdependent properties of human EA carbonic anhydrase b indicate that the active site is influenced by at least two charged groups the properties studied include the ph dependence of inhibition of native monocarboxamidomethyl and monocarboxymethyl enzymes by iodide ion and the ph dependence of the visible spectra of the cobalt derivatives of these enzymes one ionizing group has a pka of about in the native enzyme in the carboxyamidomethyl enzyme and in the CM enzyme it has a major influence on activity and anion inhibition and on the visible spectra of the cobalt enzymes a second group has a pka of about in native and modified enzymes when zinc is at the active site the secondary group in its acidic form decreases the ki for i with the carboxyamidomethyl and carboxymethyl enzymes the ki decreases by about an order of magnitude however if cobalt is substituted for zinc in the modified enzymes this group does not influence the ki for i and the binding of i does not influence the pka of the spectral EMT caused by ionization of this secondary group in the case of nonalkylated coenzyme another ionizing group with a pk of about prevents the binging of i at low ph these results show that the active site is altered when cobalt is substituted for zinc in carbonic anhydrase b
966,bovine and porcine luteinizing hormones blh plh and their subunits were treated by ethoxyformyl anhydride the acylation of the histidine residues was followed by examination of the absorbance spectrum all the histidine residues of the luteinizing hormone molecule can be modified at ph however his in blh and in plh appear to be much less reactive at ph than the others and their acylated imidazols more labile at the same ph at neutral ph histidines in blh and in plh become unreactive in the case of the subunits histidine becomes unreactive in each S1 at neutral ph these unreactive histidine residues at neutral ph are probably those which appear to be poorly reactive at ph comparison of the results obtained with blh and plh suggests that of the histidine residues present in blh and absent in plh beta beta only one exhibits a low CR acylation of his in blh do not cause dissociation into subunits of the molecule but supress per cent of the biological activity
967,up until now it has been assumed that the proteasebinding property of alphaprotease inhibitor alphapi was destroyed by acid ST gel electrophoresis ph analyses on acid starch gel blocks for ph and conductivity changes during and following a typical electrophoretic run showed that it was unlikely that the separating alphapi would be exposed to ph values lower than and that the allele products following the passage of the buffer front were in an environment of constant ph extremely low conductivity and high field strength these results strongly suggested the likelihood that alphapi would be chemically and physically unchanged as a result of exposure to acid SGE in order to test this likelihood human SS was electrophoretically separated in acid starch gel and following electrophoresis was immersed in m diethylbarbiturate buffer ph containing mugml of pancreatic elastase the phadjusted and elastaseimpregnated starch gel layer was superimposed on hemoglobinagar for h at degrees c followed by immersion of the hemoglobinagar layer in nacl overnight DW for h drying under filter paper and staining the results showed zones of undigested hemoglobin indicating unequivocally that the separated alphapi allele products are capable of forming complexes with proteases and that alphapi is not inactivated following SE to acid ST gel electrophoresis densitometric analysis of the transparent stained zones on a clear agar gel background offers an alternative to analysis of the acid starch gelseparated zones by antigenantibody crossed electrophoresis and as such is suitable for identification of alphaprotease inhibitor phenotypes further the method is TPS for alphapi and a densitometric scan provides direct information relative to the proteasebinding capacity of the sample as well as the contribution of each alphapi allele product to that capacity
968,the anionic tryptic enzyme from the crayfish crayfish TR was adsorbed to deaesephadex a and covalently coupled to brcnactivated sepharose b and porous glass loaded with isothiocyanate propyl groups itcglass the relative activities against ptosylarginine methyl ester tosargome were found to be to for deaesephadex crayfish TR to for sepharose crayfish trypsin and to for itcglass crayfish trypsin the relative activities rise with declining protein content of the enzyme matrix complexes the highest relative proteinase activities ATP casein were obtained with sepharose crayfish trypsin followed by deaesephadex crayfish trypsin and itcglass crayfish trypsin similar results are obtained with protamine and native lactate dehydrogenase as substrates in accordance with the sepharose bovine trypsin complex the Km constant kmapp of the sepharose crayfish trypsin with tosargome was found to be markedly higher than that of the native enzyme the phactivity profiles of the crayfish trypsin derivatives using tosargome as substrate were shown to be displaced towards more alkaline ph values by itcglass crayfish trypsin and sepharose crayfish TR ph units respectively or towards more acidic ph values by ph units with the polycationic derivative deaesephadex crayfish TR as compared to the native enzyme optimum ph concerning the temperature stability of the derivatives sepharose crayfish TR was more stabile itcglass crayfish TR behaves like the native crayfish TR and deaesephadex crayfish trypsin was more sensitive at elevated temperatures as compared to the soluble enzyme the properties of the crayfish trypsin derivatives are compared with the properties of the bovine analogues
969,elective induction was practised in of deliveries duration of delivery was if anything shortened after elective induction compared with spontaneous delivery there was no evidence of softtissue dystocias after elective induction the apgar score was in of children born after elective induction ph of umbilicalartery blood in of children T3 elective induction was greater than or equal to there was a striking increase in the incidence of occiput posterior position with elective induction of cases the incidence of operative vaginal delivery was as frequent T3 elective as T3 all other forms of delivery the incidence of section was after elective induction in the entire series intrauterine asphyxia being an indication in compared with for the total group the frequency of operations was inversely proportional to the C2 index perinatal mortality was per thousand one case after elective induction per thousand in the total group per thousand in those with indication for early induction perinatal mortality decreased from per thousand to per thousand from to
970,the binding and action of glucagon at its receptor in hepatic plasma CM have been compared as a function of ph with that of glucagon containing iodotyrosyl residues iodinated glucagon at ph and below binds to the receptor and activates adenylate cyclase with an affinity about threefold higher than that of native glucagon at ph the affinity of the receptor for native glucagon is the same as that seen at ph however iodinated glucagon binds with a lowered affinity with increasing ph the decreased affinity of the iodinated hormone correlates with ionization of the iodotyrosyl phenoxy groups which has a pka of it is suggested that the decreased affinity is actually due to the inability of the ionized iodoglucagon to bind to the receptor the relative potency of native and iodoglucagon will depend therefore on the concentrations of ionized and unionized species of iodoglucagon which in turn depend on the ph of the medium we conclude that incorporation of iodine atoms in the tyrosyl residues of glucagon has two major effects i the iodine atom increases hydrophobic interaction of the hormone with the receptor and ii ionization of the phenoxy groups results in the loss of biological activity possibly as the result of loss of hydrogen bonding capability thus the tyrosyl residues in glucagon are critically involved in the function of the hormone
971,a previously unrecognized enzyme citrate lyase deacetylase has been purified about fold from cell extracts of rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa it catalyzed the conversion of enzymatically active acetylscitrate lyase into the inactive hsform and acetate the enzyme exhibited an optimal rate of inactivation at ph because of the instability of acetylscitrate lyase at acidic and ALP ph values all assays were carried out at ph where the spontaneous hydrolysis of the acetylscitrate lyase was negligible and deacetylase showed of the activity at ph the apparent km value for citrate lyase was m at ph and c the activity of the deacetylase was restricted to the citrate lyase from r gelatinosa the corresponding lyases from enterobacter aerogenes formerly klebsiella aerogenes and streptococcus diacetilactis were not deacetylated likewise thioesters such as acetyls coenzyme a acetoacetyls coenzyme a and nacetylsacetylcysteamine were also not hydrolyzed citrate lyase deacetylase was present in very small amounts in cells of r gelatinosa grown with acetate or succinate it was induced by citrate along with the citrate lyase lglutamate strongly inhibited the deacetylase fifty percent inhibition was obtained at a concentration of x lglutamate dglutamate alphaketoglutarate lalphahydroxyglutarate lproline and other metabolites were less effective
972,the levels of the adenine nucleotides pyridine nucleotides and the kinetical parameters of the enzymes of the entnerdoudoroff pathway glucosephosphate dehydrogenase and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were determined in azotobacter vinelandii cells grown under o or nlimiting conditions it was concluced that the levels of both the adenine nucleotides and pyridine nucleotides do not limit the rate of sucrose oxidation experiments with radioactive pyruvate and SU show that the rate of sucrose oxidation of azotobacter cells is associated with an increase in the rate of sucrose uptake the sites of oxidative phosphorylation and the composition of the respiratory CM with respect to cytochromes c c b and d differ in cells growth either o or nlimited it was possible to show that the QO2 protection of the nitrogenfixing system in azotobacter is mainly independent of the oxidation capacity of the cells the oxidation capacity intrinsically depends on the type of substrate and can be partly adapted the maximum activity of the nitrogenase in azotobacter depends on the type of ATP Ox although the level of energy charge is somewhat dependent on the type of substrate used no obvious relation can be derived between changes in SE charge and nitrogenase activity an alternative proposal is given
973,a MM for the partition of charged molecules in AQ multiphase systems has been developed the partition coefficient of one component or the overall partition coefficient of a number of components between two arbitrary phases is expressed in terms of the difference in electrical potential between the phases due to electrolytes present in the system the net charges of the partitioned components and their partition coefficients in a sometimes hypothetical uncharged state the fraction of material in one phase has also been described as a function of the net charges of the partitioned components the model fits well to exp data for partition of chromate pyridine ribonuclease a two types of cohemoglobin and an enzyme mixture yeast lysate in threephase systems consisting of polyethylene glycol dextran ficoll and water minor deviations from the MM are construed to be a phdependent uptake of ions the data have also been used to detect differences in solvation of similar proteins as well as the presence of several forms of some glycolytic enzymes present in yeast lysate
974,after a mus laser flash a mus phase in the decay of delayed fluorescence is visible under a variety of circumstances in spinach chloroplasts and subchloroplast particles EC in photosystem ii prepared by means of digitonin the level of this phase is high in the case of inhibition of oxygen evolution at the donor side of photosystem ii comparison with the results of babcock and sauer biochim biophys acta indicates that their epr signal iif which they suppose to be due to z the Ox first secondary donor of PS ii is well correlated with a large amplitude of our mus phase we explain our mus phase by the intrinsic back reaction of the excited reaction center in the presence of z as predicted by van gorkom and donze photochem photobiol the redox state of z is dependent on the internal ph of the thylakoids the results on the effect of ph in the mus region are compared with those obtained in the ms region
975,the absorption of acetazolamide suspensions from in situ rat gastric and intestinal loop segments was studied in hr and remained unabsorbed from the rat stomach and intestine respectively although wv reduced glutathione and wv mm edetate disodium had no effect on gastric absorption drug absorption from the rat intestine hr was increased and times respectively it was hypothesized that the relatively poor intestinal absorption was due primarily to the formation of a phdependent ph nonabsorbable complex between acetazolamide and carbonic anhydrase present in the gut and that reduced glutathione acted as an inhibitor to promote intestinal absorption equilibrium dialysis studies showed that reduced glutathion could reduce the fraction of drug bound to human CAB by onehalf when present in a molar ratio times that of acetazolamide edetate disodium had no effect on the in vitro binding it was therefore assumed that edetate disodium promoted an increase in intestinal absorption by altering the permeability of intestinal epithelium based upon present experimentation however the alteration of intestinal epithelium by reduced glutathione cannot be ruled out
976,milk feeds were given through indwelling nasogastric tubes to infants with respiratory distress similar cardiorespiratory disturbances were observed when the infants were fed mlkg per feed HM cows mild or distilled water pao fell after a feed but recovered to the prefeed value at minutes at which time paco had fallen and the respiratory rate had increased no changes in ph heart rate or blood pressure were observed portal sinus pressures rose after feeding in association with an increase in CE venous pressure in contrast when the ill infants were fed human milk at a volume of mlkg per feed no consistent changes in any of the measurements were found these studies suggested that the cardiorespiratory effects were related to volume displacement resulting from feeds being introduced into the stomach the relation of the increase in CVP and the magnitude and direction of shunting in infants with the respiratory distress syndrome is uncertain adverse effects may be avoided by giving smaller and therefore even more frequent feeds
977,cytochrome p was assayed in rat CL homogenates and microsomes in order to calculate microsomal recoveries and correct for losses during UC or sedimentation in presence of cacl the values obtained for QTc microsomal protein in untreated female spraguedawley rats were between and mgg of liver the assay of cytochrome p in liver homogenate is accurate enough to calculate a reproducible REC factor the value of the method lies in its rapidity its capacity to correct over a wide range of losses and its capacity to yield reliable values of the total microsomal protein mass the limits of this method include overestimation of homogenate cytochrome p and inability to correct for nonmicrosomal protein contamination overestimation of cytochrome p can be QTc by measuring the difference in absorbance between and nm with the extinction coefficient of mmcm to be accurate cytochrome p determination on microsomes must be done at protein concentrations of about mgml the error inherent to the method may be kept constant and minimal the use of correction for microsomal losses is recommended in order to obtain uniformity between results from various laboratories and adequate rho with in vivo studies of microsomal functions
978,the effects of electrolytes on the selfassociation of the antihistaminic drugs tripelennamine hydrochloride thenyldiamine hydrochloride pyrilamine maleate pheniramine maleate chlorpheniramine maleate and brompheniramine maleate in AQ solution were examined by lightscattering from tripelennamine bydrochloride and thenyldiamine hydrochloride in mole of sodium chloridekg and mole of sodium maleatekg indicated a micellar pattern of aggregation higher aggregation numbers and lower cmcs were determined in the presence of the maleate ion no significant discontinuity in the concentration dependence of the light scattering of the remaining EDC in either of the two electrolytes was evident and the aggregation of these compounds was treated using a stepwise association model values of the association constants and the limiting number of associating species were in general increased by the addition of electrolyte in the order water less than sodium chloride less than sodium maleate an apparently nonmicellar pattern of aggregation could be induced by chemically changing the counterion from chloride to maleate
979,in vitro studies performed on rat submaxillary gland slices with diphenylhydantoin x m showed that variations of extracellular ph phe had no significant effects on uptake and only slight effects on efflux lowering the phe slightly decreased efflux rates whereas increasing phe slightly increased efflux rates increasing diphenylhydantoin concentration significantly decreased uptake and slightly increased the rate of efflux uptake of cdiphenylhydantoin was significantly decreased when compared to control conditions ph degrees c o aeration x m by the following alterations aeration of the incubation medium with n instead of o decrease of bath temperature from degrees c to degrees c and addition of the following metabolic inhibitors iodoacetic acid m dinitrophenol m and cyanide m probenecid m had no significant effect on diphenylhydantoin uptake when compared to control values no evidence of salivary biotransformation of diphenylhydantoin was seen in the in vitro system using thinlayer chromatography these in vitro data suggest an AS transport process that is concentrationdependent with a possible saturable binding site on the membrane or in the interior of the cell
980,an aminopeptidase was isolated from the culture filtrate of clostridium histolyticum and purified to homogeneity absence of endopeptidase activity in the purified preparation was demonstrated GF on a calibrated column indicates an apparent molecular weight of for the native enzyme gel electrophoresis of the denatured enzyme in the presence of dodecylsulfate in constant acrylamide concentration and in a concentration gradient resulted in the appearance of a single component for which a molecular weight of and respectively was calculated from mobilities of crosslinked and denatured protein species a molecular weight of was obtained for the monomer specificity studies show that the enzyme cleaves all types of nterminel amino acid residues including proline and hydroxyproline from small MMP and from polypeptides the peptide bond formed between an nterminal amino acid residue and proline is not cleaved by the enzyme the combined action of aminopeptidasep and clostridal aminopeptidase leads to CR hydrolysis of the prolinerich nonapeptide bradykinin low rates of hydrolysis was observed for charged residues and amides of amino acids kinetic studies with five tripeptides of the general structure xglygly where x stands for leu phe val ala or pro show a decrease in km with the increasing size of the hydrophobic side chain of x the highest kcat values are observed with proline and alanine in the series progly proglypro proglypropro the last peptide is the best ATP indicating an AS site complementary to at least four amino acid residues the enzymatic activity is dependent on the presence of divalent cations maximal activation being reached with mn and co the optimal ph for the mn and co activated enzyme is and respectively the optimal temperature is degrees c inhibition of the aminopeptidase was achieved with zn cu and pmercuribenzoate but not with diisopropylphosphofluoridate
981,p nuclear magnetic resonance spectra recorded from intact muophosphate and the sugar phosphates quantitation of these metabolites by p nuclear magnetic resonance was in good PA with values obtained by chemical analyses the spectra obtained from various muscles showed considerable variation in their phosphorus profile thus differences could be detected between a normal and diseased muscle b vertebrates and invertebrates c different species of the same animal the time course of change in phosphate metabolites in frog muscle showed that atp level remains unchanged until phosphocreatine is nearly depleted comparative studies revealed that under anaerobic conditions the northern frog maintains its atp content for hours while other types of amphibian bird and mammalian muscles begin to show an appreciable decay in atp T3 hours several lines of evidence indicated that atp forms a complex with magnesium in the muscle water a the phosphate resonances of atp in the muscle were shifted downfield as compared to those in the ALP earth metalfree PCA extract of the muscle b the coupling constants of atp measured in various live muscles closely corresponded to those for mgatp in a solution resembling the composition of the muscle water c in the muscle the gammaphosphate group of atp exhibited no shift change over a period of hours under conditions where resonances of other phosphate compounds could be titrated this SMB is similar to that of mgatp in model solutions in the physiological ph range and it is different from that of caatp the delta of the phosphate metabolites were determined in several relevant solutions as a CF of ph under all conditions only inorganic orthophosphate showed an invariant titration curve from the chemical shift of inorganic phosphate observed during aging of intact muscle the intracellular ph of frog muscle was estimated to be
982,the possible role of increased vascular reactivity in the mechanism of exp hypertension was studied by measurements of the critical OP cop of tail vessels in conscious rats in hypertension induced by administration of DOCA doca and replacement of the drinking water by nacl solution docanacl hypertension and in onekidney goldblatt renovascular hypertension the raised level of blood pressure was associated with an increased cop of the tail vessels when measured both before and T3 ganglionic blockade in rats treated with either doca CT or nacl CT there was no significant increase in systolic blood pressure sbp or cop relative to the corresponding controls in all four exp series intravenous infusion of angiotensin or norepinephrine in conscious ganglionblocked rats produced dosedependent increases in sbp and cop in docanacl hypertensive rats but not in renovascular hypertensives nor in rats treated with doca CT or nacl CT the increase in cop for a given increment in dose of angiotensin or norepinephrine was significantly greater than in the control rats it is concluded that in docanacl hypertension there is a true increase in the reactivity of the smooth muscle of the resistance vessels to angiotensin and norepinephrine in renovascular hypertension this is not the case and other factors must therefore be involved in causing the increased blood pressure and cop
983,the passive permeability of isolated chromaffin vesicles to h and the internal ph of the vesicles under various conditions were measured potentiometric measurements of k and h fluxes in the presence of selected ionophores and uncouplers indicated that the membrane is highly impermeable to both protons and potassium deltaph across the chromaffin granule membrane was measured by cmethylamine distribution at ph the deltaph was with the intravesicular space being found acidic varying the external ph produced an equivalent NC in the deltaph with extrapolation to zero deltaph yielding a value of ph which is taken as an indication of the ph of the intravesicular space the ph gradient could be enhanced or collapsed by the addition of ionophores and uncouplers under varying ionic conditions deltaph was constant for LG suspended in various ionic media suggesting that the deltaph did not arise secondarily due to the establishment of a donnan equilibrium the significance of the proton impermeability and deltaph is discussed in terms of regulation of the uptake and storage of CAs in bovine chromaffin granules
984,the effect of ph mental ions and denaturing reagents on the thermal stability of thermophilic alphaamylase ec were examined the enzyme was most stable at around ph which is coincident with the isoelectric point of the enzyme the stability of the enzyme was increased by the addition of calcium strontium and sodium ions the addition of calcium ions markedly stabilized the enzyme the protective effects of calcium and sodium ions were additive at room temperature no detectable destruction of the helical structure of the enzyme was observed after incubation for hr in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate m urea or m guanidinehc the addition of m urea or m guanidinehc lowered the thermal denaturation temperature of the enzyme the enzyme contained one atom of tightly bound intrinsic calcium per molecule which could not be removed by ED unless the enzyme was denatured the rate constants of inactivation and denaturation reactions in the absence and presence of calcium ions were measured and thermodynamic parameters were determined the presence of calcium ions caused a remarkable decrease in the activation entropy
985,the effects of various biophysical and chemical factors on the cytology of vegetative stages of naegleria sp vitek strain acanthamoeba culbertsoni acanthamoeba castellanii neff strain and acanthamoeba polyphaga no were studied the amoebae were cultured in a liquid medium under axenic conditions the optimum temperature was degrees c for pathogenic strains of naegleria sp and acanthamoeba culbertsoni and degrees c for a castellanii no changes were observed in the growth of a polyphaga at the temperatures degrees and degrees c the strains investigated grew at ph values of to using soerensens buffer at the limit values the growth was inhibited and the morphology of cells was markedly changed all of the four strains grew still at ph kept by nahco a polyphaga grew at partial anaerobiosis the three tested strains of the genus acanthamoeba grew in liquid axenic medium with nacl the growth of naegleria sp vitek was inhibited already at concentration of this salt the addition of x m kcl to the culture medium had a harmful effect on the growth and morphology of three tested strains except a polyphaga in the culture medium containing x m cacl the encystment of both pathogenic strains was stimulated the cytological changes under exp conditions were manifested by atypical movement of trophozoits and their intracellular structure
986,the actions of amylobarbitone thiopentone methohexitone and methyprylone at voltageclamped frog endplates were studied in the presence of barbiturates the conductance change evoked by an iontophoretic carbachol application was reduced by a prepulse of carbachol the extra inhibition evoked by a prepulse disappeared exponentially with a time constant of ms barbiturates produce an increased rate of decay of nerve evoked endplate currents tne concentration and voltage dependence of the barbtiruate epc decay rates tally with the hypothesis that the increased rate of decay is due to block of AS receptorchannel complexes by barbiturates with a rate constant of ms conductance changes produced by bath applied agonists were depressed by thiopentone the effect becoming greater the higher the agonist concentration this effect and also the observation that the concentration of thiopentone required to depress the bath agonist response is much greater than the apparent dissociation constant for binding to AS receptorchannel complexes calculated from kinetic measurements suggest that the selectivity for binding to open receptorchannel complexes is very high methyprylone which is structurally similar to the barbiturates is only a weak antagonist and shows no interpulse interaction it was predicted that methyprylone should produce fast and slow components in the epc decay and this prediction was verified in the presence of barbiturates large iontophoretic carbachol applications produce conductance changes which show fast and slow components under these conditions the effects of carbachol prepulses become complex however the effects are qualitatively consistent with the notion that different components of the response are contributed by channels located at various distances from the iontophoretic pipette tip all the data agree with a model in which the channel has three stages closed open and blocked only open channels can block and blocked channels can only open
987,the CR of the zinc site of bovine superoxide dismutase has been probed by observing optical and electron paramagnetic resonance changes under several conditions of the coiisubstituted protein only in the absence of copper are the optical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the cobalt chromophore appreciably affected by alkaline ph or by cyanide with both reagents the reaction with the coppercontaining protein appears to involve the water molecule bound to the copper and does not affect the magnetic coupling between copper and cobalt the reaction of cyanide with the copperfree coii protein leads to a slow detachment of cobalt from the protein as pentacyanocobalt an oxygen adduct forms in air analogous to that described in coii carbonic anhydrase haffner p h and coleman j e j biol chem acid titration modifies the coii spectra in the same way in the cucontaining and in the cufree protein and brings about uncoupling of the coiicuii system protonation of histidine on the zinc facing nitrogen is suggested ho modifies the cobalt chromophore only in the presence of copper magnetic coupling between cuii and coii seems to be still present after ho inactivation of the enzyme
988,in cystic fibrosis there is chronic infection and inflammatory reaction in the airways accompanied by destruction and shedding of airway epithelium leukocytes migrate into the airways and some disintegrate liberating DNP that is incorporated into the gel structure of the bronchial mucus we compared the status of these processes in cystic fibrosis with that in CB and BE by examining the sputum raised from the lower airways measurements also were made on sputum induced in normal subjects the results indicate that migration of WBCs into the airways and shedding of damaged airway epithelium were minimal in the normal subjects they were significant in the patients with CB higher in those with BE and still higher in those with cystic fibrosis the large increases found in the total content of dna and solids in the cystic fibrosis sputum were due to increases in the insoluble fraction containing the whole leukocytes and particulate debris that remained when the sputum mucus gel was solubilized with mercaptoethanol despite the large increases in the total content of dna and solids the contents of mucus gel components and of deoxyribonucleoprotein from disintegrated WBCs actually present in the mucus gel structure of the cystic fibrosis sputum were not significantly higher than in the sputum from the patients with CB or brochiectasis
989,renin granules from rat kidney prepared at degrees c show greater stability at degrees c than at degrees c when incubated in ionic medium the sum of the renin in the supernatant fluid plus that in the pellet was the same at degrees c as at degrees c thus ruling out the possibility that the extra PR at degrees c merely represented greater stability of free renin at degrees c in common with other secretory granules renin granules were most stable at ph and were osmotically sensitive in contrast to NS and chromaffin granules renin granules were stabilized by mgatp in ionic medium this result is similar to studies by others on lysosomes it is concluded that the renin LG membrane shares many of the properties of other granule membranes some of these properties temperature and ph lability will have to be considered in the design of future experiments on renin storage and release
990,different amount of intact or irradiated bone marrow from syngenous donors was po to mice irradiated with a lethal dose there was revealed a linear dependence of the number of the day colonies grown in the bone marrow of the femur on the amount of the administered cells and an exponential dependence on the irradiation dose regularity of the stem cell cloning in the bone marrow was analogous to such in the spleen radiosensitivity of the colonyforming units cfu differed depending on the site the spleen the bone marrow of their colony formation the cfu settling in the marrow proved to be more radioresistant d equalled p in comparison with the cfu settling in the SP d constituted p it is supposed that a different radiosensitivity of the cfu was caused by the presence of heterogenic population of the stem cells and also by specific peculiarities of the organ the SP the bone marrow in which the colonies formed
991,unchanged bumetanide nbutylaminophenoxysulfamoylbenzoic acid and five metabolites were excreted in the urine of rats given mg of clabeled drug per kg intravenously the metabolites which were identified by mass spectrometry andor nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy arose by metabolic alteration of the nbutyl sidechain in metabolites iv the butylamino group was converted to nhchchchcooh nhchchchchoh nhchchchohch nhchchchohchoh and nh respectively the total urinary and fecal excretion of labeled drug and metabolites after iv and p.o. of cbumetanide was estimated in dogs given mgkg and in rats given mgkg in the dog the primary excretion product was unchanged drug although evidence was obtained that the acyl glucuronide of bumetanide was secreted in dog bile the major metabolite excreted by the rat was i and negligible quantities of intact drug were excreted in the urine after oral or iv administration optical activity was found for the two metabolites that contained a chiral center iii and iv indicating that they were formed by a stereoselective hydroxylation
992,nitrogenase biosynthesis in klebsiella pneumoniae including mutant strains which produce nitrogenase in the presence of nh shanmugam kt chan irene and morandi c biochim biophys acta is repressed by a mixture of lamino acids biochemical analysis shows that glutamine synthetase activity in strains sk sk and sk is also repressed by amino acids with no detectable effect on glutamate dehydrogenase among the various amino acids lglutamine in combination with laspartate was found to repress nitrogenase biosynthesis CR in the presence of high concentrations of glutamine mgml even nh repressed nitrogenase biosynthesis in the strains sk sk sk and sk under these conditions increased glutamate dehydrogenase activity was also detected physiological studies show that nitrogenase derepressed strains are unable to utilize nh as sole source of nitrogen for biosynthesis of glutamate for biosynthesis of glutamate whereas back mutations leading to nh utilization results in sensitivity to repression by nh these findings suggest that amino acids play an important role as regulators of nitrogen fixation
993,regulation of csf hcoin respiratory acidosis was studied in light of the dual contribution theory which proposed that there were two sources for the csf hcoincrease hcoby diffusion from plasma and hcogenerated in the cns and catalyzed by the local carbonic anhydrase j appl physiol in anesthetized dogs with an increase in paco of mmhg for h the plasma hco increased meq and csf meq in combined respiratory and MA plasma hcodid not increase but csf hcoincreased meq in combined acidosis and intraventricular injections of acetazolamide no increase in plasma or csf hcooccurred in combined respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis and intraventricular acetazolamide plasma hcoincreased meq but csf hcoincreased meq BB and csf ammonia increased linearly and selectively with the increase in the relative contribution of cns hcoincrease therefore regulation of csf hcoin respiratory acidosis depends on both components of the dual contribution theory where each component can provide the total csf hcoincrease under appropriate experimental conditions the control mechanism may be CS to changes in h on the brain side of the bloodbrain barrier
994,protoporphyrinogen oxidase an enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of protoporphyrinogen ix to protoporphyrin ix in yeast cells has been found in several mammalian tissues it has been extracted from rat liver mitochondria by sonication in the presence of salt and detergent and partially purified the enzyme is similar in many respects to yeast protoporphyrinogen oxidase based on its behavior on sephadex g the molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately catalysis by protoporphyrinogen oxidase was specific for proteoporphyrinogen ix apparent km of mum and proceeded maximally at ph to the effect of temperature on enzyme activity plotted according to arrhenius gave a value of e of calories per mol enzyme activity was inhibited in the presence of high salt concentrations and temperatures above degrees oxygen was essential for protoporphyrinogen oxidase activity and an alternative elevtron acceptor has not yet been found no requirement for a metal or other cofactor could be demonstrated the presence of monothiol CG was indicated however it is not known whether the thiol CG are involved directly in the binding of ATP to the enzyme
995,the present investigation sought to determine whether the CS- properties of morphine and lysergic acid diethylamide lsd would generalize to several narcotic analgesics which vary in their subjective effects morphine and saline served as discriminative stimuli for one group of rats in a lever discrimination task lsd and saline were discriminative stimuli for a second group depression of one lever in an operant chamber resulted in reinforcement following the administration of morphine or lsd and the opposite lever was reinforced after saline after discriminated responding was stable stimulus generalization tests with narcotic analgesics and antagonists showed that the stimulus properties of morphine generalized to methadone and meperidine and partially to pentazocine all of which produce morphinelike subjective effects in humans morphine stimulus properties did not generalize to nalorphine or cyclazocine which produce dissimilar subjective effects the stimulus properties of lsd generalized partially to cyclazocine but not to nalorphine in humans cyclazocine and nalorphine produce a high incidence of psychotomimetic effects but the subjective effects of cyclazocine are differentiable from those of lsd
996,the chemical modification of two new doubleheadedprotease inhibitors from blackeyed peas a trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor bepci and a trypsin inhibitor bepti with dansyl chloride was investigated under various conditions the nhterminal serine of both bepci and bepti the lysyl residues of bepci and of the lysyl residues of bepti could not be dansylated in the absence of urea the single IMT per subunit of bepci and bepti was unreactive even in the presence of urea but could be labeled with halfsite reactivity by the celite method lysine nhterminal serine and tyrosine were reactive in fully reduced carbamidomethylated bepci and bepti gel filtration was used to study the subunit interactions of bepci and bepti at ph or ph there is a complex set of multiple equilibria with widely differing rates of attainment we have found evidence for a rapid dimertetramer equilibrium a distinct moderate rate dimertetramer equilibrium a very slow monomerdimer equilibrium and postulate slow isomerization of the two forms of dimer and the two forms of tetramer the monomerdimer equilibrium is quite unusual in that the dimer is stabilized by chaotropic ions and even slightly by guanidine hc in contrast to the complex DP seen in native bepci the halfsite dansylated bepci exists at similar concentration exclusively as a tetramer at neutral ph
997,to study the CBF protective effects of hypothermia in arterial hypoxia anesthetized no MV rats were cooled to a body temperature of c hypoxia was induced by decreasing the oxygen content in the inspired gas mixture either to per cent or to per cent this reduced mean pao to about and torr respectively at pao torr there was no change in cerebral blood flow cbf cerebrla oxygen consumption cmro or labile tissue metabolites the absence of signs of cerebral hypoxia could be attributed to an effect of temperature and ph on the hemoglobinoxygen dissociation curve thus at c with a pao of torr the total oxygen content to of arterial blood remained greater than ml ml about three times the value obtained at this po in normothermic rats at pao torr arterial to was reduced to about ml ml the hypoxia induced no NC in cmro a threefold increase in cbf a moderate lactacidosis in the tissue and a small decrease in phosphocreatine content but no NC in atp adp or amp these changes are less marked than those occurring at the same arterial to in normothermic rats it is concluded that HT exerts a pronounced protective effect on the brain in hypoxic hypoxia and that two mechanisms are involved first since HT shifts the oxyhemoglobindissociation curve towards the left and prevents or minimizes a rightward shift due to acidosis it maintains a high to in arterial blood at a given pao second by reducing cmro and thereby presumably also cellular SE requirements hypothermia exerts a protective effect at the cellular level
998,in an attempt to examine the effects of mild and severe CMA on proximal tubule sodium reabsorption dogs were given meq per kilogram per day and dogs were given meq per kilogram per day of ammonium chloride for days and compared to normal dogs during a steadystate water diuresis and following the administration of ethacrynic acid ea intravenously mg per kilogram utilizing standard clearance methodology in the severely acidotic group ph decrease is greater tthan plasma ph was and plasma bicarbonate was eq per liter compared to a ph of and bicarbonate of in mild acidosis ph decrease is less than during a steadystate water diuresis urine flow was in severely acidotic compared to ml per minute per ml glomerular filtration rate gfr in normal dogs p is less than following ea sodium clearance increased in severely acidotic dogs and ml per minute per ml gfr in normal dogs p is less than in mild acidosis steadystate fractional urine flow and the increase in fractional sodium clearance following ea were not significantly different than normal dogs we conclude that chronic metabolic acidosis leads to an increase in distal solute load and enhanced natriuretic effect of ea AA to a decrease in PT tubule sodium reabsorption which may be dependent upon the degree of reduction in the plasma bicarbonate level
999,this study reveals the main vasoactive substances which pass through the lung by studying in each case the extrapulmonary of pulmonary origin the effects of the lung on these substances capture discharge transformation and the effects of these substances on the lung eight groups of substances are studied mediators of the sympathoadrenergic system substances interfering with adrenergic agents acetylcholine serotonin angiotensin histamine kinins and prostaglandins the lung behaves either as a neutral organ or a filtering organ or a filtering organ or a secreting organ for these substances in this way it strangely resembles the kidney the pulmonary circulation is not CR comprised of simple reaction it is capable of internal adjustement and RD under the effect of these substances pulmonary edema probably will always remain difficult to their mechanism of production in so far as can be estimated from the multitude of substances it is still rather a delicate matter to distinguish between edemagenerating phenomena and phenomena which are secondary to the edema itself
1000,"hemoglobin deer lodge is an abnormal human hemoglobin with arginine substituted for histidine at the beta position xray crystallography of normal human hemoglobin has shown that the beta residue is normally part of the binding site for 2,3-DPG the substitution of Arg for histidine at beta affects both the kinetics and equilibria of ligand binding when stripped of anions hb deer lodge has an increased oxygen affinity and a decreased degree of cooperativity relative to hb a the alkaline bohr effect is slightly increased and there are marked increases in oxygen affinity below ph and above ph in the presence of diphosphoglycerate the cooperativity in increases to nromal and the ph dependence of oxygen binding is reduced this contrasts with the enhanced bohr effect seen for hb a in the presence of organic phosphates due to enhanced anion IB at high ph hb deer lodge has a slightly lower P50 than hb a at ph in the presence of 2,3-DPG or Ins hexaphosphate kinetic studies at neutral ph in the absence of organic phosphates revealed biphasicity in the rate of oxygen dissociation from hb deer lodge while approximately linear time courses were observed for hb a the fast phase of the oxygen dissociation kinetics shows great ph sensitivity and organic phosphates increase the rate and percentage of the fast phase without greatly affecting the slow phase the two phases are not resolvable at high ph co combination kinetics are much like those of hb a except that fast and slow phases were apparent at wavelengths near the deoxyco isobestic point we suggest that PET differences between the alpha and beta chains are enhanced in hb deer lodge after flash photolysis of the co derivative the percentage of quickly reacting material was slightly greater for hb deer lodge than for hb a this may imply a somewhat greater tendency to dissociate into high affinity subunits the substitution of arginine for histidine at beta thus results in a macromolecule whose ligandbinding properties are significantly altered the primary differences being expressed at high ph where hb deer lodge binds anions more strongly than hb a the properties of hb deer lodge are compared to those of other hemoglobin variants with substitutions at residues involved in binding of diphosphoglycerate"
1001,with the microdissection method of palkovits individual hypothalamic nuclei were removed from the brains of adult male rats and the tyrosine hydroxylase th activity of each nucleus was determined days after gonadectomy or thyroidectomy following gonadectomy th activity increased significantly in the median eminence with no change in the periventricular npv arcuate narc and dorsomedial nuclei ndm or medial forebrain bundle mf following Tx th activity increased significantly in all hypothalamic nuclei examined placement of bilateral lesions in the VP norepinephrine bundles resulted in a greater than an fall in the DBH of the ME arcuate nucleus and ventromedial nucleus but had no effect on IMT hydroxylase activity measured in those same areas furthermore placement of such lesions had no effect on the endocrineinduced increases of th activity found in the median eminence following gonadectomy and Tx but did prevent the increase of th activity found in the npv ndm and mfb following thyroidectomy three conclusions appear to be justified a NE axons which innervate the median eminence arcuate and ventromedial nuclei course in the VP norepinephrine bundles b the th content of noradrenergic SN in the median eminence arcuate nucleus and ventromedial nuclei is quite small and c the majority if not all of the endocrineresponsive catecholaminergic neurons in the ME are dopaminergic
1002,the methods used for ventilation of the neonate shold be based upon consideration of the physiological changes which occure in the lungs and circulation at birth of the normal infant three important changes must be taken into consideration the first is the formation of a residual volume of alveolar gas the second the resorption of pulmonary fluid and the third a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance upon which is dependent the change from foetal circulation to that of the neonate to begin insufflation of foetal lungs it is necessary to use a pressure of between and cm ho after the first insufflation a good deal of air remains in the lungs even during expiration as long as pulmonary surfactant is present in the absence of the latter residual pressure at the end of expiration is necessary in order to avoid the lung emptying itself of air the resorption of pulmonary liquid from the alveolar spaces into the blood is dependent upon a change in the permeability of the AM epithelium which renders possible the rapid passage of water via the channels which open probably between the epithelial cells and this change is dependent upon an expansion of the lungs by a pressure of between and cm ho dilatation of the pulmonary vessels depends in part upon an increase in partial pressure of oxygen and a fall in carbon dioxide in the environment of the pulmonary arterioles and in part upon mechanical changes brought about by the movements of ventilatation
1003,the transmembrane potential of isolated chromaffin granules has been measured using the permeant ions cmethylamine and sthiocyanate as well as the fluorescent probe aminoacridine at ph the granule membrane had a nernst proton potential of mv inside negative this potential was sensitive to the external ph but was unaffected by kna ca mg or other cations the ph of zero potential was for both methylamine and thiocyanate thiocyanate also had a nernst potential of similar magnitude and sign to that of methylamine at ph and was also sensitive to variation in external ph mgatp was found to depolarize the granule membrane by a saturable mechanism with a k for atp of mum ca was only as effective as mg in supporting the atp effect the ph optimum for this process was and appeared to be accompanied by a marked alkalinization of the granule interior the specificity for atp was further tested with structural analogs of atp and gtp the rate of NC of membrane potential in response to changes in external ph or mgatp was estimated using the FL probe aminoacridine changes came to completion in less than s this suggested that the atp effects were not dependent on an enzymatic transformation but on an atpinduced conformational change in the membrane we conclude that the chromaffin granule exists in at least two proton permeability states corresponding to the presence or absence of mgatp these states may be related to hormone PR from granules and regulation of secretion in vivo
1004,deazafmncontaining glycolate oxidase has been prepared and shown to catalyze the stereospecific transfer of the alphahydrogen from ATP to enzymebound deazafmn the reaction of sulfite cyanide and hydroxylamine with several deazaflavincontaining enzymes GO damino acid oxidase gl oxidase nmethylglutamate synthetase and free deazafmn has been examined all the deazaflavin systems tested form reversible complexes with sulfite and cyanide the ph dependence of the reaction of free deazafmn with cyanide indicates that cyanide anion is the reacting nucleophile hydroxylamine complexes are formed with deazafmn glycolate oxidase and deazafad gl oxidase the effectiveness of the various nucleophilic reagents in complex formation decreases in the following order sulfite greater than cyanide greater than hydroxylamine the relative stability observed for the sulfite and cyanide complexes formed with various deazaflavin systems glycolate oxidase greater than damino acid oxidase greater than free deazafmn follows the same trend observed for the stability of the sulfite complexes formed with the corresponding flavin system a correlation is also observed between the reduction potential eo of the deazaflavin system GO mv greater than damino acid oxidase mv greater than free deazafmn mv and the stability of the deazaflavinnucleophile complexes the following evidence indicates that deazaflavin systems are generally more susceptible toward nucleophilic attack than corresponding flavin system a with the exception of glucose oxidase the dissociation constants for the deazaflavinsulfite complexes are at least order of magnitude less than the corresponding flavin sulfite complexes b the least reactive nucleophile hydroxylamine does not form a complex with any of the flavin systems in the case of cyanide a complex is formed only with native glycolate oxidase which is the flavincontaining system most susceptible to attack by the more reactive sulfite formation of the various deazaflavinnucleophile complexes is characterized by a bleaching of the longer wavelength absorption band of the chromophore and increases in absorption below the isosbestic point of the reaction in the nearultraviolet region of the spectrum these results are consistent with the formation of covalent adducts via attack of the various nucleophiles at position of deazaflavin the reaction with cyanide provides the first example of a reversible addition of carbanion to enzymebound deazaflavin
1005,resting bone marrow lymphocytes recongised as small lymphocytes by LM were labelled by the complete hthymidine labelling technique EC by fractionation on a discontinuous Al gradient and investigated for their stem cell properties by culture in diffusion chambers fraction with the highest enrichment of labelled small lymphocytes and slight enrichment of other labelled cells reticulum and EC cells produced substantial growth in contrast to fraction with no enrichment of these cells the number of labelled small lymphocytes per chamber in fraction remained constant or tended to increase this is assumed to be an indication of some degree of selfreplication in the small lymphocyte population since however their labelling intensity decreased only slowly it must be further concluded that part of the labelled small lymphocyte population probably remained resting some labelled transitional and blast cells appeared before the development of recognisable myelopoietic and erythropoietic precursors and of megakaryocytes in agreement with the concept that small lymphocytes transfrom to transitional cells during the developmetn of normal haempopiesis
1006,the reaction of serum samples with bromcresol green proceeds in two steps albumin is responsible for the faster less than min reaction the slower min reaction is a measure of acute phase reactants in serum serum is simply mixed with bromcresol green reagent and the absorbance is measured twice immediately and at min albumin concentrations determined from the absorbance at min correlate well with those determined by laurell rocket immunoelectrophoresis r with no certain deviation from unity for the slope and with a negligible difference at zero concentration the slow reaction was expressed as deltaa deltaasdeltaav where deltaas and delta av are the changes in absorbance between and min for the sample and a commercial control serum respectively the value for deltaa correlates well with the percentage of alphafraction as determined by PACE on cellulose acetate as well as with orosomucoid and ceruloplasmin all of which are acute phase reactants whether these proteins or other acute phase reactants actually cause the slow reaction has not yet been established
1007,from all mammals investigated so far only in rabbits diamine oxidase could not be detected in any tissue except the gut thus this species was chosen for studying the physiological and pathophysiological function of this enzyme in the gastrointestinal tract by gel filtration on sephadex g and g the enzyme was purified fold separated from a soluble MAO-A and the properties of the two enzymes were determined diamine oxidase from rabbit small intestine deaminated putrecine km times m phoptimum and histamine km times m phoptimum but not serotonin and was inhibited by aminoguanidine but not by pargyline soluble MAO-A from rabbit small intestine catabolized serotonin km times m phoptimum but not putrescine and histamine and was inhibited by pargyline but not by aminoguanidine based on its properties in vitro intestinal diamine oxidase could inactivate the vasoactive biogenic amine histamine in vivo to confirm this hypothesis in rabbits the small intestine was damaged severely by inducing total intestinal ischemia which occurs as MES infarction also in human subjects and is accompanied by histamine release treatment with aminoguanidine and ischemia killed the animals times faster than ischemia CT which supported our hypothesis on a protective role of intestinal DAO against histamine
1008,active transport of gl in prosthecae isolated from cells of asticcacaulis biprosthecum was stimulated by the nonphysiological electron donor n n n ntetramethylpphenylenediamine dihydrochloride glucose uptake was mediated by two transport systems the apparent km of the highaffinity system was mum and that of the lowaffinity system was mum free glucose accumulated within prosthecae at a concentration to times above that present externally depending on the km of the system being observed the GT system in prosthecae was stereospecific for dglucose and neither methyl alphadglucopyranoside nor deoxyglucose was transported uptake of glucose was inhibited by nethylmaleimide nem and PCMB pcmb and the inhibition by pcmb but not by nem was reversed by dithiothreitol gl uptake was also inhibited by the uncoupling agents chlorotbutylnitrosalicylanilide s chloropchlorophenylchlorosalicylanilide s and carbonylcyanide mchlorophenylhydrazone cccp and by the respiratory inhibitor kcn efflux of glucose from preloaded prosthecae was induced by pcmb and kcn but not by s or cccp glucose uptake was not affected by arsenate or an inhibitor of membranebound adenosine triphosphatases n ndicyclohexylcarbodiimide the lack of inhibition by these two EDC combined with the extremely low levels of adenosine triphosphate present in prosthecae indicates that adenosine triphosphate is not involved in the transport of glucose by prosthecae
1009,practice patterns and patientreported outcomes of care are compared in detail for ten physicians and new health practitioners delivering ambulatory care in two departments of a prepaid group practice the columbia medical plan cmp all providers completed questionnaires for a per cent random sample of patients seen during a twoweek period patients completed questionnaires prior to receiving care and were interviewed one week and one month after their clinic visits new health practitioners deliver approximately per cent of wellperson care per cent of problemoriented care in adult medicine and per cent of problem care in pediatrics they have become increasingly involved over time in the treatment of acute conditions and injuries while physicians have retained their predominant role in treating patients with chronic conditions thirtytwo per cent of visits with new healh providers involved a physician in one or more of the following decisionmaking direct supervision consultation or seeing the patient as a second provider of care degree of autonomy varied by type of task performed category of problem treated and specialty the following outcomes of care were examined by type of provider patientreported change in problem statusincluding frequency and intensity of pain or discomfort level of anxiety and degree of activity limitation the degree to which physicianspecified criteria for the most commonly occurring conditions were met with respect to NC in problem status and patient satisfaction with a number of dimensions of the clinic visit the analysis suggests that the new health practitioners at the cmp are providing care within their areas of responsibility of comparable quality to that delivered by physicians
1010,the high membrane potential of acetabularia emmv is due to an electrogenic pump in parallel with the passive diffusion system edmv which could be studied separately in the cold when the pump is blocked electrical measurements under normal conditions show that the pump pathway consists of its EMF ep with two elements p and p in series p is shunted by a large capacitance cpmf cm the nonlinear currentvoltage relationship of p light and temperaturesensitive could be determined separately it reflects the properties of a carriermediated electrogenic pump the value of ep mv indicates a stoichiometry of between electrogenically transported charges and atp the electrical energy normally stored in cp compares well with the metabolic energy stored in the atp pool the nonlinear currentvoltage relationship of p attributed to phosphorylating reactions is also sensitive to light and temperature and is responsible for the region of negative conductance of the overall currentvoltage relationship the power of the pump muw cm amounts to some percent of the total energy turnover the high cl fluxes nmol cm sec and the electrical properties of the plasmalemma are not as closely related as assumed previously for kinetic reasons a direct and specific cl pathway between the vacuole and outside is postulated to exist
1011,measurements are reported on certain isotopic fluxes during the net conversion of glutamine adp and pi to glutamate nh and atp by escherichia coli glutamine synthetase adenylylated form mn G1 in presence of a hexokinaseglucose trap to remove the atp formed during the reaction the results show that the transfer of oxygens from pi to glutamine is the most rapid of the measured isotopic interchanges over five oxygens from pi being transferred to glutamine for each glutamate formed by net reaction under similar conditions the oxygen transfer from pi to glutamate was stimulated somewhat by an increase in the glutamate concentration but inhibited by an increase in the ammonia concentration the enzyme from BB or peas did not show the rapid transfer of o from pi to glutamine shown by the e coli enzyme deductions are also made from the data about the availability of the oxygens of gammacarboxyl of bound glutamate for reaction the most logical explanation of the results with the e coli enzyme is that the gammacarboxyl group of bound glutamate has sufficient rotational freedom so that under conditions of rapid substrate interconversion either carboxylate oxygen can participate in the reaction the results with the pea enzyme are consistent with hindered rotation of the gammacare additional findings make likely a relative order of certain catalytic steps for the e coli enzyme as follows atp release less than nh release less than glutamate release less than substrate interconversion less than glutamine release and pi PR and glutamate release less than adp release
1012,certain chemical properties which may determine the biological actions of the recently discovered histamine hreceptor antagonists burimamide and metiamide are identified partly by considering the derivation of these antagonists examples are given of attempts to design antagonists using histamine as starting point a partial agonist was eventually obtained through modifying the side chain of histamine but retaining the imidazole ring further developments led to the synthesis of uncharged thioureido analogues and to the discovery of the antagonist burimamide consideration of the relative concentration of imidazole tautomers led to the replacement of a methylene group ch with an isosteric thioether s link in the side chain and incorporation of a methyl group in the imidazole ring these changes afforded metiamide an orally active antagonist these developments emphasize that the imidazole ring appears to have a special importance at h receptors burimamide and metiamide are hydrophilic molecules that resemble histamine in having an imidazole ring but differ in the side chain which though polar is uncharged by contrast the hreceptor antihistaminic drugs are lipophilic molecules their resemblance to histamine is in having a positively charged ammonium side chain these substantial chemical differences between the respective antagonists probably determine their selectivity in distinguishing between the two types of histamine receptor furthermore the very low lipophilicities of these hreceptor antagonists probably account for the lack of CE nervous system and local anesthetic effects normally associated with the use of antihistaminic drugs
1013,to ascertain the clinical significance of derangements in arterial ph and arterial carbon dioxide tension paco in modifying pulmonary arterial pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance in critically ill patients the relationship between these two sets of variables was evaluated in patients no significant differences in pulmonary hemodynamic values were found among patients with acidemia a normal ph or alkalemia even at extreme ph values and there was no consistent relationship between paco and each of the pulmonary hemodynamic measurements in patients who initially had a normal ph but subsequently developed acidemia or alkalemia there was also no significant correlation between changes in ph and pulmonary hemodynamic values we conclude that CA of pulmonary hemodynamic values in seriously ill patients are usually due to factors other than acidbase derangements of practical importance is the observation that the predictability of the pulmonary arterial wedge pressure from the pulmonary arterial Pd is not invalidated by acidbase disturbances
1014,equilibrium dialysis studies have been made of the binding of a number of small molecules by rat ligandin direct measurements of IB together with competition experiments indicated that bromosulphophthalein oestrone sulphate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate each bind at the same single primary binding site with association constants of x x and x mol respectively at ph iom degrees c as well as bromosulphophthalein and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate a number of strucurally similar organic anions including hydroxyoestradiolglutathione oestrone glycyronide nmethylaminoazobenzeneglutathione and several bile acids were able to displace oestrone sulphate from ligandin in a manner consistent with competition at a single IB site from these experiments association constants for the competing ligands were derived these were inthe range x x mol ligandin was found to bind a number of compounds for which because of their low AQ solubilities relative to their IB affinities complete IB isotherms could bot be obtained these included several steroids but not cortisol methylcholanthrene DES oleate and palmitate E1S was able to compete with these ligands for IB and the results of the competition experiments were interpretable in terms of competition at a single binding site in general the conjugation of nonpolar ligands with sulphate or glutathione resulted in increased affinities but such increases were relatively small approximately in therms of free energy implying that the main driving force for the IB of both the conjugated and unconjugated species was the hydrophobic effect this conclusion is borne out by the observations that both oestrone and its sulphate showed slight increases in affinity with increase in ionic strength as would be expected for hydrophobic interactions as well as nonpolar EDC and organic anions ligandin was also found to bind sulphate and glucuronate to a measurable degree and to interact quite strongly with glutathione for the latter compound a single binding site was found with an association constant of x mol glutathione was able to cause the dissociation of the ligandinoestrone sulphate complex but this effect was not explicable in terms of simple competition both oestrone and oestrone sulphare were bound most strongly at ph the affinity of the protein for these ligands falling off quite sharply on either side of this maximum the affinities of ligandin for BSP steroids and their conjugates diethylstilboestrol and nndimethylaminoazobenzene are similar in magnitude to those of serum Al and aminoazodyebinding protein a b ketterer e tipping jf hackney and d beale
1015,the response of rat liver adenylate cyclase atp pyrophosphatelyase cyclizing ec to catecholamines is enhanced after ADX to investigate this phenomenon we developed an in vitro assay for betaadrenergic receptors of plasma CM derived from livers of control and adrenalectomized rats using iiodohydroxybenzylpindolol ihyp a potent betaadrenergic receptor antagonist IB of ihyp reached equilibrium within min and dissociation occurred with a halftime of approximately min the lisomers of isoproterenol and propranolol were at least times more potent as inhibitors of ihyp binding than were the corresponding disomers ADX did not affect the rates of association or dissociation of ihyp or the dissociation constants of several ligands that are active at betaadrenergic receptors the number of binding CS for ihyp was determined in homogenates and in purified CM of livers from control and adrenalectomized rats the number of sites increased to fold after ADX a similar increase in hormone stimulation of adenylate cyclase was observed these changes were reversed by the administration of cortisone the increase in the number of binding sites for ihyp may be a compensatory response to the impairments in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis which occur after adrenalectomy
1016,in recent years dosage forms with sustained PR have obtained a significant importance the technological possibilities for manufacturing are described as coating embedding and matrix procedures the range of auxiliary substances which are responsible for the retardation of drug activity reaches from lipophilic EDC as lipoids fatty alcohols and EDC which are forming hydrogels as cellulose derivatives and NK polysaccharides to synthetic polymers derived from acrylic acid the formulation of the dosage forms requires particular care in respect to the amount of initial and maintenance doses on account of technological processes for example during manufacturing of tablets under certain circumstances the liberation rate is altered in vitro test methods allow comparisons only then when the results can be counterchecked by in vitro experiments the PR of drug follows different mechanisms which are described entirely or in part to be reactions following the time law of zero or first order in special cases a linear rho is observed as a function of square root of time the calculation of given special equations for events within the dosage form is feasible from bloodlevel values
1017,the effects of pancuronium bromide infusion on the uptake and PR of c noradrenaline cna by the isolated perfused rat heart and on the chronotropic and inotropic activity of the isolated HR were evaluated hearts were removed from animals under light ether anaesthesia transferred to a modified langendorff perfusing apparatus and perfused with krebsringer bicarbonate solution at a rate of ml min the effect of pancuronium on the uptake of noradrenaline was determined by perfusing hearts for min with perfusate containing various concentrations of pancuronium and ng ml of cna T3 min pancuroniumtreated hearts contained less cna the degree of reduced uptake increased with increasing concentrations of pancuronium in addition the combination of pancuronium perfusion and electrical stimulation ma for ms at hz blocked the min uptake of cna by the HR to a greater degree than either factor separately the release of noradrenaline was determined after perfusing hearts with cna followed by perfusion with solution containing pancuronium but no cna for h pancuronium infusion did not significantly alter the PR of cna from the heart after h of perfusion the infusion of pancuronium caused a reduction in both the rate and strength of myocardial contraction of the isolated heart which was reversed by perfusion with perfusate free of pancuronium following perfusion with pancurnium the rate and strength of contraction of the heart was seen to rebound above prepancuronium values for a short period the rebound of myocardial rate and contraction may have been due to the presence of myocardial noradrenaline previously blocked from reuptake by pancuronium since hearts removed from reserpinized animals did not demonstrate rebound
1018,because of the close anatomic and physiologic relationship between the HR and lungs patients with chronic obstructive lung disease are at special risk of arrhythmias effective therapy hinges on identifying the mechanisms of the arrhythmiashemodynamic metabolic or druginduced impulsive use of antiarrhythmic agents may result only in a more complex and dangerous rhythm disorder extremes of ph are a major cause of arrhythmias in these patients respiratory alkalemia usually originates with inappropriate ventilation often during mechanical QO2 while metabolic alkalemia generally can be traced to diuretic or bicarbonate therapy lidocaine or diphenylhydantoin are of little use since the alkaline ph inside and outside heart muscle cells hampers drug distribution and activity at the other extreme the arrhythmias of acidemia strike patients who have severe respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or severe cardiac failure with shock and lactic acidemia arrhythmias may develop if vagal restraint is lost which is especially likely in patients with KD irritant receptors along the bronchopulmonary tree can trigger arrhythmias if stimulated by cough microembolism or mechanical irritation which is a hazard with endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes
1019,two groups of and patients with acne vulgaris were first treated for a period of one week with g oxytetracycline a day po in a second treatment period of weeks the first group received mg OTC a day po and the second group a combination of mg oxytetracycline and g sodiumbituminosulfonates a day po in the third treatment period similarly continued for weeks the method was reversed gastric juiceinsoluble S9 were used for the investigation all criteria for a doubleblind study were considered amount and composition of the skin surface lipids were analysed before beginning the treatment at the end of the nd and at the end of the rd treatment period the combination of both agents in gastric juiceinsoluble preparations suppresses to a great extent the known effects brought about by the substances separately namely the reduction in free fatty acids and the decrease in the skin surface lipids the findings also show that the reduction of the free fatty acids was in a limited time observed only in patients treated with mg oxytetracycline a day po if they had been treated in the beginning of this therapy with a higher dosage of tetracycline
1020,Pyr kinase ec was isolated from neurospora crassa mycelium grown at degrees c pk and at degrees c pk the regulatory properties particularly the response towards the allosteric effector fructose diphosphate fdp was different in the two enzymes pk showed an activation by fdp but pk under comparable conditions appeared to be activated by low concentrations of fdp and inhibited by higher ones for pk complex formation with fdp results in a lowering of the isoelectric point from to representing the pi of the unliganded enzyme and that of the complex respectively in contrast to this pk exhibits a weak IB to fdp as suggested by a lack of decrease in the isoelectric point on treatment with comparable concentrations of fdp studies with quenching of aromatic residue fluorescence of pk and pk following binding of fdp indicate that although this ligand binds to both types of enzymes the affinity for the two is vastly different dissociation constants of mum and mm were calculated for the binding of fdp to pk and pk respectively it is concluded that growth at elevated temperatures induced a conformational NC in the pyruvate kinase leading to partial desensitization of the allosteric site the nature of the factors responsible for this change is not understood at present
1021,mutants of escherichia coli k that require ltryptophan trp are normally unable to utilize dtryptophan to fulfill their requirement however secondary mutations dadr that confer this ability can be isolated in such strains two distinct enzymes are found to be produced at high levels damino acid oxidase ec and dtryptophan oxidase a convenient assay procedure for dtryptophan oxidase is described the two enzymes could be distinguished on the basis of their sensitivity to inhibition by lphenylalanine and ltyrosine strains that were trp dadr could not grow with dtryptophan in the presence of lphenylalanine but further mutations fyo could be isolated that allowed growth under these conditions some of them were characterized by further increases in the level of dtryptophan oxidase activity and a sharp decrease in damino acid oxidase these kinds of fyo mutations lay in or near the dadr gene the substrate specificity of the two enzymes toward a C1 number of compounds was examined the transamination of aromatic keto acids was investigated in the wildtype strain only a single enzyme transaminase a ec was found and it was irreversibly activated when subjected to elevated temperatures the present state of our knowledge on damino acid utilization in e coli is summarized
1022,the interactions of lanthanide metals and dinitrophenyl spinlabel haptens with the fv fragment of the mouse myeloma protein mopc were investigated by the techniques of fluorescence esr electron spin resonance and highresolution nmr nuclear magnetic resonance the protein fluorescence of fv fragment at nm is quenched by the haptens fluorescence enhancement epsilon and enhanced by gdiii epsilon and other lanthanides the IB of the haptens studied here is insensitive to ph in the range dissociation constant kh mum and shows stoicheiometry the binding of gdiii also shows stoicheiometry but is phdependent the binding constant km varies from mum at ph to mum at ph laiii binding is less sensitive to ph the phdependences of the metalbinding constants imply that a group in the protein with pka greater than or equal to is involved in the binding and probably also other groups with lower pka values the apparent binding of the haptens is weakened about fold by gdiii and vice versa an equilibrium scheme involving a ternary complex with an interaction between the two IB sites is derived in appendix i to explain the exp results at two ph values timedependent fluorescence changes are observed in the presence of gdiii at ph a twostate kinetic scheme involving a slow conformational NC in the fv fragment is derived in appendix ii to explain this timedependence this scheme is consistent with the antagonistic equilibrium behaviour the esr changes in the spinlabel haptens on binding to fv fragment and on the subsequent addition of lanthanides are consistent with the binding scheme for haptens and lanthanides proposed from the fluorescence studies a difference between the limiting quenching of the esr signal from the bound haptens in the presence of saturating concentrations of gdiii and laiii is attributed to dipolar interactions between bound gdiii and the nitroxide moiety of the bound hapten the residual quenching with gdiii allows an estimate of nm to be made for the distance between the two paramagnetic centres the mhz proton difference spectrum of the fv fragment resulting from the addition of laiii suggests that any metalinduced conformational changes are small and involve relatively few amino acid residues on the fv fragment
1023,the properties of the functional CG in a protein can be used as builtinprobes of the structure of the protein we have developed a general procedure whereby the ionization constant and chemical reactivity of solitary PET groups in proteins may be determined the method may be applied to the side chain of histidine tyrosine lysine and cysteine as well as to the amino terminus of the protein the method which is an extension of the competitive labeling technique using h and cfluorodinitrobenzene nphf in a doublelabeling procedure is rapid and sensitive advantage is taken of the fact that T3 acid hydrolysis of a dinitrophenylated protein a derivative is obtained which must be derived from a unique position in the protein the method has been applied to the solitary histidine residue of lysozyme alphalytic protease and streptomyces griseus sg trypsin as well as to the amino terminus of the latter protein the following parameters were obtained for reaction with nphf at degrees c in n kcl the histidine of hen eggwhite lysozyme pka of and secondorder velocity constant of m min the histidine of alphalytic protease pka of and secondorder velocity constant of m min the histidine of sg trypsin pka of and secondorder velocity constant of m min the valyl amino terminus of sg trypsin pka of and secondorder velocity constant of m min in addition the results obtained provide clues as to the microenvironments of these functional groups and indicate that the proteins studied undergo phdependent conformational changes which affect the microenvironment and hence the chemical CR of these groups
1024,initiation factor if causes the destabilization of preformed ternary complexes of s ribosomal S1 codons and aminoacyltrnas or peptidyltrna this destabilization is dilutiondependent and affects all ternary complexes with the exception of those containing the initiator fmettrna which remain more resistant to ifinduced destabilization under the various conditions studied several possible reasons for this specificity have been examined it was found that the basis for the specificity is not a an intrinsic greater stability of the ternary complexes containing fmettrna b the amoung of aminoacyltrna bound to the ribosome c the conditions under which the ternary complex is made or d the formylation of the amino group on the other hand the nature of the polynucleotide in response to which the ternary complex is formed was found to influence the amount of aminoacyltran bound to the ribosome and to some extent the amount of aminoacyltrna which can be relased the ternary complex containing the mischarged initiator trna fvaltrnafmet displays greater resistance to the ifinduced destabilization than the complex containing fvaltrnaval these results indicate that the specificity of the if activity is due to the special structural feature of the initiator trna molecule and to some extent to the nature of the polynucleotide the ifinduced destabilization of ternary complexes was found to be little affected by variations in reaction conditons so that this if activity can be used to measure the stoichiometric IB of if to the ribosome over a broad range of ph and k and mg concentrations several antibiotics have been tested for their capacity to interfere with this reaction only high concentrations of tetracycline blocked this if activity
1025,this study describes the probably eleventh case mentioned in literature of acquired heat contact uticaria in an otherwise healthy young woman with regard to true contact induction heat contact urticaria clearly differs from the more common cholinergic uticaria on the other hand heat contact urticaria is completely analogous to cold uticaria because of the exposure area reversible blocking by unphysiological prolonged heating of the skin sensitivity to antihistamines and resistance to corticosteroids in this case whealing of the skin occurred on SE to heating of degrees c for min with a temperature of degrees c the shortest time for wheal induction was sec at degrees c the shortest time for maximal reaction was only a split second an optimal temperature for wheal induction could not be determined local anaesthesia with xylocain caused a considerable blocking of wheals histamine and cholinergic drugs showed normal skin reactions after intradermal i.t. antihistamines po parenterally or perorally were highly effective corticosteroids however given systemically in high doses proved to be ineffective during our observations a SR appeared with a clinical symptomfree state on unphysiological high temperature stimulus however contact uticaria could still be demonstrated the pathogenetic uniformity of sporadic heat contact urticaria and problems of therapeutical controls are discussed
1026,these experiments were designed to study the mechanism of depletion of dopamine da in the striatum produced by alphamethylmtyrosine alphammt alphamethylmtyramine alphammta the metabolite of alphammt appears to be the AS dadepleting agent since the administration of a decarboxylase inhibitor before alphammt markedly reduced both the formation of alphammta and the SD of da after injection of alphammt mgkg ip the striatal concentration of homovanillic acid hva rose by at hour this is probably due to an increase in da metabolism since alphammt markedly enhanced the decline of da produced by alphamethylptyrosine alphampt at and hours after alphammt the concentration of hva and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was below control level the decrease in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid is due partially to a decreased formation of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid from da in striatal slices both alphammt and alphammta decreased the formation of hho and the accumulation of hda from htyrosine alphammt did not alter the TPS activity of htyrosine or release hda from the slices but it did inhibit the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in striatal homogenates at low concentrations of tyrosine mum alphammta released both newly synthesized and exogenously accumulated hda from striatal slices at low concentrations of alphammta the percent reduction in hho was much greater than the percentage of hda released into the medium however at higher concentrations the inhibition of hho reached a maximum while hda PR kept increasing these results suggest that both inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and da release from storage CS by alphammta may account for the SD of da produced by the injection of alphammt
1027,experiments were performed to determine the mechanism by which centrifugal impulses in the CSN nerve csn reduce the frequency of impulse traffic in afferent chemoreceptor fibers from the carotid body in cats recordings of chemoreceptor activity were made from single or fewfiber S9 dissected off the csn while the remainder of the csn was stimulated electrically to produce neurally induced inhibition of chemoreceptor activity various drugs were injected either intravenously or directly into the arterial blood supply to the carotid body we found that CAs dopamine norepinephrine and epinephrine inhibited spontaneous chemoreceptor activity and that alpha adrenergic antagonists abolished both this inhibition and that produced by electrical stimulation of the csn in the same preparation atropine but not nicotinic antagonists of acetylcholine consistently blocked neurally induced inhibition but not that produced by CAs muscarinic agonists had no effect on spontaneous chemoreceptor activity we conclude that centrifugal activity in the csn causes PR of endogenous catecholamines in the carotid body and that these catecholamines mediate neurally induced inhibition of chemoreceptor activity is due to the vasomotor effects of acetylcholine
1028,it had previously been held that chlorate is not itself toxic but is rendered toxic as a result of nitrate reductasecatalysed conversion to chlorite this however cannot be the explanation of chlorate toxicity in aspergillus nidulans even though nitrate reductase is known to have chlorate reductase activity among other evidence against the CP theory for the mechanism of chlorate toxicity is the finding that not all mutants lacking nitrate reductase are clorate resistant both chloratesensitive and resistant mutants lacking nitrate reductase also lack chlorate reductase data is presented which implicates not only nitrate reductase but also the product of the nira gene a positive regulator gene for nitrate assimilation in the mediation of chlorate toxicity alternative mechanisms for chlorate toxicity are considered it is unlikely that chlorate toxicity results from the involvement of nitrate reductase and the nira gene product in the regulation either of nitrite reductase or of the PP pathway although low ph has an effect similar to chlorate chorate is not likely to be toxic because it lowers the ph low ph and chlorate may instead have similar effects a possible explanation for chlorate toxicity is that it mimics nitrate in mediating via nitrate reductase and the nira gene product a shutdown of nitrogen catabolism as chlorate cannot act as a nitrogen source nitrogen starvation ensues
1029,the charge state of two derivatives of sepharose prepared by the cnbr activation method were studied by acidbase titration and by ionexchange chromatography dodecylsepharose exhibited cationic groups mumolml of settled gel pka that were tentatively assigned to the coupling isourea group cpadsepharose ncarboxypropionylaminodecylsepharose has anionic carboxyl groups pka and cationic CG pka in roughly equal concentrations e coupling group cpadsepharose is slightly negatively charged at ph and substantially negatively charged at ph the pka values of dodecylsepharose and cpadsepharose are unaffected by a fold increase in the concentration of kcl cpadsepharose has considerable affinity for wheatgerm aspartate transcarbamoylase at ph when the adsorbent and enzyme are both negatively charged the interaction involves the c chain but is relatively moderate compared with c chains associated only with positive charge desorption of the enzyme adsorbed to cpadsepharose can be achieved by raising the ph to increase the electrostatic repulsion or by introducing the detergent sodium deoxycholate acetone and butanol also weaken the adsorption at ph high concentrations of sodium acetate or sodium phosphate induced the enzyme to bind more tightly to cpadsepharose these results are discussed in terms of a repulsioncontrolled model or hydrophobic chromatography
1030,the responses of spontaneously active single neurones in the substantia nigra and overlying mesencephalic Rt formation have been analysed during the electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral Cd nucleus experiments were performed in rats anaesthetized with urethane or pentobarbitone all recordings were made extracellularly with multibarrelled glass micropipettes which were also used to test neuronal responsiveness to electrophoretically administered substances the micropipette tip position was marked and the distribution of neurones studied has been analysed single shock stimulation of the Cd nucleus inhibited neuronal activity in the substantia nigra cells mean RL msec and in the mesencephalic reticular formation cells mean RL msec however these effects were often accompanied by periods of excitation in PB anaesthetized animals the latency and duration of these substantia nigra inhibitions was increased compared with the zona reticulata fewer neurones in the zona compacta of the substantia nigra responded to Cd stimulation in both urethane or pentobarbitone anaesthetized animals the activity of most cells was depressed by electrophoretically administered gaba or glycine and increased by acetylcholine or glu neurones of the mesencephalic reticular formation were less CS to gaba and glycine than substantia nigra neurones within the substantia nigra both zona compacta and zona reticulata neurones were more CS to gaba than to glycine overall glutamate was a more potent excitant than acetylcholine ach electrophoretic bicuculline methochloride bmc consistently reduced gaba but not glycine depression of substantia nigra neurones approximately twice as much bmc was required to reduce the endogenous inhibition of the same substantia nigra neurones and the amplitude of concomitantly evoked positive field potential as was required to abolish exogenous gaba responses some evoked substantia nigra inhibitions were resistant to bmc electrophoretic str consistently reduced glycine but not gaba depression of substantia nigra neurones and did not modify caudate evoked inhibition of these neurones or the accompanying field potential the results support the concept of a slowly conducting caudatonigral pathway which has both facilitatory and inhibitory components the inhibitory pathway uses gaba as the neurotransmitter the identity of the possible excitatory transmitter is unknown the MSR nature of this pathway is uncertain and the possible contribution of other bicuculline insensitive nigral inhibitory processes is discussed
1031,several t bruceisubgroup strains isolated from game were investigated with the blood incubation infectivity test biit and in human volunteers original isolates and their clones derivatives were tested in order to check the validity of the biit volunteer tested clones were used under modified biit conditions inoculation of different trypanosome strains into volunteers yielded positive parasitaemia for original isolates from lion hyaena and cokes hartebeest changing antibody titers during the course of infection in the volunteers were checked with the indirect FAT ift the biit was reliable consistently positive for cloned t b rhodesiense when testing t b brucei the biit results depended on the number of incubated parasites and on the parasitaemia peak number the tested trypanosomes derived from it was further shown that the in vivo part of the biit is actually essential for the complete neutralization of t b brucei induced by the action of human plasma tests with trypanosomes originating from experimentally mixed t b rhodesiense and brucei infections gave inconsistent results on the other hand pure populations mixed in vitroprior to incubation for biitrevealed results depending on the proportion of the species up to t b rhodesiense gave negative higher concentrations consistently positive results
1032,the acylcoasnglycerolphosphate acyltransferase ec glycerolp acyltransferase and acylcoadihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase ec dhap acyltransferase activities were investigated in vitro in order to evaluate the quantitative contribution of the glycerolp and dhap pathways for the synthesis of triacylglycerols in isolated fat cells and to test the hypothesis that these two activities may be dual catalytic functions of a single enzyme more than of both acyltransferase activities was associated with the microsomal subcellular fraction the microsomal glycerolp acyltransferase activity showed an apparent km of mum for glycerolp with a vmax of nmolminmg while the dhap acyltransferase activity showed an apparent km of mum for dhap with a vmax of nmolminmg glycerolp was a competitive inhibitor ki mum of the dhap acyltransferase and dhap was a competitive inhibitor ki mum of the glycerolp acyltransferase the two acyltransferase MICs showed virtual identity in their ph dependence acylcoa chain length dependence thermolability and inactivation by nethylmaleimide trypsin detergents collagenase phospholipases and various salts and organic solvents also had similar effects on both activities taken as a whole the data strongly suggest that the microsomal glycerolp and dhap acyltransferase activities actually represent dual functions of a single enzyme calculations based on the above kinetic constants and previously reported glycerolp and dhap pools in adipocytes suggest that the in vivo ratio of glycerolp to dhap acylation should be greater than
1033,the actions of glycine gaba alphaalanine betaalanine and taurine were studied by intracellular recordings from lumbar MNs of the isolated spinal cord of the frog all amino acids tested produced a reduction in the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials a blockade of the antidromic action potential and an increase of Gm furthermore membrane polarizations occurred which were always in the same direction as the ipsp all these effects indicate a postsynaptic GABA action of these amino acids when the relative strength of different amino acids was compared taurine had the strongest inhibitory potency followed by betaalanine alphaalanine gaba and glycine topically applied strychnine and PT induced different changes of postsynaptic potentials indicating that distinct GABA systems might be influenced by these two convulsants interactions with amino acids showed that picrotoxin seletively diminished the postsymaptic actions of gaba while strychnine reduced the effects of taurine glycine alpha and betaalanine but differences in the susceptibility of these amino acid actions to strychnine could be detected the action of taurine was more sensitively blocked by strychnine compared with glycine alpha and betaalanine with regard to these results the importance of taurine and gaba as transmitters of postsynaptic inhibition on motoneurons in the spinal cord of the frog is discussed
1034,a sodium dependent specific transport system for phosphate is present in the brush border microvilli but absent from the basallateral plasma membranes the apparent affinity of this transport system for phosphate is mm at mm sodium and ph it is inhibited competitively by arsenate with an apparent inhibitor constant of mm mm sodium ph sodium dependent phosphate uptake is two times higher at ph compared to the uptake observed at ph the apparent affinity of the transport system for sodium is also phdependent halfmaximal stimulation of uptake is found at ph with mm sodium at ph with mm sodium and at ph with mm sodium under all conditions a nonhyperbolic dependence of phosphate uptake on the sodium concentration is observed the uptake of phosphate by brush border microvilli vesicles shows a typical OS phenomenon in the presence of sodium gradient across the membrane cnao greater than cnai the amount of pohsphate taken up after min is about twice the equilibrium value reached T3 h of incubation at ph the initial rate of uptake is increased only slighyly by inside negative membrane DWI potentials and inhibited to the same extent by inside positive membrane diffusion potentials these results indicate that the entry of phosphate across the brush border membrane into the epithelial cell of the proximal tubule is coupled to the entry of sodium the transfer of phosphate is dependent on its concentration gradient and on the concentration difference of sodium the data are best explained by the following hypothesis both the primary phosphate as well as the secondary phosphate are transported in cotransport with sodium the divalent form however seems to be transported preferentially its transport occurs electroneutral with sodium ions the monovalent phosphate also enters the cell together with sodium ions but as a positively charged complex the exit of phosphate across the contraluminal cell border is sodium independent and is favoured by the high intracellular phosphate concentration and the inside negative membrane potential
1035,application of acid cerebrospinal fluid at ph to the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata in cats increased the arterial blood pressure and the activity of the vertebral nerve and enhanced respiratory modulation of the vertebral and cardiac nerves ALP CSF fluid at ph applied to the VP surface of the MO increased the arterial blood pressure without changes in the sympathetic nerve activity when the spinal cord was superfussed with artificial acid cerebrospinal fluid at the th level the activity of the vertebral nerve and cardiac nerve increased and the arterial blood pressure rose the authors discuss the possibility of regulation of the activity of sympathetic SN in the medulla and spinal cord by means of direct action of ph and pco on the neurons or through an indirect effect mediated by superficial chemoreceptors of the medulla oblongata the role of local changes of the brain blood flow in the mechanism of these results is discussed as well
1036,fentanyl was used in abdominal surgical interventions combined with droperidol or with diazepan always with good results as far as analgesia was concerned tensional variations that occurred during the induction were quite small and disappeared during the filling up in the course of the intervention tensional variations were only met with subjects suffering from high blood pressure the respiratory depression that went with analgesia did not constitute an obstacle but made it necessary to use artificial ventilation for the intervetion the awakening was always quick smooth without any vomiting and was influenced neither by the time taken up by the intervention nor by the condition of the patient no residual respiratory depression requiring the use of an antimorphinic was noted at the end of the study FE appears as a powerful analgesic easy to use and successful in all the cases of abdominal surgery its effect does not last a drawback that can be avoided by the use of an intravenous drip
1037,the IB of phydroxymercuribenzoate to human methemoglobin causes a perturbation of the visible heme abosrption spectrum which is expressed by an increase in absorbance in the high spin band regions to nm and to nm concomitant with a decrease in absorbance in the alpha and betaband absorption regions the ph dependence of the phydroxymercuribenzoateinduced difference spectrum can be accounted for quantitatively by a shift toward higher spin of the aquo form of methemoglobin a shift toward higher spin of the hydroxide form and a shift in the apparent pka for the water to hydroxide transition from to when mercurial is bound the rate of these heme abosrbance changes is consistent with the rapid second order formation of the beta cysteine mercurymercaptide bond and does not represent a change due to the dissociation of methemoglobin tetramers into dimers even though the latter slow process does follow mercurial binding the observation of an increase in spin produced by the IB of a reagent which also promotes dimer formation argues strongly against any direct correlation between an increase in spin and the appearance of deoxyhemoglobinlike conformations
1038,adenine nucleotide exchangetransport was reconstituted in vesicles prepared from phospholipids and protein fractions derived from SMP the transport which was specific for atp and adp was measured either as adpadp atpatp or adpatp exchange the highest specific activity nanomoles of adpadp exchangeminmg of protein at room temperature was obtained with a protein fraction prepared by cholate SE of partly resolved submitochondrial particles followed by AS fractionation at mum external nucleotide the exchange reactions were inhibited by low concentrations of bongkrekate atractyloside and palmitoylcoa with ki values of and mum respectively the adpadp nucleotide exchange was stimulated about fold by mum mgcl or mnclkm of mum and about fold by mum caclkm of mum it was optimal between ph and and decreased rapidly above ph arrhenius plots between degrees and degrees showed a break point at degrees with soybean phospholipids and an activation SE of kcalmole from degrees degrees and kcalmole from degrees degrees with mitochondrial phospholipids the break point was at degrees and activation energies were kcalmole from degrees degrees and kcalmole from degrees degrees the phospholipid requirements for adenine nucleotide exchange were similar to those of oxidative phosphorylation optimal rates were observed with a phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine ratio of cardiolipin had a slight stimulatory effect the uptake of adp into vesicles containing atp was stimulated by kcl or by kpi as well as by hexafluoracetonylacetone and uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation the uptake of atp into LDV containing adp was inhibited by kcl or by kpi but was also stimulated by hexafluoracetonylacetone in both cases valinomycin reversed the effects of kcl while mersalyl or nethylmaleimide prevented the effects of kpi in contrast none of these salts nor hexafluoracetonylactone affected the adpadp or atpatp exchange these findings suggest that in the reconstituted system the adpatp exchange is electrogenic
1039,subunits released from influenza asingapore hn virus by either tritonx tx or sodium lauryl sarcosinate sls or ether were separated by PACE in agarose suspension into a rapidly migrating fraction i and a slowly migrating fraction ii fraction i obtained after tx treatment contained the viral ribonucleoprotein rnp in a form indistinguishable from the obtained after ether treatment sls treatment of the virus resulted in a rapidly migrating fraction containing only the protein part of the viral rnp fraction ii obtained after tx or sls treatment contained both haemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na mostly dissociated from each other in contrast to fraction ii obtained T3 ether treatment which contained mixed aggregates of ha and na the yields of electrophoretically isolated rnp and hana were essentially the same irrespective of whether tx or ether was used for virus disruption treatment of virus by tx and subsequent removal of the latter resulted in a fold increase of the ha activity after SDS sds treatment of the virus the na activity was found in a heterogeneous fraction with surprisingly high migration rate towards the anode indicating that na remained active despite its extensive sds binding
1040,noncollagenous substances in newborn calf dermis were extracted with solutions of various concentrations of mgcl the total protein and hydroxyproline contents in mgcl extracts increased with increase in the concentration of mgcl in the solutions in particular steep increases of their contents were observed at concentrations of mgcl from to m total amounts of hydroxyproline in and m mgcl extracts were equivalent to of the hydroxyproline content in the whole connective tissue hexose and hexosamine contents of mgcl extracts increased with increase of the mgcl concentration hexuronic acid was hardly present in the residues after extractions with and m mgcl plasma proteins hyaluronic acid and DS were extracted at low concentrations of mgcl a noncollagenous protein and mgclsoluble collagen were extracted with and m mgcl solutions the disperson of collagen fibrils was observed in the residue extracted with m mgcl solution by electron microscopy the fibril structure of collagen was disordered by extraction with and m mgcl the results suggest that the dispersion and disorder of collagen fibrils lead to the release of a noncollagenous protein furthermore it is suggested that the removal of hyaluronic acid and DS was not very effective for the CMS of a C1 amount of collagen but was suitable as a pretreatment to the extraction of a noncollagenous protein accompanied by the solubilization of a large amount of collagen the noncollagenous protein was purified by deaecellulose column chromatography polyacrylamide gel PACE of this protein at ph showed a single band moving to the cathode the noncollagenous protein contained hexose hexosamine and no hexuronic acid this protein is rich in glycine glutamic acid and alanine and contains neither hydroxyproline nor hydroxylysine sedimentation analysis showed a single peak with s and the molecular weight was approx as determided by sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
1041,previous studies on the pharmacokinetics of hdigoxin in the rat have been based on total radioactivity in the plasma even though the drug is extensively metabolized in this species a comparison of total radioactivity vs unchanged drug in rat plasma after administration of hdigoxin clearly showed the need to separate digoxin from its metabolites the pharmacokinetics of digoxin were therefore examined using solvent extraction and TLC to isolate unchanged drug digoxin C2 after a mgkg iv dose were measured in the plasma and urine of adult male rats in which the bile duct or the ureters had been ligated as well as in shamoperated controls in all cases digoxin concentrations were best described by a twocompartment open model digoxin was rapidly eliminated from the plasma of controls with a halflife of hr a volume of distribution of literkg and a renal clearance somewhat lower than the glomerular filtration rate no significant change in these parameters was observed in rats with bile duct ligation the TB clearance of mlmin in the controls was reduced by only in the bile ductligated rats in animals with bilateral ureter ligation the body clearance was reduced by and the plasma halflife of digoxin was increased to hr although no significant NC in the apparent volume of CSD was noted approximately of the total body clearance was unaffected by bile duct and ureter ligations and was assumed to be due to biotransformation biliary excretion was found to be important for digoxigenin bisdigitoxoside inasmuch as rats with bile duct ligation showed elevated metabolite levels in the plasma as well as a fold increase in renal excretion of the bisglycoside
1042,the sensitivity of the phosphate transport system to pcmps T3 phosphate starvation is dependent on protein synthesis this fact is related to the development of transport activity at alkaline ph in nonstarved cells the presence of only one peak of maximal activity for phosphate uptake at neutral ph at low and high concentration has been observed however in phosphate starved cells two peaks of maximal activity at low phosphate concentration at neutral and alkaline ph are present in starved cells pcmps inhibits more intensely the phosphate transport activity at alkaline ph than at neutral ph by contrast nem inhibits the phosphate transport more strongly at neutral than at alkaline ph phosphate uptake at neutral and alkaline ph are CS to osmotic shock but phosphate uptake at alkaline ph is decreased more than at neutral ph the results could be interpreted either by assuming that the membrane surroundings change during phosphate starvation or that two transport systems are present in starved cells whereas only one transport system exists in nonstarved cells
1043,effects of substitution of vinyl groups of hemin with formyl groups on the optical and ligand binding properties of horse heart ferric myoglobin were investigated the peak positions as well as the line shapes of the absorption spectra of the ferric derivatives of three kinds of formylmyoglobin vinylformyl formylvinyl and diformylmyoglobins depend on the number and the position of the formyl CG absorption maxima in the soret region of the acid forms of these ferric formylmyoglobins in m potassium phosphate buffer ph at degrees were and nm respectively the acid forms of these formylmyoglobins exhibit absorption spectra of the mixture of high and low spin states at ambient temperature since proto deutero and mesomyoglobins have a high spin state under the same condition the increase of the low spin iron in these formylmyoglobins may be due to the strong electron withdrawal by the formyl CG toward the periphery of the porphyrin ring the affinities of these ferric formylmyoglobins and protomyoglobin for n f ocn and scn increased in the order of proto monoformylmonovinyl diformylmyoglobin which corresponds to the increasing order of electronwithdrawing power of the porphyrin side chains the pka values of the acidalkaline transition decreased in the same order although the ferric forms of the two isomeric monoformylmonovinylmyoglobins exhibited different optical spectra the dissociation constants of the complexes of these isomers for various ligands were similar to each other the pka values of the acidalkaline transition were also similar these results indicate that affinities of ferric myoglobin for ligands in contrast to those of the ferrous form for oxygen and carbon monoxide sono m and asakura t j biol chem and sono m smith pd mccray ja and asakura t j biol chem are not affected by the position of modifications at the two vinyl groups but are determinedby the number of the formyl groups and that two vinyl CG at position and are equivalent in the binding of various ligands by ferric myoglobin the electron density of the ferric iron appears to be similar for the two isomeric monoformylmonovinylmyoglobins
1044,properties of the phenobarbital induced cytoplasmic aldehyde dehydrogenase ec have been studied in rat liver fold higher C2 were seen in the cytoplasmic activities after phenobarbital treatment in reactor compared to nonreactor animals with high concentrations of acetaldehyde mm and propionaldehyde mm no difference was found with mm acetaldehyde mm glycolaldehyde mm formaldehyde or mm betaine aldehyde the reactor group also had slightly higher activity in the mitochondrial fraction with the high acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde concentrations in the microsomal fraction the activities showed no differences at any substrate concentration an induced aldehyde dehydrogenase was purified fold by chromatographic techniques it had different molecular and enzymic properties than the main highkm enzyme normally present in rat liver cytoplasm the pi of the induced enzyme was about as measured by isoelectric focusing it was active with several aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes but not with formaldehyde glycolaldehyde or dglyceraldehyde the kmvalues for propionaldehyde and acetaldehyde were in the millimolar range millimolar concentrations of aromatic aldehydes caused a strong substrate inhibition the enzyme was inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of disulfiram estrone deoxycorticosterone progesterone and DES also affected the CEA
1045,CB of benzoapyrene to polyg was studied with the use of a radioactive CA and specifically labeled substrates to define the role of the and positions of the hydrocarbon during this process binding was shown to be dependent on microsomes nadph o and polyg benzoflavone and diethylaminoethyl diphenyl valerate were inhibitory whereas modulators of epoxide hydrase activity had little effect h and c studies suggested a possible loss of one to two protons incorporation of hbenzoapyrene provided evidence that the position of the hydrocarbon was not metabolized during covalent attachment to polyg and furthermore results with hbenzoapyrene suggest that the and positions may not be involved either after scaling up of the standard assay fold characterization of the tritiated bappolyg complex was carried out by hydrolysis and subsequent chromatography TLC chromatography of the isolated hydrolysis products treated with hcl or alkaline phosphatase indicated that the complex formed between bap and polyg was covalently linked and composed of hydrocarbonnucleotides
1046,the late effects of various immunosuppressive insults on cellmediated immunity in mice were studied in an attempt to assess the role of immune surveillance in the aging process results were obtained using susceptibility to allogeneic RT cell challenge graftversushost reaction gvhr blastogenic response to pha a thymus derived t cellspecific plant mitogen and cytolytic activity against allogeneic tumor cells as measures of immunologic activity in vivo studies late in life show that resistance to allogeneic tumor cells is significantly decreased in thymectomized mice whereas those treated with cortisone cyclophosphamide and sublethal xray remain unchanged SP cells from only the thymectomized and the sublethally irradiated mice show reduced activity in the gvhr no difference is seen in the activity of bone marrow cells results consistent with these findings were obtained in in vitro studies thus spleen cells from thymectomized or sublethally irradiated mice show decreased activity is response to pha whereas no change is seen in spleen cells from other treated CG hence surgical and PCS insults are more likely to induce longlasting immunosuppression in those immunocompetent tissues whose activity normally diminishes with advancing age furthermore the degree of immunosuppression seen in this T0 is not of the order of magnitude that one could reasonably predict a significant decrease in mean lifespan
1047,subjects deficient in lactase may experience bloating cramps and diarrhoea after ingesting milk due to the unhydrolysed and poorlyabsorbed lactose the diarrhoea may result from an osmotic effect of the lactose itself or its poorlyabsorbed acidic products of fermentation weijers van de kamer others christopher bayless possibly together with an alteration of sodium and water absorption due to the lowered Tc ph rousseau sladen laxation by lactulose betagalactosidofructose may operate through an analogous mechanism the drug is a synthetic dissaccharide which in oral doses of g relieves chronic constipation wesseliusde casparis braadbaart others it is neither hydrolysed by intestinal dissaccharidase dahlqvist gryboski nor absorbed in the gut but it is converted in the colon mainly to lactic and acetic acids by various bacteria including lactobacillus acidophilus apart from the increased osmotic effect the ph in the proximal colon falls markedly bown gibson others and larger doses may reduce stool ph weijers others inferred that the acidic products formed from lactose in the colon stimulate propulsion and ks liem philipsduphar suggested to us that lactulose may relieve constipation partly by stimulation of propulsion due to the lowered ph the experiments described below support this view
1048,the circular polarization of luminescence cpl emitted by tryptophan residues was used as a sensitive probe for measuring ligandinduced structural changes in a homogeneous type iii pneumococcal antibody a series of oligosaccharide ligands of increasing size derived from type iii polysaccharide by partial acid hydrolysis was assayed ligandinduced changes in the circular polarization of fluorescence of the antibody were observed for all antigens tested including tetra hexa and octasaccharides and a residue oligomer the largest changes being recorded upon interaction with the intact soluble type iii pneumococcal siii polysaccharide when fab or fab fragments were used instead of the antibody igg for binding of siii polysaccharide the extent of conformational changes was decreased this suggests interactions between fab and fc portions in the igg molecule and subsequent conformational changes in fc part upon antigen binding reduction of interchain disulfide bonds abolished the additional spectral changes attributed to the fc part but not the changes observed in the fab part thus suggesting that the presence of the interchain disulfide bond in the hinge region is required for maximal cpl changes to occur small monovalent ligands ie the tetra hexa and octasaccharides were capable of inducing cpl changes in the fab part of the antibody molecule as well as cpl changes attributed to the fc portion a multivalent ligand containing about sugar residues appears to be the minimal antigenic size required for triggering conformational changes attributed to the fc part similar to those seen in the interaction with the whole SPA
1049,treatment with hydrofluoric acid hf removed most of the phosphorus and small amounts of mannan glucan and protein from walls of two nonflocculent strains ncyc and ncyc and two flocculent strains ncyc and ncyc of saccharomyces cerevisiae organisms of all strains showed increased flocculating ability following hf treatment flocculation of UT organisms of ncyc and ncyc and of hftreated organisms of all four strains declined appreciably when they were washed in deionized water with or without edta and the flocculation was measured in deionized water instead of in msodium acetate containing ca treatment with epoxypropane also caused a decrease in the flocculating ability of these organisms extracting the lipids from organisms of strains ncyc and ncyc had no effect on their flocculating ability but decreased the flocculating ability of organisms of strains ncyc and ncyc phelectrophoretic mobility curves of untreated and hftreated organisms confirmed the loss of wall phosphate by hf treatment and indicated that hf treatment had little effect on the content of protein carboxyl groups in the outer wall layers mannose at m CR prevented floc formation by organisms of CS ncyc but even at m it had very little effect on floc formation by hftreated organisms of strains ncyc and ncyc organisms of all four strains bound fluoresceinconjugated concanavalin a to the same extent after treatment with hf as before but this treatment led to a greatly diminished IB of of fluoresceinconjugated AS raised against organisms of CS ncyc the results indicate that phosphodiester linkages in yeastwall mannan are not involved in bride formation through ca during floc formation and that this arises principally through carboxyl groups
1050,receptor blocking drugs were used to determine whether adrenergic DA serotoninergic or cholinergic synapses are involved in mediating the lh release induced by intraventricularly injected pge prostaglandin e mug was injected into the rd ventricle rd v of ovariectomized rats and plasma lh concentrations before and after treatment were determined by radioimmunoassay phentolamine or mug or pronethalol mug alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockers respectively injected into the rd v failed to alter the elevation of plasma lh evoked by pge injected into the ventricle min later likewise lh PR following pge was not changed when a DA blocker pimozide mgkg sc was injected h prior to pge two antagonists of serotonin methysergide maleate mgkg ip or cinanserin hc mgkg iv given h or min before pge respectively failed to alter the action of pge atropine or mug injected into the rd v min prior to pge was also ineffective in blocking the increase in plasma lh following pge the results of this T0 indicate that the effect of pge on lh release is not mediated by adrenergic dopaminergic serotoninergic or cholinergic receptors they also suggest that pge is not acting transsynaptically but probably directly on the lhrh neuron to induce the discharge of lhrh into the hypophysial portal vessels which then evokes release of lh from the adenohypophysis
1051,thirtyeight patients who had sustained acute trauma profound hemorrhagic shock and massive transfusion were studied prospectively to determine the predominant etiologic factors in the development of posttraumatic jaundice an analysis of clinical and biochemical factors occurring in association with each bilirubin peak in the postoperative course found the jaundice related to transfusion and surgery in instances to sepsis and septicemia in instances and to hepatic dysfunction in instances results indicated that admission estimates of sgot and ldh levels the height of the bilirubin peak and the postoperative day on which it occurs and the white cell count and ggt at the time of the peak may be of use in the differential diagnosis four case reports were used to emphasize the fluctuating pattern of jaundice and the different etiologic factors that may predominate light and electron microscopy from three patients illustrated the structural alterations that accompany the PSA impairment of liver function and enable a more precise appreciation of this syndrome hepatic dysfunction appears to be implicated in a high proportion of patients who develop posttraumatic jaundice which frequently occurs as part of a spectrum of MOF
1052,three homogeneous preparations of dalanine carboxypeptidases i have been obtained from escherichia coli strain h termed enzymes ia ib and ic enzyme ia purified from the membrane after extraction with triton x appeared on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis to be a polypeptide doublet whose monomer molecular weights were about and in addition to dalanine carboxypeptidase activity it catalyzed a transpeptidase reaction with several substrates bound cpenicillin g had a weak penicillinase activity but was devoid of endopeptidase activity enzyme ib obtained from the membrane after licl SE and enzyme ic obtained from the supernatant solution were either identical or extremely similar they were composed of a single polypeptide whose monomer molecular weight was about in addition to carboxypeptidase activity they catalyzed an endopeptidase reaction had weak penicillinase activity and had very poor transpeptidase activity but did not bind cpenicillin g some data relating to the mechanism of catalysis by these enzymes are described their possible physiological role is discussed
1053,concentrations of bacteria in CSF fluid ranged from x to x colonyforming unitsml in patients with BM before antibiotic therapy and from x to x cfuml in four patients T3 one to two days of antibiotic therapy all patients with persistent positive cultures had i.c.v. concentrations of cfuml or greater a significant association was observed between cerebrospinal fluid lactic acid dehydrogenase activity and concentrations of bacteria p less than large inocula of hemophilus influenzae type b increased the MICs for penicillin and ampicillin but not for chloramphenicol the MICs of each of the three antibiotics increased when group b streptococci were assayed these data indicate that persistence of a positive SC may be related to large initial concentrations of bacteria the relative resistance in vitro of large inocula possibly contributes to this persistence these observations are also consistent with the hypothesis that lactic acid dehydrogenase activity in CSF fluid is derived from bacteria
1054,intrauterine reanimation means the removal of acute maternal or fetal distress beside of maternal shock traumatic hoaemorrhagic supine SH syndrome all acute distress situation are seen during labour the therapeutical possibilities and premises on the one side the limits and dangers on the other are discussed there are the NC of position in bed infusion of low molecular dextrane o breathing buffering of the mother infusion of vasodilatators and betastimulators to the mother the main therapeutical principle for intrauterine reanimation are change of side position and betastimulator therapy in case of disturbances in fetomaternal respiration because of an acute uteroplacental insufficiency or a cord complication as to an own patient group with intrauterine reanimation with the betastimulator partusisten in deliveries with CTG signs of fetal distress in the first stage of labour there is shown that threatened fetal distress because of uterine hyperactivity and cord complication is successfully treated by tocolysis in case of chronic placental insufficiency there is no therapeutical success by intra partum tocolysis in
1055,the aim of the study was to assess the oral health of a group of children and to compare the findings with the results from an investigation performed years earlier in children of the same age and living in the same area the material consisted of randomly selected yearold children the study included examination of caries and the state of the gingival conditions enamel hypoplasia and opacities supragingival calculus and extrinsic stains determinations were also made of the rate of secretion ph and buffer effect of stimulated saliva SES data and anamnestic dental data were noted the investigation showed a decrease in caries frequency in the primary teeth but not in the permanent teeth during the fouryearperiod as in the former investigation regression analyses showed a negative correlation between the level of education of the parents and caries indices and that the variation of the GI could be explained by socioeconomic factors in addition a negative correlation was found between the caries index for primary teeth and the rate of secretion of the saliva and the presence of supragingival calculus
1056,healthy pregnant women at term were divided into groups and anaesthetized with either mgkh or mgkg ketamine n for primary caesarean section maternal A-V ketamine plasma levels neonatal ketamine plasma levels umbilical i.a. and UV and blood gases were measured maternal venous ketamine plasma levels in group i exceeded those in group ii by sec after i.t. and at the time of delivery respectively independent of the dose used the plasma levels of ketamine in the umbilical artery or the umbilical vein were found to be identical in the two CG of newborn infants neonatal blood gases and acid base parameters did not significantly differ between the two groups except for the oxygen tension in group ii which slightly exceeded the po values in GI and min after delivery ph and standard bicarbonate values were found to be higher and min in both CG compared to ph and standard bicarbonate C2 in a group of newborns delivered spontaneouslythe results of this study show independent of a low or high ketamine dosage neonatal blood concentration of the drug remain low probably due to a placental barrier effect the post partum recovery of the newborns was neither influenced by the ketamine anesthesia itself nor by different drug doses
1057,sleep stages and release patterns for growth hormone gh luteinizing hormone lh and prolactin were evaluated in two subjects during a three week period in which flurazepam mg was administered nightly sleep stages were monitored throughout the placebobaseline drug and placebowithdrawal conditions blood samples were obtained on nights three and four of baseline after two and three weeks of drug administration and following extended drug withdrawal in both subjects flurazepam produced a marked suppression in stages and slow wave sleep which was maintained throughout the drug administration period following withdrawal there was a slight increase in slow wave sleep above baseline levels with all three hormones no clear cut changes were observed in mean nightly output PA and PP frequency from baseline to the drug and the withdrawal conditions thus the decrease in slow wave sleep produced by administering flurazepam mg was not accompanied by any clear cut changes in gh lh or prolactin
1058,human red blood cells hrbc even without prior neuraminidase treatment could form rosettes with human IP blood lymphocytes in vitro the optimum conditions for forming these rosettes were a ph of and a medium with bovine serum Al bsa rosette proportions became much less at a different ph or using lower concentrations of bsa or replacing bsa with foetal calf sera fcs or human sera rosette formation was also promoted by prior treatment of hrbc or lymphocytes with neuraminidase mixed rosettes of hrbc and sheep red blood cells srbc showed that hrbc receptors were detectable only on lymphocytes that possessed srbc receptors suggesting that hrbc rosetteforming cells were probably thymusderived t cells next the properties of human red blood cell hrbc and sheep red blood cell srbc rosetteforming cells were investigated by comparing the ability of human peripheral blood lymphocytes to form these two types of rosettes T3 treatment with various GABA reagents hrbc rosettes were relatively more resistant to inhibition with proteolytic agents such as trypsin alphachymotrypsin and pronase antithymocyte serum ats metabolic inhibitors such as sodium azide and dinitrophenol dnp cytochalasin b on further incubation T3 trypsinization the lymphocytes recovered some ability to form srbc rosettes but continued to lose more of their capability to form hrbc rosettes all these results were regarded as circumstantial evidence that the hrbc rosettes might represent a subpopulation of human t lymphocytes
1059,the bacterial protein colicin k when added to CS escherichia coli in the presence of dihexyloxacarbocyanine cuases a doubling in fluorescence of the probe glucose and oxygen cause a decreased fluorescence while anoxia and cyanide cause a rise in fluorescence these results in conjunction with the work of other laboratories suggest that colicin k causes a depolarization of the transmembrane electrical potential fluorescence in the absence of colicin k was relatively independent of kcl nacl and mgcl concentrations below m although colicin k caused rapid efflux of the k analogue rb the fluorescence rise was only partially blocked by m kcl the level of fluorescence caused by the action of colcin k was inversely proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of mgcl over the range of mum to mm this suggests that a nernst electrochemical potential for an anion can counteract a membrane depolarization caused by colcin after colcin k action the fluorescence of the carbocyanine could be further increased by anoxia or cyanide the distribution of the weak base dimethyloxazolidinedione indicated that the ph in the interior of aerobic e coli supplied with lactate was alkaline by unit and unaffected by colicin these results suggest that colicin k does not completely depolarize the membrane potential and does not interfere with the component of membrane energization generated by electron transport colicin k does not act as a cationophore the partial depolarization of the membrane may account for the inhibition of active solute transport caused by colicin k
1060,the contamination of mycoplasma cell S9 by SS proteins originating from culture medium was studied a laidlawii and m arthritidis cells were grown in the presence of caminoacids and the cells were washed with nac by threefold centrifugation total proteins of the washed cells were analysed by sds gel electrophoresis coomassiestained electrophoretic patterns were compared with autoradiographs of the same gels the stained electrophoretic pattern of washed a laidlawii grown without serum was identical with autoradiographs of the same cells grown without or with serum that of washed a laidlawii grown with SS differed from the corresponding autoradiography by the presence of extra protein bands i ii iii and iv with molecular weights of over and respectively the same extra bands were found in stained electrophoretic patterns of washed a a laidlawii cells grown without serum and mixed with serum in the stationary phase b m arthritidis cells as compared with their autoradiographs c serum precipitate the bands iii and iv may be due to the heavy and CS chains of gammaglobulin the band ii might belong to transferrin or to some component of complement acidification of SS to ph brought about fold rise of amount of serum precipitate the number of bands in the electrophoretic DP of the precipitate being also increased stained electrophoretic patterns of cells purified by twofold centrifugation in step sucrose density gradient gcm for a laidlawii and for m arthritidis contained no extra bands and matched CR with their autoradiographs it was concluded that contamination of washed mycoplasma cells by serum proteins is mainly due to coprecipitation of aggregated serum proteins together with cells during centrifugation rather than to adsorption of SS proteins on the cell surface
1061,cell envelope vesicles prepared from halobacterium halobium were loaded with m kcl suspended in m nacl and the loss of k was followed at various temperatures the arrhenius plot of the kefflux rates shows a break at degrees c with higher energy of activation above the break this temperature dependence is consistent with earlier studies of chain motions in liposomes prepared from isolated lipids the efflux of k is more rapid with increasing ph between ph and since these vesicles do not respire under the experimental conditions it was expected that the kefflux data would be related to the passive permeability of the membranes to k the apparent k permeability at degrees c is cm s this value corresponds to a h halflife for retained k in the envelope LDV and to a probably much longer halflife in whole cells the previously observed ability of halobacterium to retain k in the absence of metabolism can thus be explained solely by the permeability characteristics of the CM
1062,the physiochemical properties amino acid composition and profile of the the tryptic peptides for an alkaline subtilopeptidase type pfizer have been determined the enzyme is stable in the ph range from to has a ph optimum of to and is relatively stable for a period of h up to a temperature of c homogeneity was demonstrated by electrophoretic techniques and the mobilities indicated on isoelectric point of the molecular weight was found to be by gel filtration the amino acid composition was found to be ala arg aspgamma glu gly his ile leu lys met phe pro ser thr tyr val a total of CAA residues the enzyme does not contain either disulfide bonds or cysteine and lacks tryptophan as well the nterminal endgroup residue is alanine the cterminal CAA is arginine tryptic hydrolysis of the enzyme produced peptides which were separated by gradient elution on dowex x the CAA composition of each appropriately purified tryptic peptide was established
1063,homogeneous rb liver phosphorylase phosphatase brandt h capulong z l and lee e y c j biol chem also dephosphorylates glycogen synthase b during purification phosphorylase phosphatase and glycogen synthase phosphatase copurified with a constant ratio of activities the two activities comigrated on disc gel electrophoresis both substrates competed with each other for the phosphatase and both phosphatase activities were inhibited by lysine ethyl ester it is concluded that CL phosphorylase phosphatase and GS phosphatase have a common identity and that coordinate regulation of the phosphatasecatalyzed activation of glycogen synthase and inactivation of phosphorylase occurs in vivo this provides a parallel and opposing mechanism to that mediated by adenosine monophosphatedependent protein kinase which coordinately inactivates glycogen synthase and via phosphorylase kinase activates phosphorylase maximal GS phosphatase activity was observed near neutrality mg and glucosep activated the glycogen synthase phosphatase reaction and this activation was phdependent the km for glycogen synthase b was mum
1064,fortyfour infants to days of age with severe obstructive lesions of the aortic arch underwent emergency surgical correction between jan and april the typical clinical presentation was severe congestive heart failure and acidemia resection of an aortic coarctation with EE anastomosis was performed in patients eight per cent died T3 the operation since the mortality rate has been reduced to per cent of patients even though the incidence of major associated cardiac lesions has remained essentially constant per cent from through per cent from through march this suggests that the higher survival rate has resulted from improved surgical techniques and postoperative care the mortality rate in the infants operated upon during the second and third months of life was twice as high as that in those operated upon before the age of month eight patients with type a interrupted aortic arch were operated upon and survived five patients with type b aortic arch were operated upon and survived
1065,isolated working rat NF were made ICM by introducing a oneway aortic ball valve after the ICM period the hearts were perfused in a VA nonworking way for min flow rates glycogen atp and creatinephosphate went down during the time of ischemia whereas tissue lactate accumulated for shorter periods of ischemia these values were normalized but after min of ischemia the NF seemed to be irreversibly damaged there was a leakage of got gpt ldh and cpk from all NF when ischemic from to min different factors that might be of importance for the degree of ischemic injury were tested the injury tended to be more severe at higher heart rates addition of adrenaline m resulted in excessive myocardial damage a variation of ph from to did not alter the effects of the ischemic injury one group of rats were injected with adrenaline for weeks to simulate chronic stress when hearts from these rats were made ischemic they were more prone to fail compared to controls the failing hearts on the other hand had a lower leakage of enzymes possibly due to a less severe myocardial damage a high mechanical performance and a normal noradrenaline content of the hearts are key AF for the development of myocardial infarction as indicated by this study
1066,influence of ph was studied on the absorption spectra nm and on the curves of abnormal dispersion of optic rotation nm of the lupine ferrileghemoglobin lb ph range of the existence of the lupine lb native form was determined ph at degrees c it has been shown that not only methydroxy transition which is in a complicated manner connected with the ionization of both ligandbound water and certain amino acid residues of globin but the ionization of a group with pk approximately too in the native molecule produces a heterotropic effect onto the haem complex analysis of the acidic and alkaline denaturation evidences that these processes are cooperative and proceed via several stages pk values and the number of tyrosine residues were determined it has been shown that these CAA moieties are buried in the protein molecule the results are discussed on the basis of a tentative model of the lupine lb spatial suggested by the authors
1067,the procedure for the isolation of the highly AS fraction of sarcoplasmic reticulum from pigeon and dog NF is described the method is based on the partial loading of heart microsomes with calcium and Ox ions and the precipitation of loaded vesicles in sucrose and potassium chloride concentration gradients preparations obtained possess high activity of cadependent atpase and are also able to accumulate up to mumol ca per mg protein purification of sarcoplasmic reticulum CM is accompanied by a decrease in concentration of cytochrome aa and an increase in the content of pphosphoenzyme the basic components in calciumoxalate preparation from hearts are proteins with molecular weights of about cadependent atpase and calciumoxalate preparation from pigeon hearts was used for subsequent purification of cadependent atpase specific activity of purified enzyme from pigeon hearts is mumol pimin per mg protein enzyme activity of purified cadependent atpase is inhibited by egta and is not CS to azide dinitrophenol and ouabain the data obtained demonstrate the similarity of calcium pump systems and cadependent atpases isolated from HR and skeletal muscles
1068,isolated protoplasmic droplets of the alga nitella were investigated with microelectrodes under current clamp conditions the following observations were made long pulses of either polarity yielded almost symmetric currentvoltage relations near the rather small resting potential inside negative the measuring points lay on a straight line corresponding to an apparent surface Rm of komega mean sem n experiments with various pulse programs revealed no mechanism comparable to na inactivation but stressed the electrical symmetry of the droplet with respect to the resting potential changes of the ca in the bathing medium between to mm as well as of the ph between and did not influence the responses replacing k by na or vice versa or exchanging no for acetylglycine or cl was also ineffective these observations are not consistent with a normal excitable surface membrane similar responses are obtained with a rc network which is described and which may have its substrate in histological peculiarities of the protoplasmic droplet
1069,we described earlier the facilitated purifications of the TR and aminopeptidase components present in pronase vosbeck k d chow k f and awad w m jr j biol chem a partially resolved protein mixture left over T3 one of the steps in that procedure was passed through a sephadex g column by this means a component with carboxypeptidase activity was separated from associated serine endopeptidases further purification of this exopeptidase to apparent homogeneity was acheived by refiltration through the same sephadex column and by cmcellulose chromatography a single protein band was observed after acrylamide gel PACE analysis by sedimentation equilibrium using the meniscus SD method gave a molecular weight of this enzyme demonstrates activity against nalphabenzyloxycarbonylglycyllleucine and hippuryldlphenyllactate no activity was found against nalphaacetylltyrosine ethyl ester nalphabenzoyldlargininepnitroanilide or lleucknepnitroanilide the maximum activity lies between ph values of and the enzyme is stable between ph values of and at RT phenanthroline inactivates the enzyme completely whereas edta has no effect of the many cations tested only co ni or zn restores activity to the phenanthrolinetreated enzyme co provided times the native activity the metal in the native protein was found to be zinc these findings are similar to those recorded with bovine pancreatic carboxypeptidase a and suggest the possibility that the present enzyme may ge genetically related to the rat protein as in previously noted examples of homology of three pronase endopeptidases to pancreatic serine enzymes
1070,pulmonary ventilation ve o consumption vo and co production vco were measured continuously on each of turtles pseudemys scripta elegans at degrees c during and for h after heating to degrees c and during and for h after cooling to degrees c in seven of the animals arterial blood was sampled at the three temperature plateaus ventilatory ratios vevo and vevco and metabolic rate adjusted promptly to temperature change stabilizing at values similar to those observed previously in turtles following day or more at each temperature likewise mean blood ph and pco values conformed both in absolute values and in temperaturedependence to data previously obtained from animals exposed to the various temperatures for longer time periods or from turtle blood thermally equilibrated in vitro total plasma co did not NC significantly suggesting that steadystate co exchange prevailed throughout the experiment in accordance with this rvcovo did not change significantly during the degrees c transition however r rose during the degrees c transition suggesting possible hyperventilation at this stage we conclude that the respiratory control of blood acidbase status adjusts rapidly to temperature change in the turtle and its adjustment minimizes disturbance to co balance
1071,the binding of ribonuclease t with guanosine guo and deoxyguanosine dguo was studied in experiments employing ultraviolet difference spectroscopy in the ph range at m ionic strength and degrees c similar experiments were also conducted with psicarboxymethylglutamate ribonuclease t at ph at most ph values the characteristic difference spectrum and association constant were obtained the binding constant for dguo was approximately m and did not significantly vary in the ph range the binding constant for guo increased from ph to was constant between ph and approximately m and decreased at higher ph values the IB of guo and dguo with ribonuclease t could also be distinguished in terms of the wavelength for maximal difference absorbance lambdamax between ph and at higher and lower ph values lambdamax for guo approached that found fr dguo on the other hand the value of the binding constant approximately m and the nature of the difference spectra for guo and dguo IB with lambdamaxcarboxymethylglutamateribonuclease t at ph were MZ these results suggest that the discrete interaction of the guo hydroxyl group with ribonuclease t involves the lambdacarboxylate of glutamate and an imidazolium group at the AS site
1072,male charles river mice divided into control or experimental CG received on day either sterile mnahco in per cent saline ph intraperitoneal injection or pteroylglutamic acid mug per body weight similarly buffered to ph and were sacrificed on days and the exp kidneys demonstrated intratubular deposits of pteroylglutamic acid with edema between days and with cortical scarring by day the exp kidneys reached maximal increases in weight per cent on day rna per cent protein per cent on day and dna per cent on day before falling to below control levels on day the control kidneys demonstrated the gradual incremental increases of normal renal growth throughout this period no change in renal size protein rna or dna could be detected in those animals who failed to demonstrate renal tubular damage it is postulated that the response of the kidney to folic acid administration is a reparative response and not a response directed toward accelerated renal growth
1073,ca incorporated in vesicles of sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments srf by diffusion could be released rapidly by changing the ionic environment by dilution from methanesulfonate ms to chloride this ion exchange is considered to make the membrane potential of srf insidenegative much faster PR of cat was also observed upon osmotic change from high to low these responses were very similar to the ca PR from srf after take up using atp but the PR rate was slow in the case of anion exchnage the behavior of k na sucrose and inulin incorporated in srf was followed upon similar treatment these ions and nolecules were not released upon ion exchange but were immediately released by osomtic treatment therefore the ca release upon anion exchange was not due to the bursting of srf but to a direct effect such as a membrane potential change of the srf the SMB of anion such as c and propionate could not followed by the same method because of the large permability of these anions it was also shown that ca release upon ion exchange was not a direct effect of ph change CL microsomes did not show ca PR upon the same treatment as srf
1074,chromatin prepared from liver tissue contains a histonedegrading CEA with a ph optimum of whereas chromatin isolated from purified nuclei is devoid of it the histonedegrading enzyme activity was assayed with radioactively labelled total histones from EA tumor cells among the different subcellular fractions assayed only lysosomes and mitochondria exhibited histonedegrading enzymes a ph optimum around was found for the lysosomal fraction whereas has been found for mitochondria binding studies of frozen and thawed lysosomes or mitochondria to proteinasefree chromatin demonstrate that the proteinase associated with chromatin isolated from frozen tissue originates from damaged mitochondria the protein degradation patterns obtained after acrylamide gel PACE are similar for the chromatinassociated and the mitochondrial proteinase and different from that obtained after incubation with lysosomes the chromatinassociated proteinase as well as the mitochondrial proteinase are strongly inhibited by mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride weak inhibition is found for lysosomal proteinases at ph kallikreintrypsin inhibitor however inhibits lysosomal proteinase activity and has no effect on either chromatinassociated or mitochondrial proteinases the higher template activity of chromatin isolated from a total homogenate compared to chromatin prepared from nuclei may be due to the presence of this histonedegrading CEA
1075,the effects of ph indicators on MICs for atp hydrolysis in the dark and atppi exchange in the dark were examined with chromatophores from rhodospirillum rubrum of thirtyone ph indicators tested eleven metanil yellow dinitrophenol ethyl orange bromocresol green resazurin NR bromthymol blue alphanaphtholphthalein ocresolphthalein phenolphthalein and alizarin yellow g almost completely inhibited the MICs for atp formation and atppi exchange at concentrations of mm and were studied in detail of the eleven ph indicators those other than alphanaptholphthalein ocresolphthalein and phenolphthalein when assayed at appropriate concentrations inhibited atppi exchange but not atp hydrolysis in atppi exchange these eight ph indicators at the concentrations described above were competitive against pi and noncompetitive against atp the remaining three kinds of ph indicators were MK-801 against either pi or atp when assayed at concentrations of the dyes that inhibited both activities the amounts of ph indicators bound with chromatophores were measured no correlation was found between the amounts of the bound dyes and the extents of their inhibition of either atp formation or atppi exchange ethyl orange pka and dinitrophenol pka stimulated atp hydrolysis to the greatest extent the latter dye was hardly bound with chromatophores the stimulatory effects of ph indicators on atp hydrolysis were hardly affected by extraction of quinones from chromatophores most of the ph indicators stimulated both succinatecytochrome c and nadhcytochrome c reductions in the dark the mechanism of uncoupling of the electron transfer system and the phosphorylation system by ph indicators and the mechanism of the coupling are discussed
1076,obligate methylotrophs are divisible into two types on the basis of ultrastructural biochemical characteristics both groups possess a soluble PMS pmsdependent methanol dehydrogenase in addition particulate pmsdependent methanol dehydrogenase and pmsindependent methanol oxidase have been found in the type i membrane group a procedure was developed for the crystallization of methanol dehydrogenase from the soluble fraction of the type ii obligate methylotroph methylosinus sporium this is the first report of a crystalline methanol dehydrogenase from a methylotrophic bacterium the crystallized enzyme is homogeneous as judged by ultracentrifugation and by acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of an QA phenazine or phenazinium compound and an activator ammonium compound the crystallized enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of primary alcohols and formaldehyde secondary tertiary and aromatic alcohols were not oxidized the molecular weight of the enzyme as estimated by gel filtration is approximately and as estimated by sedimentation equilibrium analysis it is the sedimentation constant sw is the S1 size determined by sodium dodecyl sulfategel PACE is approximately the amino acid composition and spectral properties of the enzyme are also presented antisera prepared against the crystalline enzyme are nonspecific they crossreacted and inhibited isofunctional enzymes from other obligate methylotrophic bacteria
1077,six apparently healthy young males years of age lived in a specially designed laboratory for a week span in normal air followed by weeks in a co atmosphere and thereafter week again in normal air room temperature was degrees c degrees c relative hygrometry with respect to socioecologic time clues and cues the subjects were not isolated the subjects social synchronization was altered only by the shiftwork schedule lighton lightoff on normal days every other day each subject had a h night task located between and once a week during hrs saturday and sunday a set of physiologic variables was documented every hrs in order to study their circadian changes oral temperature peak expiratory flow GS arterial blood pressure tempo and urinary ph volume and potassium excretion as far as rhythms are detectable cosinor method the most striking result is that both rhythm acrophases and amplitudes do not show any statistically significant changes when comparing either nightwork versus daywork andor normal air versus air with co both hrs of nightwork every other day and an unusual amount of co do not alter the parameters characterizing the circadian rhythms considered the absence of desynchronization during nightwork could be related to the speed of rotation in the shiftwork the short duration of nightwork and the youth of the subjects
1078,reaction of phenylglyoxal with aspartate transcarbamylase and its isolated catalytic S1 results in complete loss of enzymatic activity this modification reaction is markedly influenced by ph and is partially reversible upon dialysis carbamyl phosphate or carbamyl phosphate with succinate partially protect the catalytic subunit and the native enzyme from inactivation by phenylglyoxal in the native enzyme CR protection from inactivation is afforded by nphosphonacetyllaspartate the decrease in enzymatic activity correlates with the modification of arginine residues on each aspartate transcarbamylase molecule ie arginine per catalytic site the data suggest that the essential Arg is involved in the binding of carbamyl phosphate to the enzyme reaction of the single thiol on the catalytic chain with chloromercurinitrophenol does not prevent subsequent reaction with phenylglyoxal if nphosphonacetyllaspartate is used to protect the active site we find that phenylglyoxal also causes the loss of activation of atp and inhibition by ctp the rate of loss of heterotropic effects is exactly the same for both nucleotides indicating that the two opposite regulatory effects originate at the same location on the enzyme or are transmitted by the same mechanism between the subunits or both
1079,the modified procedure for rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase pfk purification is worked out utioizing the method of specific elution from deaecellulose in m trisedtaphosphate ph with mm citrate by the latter procedure pfk can be resolved into fractions a b and c which are eluted specifically with m buffer and with m nacl respectively rechromatography of each fraction reveals their interconvertibility the S9 are characterized by disc electrophoresis and velocity sedimentation the results of formalinization experiments demonstrate that high concentrations of formaldehyde dissociate pfk u to the s component the presence of the s component in the formalinized S9 evidences against the possibility that the middle component presented at the schlieren patterns of pfk at ph is and artifact of superposition complex profiles of protein distribution observed in different transport experiments are discussed from the point of view of slow equilibrium of oligomers and conformers characteristic to pfk over the ph range from to
1080,as reported in the preceding study the ability of certain AP and adrenolytic agents to inhibit the spontaneous firing of serotonergic ht SN in the dorsal raphe nucleus appeared to be related to adrenergic blocking efficacy however the interaction between adrenergic and serotonergic systems was apparently indirect in this phase of the T0 we investigated the hypothesis that another transmitter system could mediate this interaction we examined the effects of two GABA CAA transmitters gaba and glycine for possible effects on dorsal raphe cell firing using single cell recording and microiontophoretic techniques in addition the ability of the gaba PTX and the glycine antagonist str to reverse the effects of the AP and alphablocking drugs on dorsal raphe firing was tested both gaba and glycine were found to inhibit raphe cell firing selectively allowing for a possible neurotransmitter function for these amino acids within the dorsal raphe nucleus however picrotoxin but not strychnine was found to reverse the effects of the antipsychotic and alphablocking drugs on raphe firing based on these results we propose that the adrenergic input may influence ht neurons indirectly via a gabaergic interneuron or interposed gaba neuron
1081,many investigations of the regulation of prolactin synthesis and release are based on single plasma prolactin determinations the purpose of the present experiment was to ascertain whether groups of rats ie young or adult male or female animals being either intact gonadectomized or gonadectomized and treated with oestrone differing in age andor endocrine status will react to a single dose of perphenazine by an acute release of pituitary prolactin in proportion to their initial plasma prolactin C2 no consistent relation existed between the classification of the twelve groups of rats into three categories of basal plasma prolactin C2 ie less than greater than ngml and their response to perphenazine even though all groups showed a highly significant increase of plasma prolactin levels the magnitude of the maximum prolactin response at min varied greatly within the groups of one category and thus was not related to the initial prolactin levels the effect of days of oestrone treatment in increasing plasma PRL in gonadectomized animals was greatest in young and adult male rats less in young females and not significant in adult females the results obtained after perphenazine treatment in the latter group made it clear that the effect of oestrogen treatment on prolactin release can be completely blocked by increasing synthesis andor PR of the prolactinrelease inhibiting factor pif since perphenazine induces decrease of pituitary prolactin and a concomitant increase of plasma PRL through lowered pifaction the positive effect of oestrogens on prolactin PR as observed in gonadectomized male and young female rats apparently is caused by a different mode of action the implications of these findings for the regulation of prolactin PR as affected by the endocrine status of the rat is discussed moreover comparison of prolactin lost from the pituitary and gained in the circulation of the experimental animals with amounts of prolactin that were observed to disappear from plasma during the experiment provided suggestive evidence that the capacity to synthesize andor eliminate prolactin T3 a sudden provoked release of the hormone differed among the groups the rates of synthesis by the pituitary of PR from the PIT into the circulation as well as of beta of the hormone from the circulation equally involved in determing actual plasma levels are thought therefore to be far more important for the elucidation of prolactin regulation than single plasma prolactin determinations
1082,intravenous DR relationships were used to correlate neuromuscular paralysis with the effects of fazadinium ah on autonomic mechanisms in anaesthetized cats and rhesus monkeys and with cardiovascular effects in man in cats and monkeys NM paralysis of the twitch responses of the gastrocnemius muscle by fazadinium was accompanied by impairment of the vagally induced bradycardia but cardiovascular disturbances were small blockade of sympathetic mechanisms and SH were only evident with supramaximal doses in man tachycardia was a common occurrence and in some patients hypertension occurred with doses of the drug needed for complete NM paralysis fazadinium was three to four times more potent in rhesus monkeys than in cats and its course of action was considerably longer the potency of the drug in man corresponded more closely to that in cats than in Rh monkeys but its course of action in patients was similar to that in monkeys in man doseresponse curves were constructed for the contractions of the AP muscles elicited by tetanic and single twitch stimuli applied to the corresponding ulnar SN the onset of paralysis of the tetanic contractions T3 the intravenous injection of fazadinium mgkg occurred within two minutes but recovery was slow and about minutes were needed for its completion depression of the simultaneously recorded twitch responses was less marked slower in onset and recovery was slightly more rapid these effects were similar to those obtained with TC mgkg but the action of fazadinium was slightly shorter tetanictension ratios were computed after and per cent recovery from neruomuscular blockade in man these ratios were lower with fazadinium than with tubocurarine and indicated taht tetanic fade was greater and more persistent after fazadinium than T3 TC
1083,the effects of the cardioselective betablocker MET were evaluated under doubleblind conditions in eighteen patients with angina pectoris during an introductory runin period of eight weeks a PL was given singleblindly thereafter two doubleblind crossover periods each of four weeks followed either mg metroprolol or placebo being given tid metoprolol gave a significant reduction in the number of anginal attacks and in nitroglycerin consumption the patients subjective assessments of their daily AP PS also showed a significant improvement compared with the placebo at the end of each period a standardized exercise test was performed in comparison with placebo metoprolol gave a significant increase of total work performed until the appearance of mm stsegment depression and until the end of exercise the heart rate was significantly reduced at rest and during exercise the blood pressure was significantly reduced only during exercise none of the patients reported any severe unwanted effects the complaints reported were mild to moderate and the frequency during metoprolol treatment was even lower than during placebo treatment no signs or symptoms of cardiac failure were seen in any of these patients on any occasion it is concluded that mg metoprolol tid is of benefit in the treatment of angina pectoris but further benefit might be obtained with higher doses
1084,sperm agglutinating antibodies are purified from sera and cervical mucus of women with unexplained causes of infertility which were positive in the fdtest fractionation was performed by affinitychromatography in a batch device and the sperm agglutinating activity controlled by the franklin and dukes test this sperm antibody fraction was determined via crossed immunoelectrophoresis by migration into an antihuman SS containing gel in all cases only one big peak resulted the negative control serum and mucus samples demonstrated no precipitation peaks by absorption studies it was shown that the sperm agglutinating antibodies in sera were igm and in cervical mucus iga the concentration of iga and igm was determined by comparison with standard human iga and igm thus only one serum and one C2 mucus antibody seems to be responsible for agglutination the number of experiments however is still too small for GA conclusions this method is easily and quickly performed and can therefore be used as a routine method for the determination of sperm agglutinating antibodies its application for spermimmobilizing or cytotoxic activity remains to be tested
1085,clinical variables and especially their relation to the ecg have been studied in cases of poisonings by TCA antidepressants tca the mean age of the patients was years amitriptyline poisoning accounted for of the cases and the mean dose ingested was about mg coma was present in patients and on admission had a systolic blood pressure bp below mmhg the systolic bp on admission was significantly lower p less than and the heart rate hr higher p less than than when the patients left the ward apart from an increased hr greater than or equal to beatsmin which was present in of the cases the most characteristic ecg NC was a qrs prolongation greater than or equal to sec this being found in of the cases about the same proportion displayed a qt prolongation and had a prolonged pq time the mean of the qrs times was sec unlike the qt time the qrs time was not correlated to hr statistical analysis of the material with regard to clinical variables dose of tca bp coma duration etc showed that the qrs time was closely related to the severity of poisoning five patients died all of whom already on admission demonstrated advanced ecg changes with arrhythmias and a mean qrs time of sec excluding dibenzepine poisonings cases all fatal the MR was the importance of high initial preparedness for cardiac complications is pointed out as is the value of the qrs time as a guide to the severity of poisoning
1086,the dosage of the whole tryptophan and of the free tryptophan was conducted in normal subjects to establish REF values and in schizophrenic subjects among whom were under treatment and were not the method of dosage is made by spectrofluorimetry by increasing the native fluorescence of tryptophan the results give mean values for the free tryptophan and for the ratio of the free tryptophan to the whole tryptophan values that are higher in the schizophrenics than in the normal subjects used as reference while the whole tryptophan seems to be little modified this increase is more noticeable in the schizophrenics under treatment the limited number of the cases studied does not enable us yet to establish correlations between the increase of the free tryptophan found in some cases and the nature of the schizophrenia its age and its evolutivity or even the clinical response to the treatment however some figures for the free tryptophan being very much higher than the mean value in some schizophrenics suggest ways of research for understanding the pathogenisis of schizophrenia and the mechanisms of the therapeutic action of the psychotropic drugs
1087,T3 lethal irradiation longlived immunologically vigorous chf mice were produced by treatment with syngeneic FL cells or syngeneic P0 or AD spleen cells treatment of lethally irradiated mice with syngeneic or allogeneic P0 thymus cells or allogeneic newborn or AD spleen cells regularly led to fatal secondary disease or graftversushost reactions treatment of the lethally irradiated mice with fetal liver cells regularly yielded longlived immunologically vigorous chimeras the introduction of the fetal liver cells into the irradiated mice appeared to be followed by development of immunological tolerance of the donor cells the findings suggest that tcells at an early stage of differentiation are more susceptible to tolerance induction than are tlymphocytes at later stages of differentiation these investigations turned up a perplexing paradox which suggests that high doses of irradiation may injure the thymic stroma rendering it less capable of supporting certain tcell populations in the peripheral lymphoid tissue alternatively the higher and not the lower dose of irradiation may have eliminated a host cell not readily derived from fetal liver precursors which represents an important helper cell in certain cellmediated immune functions eg graftversushost reactions but which is not important in others eg allograft rejections the higher dose of lethal irradiation did not permit development or maintenance of a population of spleen cells that could initiate graftversushost reactions but did permit the development of a population of donor cells capable of achieving vigorous allograft rejection these observations contribute to understanding of some of the persisting immunodeficiencies that are observed in man after fatal irradiation and bone marrow transplantation these results should suggest better approaches to more effective cellular engineering for correction of immunodeficiency diseases and for treatment of immunodeficiency diseases and of leukemias and HM of man
1088,in day Pr new zealand white rabbits dosed intravenously with hnicotine the hactivity in the uterine fluid was approximately to times greater than that in the plasma at the corresponding times hnicotine itself accounted for most of this radioactivity dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt also accumulated in the uterine luminal fluid of day Pr rabbits but to a lesser extent however nicotine or ddt accumulation did not occur in similarly treated nonpregnant rabbits the radioactivity in the uterine fluid of rabbits treated with cisoniazid salicylic acid barbital AP and caffeine was not different from that in the plasma uterine fluid to plasma radioactivity ratios ranged between and in both day pregnant and nonpregnant rabbits no differences in regard to nicotine metabolism volume of CSD plasma disappearance plasma protein binding or urinary excretion were found between day pregnant and nonpregnant rabbits accumulation of nicotine took place in the uterine luminal fluid of nonpregnant does pretreated with either progesterone or human chorionic gonadotropin but did not occur in does pretreated with estrogen it is possible that the accumulation of NIC in uterine fluid of pregnant does and in human chorionic gonadotropin or progesteronepretreated nonpregnant does is due to the IB of nicotine to TPS uterine fluid proteins
1089,an activator protein necessary for the enzymic hydrolysis of cerebroside sulphate could be partially purified from unfractionated rat liver this activator which is similar to that of human origin proved to be a HS nondialyzable low molecular weight protein with an isoelectric point of its activity could be destroyed by pronase for elucidation of the subcellular localization of the activator rat liver was fractionated by differential centrifugation the intracellular distribution of the cerebroside IDS activator was compared to the distribution patterns of marker enzymes for different cell organelles and found to coincide with the lysosomal arylsulphatase thus indicating a lysosomal localization this was confirmed using highly purified secondary ie ironloaded lysosomes after disruption by osmotic shock these organelles hydrolyzed cerebroside sulphate when incubations were performed under physiological conditions with endogenous as well as exogenous sulphatase a as enzyme T3 subfractionation of the disrupted secondary lysosomes into membrane and lysosol fractions by high speed centrifugation it was found that the activator protein was exclusively associated with the lysosol whereas the acid hydrolases were distributed differently between the two fractions the lysosol was further fractionated by semipreparative electrophoresis on PAGE two protein fractions were obtained a high molecular weight fraction containing the activatorfree acid hydrolases and a low molecular weight fraction containing the enzymefree activator of cerebroside sulphatase the significance of these findings for the hydrolysis of sphingolipids in the lysosomes is discussed
1090,nbenzoyloxyethyl norfenfluramine s was administered to rats by stomach tube at a dose of mg kg of body weight livers of the rats which were given an acute dose of the drug synthesized more triacylglycerol phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine from hglycerol and cpalmitate than did those of control rats the measurements were made by injecting a mixture of the radioactive precursors into the portal veins of anaesthetized rats and freeze clamping a portion of the liver min later diffferent results were obtained after treating rats daily with s for days liver slices from these rats synthesized less triacylglycerol and relatively more phosphatidylinositol plus phosphatidylserine from hglycerol than did those of control rats s treatment depressed the hepatic synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine as measured in vivo T3 intrapotal i.t. of cpalmitate and hglycerol chronic treatment with s also depressed FI and lowered CL weight and body weight of rats fed the b diet the results are discussed in relation to the effects of s on the synthesis of glycerolipids
1091,in contrast to the traditional belief that the popliteal lymph node pln assay of graftversushost gvh reactivity is a local phenomenon this study describes significant systemic components of both donor and host lymphoid cell activity not only are host radiosensitive lymphocytes of systemic origin necessary for the manifestation of normal pln hypertrophy but as few as x parental lymph node cells lncs injected into the hind FP of AD f hybrid rats disseminate widely provoking significant systemic gvh reactions as measured by splenomegaly and distant lymphadenopathy futhermore locally injected donor lncs ultimately engender three forms of att gvh reactivity the dissipation of potentially unlimited gvh reactivity refractoriness of the host to subsequent rechallenge by gvhinducing cells and progressive loss of gvh reactivity in donor lncs when serially transferred to secondary f recipients whether this modulation of the cellmediated immune response is the expression of an antirecognition structure response by the host or the activation of some other immunoregulatory protein it is absent or reduced in splenectomized recipients the data suggest that the SP provides an immunoregulatory microenvironment in which cellmediated immune responses such as the gvh reaction are modulated
1092,biosynthetic lthreonine dehydratase was purified to homogeneous state with yield of total activity from e coli k the cells were disrupted by means of ultra sound nucleic acids and NP were precipitated with protamine sulphate the proteins were fractioned with nhso by gel filtration through sephadex g followed by chromatography on deaecellulose using stepways elution by changing the phvalues the homogenity of the enzyme was shown by polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis in the presence of dodecylsulphate the enzyme consists of equal subunits having a molecular weight about the polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis had shown that the native enzyme consists of a set of oligomeric forms the multiplisity of molecular organization of the enzyme was relfected in complicated kinetic behavior at ph greater than on the plots of initial reaction rate upsilon versus initial substrate concentration s there were four inflexion points two intermediate plateaux the position and deepness of which depended on enzyme concentration kinetic properties of the highly purified enzyme and the enzyme in crude cell extracts at ph and were MZ at ph on the upsilon versus s plots appeared two inflexion points one intermediate plateau the position of which practically did not depend on enzyme concentration in the reaction mixture but strongly depended on the enzyme concentration in the stock solution repeated polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis of several oligomeric forms isolated by the first electrophoresis had shown that oligomeric forms underwent a slow polymerization it is suggested that biosynthetic lthreonine dehydratase from e coli k is a set of multiple oligomeric forms having different kinetic parameters probably each form of the enzyme has a simple kinetics characterized by hyperbolic or sigmoidal shape of upsilon versus s plots the rate of equilibrium between the oligomeric forms is small in comparison with the enzyme reaction velosity that lead to the complex kinetic curves appearing as a result of summing up the kinetics inherent to the individual forms
1093,there is evidence that hypersensitivity of V1 muscle to neurotransmitters contributes to the development of hypertension comparison of the caudal arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats shr and their genetically related kyotowistar NCR knr showed that although there is no difference in membrane potential under unstimulated conditions greater depolarization of the shr vascular muscle cells by norepinephrine occurs at concentrations which cause greater contraction the mechanism for the increased depolarization and resulting increase in contraction appears to be a lower intracellular potassium ion activity in shr vascular muscle cells which results in a lower contribution of potassium gradient to membrane potential experiments to determine the sensitivity of isolated dispersed chick omphalomesenteric vascular muscle cells to neurotransmitters showed remarkably low thresholds to the neutransmitters norepinephrine serotonin and acetylcholine but not potassium chloride the high sensitivity of isolated cells to neurotransmitters suggests that factors in the intact vessel may cause thresholds to be high possibly implying that alterations in a neurotrophic mechanism might be responsible for changes in V1 muscle sensitivity in situ
1094,the role of the ca concentration gradient in atp synthesis and membrane phosphorylation by pi was investigated in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle the pi concentration required to attain of the maximal membrane phosphorylation varies significantly in the ph range of to the optimal being at ph in the ph range of to this concentration of pi was to fold higher in empty LDV than in LDV loaded with calcium phosphate ie having TM ca concentration gradient atp adp and ca inhibit the membrane phosphorylation by pi the inhibition being greater at ph than at ph the ph profile for atp synthesis shows a higher optimum than for membrane phosphorylation the optimum ph for synthesis but not for phosphorylation depends on whether the LDV were previously loaded with calcium phosphate or with calcium Ox addition of ca to the assay medium inhibits the extent of membrane phosphorylation and the rate of atp synthesis to different extents evidence is presented that the rate of membrane phosphorylation by pi is higher than the rate by which the phosphoprotein transfers its pohsphate to adp for the atp synthesis
1095,the effect of sympathetic nerve stimulation ns and injected noradenaline na or isoprenaline iso on pvo vo and pto was studied in isolated canine subcutaneous AT these effects were compared to those produced by mechanical blood flow reduction clamping resting vo measured mumol x min x g when blood flow was reduced by or less there was no significant change of vo reducing blood flow to of control or less by ns caused a parallel reduction in vo while clamping reduced vo significantly less na gave effects similar to those of ns after ns or na there was a period of hyperemia and increased oxygen SE which more than compensated for the decrease in vo during vasoconstriction such a net increase in vo was not produced by clamping control pto averaged mmhg na reduced it by and clamping to the same blood flow level only by p less than thus a mere reduction in blood flow has little effect on pto while blood flow reduction combined with RD of blood flow and an increased oxygen deman can lead to tissue hypoxia
1096,a latex agglutination la method for detection of pneumococcal antigens was evaluated and compared with counterimmunoelectrophoresis cie la was to times more CS than cie for the detection of purified capsular PSs in defined media but only when a or agglutination reaction was interpreted as positive la was much less sensitive than cie with clinical samples in cases of pneumococcal pneumonia antigen was detected in the serum almost twice as often with cie as with la la was positive in six cases of pneumonia where cie was negative however in three of these cases antigen was detected only in undiluted sera which raised some question about the specificity of the result with samples of cerebrospinal fluid csf from patients with pneumococcal meningitis the cie test was positive more frequenlty samples than was la samples moreover antigen was detected in csf by la in only one additional patient than was positive by cie CT there was one falsepositive la reaction among samples of csf from patients without pneumococcal infection although la is a less complicated method than cie it is not a CS test for pneumococcal antigens and would be of little value as a routine diagnostic method
1097,streptococcus sanguis wicky cells strain we developed little or no competence and failed to autolyze in permissive conditions when treated with competence factor cf below ph this lack of activity was directly correlated with the inability of the cells to bind or take up cf at ph values of and on the other hand competent cells bound dsDNA molecules maximally below ph and transformed maximally at ph deoxyribonucleic acid was optimally bound to cells in a deoxyribonucleaseresistant form at ph values between and concomitant with this binding undefined acidsoluble dna fragments appeared in the culture menstrua cf binding and uptake by cells was not only influenced by low ph but also by low temperature at c we cells bound only of the input cf and took up less than into a trypsininsensitive state compared to cells treated at c cells treated with cf at c did not autolyze when transferred to permissive conditions the results presented in this report extend earlier findings that showed that competence development and autolysis are related to the uptake of cf
1098,the isocytochromes c from bakers yeast iso methylated and unmethylated forms and iso have been purified and their stabilities towards denaturants compared to that of horse heart cytochrome c thermal acid and guanidinium hydrochloride denaturations were followed using fluorescence emission of their tryptophan andor the absorbance in the soret region as the physical parameters very few differences could be evidenced among the ferricytochromes investigated in this study insofar as the acid denaturations are concerned this is to be contrasted with the conclusions of the thermal and guanidinium hydrochloride denaturations studies which clearly showed the ferricytochrome from horse HR to be much more stable than those from bakers yeast no appreciable differences could be measured among the methylated and unmethylated forms of iso cytochrome c nor among iso and iso cytochromes from bakers yeast our results suggest that a stabilizing effect of methylation on the tridimensional structure of ferricytochrome c must probably be discarded other possible physiological roles of methylation are suggested taking into account the relative instability of ascomycetess cytochromes as compared to mammalian ones
1099,alcohol oxidase alcohol oxygen oxidoreductase of a thermophilic methanolutilizing yeast hansenula polymorpha dl was isolated in crystalline form this alcohol oxidase of h polymorpha was more SD to heat than was the enzyme of kloeckera sp this difference in heat stability is compatible with the difference in growth temperatures for both yeasts the crystalline alcohol oxidases of both yeast oxidized the lower primary alcohols c to c as well as methanol the apparent km values for the methanol of kloeckera and h polymorpha enzymes were and mm respectively the enzymes could also oxidize formaldehyde to formate and were inactivated by relatively low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide the molecular weight for both enzymes was calculated to be about each enzyme is composed of eight identical subunits molecular weight and contains eight moles of fad as the prosthetic group the nhterminal and coohterminal amino acids of h polymorpha enzyme were identified as alanine and phenylalanine respectively the octameric subunits MM of each enzyme was confirmed by EM which showed an octad aggregate composed of two tetragons face to face
1100,because injuries of the ligaments of the knee joint during years operations have been performed by the authors in order to evaluate the late results all patients have been reexamined to years after the T0 in more than the half of the cases at the least ligament injuries have been operated on patients underwent the T0 within two weeks after the injury and the other patients later on the authors material and results are compared also with the data of the literature in the authors opinion the result of the surgical treatment is not decisively depending on the chosen operative method the early and exact diagnosisforming the basis of the suitable treatmentare of far greater importance the perfect operative technique and the consequent rehabilitation are indispensable requirements of all surgical interventions T3 severe AL injury of the knee joint the surgical MI allowed to or of the injured patients to return to work with stabilized knee in younger patients also sporting may be possible therefore the surgical treatment of the knees which became unstable because of AL injury is absolutely indicated in patients in working age
1101,continuous monitoring of heat denaturation of a mixture of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes at degrees c and ph permits the simultaneous direct ID and quantitation of three isoenzymes the placental isoenzyme the lphenylalaninesensitive intestinal isoenzyme and the liver isoenzyme hepatocytic the isoenzyme that is principally of bone origin cannot be identified as such without the help of other diagnostic aids and the patients medical PH all human tissues contain alkaline phosphatase many organs more than one of the isoenzymes CL ALP phosphatase which constitutes of normal serum alkaline phosphatase activity was measured in the serum of persons with various liver diseases its activity exceeded normal in all types of CL disease in of cases this increase was accompanied by increased gammaglutamyltransferase activity but the quantitative correlationship r was not as good as expected if both enzymes come from the same source and are indices of liver dieases liver alkaline phosphatase activity increases in the blood early in liver disease before most liver tests show abnormalities the other major isoenzyme of normal serum probably represents a mixture of isoenzymes from bone and reticuloendothelial and vascular tissues which all contain the same very heatlabile alkaline phosphatase cord blood and childrens sera contain mostly this very heatlabile isoenzyme
1102,purine nucleotide pyrophosphotransferase was purified to apparent homogeneity from a SC filtrate of streptomyces morookaensis it is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of and its isoelectric point is the enzyme synthesizes purine nucleoside phosphate mono di or tri diphosphates such as pppapp ppapp papp pppgpp ppgpp and pppipp by transferring a pyrophosphoryl group from the position of atp datp and ppapp to the position of purine nucleotides the purified enzyme catalysed the formation of mumol of pppapp and mumol of pppgpp from atp and gtp per min mg protein under the standard conditions the enzyme requires absolutely a divalent cation for activity and optimum ph for the enzyme activity lay above for mg for co and zn from to and for fe from to the following michaelis constants were determined amp mm adp mm gmp mm gdp mm and gtp mm in the case of atp donor the enzyme is inhibited by guanine guanosine dgdp dgtp nbromosuccinimide iodacetate sodium borate and mercuric acetate
1103,conformational EMT of monellin an intensely sweet protein from the berries of dioscoreophyllum cumminsii were studied by the circular dichroism cd probe according to the cd spectra monellin has a low content of the helical structure and a significant amount of the pleated sheet beta conformation the native conformation was found to be sensitive to alkali sodium dodecyl sulfate and guanidinehc but it was SD in acid eg ph as shown by cd and persistence or the disappearance of sweet taste the main chain conformation of the alkalidenatured monellin ph was restored upon acidification ph of the alkaline solutions the tertiary structure however was not completely restroed as indicated by cd in the nm spectral zone although the sweet taste reappeared if the ph of a neutral solution was raised to the cd in the near ultraviolet was significantly altered though the sweet taste persisted this indicates that a slight conformational change did not interfere with the effects on the taste buds while sodium dodecyl sulfate readily disorganized the tertiary structure the main chain was reconstructed by this reagent into a new form of higher helix content than in the native macromolecule reconstruction into a modified conformation of higher helix content was achieved also with ethanol the main chain conformation was not affected by ethanol which produced slight changes in the cd at nm zone and did not abolish the sweet taste
1104,a comparative study is made at degrees c of flashinduced absorption changes around nm attributed to the primary donors of photosystems i and ii and nm photosystem i only in normal chloroplasts and in chloroplasts where o evolution was inhibited by low ph or by tristreatment at ph with untreated chloroplasts the absorption changes around nm are shown to be due to p CT any contribution of the primary donor of PS ii should be in times shorter than mus when chloroplasts are inhibited at the donor side of photosystem ii by low ph an additional absorption change at nm appears with an amplitude which at ph is slightly higher than the signal due to Ox p this additional signal is attributed to the primary donor of PS ii it decays t about mus mainly by back reaction with the primary acceptor and partly by reduction by another electron donor acidwashed chloroplasts resuspended at ph still present the signal due to photosystem ii t about mus this shows that the acid inhibition of the first secondary donor of photosystem ii is irreversible in tristreated chloroplasts absorption changes at nm due to the primary donor of photosystem ii are also observed but to a lesser extent and only after some charge accumulation at the donor side they decay with a halftime of mus
1105,tryptophan was administered to rats under various nutritional conditions fasted for hr fasted and refed with gl or cornoil fasted and administered glycerol intramuscularly and nonfasted the changes in the contents of glycolytic intermediates in the livers indicated that the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ec reaction is inhibited by tryptophan administration in all CG of rats the inversely related changes in the contents of malate and phosphoenolpyruvate were associated with the accumulation of quinolinate in the livers the content of quinolinate which exhibited the halfmaximal effect on the contents of both metabolites was mumole per g CL the rate of incorporation of h from ho into the total hepatic fatty acids was increased about fold by the administration of this amino acid to the fasted rats the enhancement of the rate was closely related to the increase in the citrate content the hyperlipogenesis was also related to the decrease of acetylcoa and the increase of malonylcoa the content of longchain acylcoa was not affected these effects of tryptophan administration on the hepatic fatty acid metabolism were found in all groups of rats the liver content of glycerol phosphate was decreased by tryptophan administration was markedly increased by glycerol injection the injection of glycerol into the control and the tryptophantreated rats produced a marked increase of glycerol phosphate but did not affect the rate of fatty acid synthesis in the livers of either group it may be concluded that in the livers of rats under various nutritional conditions the ST control of HFA synthesis by tryptophan administration is most likely due to the activation of acetylcoenzyme a carboxylase ec by citrate
1106,aldose reductase from calf lens was purified fold the homogeneity of the final preparation was demonstrated by molecular sieve chromatography AUC sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis ouchterlony immunodiffusion and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at three ph values the monomeric nature of the enzyme is suggested by the molecular weight of from both molecular sieve chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfategel electrophoresis with betamercaptoethanol this closely corresponds with a molecular weight of estimated by using calculate physical constants in the svedberg equation the sw was to as determined from ultracentrifuge and SDG data the stokes radius was found to be nm and nm by two different methods the diffusion constant dw is x cms the molecule is nearly spherical as indicated by a frictional ratio ffo the alphahelical content was estimated from circular dichroism data to be and did not NC in the presence of added substrates products and some enzyme inhibitors homotropic cooperative effects were observed as shown by the concave downward curvature of the reciprocal plots
1107,several types of fluorophenylalanine resistant mutants were isolated in one type of mutant dahp synthetase tyr and prephenate dehydrogenase were coordinately derepressed the mutation was linked to arof and tyra and was cis dominant by merodiploid analysis thus confirming that it is an operator constitutive mutation tyroc a second type of mutation showed highly elevated C2 of IMT pathway enzymes which were not repressed by ltyrosine it was unlinked to tyra and arof and was transrecessive in merodiploids these properties were attributed to a mutation in a regulator gene tyrr linked to pyr f that resulted in altered or nonfunctional aporepressor hence tyro tyra and arof constitute an operon regulated by tyrr in a third type of mutation CM pprephenate dehydratase was highly elevated it was not linked to phea was located in the min region of the salmonella chromosome and was recessive to the wild type gene in merodiploids a mutation was therefore indicated in a regulatory gene pher which specified an aporepressor for regulating phea dahp synthetase phe specified by arog was not regulated by pher but was derepressed in one of the tyrr mutants suggesting that as in escherichia coli tyrr may regulate dahp synthetasephe and dahp synthetase tyr with the same aporepressor a novel mutation in chorismate mutase is described
1108,dalphahydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase of r rubrum grown anaerobically in the CS was partially purified and some properties were investigated the enzyme catalyze stoichiometrically the dehydrogenation reaction of dalphahydroxyglutarate into alphaoxoglutarate coupled with the reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol cytochrome c cytochrome c and ferricyanide are ERP as electron acceptors with the crude enzyme but not with the purified one whereas nad and nadp are completely ineffective the enzyme is thought to play a role in the ETS of the organism dalphahydroxyglutarate is virtually the sole substrate for the enzyme the apparent activity against lalphahydroxyglutarate is presumed to be due to contamination of the lisomer sample with the disomer the enzyme shows barely detectable activity against both isomers of malate and virtually no activity against dllactate and glycolate both isomers of malate and Ox which are presumably ATP analogues inhibit the enzyme activity the enzyme is not an inducible enzyme but rather is a constitutive one for r rubrum unlike from the enzyme of pseudomonas putida which is an inducible enzyme for the catabolism of lysine
1109,phospholipase c ec found in the GM of streptomyces hachijoensis was purified about sixtyfold by dialysis and column chromatography on sephadex g the active fraction was separated by isoelectric focusing into two fractions phospholipase ci pi and phospholipase cii pi both purified phospholipases c were homogeneous by ID and were not differentiated as regards antigencity phospholipase ci had maximal activity at ph and the optimal temperature was degree phospholipase ci was stable at degrees for min and was SD at neutral ph the activity of phospholipase ci was inhibited by high concentrations of various detergents such as triton x sodium cholate sds and was also inhibited by ca ba al and edta but was stimulated by mg and ethyl ether the km value of phospholipase ci was mm using phosphatidylcholine as a substrate by the gel filtration procedure the molecular weights of phospholipase ci and ii were both determined to be phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylinositol cardiolipin sphingomyelin and lysophosphatidylcholine were hydrolyzed by phospholipase ci but phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine were hydrolyzed with difficulty under the same conditions phospholipase ci also hydrolyzed phosphatidic acid
1110,the fluorescence and excitation spectra of luliberin luteinizing hormonereleasing factor in m AQ ammonium acetate are identical in shape to those of nacetyltryptophan NH and are related to the indole side chain of trp the change of fluoresecence intensity of luliberin with ph was measured in the range of ph the increase of ph from to is followed by about increase in FI due to deprotonation of the imidazolium side chain of his the fluorimetric titration curve in this ph region reveals a pk value for his of increasing of ph from to results in about quenching of the fluorescence due to electronic SE transfer from the excited indole of trp to the phenolate side chain of tyr the pk value of tyr obtained independently from the fluorimetric and photometric titrations indicate that at ph luliberin contains only one charged residue arg which is in close vicinity to both his and tyr the side chains of his tyr and arg presumably form a combined unit which may play an active role in the hormone action trp is at a maximal distance from this unit and may thus act as an independent AS unit
1111,the antibacterial effects of Sp and penicillin g on clinical isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae were studied the concentrations of penicillin g at which the isolates showed drug sensitivity ranged widely from to mugml some of the isolates were resistant to penicillin g sensitivity to spectinomycin was observed at the drug concentrations ranging from to mugml about of the isolates were CS to mugml of Sp and those isolates which were resistant to penicillin g showed good sensitivity to spectinomycin no correlation in sensitivity was noted between the two drugs tests for their bactericidal MICs on bouillon media revealed that the addition of spectinomycin at the concentration of mugml or over produced a marked bactericidal effect in a short time while penicillin g exhibited a bactericidal or bacteriostatic effect depending upon the concentration used a synergistic effect of a penicillin and an aminoglycoside antibiotic was observed in these isolates of n gonorrhoea as was in the isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa where penicillin g and spectinomycin were used in combination a simultaneous addition of both the drugs produced the most marked synergistic effect morphology of n gonorrhoeae cells exposed to either of these drugs was examined under a scanning electron microscope SE to Sp at the level of mugml resulted in almost no morphological change at mugml of the drug however a roughened cell surface a bleblike structure or a state suggesting the loosening of such a bleblike structure was noted the addition of penicillin g at mugml led to an impairment of cell division at one hour of exposure and to cell swelling and lysis with further exposure at mugml of the drug these processes of cell swelling and lysis took place early
1112,in a double blind trial male chronic alcoholic patients were treated with either fenfluramine in a dose of mg or mg daily or with identically prepared placebo tablets patients were interviewed on admission to the trial and then at fourweekly intervals for a period of one year and blood levels of deltaaminolaevulinic acid dehydratase alad and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase gammagt and fenfluramine were determined the efficacy of fenfluramine at the two dose C2 was compared with placebo on the basis of the number of lapses indicated by the clinical PH and also by alterations in the biochemical indices twentyseven patients completed the period of observation there being in each of the three groups those receiving mg fenfluramine daily showed significantly fewer lapses than either of the other two CG p less than on biochemical but not on clinical criteria overall assessment revealed that of the patients receiving the high dose of fenfluramine had a good result during the period of the trial but there were none in the mg group or in those receiving placebo more extensive trials of fenfluramine in the treatment of chronic alcoholism are indicated
1113,this study compared the contractile performance of a canine RA atrial trabecula with that of a macroscopically indistinguishable trabecula isolated from the RVA the heart was removed from nine mongrel puppies weighing kg and placed in krebsringers bicarbonate solution the bathing solution contained only mmoles of ca and was bubbled with a o co gas mixture each atrial trabecula was specially selected from the right atrial appendage histologically these trabeculae showed a remarkable longitudinal orientation of the fibers at lmax the length of the muscle at which DT was maximum under identical conditions of temperature rate of stimulation ionic milieu ph and o and co supply RA atrial trabeculae achieved the same developed and total tensions but in a much shorter time than did ventricular trabeculae in both muscle groups the maximum developed tension averaged about gmm since lo expressed as a fraction of lmax was less in atrial muscle than it was in ventribular muscle we concluded that atrial muscle can be stretched considerably more than can VVI muscle before optimum length is reached at any given initial muscle length the maximum of tension rise for atrial trabeculae amounted to at least twice that for ventricular trabeculae at any given load up to gmm the maximum velocity of shortening of an atrial trabecula was about three to four times that of a ventricular trabecula these results collectively indicate that the contractile performance of the right atrial muscle is in many respects superior to that of the RA ventricle at least under the conditions of these experiments
1114,a peroperative study of blood flow and flow direction was performed in series of patients with occlusive disease of the subclavian i.a. particular attention was focused on the flow variations caused by arm ischaemia and postischaemic hyperaemia and on the effect of injection of a vasodilator into the distal subclavian artery the effect on blood flow and flow direction was measured with the aid of an EMF during arm ischaemia induced by an inflated cuff on the arm the subclavian flow diminished as did the vertebral i.a. flow when it was VA if the vertebral artery flow was anterograde it increased during arm ischaemia the postischaemic hyperaemia caused an increase of the subclavian flow and of reversed vertebral flow if the vertebral flow was anterograde it diminished during the postischaemic hyperaemia similar findings were obtained with intraarterial injection of a vasodilator the large amount of blood flow passing through the vertebral i.a. as well as the flow variations caused by reactive arm hyperaemia emphasize the role of this artery as a collateral vessel to the UL in cases of the subclavian steal phenomenon
1115,the apparent isoelectric points pi in isoelectric focusing if of human pituitary and amniotic fluid prolactin hprl both noniodinated and iodinated were determined unresolved mixtures of PIT hprl isohormones e and f and of at least five isohormones found in amniotic fluid and plasma hprl exhibit an average pi value of transient state ph values observed or previously reported for hprl components range from ph to T3 correction to standard conditions at ph the L1 isohormone hprlf carriers a charge of net protons per molecule the net charge differences among isohormones e f and g are compatible with acquisition or loss of single charged groups per molecular weight this net charge is similar to that of the least prolactinbioactive L1 isohormone of human growth hormone hghb while the hgh with a bioactivity comparable to that of hprl exhibits a net charge of valence units the large isohormones j and h increased net charges by a factor of in direct proportion to their size increments
1116,one of the major diagenetic pathways of organic matter in recent sediments involves the condensation of cellular constituents particularly amino acids and sugars into insoluble melanoidintype polymers these polymers consist mainly of humic and fulvic acids and make up the major part of the organic carbon reservoir in recent sediments we suggest that a similar set of reactions between abiotically formed amino acids and sugars and more generally between aldehydes and amines occurred on a large scale in the prebiotic hydrosphere the rapid formation of this insoluble polymeric material would have removed the bulk of the DOC from the primitive oceans and would thus have prevented the formation of an organic soup melanoidin polymers have several properties which make them attractive hypothetical precursors of contemporary oxidationreduction coenzymes they contain heterocyclic nitrogen compounds similar to the nitrogenous bases they contain a high concentration of stable free radicals and they tend to concentrate those heavy metals which play prominent roles in contemporary enzymic redox processes the prebiotic formation of similar polymers could therefore have provided the starting point for a basic class of biochemical reactions we suggest that the prebiotic scenario involved chemical and protoenzymic reactions at the sedimentocean interface in relatively shallow waters and under conditions not much different from those of the recent environment
1117,tha alphasympathomimetic agonists clonidine naphazoline methoxamine oxymetazoline and phenylephrine were used to further characterize the alphaadrenoceptors mediating the PIE in the isolated papillary muscle of the rb heart the maximal inotropic effects of these amines were compared with the effect of isoprenaline and it was examined whether or not these amines compete for alphaadrenoceptors on the PTC muscle stimulated at hz phenylephrine showed a high affinity pd value and produced the most pronounced alpha of the alphasympathomimetic amines therefore the intrinsic activity of phenylephrine in the presence of prindolol x m was used for comparison with those of the other alphaagonists clonidine caused a PIE the alpha amounted to of that of phenylephrine the affinity was the highest among the amines tested pd value its effect was inhibited by m phentolamine the affinity and the intrinsic activity of naphazoline were slightly lower than those of clonidine methoxamine showed a relatively high intrinsic activity but the lowest affinity oxymetazoline did not cause any positive inotropic effect clonidine naphazoline and oxymetazoline antagonized the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine mediated via the alphaadrenocaptors in the presence of x m prindolol in a competitive manner this observation suggests that these alphasympathomimetic amines compete with phenylephrine for the same receptor site thus the present results provide additional evidence for alphaadrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic actions of sympathomimetic amines in the rabbit PTC muscle
1118,hormonesensitive lipase and cholesterol ester hydrolase of chicken adipose tissue were markedly activated by adenosine monophosphate campdependent protein kinase on the average to occasionally as much as diglyceride and monoglyceride hydrolases were also activated but to a lesser extent to the activation of all four hydrolases was inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor and reversed by the addition of exogenous protein kinase following activation by campdependent protein kinase all four hydrolases were deactivated in a mgdependent reaction and then reactivated to or near initial levels on incubation with camp and mgatp the reversible deactivation is assumed to reflect activity of one or more protein phosphatases the maximum activation obtainable for the four hydrolases decreased when the tissue had been previously exposed to glucagon indicating that the glucagoninduced activation was probably similar to or identical with the activation demonstrated in CF preparations the ph optima for the four hydrolase activities were similar to although the absolute activities and relative degrees of kinase activation differed according to the particular emulsified substrates used the results do not rule out the possibility that all four hydrolase MICs are referable to a single hormonesensitive hydrolase hormonesensitive acyl hydrolases were separated from lipoprotein lipase by heparinsepharose AC lipoprotein lipase was active against TO diolein and mo but not cholesterol oleate incubation of lipoprotein lipase with exogenous protein kinase camp and mgatp had no effect on any of the three hydrolase activities lipoprotein lipase was further purified to homogeneity and used to prepare AS in rabbits the immunoglobin g fraction from these antisera CR inhibited lipoprotein lipase eluted from heparinsepharose columns however the hormonesensitive hydrolase activities not retained on heparinsepharose affinity chromatography were not inhibited by antilipoprotein lipase immunoglobin g and antilopoprotein lipase immunoglobin g did not affect the activation process in crude fractions thus hormonesensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase functionally distinct enzymes have been physically resolved and immunochemically distinguished apparently lipoprotein lipase activity is not regulated at least directly by campdependent protein kinase
1119,the intensely chromophoric intramolecular coordination complex formed between arsanilazotyrosine and the active site zinc atom of azocarboxypeptidase a johansen j t vallee b l proc nat acad sci usa is a spectrokinetic probe of catalytic events the interconversion of the azotyrzn complex and its constituents is measured by stoppedflow ph and temperaturejump methods the rate of interconversion sec is orders of magnitude faster than that of the catalytic step itself about sec rapidly turned over peptide and ester substrates disrupt the azotyrzn complex before hydrolysis occurs as a consequence formation of azotyr substrate IB and catalysis can all be monitored while catalysis is actually in progress the results of these dynamic studies specify a course of catalytic events different from those postulated based on xray structure analysis if azotyr is displaced the direction is opposite to the inward movement postulated on the basis of xray studies and is not unique to induction by substrates since rapid changes in ph also result in analogous spectral changes azotyr CP has all the features which are essential for mechanistic studies it is enzymatically active the spectra of the metal complex differ characteristically from those of its constituents it responds dynamically to environmental factors and the response time of the probe itself is much more rapid than is required for the measurement of the catalytic step these combined kinetic and spectral properties of the metal complex render it a powerful spectrokinetic probe to visualize and discern microscopic details of the catalytic process
1120,pretreatment with RES or mgkg hours before the experiment reduced the norepinephrine ne levels in the medial muscle of the CNM to approximately of the control values under these exp conditions the responses to postganglionic nerve stimulation were not abolished reaching up to of the maximum development of tension to exogenous sympathomimetic amines both in vivo and in vitro in contrast to the responses to nerve stimulation obtained in normal nictitating membranes the residual responses to nerve stimulation obtained after pretreatment with RES were not blocked by phentolamine and mum or by mum phenoxybenzamine the effectiveness of phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine in blocking responses to exogenous ne was the same when the normal nictitating membrane was compared to the smooth muscle obtained from cats pretreated with reserpine the residual responses to nerve stimulation were reduced when the calcium concentration in the medium was decreased to mm these residual responses were abolished in the presence of tetrodotoxin scopolamine mum did not reduce the residual responses to nerve stimulation while it antagonized the responses to exogenous acetylcholine indicating that a ACh mechanism is not involved in this phenomenon adenosine triphosphate atp and adenosine diphosphosphate adp behaved as agonists on the smooth muscle of the normal and of the reserpinepretreated nictitating membrane and the responses to atp were not blocked by phentolamine it is concluded that the residual responses to nerve stimulation obtained after pretreatment with reserpine could be due to the release of a transmitter different from ne the possibility that atp or adp might be involved in these residual responses to nerve stimulation is discussed
1121,effects of the denaturants urea and guanidinehcl on the sweettasting protein monellin have been studied the ph at which monellin is initially treated with denaturant is an important factor in PR of sweetness but the ph maintained during subsequent removal of denaturant by dialysis has no effect on activity REC of sweetness of denaturanttreated monellin is favored when denaturation occurs at acid ph monellin treated with either m guanidinehcl or m urea at acid ph retains all of its sweetness following removal of denaturant but urea treatment at neutral ph leads to some irreversible loss of sweetness monellin precipitates from solution under some conditions during removal of denaturant by dialysis and the precipitated protein is no longer sweet precipitation is least under acid conditions aggregated protein was demonstrated by GFC the single sulfhydryl group of monellin was not demonstrable in the precipitated protein having apparently become oxidized during denaturation and formation of the aggregated protein the data support the hypothesis that the tertiary structure is important in the ability of monellin to elicit a sweet sensation
1122,primary amines react with pentanedione at ph to form enamines nalkylaminopentenones the latter compounds readily regenerate the primary amine at low ph or on treatment with hydroxylamine guanidine and substituted guanidines react with pentanedione to form nsubstituted aminodimethylpyrimidines at a rate which is lower by at least a factor of than the rate of reaction of pentanedione with primary amines selective modification of lysine and arginine side chains in proteins can readily be achieved with pentanedione modification of lysine is favored by reaction at ph or for short reaction times at ph selective modification of Arg is achieved by reaction with pentanedione for long times at ph followed by treatment of the protein with hydroxylamine the extent of modification of lysine and arginine side chains can readily be measured spectrophotometrically modification of lysozyme with pentanedione at ph results in modification of lysine residues and less than arginine residue in hr modification of lysozyme with pentanedione at ph results in modification of lysine residues and Arg residues in hr treatment of this modified protein with hydroxylamine regenerated the modified lysine residues but caused no NC in the modified arginine residues one arginine residue seems to be essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme
1123,the chorontropic response of isolated rabbit atria in normal tyrodes medium increases monotonically with increasing doses of histamine x x m plots of the inverse of response against the inverse of concentration were linear and from these plots were derived values fro the theoretical maximum response at infinite dose and for ph histamine concentration required to evoke a half maximum response alteration of ph by changing hco at a constant pco na and osolality did not appreciably affect the response to histamine in the range ph however at ph below the magnitude of histamine response was reduced at all concentrations of histamine tested in the ph range additions of nahco at constant pco increased the spontaneous rate of rb atria in the absence of histamine however there was little effect of changing ph in this range by altering hco at constant pco when na and osmolaity were kept constant immersion in solutions at phs less than led to decline in spontaneous rate and force contraction it is probable that depression of adenyl cyclase activity rather than a TPS change in ionization of histamine receptor is responsible for a decreased response to histamine at ph
1124,loperamide a new antidiarrheal agent was tested to determine whether its biological activity involves binding to opiate receptor CS loperamide and morphine competitively inhibited hnaloxone binding to homogenates a guineapig brain and MP the kp values obtain in the presence of na were morphine m brain m MP loperamide m brain m myenteric plexus naloxone m BB m myenteric plexus in the absence of na IB a loperamide and morphine to brain homogenate was enhanced while the binding of naloxone was reduced morphine ic m and loperamide ic m inhibited the electrically induced contractions of longitudinal muscle from guineapig ileum and naloxone competitively antagonized these effects the kd value calculated for the interaction of naloxone with binding CS associated with the contracting muscle was between m and m in the mouse hot plate test subcutaneous administration of morphine MED mugmolkg and loperamide minimal effective dose mugmolkg delayed the response to heat stimuli and this effect was completely blocked by prior administration of naloxone in the anesthetixed dog intravenous administration of morphine mugkg and loperamide mugkg enhanced the contractile activity of circular muscle in proximal and distal duodenum distal ileum and proximal colon but DU longitudinal muscle was relaxed these effects were completely reversed by subsequent administration of naloxone it is concluded that loperamide binds to opiate receptor sites and possesses opiate agonist activity both in vivo and in vitro
1125,tyrosine aminotransferase tat induction by glucagon and dexamethasone in the liver of tumorbearing chickens was studied and compared with induction in healthy animals the transplantable tumor was caused by inoculation of cells from a cell line induced by mc avian leukosis virus tat was hardly detectable in RT tissue of control and dexamethasonetreated chickens but it was induced by glucagon to C2 which were significant although very low when compared to those in host liver or the CL of nontumorbearing controls after glucagon treatment dexamethasone failed to induce tat in host liver at am while it significantly indiced tat in the normal CL at the same time of the day similar failure of tat induction was not detectable when glucagon was used instead of dexamethasone furthermore it was found that diurnal variations in basal and dexamethasone or glucagoninduced tat C2 are considerably mitigated in host CL as compared to those observed in the liver of healthy animals the possible reasons for these findings are discussed
1126,ca taken up by sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane fragments srf upon using atp could be released rapidly by changing the anion outside the LDV from methanesulfonate to chloride it is considered that this anion exchange caused depolarization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane similar rapid release of ca taken up by srf was also caused by a change from high to low osmotic pressure probably due to bursting of the membrane on the basis of experiments in which these two types of ca release were discriminated it was concluded that ca bound inside the membrane was released directly by anion exchange depolarization however ca release was not caused by cation exchange SU inhibited these two types of ca release cia taken up in the presence of oxalate could not be released by any treatment used liver microsome fraction also has ca uptake activity however ca was not released upon anion exchange but was released upon oxmotic change these results show that ca PR from srf upon anion exchange is TPS to the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane in conclusion srf membrane retains the ability to respond to the depolarization caused by ion exchange and can PR the accumulated ca
1127,stoicheometries and rates of proton translocation associated with respiratory reduction of no have been measured for spheroplasts of escherichia coli grown anaerobically in the presence of no observed stoicheiometries leads to hno ratio p mitchell chemiosmotic coupling in oxidative and photosynthetic phosphorylation glynn research bodmin were approx for lmalate oxidation and approx for succinate dlactate and glycerol oxidation measurements of the leads to he ratio with formate as the reductant and oxygen or no as the oxidant were complicated by ph changes associated with formate uptake and co formation nevertheless it was possible to conclude that the site of formate oxidation is on the inner aspect of the cytoplasmic membrane that the leads to ho ratio for formate oxidation is approx and that the leads to hno ratio is greater than measurements of the rate of no penetration into osmotically sensitive spheroplasts demonstrated an electrogenic entry of no anion the permeability coefficient for nitrate entry at degrees c was between and cm s the calculated rate of nitrate entry at the concentration typically used for the CA of nitrate reductase ec activity was about of that required to support the observed rate of nitrate reduction by reduced benzyl viologen measurements of the CSD of nitrate between the intracellular and extracellular spaces of a haemless mutant derepressed for nitrate reductase but unable to reduce nitrate by the respiratory chain showed that irrespective of the presence or the absence of added glucose nitrate was not concentrated intracellularly osmoticswelling experiments showed that the rate of diffusion of azid anion across the cytoplasmic membrane is relatively low in comparison with the fast DWI of hydrazoic acid the GABA effect of azide on nitrate reductase was not altered by treatments that modify ph gradients across the cytoplasmic membrane it is concluded that the nitratereducing azidesensitive site of nitrate reductase is located on the outer aspect of the cytoplasmic membrane the consequences of this location for mechanisms of proton translocation driven by nitrate reduction are discussed and lead to the proposal that the nitrate reductase of the CM is vectorial reducing nitrate on the outer aspect of the membrane with h and e that have crossed from the inner aspect of the membrane
1128,the difference spectra of hen and turkey eggwhite lysozymes ec produced by acidification were measured the difference spectra of both lysozymes had peaks at and nm which are characteristic of tryptophyl residues the ph dependence curves of the extinction differences delta eplision at nm and nm for hen lysozyme were identical with the corresponding curves for turkey lysozyme the ph dependence of delta eplision at nm was analyzed assuming that the extinction at nm is due to trp only which interacts with the catalytic carboxyls glu and asp the macroscopic pk values of glu and asp in both lysozymes thus determined were and respectively these values were in excellent agreement with those determined by measuring the ph dependence of the CD band at nm kuramitsu et al j biochem ibid the ph dependence of delta eplision at nm could not be CR explained in terms of the electrostatic effects of the catalytic CG on trp
1129,the transient kinetics of reduction of the nm absorption band in BZ oxidase by ATP at different ph values between and have been studied by stoppedflow techniques and substituent effects on kinetic parameters for the reduction process have been examined using a series of ringsubstituted benzylamine derivatives as the substrates reduction of the enzyme by substrate takes place in two kinetically distinguishable steps with the intermediate formation of an enzymesubstrate complex in which the substrate appears to be covalently bound through its amino group to the prosthetic group of the enzyme possibly in the form of an aminepyridoxal schiffbase the apparent stability of the enzymesubstrate complex shows no obvious dependence on the electronic properties of the amine substrates but is strongly phdependent in a way suggesting that substratebinding involves the nonprotonated amines exclusively and requires the presence of the acid form of an ionizing group in the enzyme with apparent pka of reduction of the enzymatic nm chromophore and release of the aldehyde product of the catalytic process are ratelimited by the same monomolecular reaction step involving the enzymesubstrate complex rate constants for the ratelimiting reaction exhibit no significant dependence on ph between and but correlate with hammett sigmavalues for the ringsubstituted benzylamine derivatives tested yielding a phivalue of
1130,the conversion of proparathyroid hormone proparathormone to parathyroid hormone parathormone by subcellular fractions of the bovine parathyroid has been investigated the identification of the conversion product as parathormone was established by its elution postion during ion exchange chromatography and GF and by partial CAA sequence analysis of its nhterminal region total homogenates and derived subcellular fractions x g pellet x g pellet x g pellet x g pellet and x g supernatant all catalyzed the conversion of exogenous h or cprohormone over of the converting activity was in the particulate fractions the x g particulate fraction contained the highest TPS converting activity the converting activity appeared to be an integral component of the membranes since it could only be partially removed by extraction with triton x the production of PTH by the particulate converting enzyme increased with time and the concentration of enzyme protein the optimum ph range was between and and the enzyme was inactive below ph conversion by the particulate enzyme was inhibited by benzamidine or chloroquine but not by pancreatic TR inhibitor indicating its dissimilarity to trypsin when a mixture of cproparathormone and hparathormone was used as substrate the particulate enzyme did not metabolize the hormone despite over conversion of the prohormone to hormone and other MMP there was a close correlation between the subcellular distribution of converting activity and that of newly formed parathormone found in the membrane fraction these data suggest that the particulate converting activity is that concerned with the formation of PTH in vivo
1131,the isolated perfused working rat heart preparation has been used to study the effects of respiratory acidosis on myocardial metabolism and contractilly NF were perfused with mm gl and uml of insulin in order to enhance metabolsim of gl relative to that of fatty acids after perfusion with krebs bicarbonate medium at ph NF rapidly ceased performing external work and peak left VVI pressure fell by T3 T2 oxygen consumption rate of atp generation and overall glycolytic flux also declined rapidly after about minutes of perfusion the fall of glycolytic flux showed a partial reversal which was largely accounted for by increased lactate production so that glucose oxidation decreased further the reversal of glycoltic flux could be accounted for by partial release of h inhibition of phosphofructokinase by increased tissue C2 of adenosine diphosphate adp adenosine monophosphate amp and p and decreased levels of adenosine triphosphate atp and creatine phosphate the increased proportion of gl uptake converted to lactate together with an increase of the tissue L/P ratio could be accounted for by inhibition of the malateaspartate cycle combined with tissue hypoxia lactate accumulated in the tissue as a result of a decreased permeability of the BPM to lactate decreased oxygen delivery to the myocardium was caused by AA constriction of the coronary vessels in further experiments the CF was regulated by an external pump which delivered fluid at a controlled rate into the aortic cannula above the CAs and the degree of tissue hypoxia was monitored by measuring changes of pyridine nucleotide reduction state by surface fluorescence techniques the effects of acidosis uncomplicated by possible hypoxia were compared directly with those produced by ischemic hypoxia the effects of acidosis under these conditions were similar to those described above and to those produced by ischemia from these and other data it is concluded that the effects of ischemia are caused by a lowering of the intracellular ph which decreases the rate of SE production relative to the rate of energy demand however it is suggested that the primary cause of the decreased peak systolic pressure with either acidosis or ischemia is not a result of a defect of SE metabolism but is due to alteration of the calcium cycle of the HR possible causes of irreversible HF after prolonged ischemia are discussed
1132,the enzyme ctpphosphatidate cytidylyltransferase ec which catalyses formation of cdpdiglyceride from ctp and phosphatidic acid has been studied in rat brain S9 and other tissues improvement as judged by the higher tissue activities obtained in the CA method for this enzyme was achieved through use of phosphatidic acids sonicated in bufferdetergent solution saturated with ether and containing bovine SS Al and use of short incubation times which essentially provided a measure of initial rates the enzyme of rat brain microsomes yielded with dioleolphosphatidic acid as ATP a ph optimum of with maleate buffer and optimal concentrations of mm for mg mm for ctp and mug per ml for phosphatidic acid enzyme activity was mainly located in the x g fraction microsomal with small but significant activity in the x g fraction comparison of activities nanomoles ctp incorporated per milligram protein per minute amongst tissues showed the following order brain CL lung small intestine kidney heart diaphragm skeletal muscle examination of the effect of varying the fatty acid composition in the phosphatidic acids added exogenously gave the following order activities in parentheses stearoyloleoyl oleoylstearoyl dioleoyl palmitoyloleoyl stearoylarachidonoyl arachidonoylstearoyl diarachidonoyl dicaproyl dipalmitoyl and distearoyl the single bis and lysophosphatidic acids tested were inactive as substrates apart from a possible preference for one or more unsaturated fatty acids the transferase enzyme showed no selectivity in respect to the fatty acid CSD of phosphatidic acids
1133,a transports calcium rapidly into rat erythrocytes apparently by an electroneutral exchange for intracellular magnesium and protons when red cells are incubated in the absence of any added divalent cations a transports internal magnesium out of the cells in exchange for extracellular protons magnesium uptake into erythrocytes is produced by a providing the extracellular concentration of this cation exceeds intracellular levels and the ionophore also transports strontium but not barium into red cells a produces a rapid and extensive loss of intracellular potassium from erythrocytes during uptake of calcium or strontium but not magnesium when red cells are incubated in the absence of any exogenous divalent cations a still produces a potassium efflux and this is inhibited completely by small amounts of ethylene glycol bisbetaaminoethyl ethernntetraacetic acid and restored by the addition of calcium in excess of the chelator although edta enhances the extent of magnesium release from erythrocytes incubated with a it prevents the potassium efflux dipyridamole and acetamidisothiocyanostilbenedisulfonic acid which decrease chloride premeability of erythrocytes inhibit the ainduced potassium loss from red cells rutamycin peliomycin venturicidin and ab also inhibit potassium efflux from intact cells incubated with a but this effect is not correlated with their abilities to inhibit various atpases in red cell membrane preparations it is concluded that a does not transport potassium directly across the EA BPM but permits small amounts of endogenous calcium to interact with some membrane component to enhance PK of the cell
1134,immunological tolerance to gross virusspecific transplantation antigens in rats given neonatae transfer of donor lymphoid cells beneath the kidney capsule of syngeneic recipient rats immune or normal donor cells invariably developed a cellmediated immune reaction in kidneys of gvtolerant recipients presumably against gv antigens present on the surface of recipient lymphoid cells in the kidney spleen and lymph node cells from tolerant rats failed to develop a reaction in tolerant recipients but developed a strong reaction to histoincompatible antigens in the kidneys of semisyngeneic tolerant rats the immunologically tolerant state in the rats could be broken by adoptive transfer of SP and lymph node cells from syngeneic rats immunized with gvinduced lymphoma cells immunotherapy of a gvinduced and also a gvinfected methylcholanthreneinduced fibrosarcoma growing in tolerant rats was successful when immune spleen and CL node cells were administered ip days after sc inoculation of x RT cells in the case of the lymphoma and day after inoculation of x tumor cells in the case of the fibrosarcoma
1135,the phdependence of the photooxidation of ltryptophan in the presence of rose bengal and methylene blue has been investigated true initial rate constants were determined in order to circumvent errors due to AA processes photooxidation of glycoamylase i from a niger in the presence of methylene blue or rose bengal resulted in a phdependent loss of enzymic activity which was analogous to the destruction of free ltryptophan during photooxidation the loss of enzymic activity was closely associated with the destruction of tryptophan residues in the enzyme significant protection of both enzymic activity and tryptophanyl residues in the enzyme molecule was achieved by performing the photooxidation in the presence of maltose which is a substrate for the enzyme the tryptophanyl residues of glucoamylase i which had been inactivated by reaction of its carboxylic acid residues with glycine methyl ester in the presence of a watersoluble carbodiimide were also substantially protected by maltose it is concluded that the active centre of glucoamylase i is a cleft lined with tryptophanyl residues that participate in the IB of the substrate one or more carboxylic acid residues are involved in bond cleavage
1136,the mechanism of action of lipoate on frog gastric mucosa was investigated oxalacetate oaa reversed lipoateinhibited qo and qh of chambered mucosas by and respectively pyruvate or gl produced similar effects neither activity was affected by oaa when added after gl pyruvate decanoate butyrate or lipoatepropionateinhibited mucosa lipoatetreated or lipoatepropionatetreated mucosa did not respond to histamine oaa addition prior to histamine restored responsiveness tracer and chromatographic techniques showed that lipoate reduced and Pyr increased oaa formation preincubation of mitochondrial extracts of GM with mm lipoate increased pyruvic dehydrogenase activity pyruvic carboxylase pc activity was primarily in the mitochondrial fraction of the gastric mucosa the pc preparation was shown to have an absolute requirement for coasac contained biotin was not inhibited by lipoate and had an apparent km approximately equal to x m for pyruvate the results suggest that oaa concentration is regulated by pc activity and is one of the factors controlling qo and qh in the frog gastric mucosa
1137,propanidid was used for the induction of anaesthesia at caesarean section in healthy mothers all parturients were considered to have normal placental CF anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide oxygen muscle relaxant and controlled ventilation the patients were tilted laterally with a degrees rubber wedge during the procedure in order to obviate the effects of aortacaval occlusion at the time of delivery arterial blood was drawn from the mother and from the vessels of a double clamped section of UC for bloodgas analysis the results obtained are compared with those previously reported in a similar series anaesthetised with thiopentone gas oxygen and relaxant maternal bloodgas and acidbase levels were similar in the two groups at delivery the clinical status of the infants in the present series as judged by the modified apgar score at minutes after birth was satisfactory umbilical venous and arterial ph values after propanidid were both units p less than less than those following thiopentone and average base deficits were uv and ua meqlitre greater after propanidid p less than mean oxygen C2 in the UC bloods were uv and ua mmhg lower p less than p less than respectively in the propanidid group derived oxygen contents was also significantly less than in the previous thiopentone series mauv and maua gradients were and ph units higher after propanidid than that following thiopentone p less than mean mauv and maua base deficits were and meqlitre greater p less than five patients offered definite evidence of factual recall of whom three experienced pain propanidid therefore appeared to be associated with a greater degree of foetal acidaemia than did thiopentone in addition painful factual recall during surgery was encountered in percent of cases it is concluded that propanidid although theoretically offering advantages over thiopentone to the obstetric anaesthetist in practice did not fulfil this promise
1138,in a previous work the authors showed the value of administering alfatesine in interventions of long duration at a constant rate by using an automatic syringe and by combining it with destromoramide in this new work the authors present an analagous T0 carried out in subjects in which dextromoramide was replaced by fentanyl the automatic syringe used was the braun perfusor iv equipped with a ml syringe containing ml of ct and mg of FE per ml induction was achieved at graduation ml of the mixture having been injected in approximately seconds maintenance of anesthesia was ensured at graduation corresponding to an hourly administration of to ml of the mixture ml of ct and mg of fentanyl the patients were adults of average weight kg who had undergone sometimes major orthopedic surgery of an average duration of mn the results are looked at from the angle of quality of the anesthesia and of the awakening and of the side effects they confirm the nonaccumulation under these conditions of use and these doses of ct used and reveals an analagous behaviour of fentanyl reserves are however made owing to the mode of elimination of fentanyl on the use of such a technique in anuric patients or in renal insufficiency
1139,the chemical modification of lysozyme i has been accomplished with alpha alphadibromopxylenesulfonic acid dbx at five different ph values i was alkylated by dbx at RT degrees c with decrease in enzyme activity the rate of inactivation depended upon the ph at which alkylation was carried out the highest rate was seen at alkaline ph values the lowest at more acidic ph values amino acid analyses showed thattwo lysines and two tryptophan residues had been modified at ph two lysines one tryptophan and one methionine had reacted at ph a histidine residue was bound at ph together with a tryptophan residue at the lower ph values alkylation occurred with a single tryptophan residue each fluorescence and cd data both ruled out the participation of tryptophans or labeling experiments showed that two residues of dbxs were bound per molecule of i at both ph and ph one residue of dbx was bound per molecule of i at the other ph values sedimentation coefficients were characteristic of native lysozyme the stoichiometry of IB and residue modification indicated that intramolecular cross links were established the ph dependence of the crosslinking provides means to measure several allowed intramolecular distances the results presented here are consistent with the existence of side chain motion in lysozyme
1140,the inhition of feeding in rats brought about by amphetamine and fenfluramine was continuously monitored for periods of up to h using a pellet detecting eatometer for rats tested under conditions of food deprivation the two drugs gave rise to distinctive anorexic profiles amphetamine delayed the onset of eating whereas fenfluramine allowed eating to commence normally but brought about an early termination of the initial bout of feeding when the drugs were administrated to rats with free access to food analysis of the meal pattern showed that amphetamine gave rise to a small increase in the IMI while fenfluramine brought about a clear reduction tion in meal size it is suggested that the contrasting modes of action of these drugs represent an effect of amphetamine upon hunger and an action of fenfluramine on satiety this suggestion is in keeping with the proposed mechanisms of action of these drugs amphetamine acting upon a hpothalamic motivational system and fenfluramine acting by means of a postulated 5-HT satiety system use of the continuous monitoring technique has pointed pointed to certain limitations in the assessment of anorexic drug action by means of discrete food sampling periods
1141,in order to determine the effect of acid lumen ph on renal tubular potassium transport cortical collecting tubules were dissected from rabbit kidneys and perfused in vitro when the ph of the perfusate was lowered from to potassium secretion into the tubule lumen decreased by an average of the transepithelial voltage increased from a mean value of mv lumen negative at ph to mv at ph net sodium absorption from the tubule lumen was essentially unchanged mean decrease transepithelial Vc and potassium secretion returned to control values when the ph of the perfusate was raised to alterations in ph of the bath had no comparable effect on the transepithelial voltage whether the bath ph was increased or decreased we conclude that a decrease in the ph of the tubule fluid of itself inhibits AS potassium secretion in this tubule segment providing an additional explanation for the decrease in potassium excretion found in acidosis the negative voltage presumably caused by sodium absorption out of the lumen is increased under these conditions possibly because of reduction of a smaller counterbalancing positive voltage caused by potassium secretion into the lumen
1142,three vinyl monomers m m and m in which lphenylalanine pnitroanilide was acylated with chchconhchncon were synthesized they were copolymerized with a large excess of acrylamide copolymers pam pam and pam and with a C1 excess of acrylic acid copolymers pac pac and pcc in addition m was copolymerized with acrylamide containing mol of the hydrophobic monomer nacrylylnaphthylamine copolymer pamn the rates of the chymotrypsincatalyzed hydrolysis of the nitroanilide groups of m and the various copolymers were determined over a range of ph for some of the systems data were also obtained over a range of ATP concentrations to derive values for vmax and km results obtained with pam were found to be independent of the chain length of the copolymer at ph degrees and with x m enzyme vmax values for m pamk pamn and pac were and x ms while km values were and x respectively with pac the ph activity profile was shifted to higher acidities as compared to the profiles obtained with m and pam the susceptibility of the copolymers to chymotrypsin attack decreases sharply with a decreasing spacing of the lphenylalanine pnitroanilide residue from the backbone of the polymer chains
1143,renal tubular membranes from rat kidneys were prepared and adenylate cyclase activity was measured under basal conditions after stimulation by naf or salmon calcitonin apparent km value of the enzyme for hormonelinked receptor was close to x m the system was sensitive to temperature and ph ph was found to act both on affinity for salmon calcitoninlinked receptor and maximum stimulation suggesting an effect of ph on hormonereceptor binding and on a subsequent step kcl was without effect areas whereas cocl and cacl above mum and mncl above mum inhibited f and salmon calcitoninsensitive adenylate cyclase activities the ca inhibition of the response reflected a fall in maximum stimulation and not a loss of affinity of salmon calcitoninlinked receptor for the enzyme the measurement of salmon calcitoninsensitive adenylate cyclase activity as a CF of atp concentration showed that the hormone increases the maximum velocity of the adenylate cyclase gtp itp and xtp at mum did not modify basal salmon calcitonin and parathyroid hormonesensitive adenylate cyclase MICs basal sCT and f CS adenylate cyclase activities decreased at mg concentrations below mm high concentrations of mg mm led to an inhibition of the f stimulated enzyme salmon calcitoninlinked receptor had a greater affinity for adenylate cyclase than human or porcine calcitoninlinked receptors there was no additive effect of these three calcitonin peptides whereas parathyroid hormone added to sCT increased adenylate cyclase activity thus showing that both hormones bound to different membrane receptors human calcitonin fragments had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity salmon calcitoninstimulated adenylate cyclase activity decreased with the preincubation time this was due to progressive degradation of the hormone and not to the rate of binding to membrane receptors
1144,the effect of acidbase alterations was analyzed using isolated rat hearts perfused at constant coronary perfusion pressure and stimulated to contract at constant rat the amount of shortening in the major axis and its derivative were measured to assess myocardial contractility both the respiratory and metabolic alterations affected the contractile behavior to the same extent in the physiological range studied by us acidosis depresses and alkalosis increases myocardial contraction however acidosis seems to depress contractility more than the enhancement produced by the same change in ph towards the alkalotic side when either amount of shortening or max dldt was plotted as a CF of hydrogen ion acitvity ah a linear correlation was obtained either with pure metabolic or respiratory acidbase induced alterations correlation coefficients higher than p less than our findings suggest that in the range studied by us contraction of the perfused rat HR following acidbase alterations is a linear function of hydrogen ion activity
1145,neonatal infection with mouse thymic virus ta a murine herpes virus produced extensive but temporary necrosis of the thymus which was maximal at to days of age studies of precursor and amplifier cells mediating graftvshost gvh CR of thymocytes spleen cells sc and CL node cells lnc of normal and tainfected mice were made at and weeks of age infection with ta resulting in a profound reduction to in the direct gvh CR of thymocytes at both ages by comparison the capacity of thymocytes to produce synergy when combined with normal lnc was normal at weeks direct gvh reactivity of sc was depressed weeks T3 infection with ta but returned to near normal at weeks direct gvh reactivity of lnc from tainfected mice was normal at and weeks of age but amplifier t cell activity in lnc was markedly depressed at wekks these results demonstrate that ta has highly selective effects upon subpopulations of t cells in thymus and CL node
1146,the enterotoxic material in cellfree growth S9 of klebsiella pneumoniae serotype was purified by sequential UF and gel filtration gf procedures and the fractions were assayed for enterotoxic activity by determining their ability to induce in vivo net water secretion in the rat jejunum wholecell lysates were inactive anaerobic BB SC conditions yielded a fold increase in toxin production over aerobic conditions enterotoxic activity was absent in the um retentate of the broth filtrate but present in both the retentate and filtrate of the um membrane gf of the two um UF fractions through a sephadex g column yielded an active eluate whose potency was increased by or fold in or adjacent to the void volume when subsequently passed through a g column these pools eluted at a kav of between and and were further increased in potency by two or fivefold a second equally potent fraction was also recovered in the Vo of the g eluate of the um filtrate this may represent a CP progressive purification by gf was associated with an increased protein and decreased carbohydrate content of the most active fractions the most AS g eluate of the um retentate had a minimal effective enterotoxic dose of mugml and that of the filtrate was less than mugml heating the active gf eluates to c for min did not abolish enterotoxic activity and lowering the ph to or incubation with either pronase or trypsin had no effect on activity these observations indicate that k pneumoniae HS enterotoxin is probably a single toxin with an apparent molecular weight in the range of the elution characteristics during gf as well as the chemical composition of the most purified enterotoxin fractions indicate that the toxin is not associated with endotoxin
1147,the dihydrofolate synthetase ec responsible for catalyzing the synthesis of dihydrofolic acid from dihydropteroic acid and lglutamic acid was purified about fold from extracts of serratia indica ifo by ammonium sulfate fractionation deaesephadex column chromatography sephadex g GF and deaecellulose column chromatography the enzyme preparation obtained was shown to be homogeneous by deaecellulose column chromatography and ultracentrifugal analysis the sedimentation coefficient of this enzyme was s and the molecular weight was determined to be about by sephadex g the optimum ph for the reaction was the enzymatic reaction required dihydropteroate lglutamate and atp as substrates and mg and k as cofactors gammalglutamyllglutamic acid cannot replace lglutamic acid as the substrate neither pteroic acid nor tetrahydropteroic acid can be used as the ATP atp was partially replaced by itp or gtp the enzyme reaction was inhibited by the addition of ad but not by amp one mole of DHF mole of adp and mole of orthophosphate were produced from each mole of dihydropteroic acid lglutamic acid and atp by the following equation dihydropteroic acid mlglutamic acid matp mg k leads to dihydrofolic acid adp pi these results suggest that the systematic name for the dihydrofolate synthetase is dihydropteroate lglutamate ligase adp
1148,nephrectomized open chested dogs were infused with mlkg body weight of m nacl group i mhcl group ii or m lactic acid group iii pulmonary ventilation was maintained constant in the three CG intracellular ph was calculated with the co method no significant intracellular or extracellular acidbase changes were produced in group i a similar degree of extracellular acidosis was achieved in groups ii and iii in spite of constant arterial pco the pco of mixed CS and femoral vanous blood increased moderately T3 the infusion in CG ii and iii it was calculated that less than half of the hcl acid infused remained in the extracellular space however no significant changes were observed in the acidbase composition of skeletal muscle in either group ii or iii comparison of the cardiac muscle cell acidbase composition of group i with that of groups ii and iii whows that metabolic acidosis of the degree and duration produced in these experiments does not produce appreciable myocardial acidosis
1149,eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were lifethreatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs either phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressants although most patients were receiving several drugs mellaril thioridazine appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular ART one of which was fatal in a year old woman supraventricular ART developed in one patient receiving thorazine chlorpromazine aventyl nortriptyline and elavil amitriptyline each produced left BBB in a year old woman electrocardiographic t and u wave CA were present in most patients the VAs responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with VVI pacing in one the tachyarrhythmias generally subsided within hours after administration of the drugs was stopped five of the eight patients were years of age or younger only one clearly had antecedent HR disease major cardiac arrhythmias are a potential hazard in patients without heart disease who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs a prospective CT is suggested to quantify the risk of cardiac complications to patients receiving phenothiazines or tricyclic ADs
1150,the three purified proteins which are required for microsomal stearylcoa desaturation nadhcytochrome b reductase cytochrome b and desaturase have been combined with egg lecithin or dimyristyl lecithin vesicles to reconstruct a PET electron transport system capable of utilizing nadh and o in the desaturation of stearylcoa such preparations appear to consist of phospholipid vesicles which contain the three proteins bound to the outer surface of the vesicles acylcoa derivatives containing to carbon fatty acyl chains are required for desaturase activity while derivatives containing to carbons are capable of binding to the enzyme shorter chain acylcoa derivatives free coa and free fatty acids do not appear to bind to the enzyme inhibition and analog studies suggest that the methylene chain of stearylcoa assumes an eclipsed gauche conformation at carbon atoms in the enzymesubstrate complex furthermore isotope rate effects obtained with deuterated stearylcoa derivatives indicate that hydrogen removal is the ratelimiting step of desaturation stearylcoa binds to pure liposomes and desaturasecontaining liposomes and it is this form of stearylcoa which appears to be the substrate for desaturase the arrhenius plots of desaturase activity obtained using desaturase bound to egg lecithin liposomes in which the liquid crystalline to crystalline Tm temperature is degrees was linear between and degrees while that obtained using desaturase bound to dimyristyl lecithin liposomes showed a break at degrees coinciding with the liquid crystalline to crystalline phase transition temperature for this lipid the decrease observed in the deuterium isotope rate effect below the transition temperature indicates that a step in the reaction sequence other than hydrogen abstraction becomes ratelimiting when the lipid is in the crystalline state in this system translational diffusion does not emerge as the ratelimiting step the liposomes contained sufficient reductase and cytochrome b so that translational DWI was not ratelimiting
1151,the action of prostaglandin e on IMT hydroxylase activity in adrenal slices of guinea pig was studied the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and was decreased by the incubation of adrenal slices with prostaglandin e at concentrations beyond mug per ml for hours the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase was stimulated by dibutyryl adenosine monophosphate in slices of guinea pig adrenal glands incubation of adrenal slices wtth the combination of pge and dbcamp lead to a tyrosine hydroxylase activity higher than that with pge alone but not as great as dbcamp CT it was suggested that pge inhibited the enzyme activity independently of the cyclic amp level other prostaglandins such as pga and pgb were deficient to the extent that the tyrosine hydroxylase activity was decreased pge inhibited the enzyme activity much to the same extent seen with protein synthesis inhibitors such as cycloheximide and actinomycin d however pge did not influence the incorporation of lleucinec into acid insoluble protein the studies reported here showed that pge inhibited the synthesis of IMT hydroxylase
1152,interaction of usual effectors with acetylcholinesterase ec from bovine erythrocytes was examined under conditions of high ionic strength gamma greater than or equal to detailed kinetic investigation of the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase in the presence of modifiers shows that the effects produced by numerous quaternary nitrogen compounds on the enzyme can be explained on the basis of binding of the effectors to the anionic subsite of the AS center the various kinetic behaviors that are observed are dependent on the relative values of the deacetylation rate constant ak of the complex acetylated enzymemodifier and of the rate constant k defined by see article with respect to the value of the deacetylation rate constant k of the acetylated enzyme if a identical to kk it is shown that interaction of the enzyme with tetraethylammonium pentamethonium hexamethonium and gallamine ions is characterized by a greater than a and k greater than k therefore these modifiers accelerate deacetylation on the other hand inhibition of acetylcholinestase by methylpyridinium dtubocurarine tetranpropylammonium tetranbutylammonium decamethonium and succinylbischoline is consistent with one of the conditions a less than a and k greater than or equal to k or a greater than a and k less than k and inhibition by tetramethylammonium phenyltrimethylammonium hydroxyphenyltriethylammonium nmethylacridinium and bis aminopyridiniumdecane ions agrees with one of the two previous conditions or with see article consequently the effect of these ligands on the deacetylation step is undetermined however the effects of choline chloride thiazinamium methyl sulfate and thioridazine hydrochloride are not entirely consistent with this mechanism but support the existence of a functional peripheral anionic site which is distinct from the anionic subsite of the AS center
1153,a second i.t. of mug poly ri poly rc per mouse at and hours after the first injection stimulated additional peaks of interferon production the dynamics of the process of accumulation and disappearance of interferon was similar to that after a single injection of poly ri poly rc i.t. of the above dose hours T3 the first injection induced no interferon production as it apparently coincided with the refractory state in interferon production after pretreatment of poly ri poly rc with deaedextran the refractory phase occurred in hours inoculation of VEE virus as a second interferon inducer resulted in a repeated stimulation of interferon production both in animals and in tissue culture however interferon titres in this case were low the use of an inactivated virus as a second interferon inducer stimulated interferon production to higher titres iuml than a single injection of deaedextrantreated poly ri poly rc it is possible that a combined use of poly ri poly rc and noninfectious virus as a second interferon inducer eliminates the development of the refractory state
1154,this paper reports the initial progress in a research programme to identify and obtain the relative orientations in solution of the amino acid residues that constitute the combining site of the myeloma protein mopc this protein has a molecular mass of but enzymic digestion yields the fv fragment of molecular mass which still has the combining site IN as judged by the affinity for dinitrophenyl haptens analysis of the esr spectra of a series of dinitrophenyl spin labelled haptens has allowed the dimensions rigidity and polarity profile of the combining site to be determined the combining site is a cleft of overall dimensions nm x nm x nm which has considerable structural rigidity one of these spin labels has also been used to perturb the nmr spectrum of the fv and using difference spectroscopy the mhz proton nmr spectrum of the amino acid residues in and around the combining site has been obtained this spectrum contains only the equivalent of about aromatic and aliphatic protons comparison of this difference spectrum with that obtained using a diamagnetic analogue suggests that any conformational changes on hapten binding are mainly localized to the combining site by the use of nmr difference spectroscopy the protons of the three histidine residues in the fv are observed to titrate with ph and have pka values of about and the histidine resonances with pka values and alter slightly in the presence of haptens and also appear in the spin label difference spectrum and must therefore be in or near to the combining site these are assigned to his h and his l the existence of lanthanide binding sites on the fv necessary for the mapping studies has been demonstrated by measurements of gd iii water relaxation rates in fv solutions and also by the changes in the fv tryptophan fluorescence on addition of gd iii at ph there is one tight binding site for the lanthanides kd approximately mum but in the presence of hapten this is weakened fold with a reciprocal effect on the hapten IB measurements of the gd iii quenching of the esr spectrum of a spin labelled hapten bound to fv indicate that the lanthanide site is ca nm from the nitroxide moiety
1155,CSD patterns of added mercury in raw whole milk after equilibration for min and h at c showed a distribution among acid CS whey proteins fat globule membrane and soluble fat globule membrane of and on the basis of protein content the fat globule membrane had the highest amount of mercury mercury added to milk as mercuric chloride was removed by treatment with thiolated aminoethyl celluloses and reduced human hair in a min treatment and of the mercury was removed by thiosuccinylated aminoethyl cellulose thionitrocarboxyphenylated aminoethyl cellulose and reduced human hair respectively from WM initially containing ppm mercury and equilibrated for h at c prior to treatment after treatment for min and of the mercury was removed by thiosuccinilated aminoethyl cellulose thionitrocarboxyphenylated aminoethyl cellulose and reduced hair respectively however increasing incubation temperature and time prior to treatment decreased the removal efficiencies thiosuccinilated aminoethyl cellulose and reduced human hair showed increasing efficiency directly with ph while thionitrocarboxyphenylated aminoethyl cellulose showed the opposite effect and had higher affinity for mercury at ph than at ph moreover the rate of removal of mercury at c compared to c was much slower the removal of mercury from soluble casein and soluble whey proteins was more efficient than from micellar casein protein lactose content and ph of milk were not changed by the polymer treatments
1156,summarization of the literature shows a strong correlation between dietary fatty acid intake and total lipid concentration in plasma in lactating cows whereas total MF secreted is related to neither of these in the process of plasma triglyceride removal chylomicra and very low density lipoproteins are converted to low density lipoproteins limited kinetic data indicate that the fractional removal rates for chulomicra and very LD lipoproteins are rapid in lactating cows whereas fractional removal of low density lipoproteins is slower resulting in accumulation of the latter in plasma under such conditions low density lipoprotein concentrations of plasma would not be expected to reflect quantitatively the transfer of plasma triglyceride fatty acids to MF quantitative analysis or triglyceride HFA turnover in density less than lipoproteins should delineate the role of plasma lipid transport in milk fat synthesis high fat diets protected from rumen biohydrogenation have proven to be a useful RPA in studying ruminant fat metabolism and may be used more extensively to elucidate the role of cholesterol in plasma lipid transport and the metabolism of essential fatty acids in ruminants
1157,both udpglucuronyltransferase gt and betaglucuronidase betag were assayed in untreated liver microsomes optimum assay conditions were established with rat CL microsomes using pnitrophenol pnp and its glucuronide pnpga at the ph optima of gt and betag the MICs of the two enzymes were compared using microsomes from rats mice pigs cattle and horses with pnp pnpga and phenolphthalein as ATP in the presence of various cofactors and inhibitors at ph and these data disclose pronounced differences with respect to species substrate and other experimental conditions thereby precluding the establishment of general optimum conditions the two enzymes were also assayed under strictly MZ conditions using pnp and pnpga and rat liver microsomes at ph in the presence and absence of udpglucuronate disodium udpga activators atpudpnacetylglucosamine and inhibitors when provided with a PET level of udpga both enzymes proved active under those conditions and a conjugationdeconjugation interplay was indicated the two processes could be selectively and totally inhibited by zn and saccharolactone the results suggest that conjugationdeconjugationreconjugation cycles may be operative in the metabolism of drugs in vivo taking place already at the level of the CL endoplasmic reticulum
1158,cyclic guanosine monophosphate cyclic gmp stimulates nucleic FAS in lymphocytes and has been implicated as the intracellular effector of the actions of mitogenic agents on these cells in the present T0 we examined the specificity of the mitogenic activity of cyclic gmp and of its bromo br derivatives and the effects of the t cell mitogens concanavalin a phytohemagglutinin and staphylococcal entertoxin b seb on the cyclic gmp content and guanylate cyclase activity of mouse splenic lymphocytes cyclic gmp and guanosine modestly increased the incorporation of h thymidine into dna by cultured lymphocytes but were far less ERP than their brguanosine and brgmp exceeded that of brcyclic gmp when tested in the presence and absence of serum in the culture media combined addition of maximal doses of these nucleotides did not give additive stimulatory effects suggesting an action on a common subpopulation of cells and possibly a common mechanism by contrast cyclic amp brcyclic amp bradenosine cholera toxin and prostaglandin e suppressed both basal hthymidine incorporation and stimulation of this parameter by tcell mitogens and the guanine nucleotides rapid effects of concanavalin a phytohemagglutinin seb guanosine gmp brguanosine and brgmp on the cyclic gmp content of murine lymphocytes could not be demonstrated similarly concanavalin a phytohemagglutinin and seb failed to alter guanylate cyclase activity when added directly to cellular homogenates or preincubated with IN cells conversely carbamylcholine rapidly increased lymphocyte cyclic gmp but was not mitogenic these results are consistent with the hypothesis that cyclic gmp and cyclic amp are antagonistic in their influence on lymphocyte mitogenesis however they also demonstrate that related nucleotides are more potent mitogens than cyclic gmp itself and suggest that activation of mu lymphocytes by concanavalin a phytohemagglutinin and seb may not be mediated by rapid increases in cellular cyclic gmp content since high concentrations of exogenous cyclic gmp and related nucleotides must be used to influence dna synthesis the biologic significance of this effect remains uncertain
1159,the alphaadrenergic blocking agent phenoxybenzamine pba was i.v. mug kg min during a Css water diuresis under pentothal anesthesia to six normal dogs six dogs with chronic throacic IVC constriction and ascites caval dogs and seven dogs chronically salt depleted by sodium restriction and furosemide administration in normal dogs urinary sodium excretion increased significantly from sem to muequivmin whereas no increase in sodium excretion was noted in either caval dogs or salt depleted animals after pba in all three CG UV fractional free water clearance and distalsodium load did not NC significantly in normal dogs tubular sodium reabsorption decreased significantly from to whereas no NC was noted in caval or salt depleted dogs blood pressure and renal hemodynamics were not significantly altered by pba administration in any group these data demonstrate a natriuretic effect of alphaadrenergic blockade in normal dogs with the major effect in the water clearing segment of the nephron the absence of any effect in chronic caval or salt depleted dogs suggests that increased alphaadrenergic activity does not play a significant role in the sodium retention of these animals
1160,studies of the rheological properties of hb ss blood indicate that the marked increase in viscosity with deoxygenation is primarily due to cellcell interaction of cells which were not permanently deformed the permanently deformed cells the bottom fraction of cells separated by centrifugation show only a fraction of the increase in viscosity compared to top cells when each was deoxygenated top cells showed a greater degree of morphologic change with deoxygenation compared to bottom cells the viscosity of deoxygenated hb ss blood was disproportionately reduced by the addition of compatible deoxygenated hb aa cells a mixture of hb aa cells and hb ss cells reduced the viscosity of deoxygenated hb ss blood per cent studies of hb ss cells in hypertonic media indicate that hypertonicity per se does not cause sickling normal and hb ss erythrocytes both show identical changes in rheological properties when suspended in hypertonic serum however changes in oxygen saturation due to a decrease in intracellular ph with certain hypertonic media may lead to sickling when hb ss blood is at intermediate po C2 the addition of xray CM to blood results in the changes due to hypertonicity but does not cause sickling of hb ss cells the contrast material lowers the ph of the media and raises intracellular ph
1161,BL adrenalectomy days increased the MAO of the rat heart vas deferens SP superior cervical ganglion and hypothalamus but not that of the rest of the brain kidney and liver experiments were made to determine whether the increased activity was due to neurogenic influences and whether the enhanced activity of monoamine oxidase was intra or extraneuronally located ganglionic blockade with chlorisondamine failed to alter the rise in cardiac MA oxidase likewise SCG MA oxidase was unaffected by surgical denervation hydroxydopamine abolished the increase in MAO-A activity of the vas deferens SP and superior C2 ganglion but failed to alter that of the kidney hypothalamus and the rest of the brain cardiac monoamine oxidase was reduced markedly by hydroxydopamine but the remaining activity was still significantly elevated over the respective control values the data suggest that the increase in organ MAO-A is predominantly of neuronal origin and that this increase is not due to transsynaptic induction
1162,the results of precipitin tests on blood meals of mosquitoes of the kano plain caught by a variety of catching techniques indicate that to gain an accurate overall picture of FF patterns both the indoor and the outdoor biotope must be sampled cdc CS traps operated inside houses and monkswood type CS traps operated under the outside eaves of houses were found to collect larger numbers of blood fed specimens from a wider range of species than battery driven aspirators collecting from natural resting sites the results indicated that mosquito species entered houses to bite man in appreciable numbers in the kisumu area these were anopheles gambiae sl a funestus a pharoensis mansonia uniformia m africana culex antennatus and c univittatus eight mosquito species were found to bite man and domestic animals in the outdoor biotope in large numbers these were a pharoensis a ziemanni m uniformis m africana c antennatus c univittatus aedes circumluteolus and ae ochraceus from an epidemiological point of view species with a narrow range of hosts are most likely to be of importance as vectors of parasitic diseases such as malaria and into this category fall the L1 man biting anophelines a gambiae and a funestus those mosquito species which switch from one group of hosts to another according to local circumstances are most likely to be involved in arbovirus transmission and in this group the following species must be considered a pharoensis a ziemanni m uniformia m africana c antennatus c univittatus and ae circumluteolus
1163,LC of pulmonary resistance and CL was studied in the in situ left lower lobe of the canine lung recirculation of blood through the lobe while the pco of the ventilatory gas was varied resulted in an increase in resistance and a decrease in compliance only when the pulmonary venous ph was greater than alternating sodium bicarbonate and lactic acid infusion while alveolar pco was maintained below mmhg demonstrated the dependence of the hypocapnic response on the acidbase status of the blood perfusing the respiratory airways the increase in resistance and decrease in compliance observed at a pulmonary A-V ph of was comparable to that observed T3 lobar pulmonary artery occlusion varying degrees of hypoxia did not significantly affect bronchomotor tone nor was the BC following lobar pulmonary artery occlusion affected by the hypoxia vagal stimulation superimposed on a stepwise increase in pulmonary venous ph from to resulted in an increase in resistance which paralleled the increase in resistance when pulmonary A-V ph alone was increased compliance was not significantly affected by vagal stimulation at any level of pulmonary venous ph
1164,a method was developed for the calculation of metabolic fluxes through individual enzymatic reactions of Pyr metabolism including the CAC in rat liver mitochondrial incubated at metabolic states between state and state this method is based on the measurement of the specific radioactivities of the products formed from cpyruvate with this procedure the SE balance of mitochondria incubated in the presence of cpyruvate atp bicarbonate and phosphate at different atpadp ratios in the medium was calculated the atpadp ratios were maintained at a steady state with creatine kinase plus creatine as a phosphoryl acceptor the calculations revealed that by adding increasing concentrations of creatine up to mm the SE dissipated by the mitochondria decreased but showed a local maximum at mm creatine omission of bicarbonate from the medium led to a shift of this maximum when energy dissipation was minimal the overall po ratio was maximal the amount of energy dissipated was paralleled by the magnitude of the ph gradient across the inner membrane from these results it was concluded that the recycling of h ions which consists of a passive leakage of h ions into the matrix and an active extrusion of these ions out of this compartment is an important energy dissipating process the h ion recycling is thus one of the processes which give rise to the state respiration in mitochondria
1165,the effects of prostaglandin e e falpha pge pgfalpha isoproterenol epinephrine norepinephrine salbutamol practolol atropine aminophylline and corticosterone on the hypersensitivity to anaphylaxis histamine and serotonin in bordetella pertussistreated mice and propranololtreated mice were investigated female hlasw icr mice gm were injected with pertussis vaccine intravenously days before challenge with antigen histamine or serotonin alternatively instead of pertussis vaccine propranolol was injected intraperitoneally min before histamine challenge test drugs were administered intraperitoneally min before challenge pge and pge at a narrow range of between and mug and epinephrine at mug protected both pertussis and propranololtreated mice isoproterenol mug and aminophilline mug protected betablocked mice but did not protect pertussistreated mice even with very high doses and mug respectively although salbutamol mug did pgfalpha norepinephrine and atropine were not protective at all practolol a beta blocker given intraperitoneally min before histamine neither sensitized normal mice nor changed the effect of isoproterenol or salbutamol in pertussistreated mice corticosterone mgkg reduced the number of deaths from histamine in betablocked mice but not in pertussistreated mice the protective effect is discussed in connection with probable effects of the drugs on intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp C2
1166,the citrate synthase activity of acetobacter xylinum cells grown on glucose was the same as of cells grown on intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle the activity of citrate synthase in extracts is compatible with the overall rate of acetate oxidation in vivo the enzyme was purified fold from sonic extracts and its molecular weight was determined to be by GF it has an optimum activity at ph reaction rates with the purified enzyme were hyperbolic functions of both acetylcoa and oxaloacetate the km for acetylcoa is mum and that for oxaloacetate mum the enzyme is inhibited by atp according to classical kinetic patterns this inhibition is competitive with respect to acetylcoa ki mm and noncompetitive with respect to oxaloacetate it is not affected by changes in ph and ionic strength and is not relieved by an excess of mg ions unlike other gramnegative bacteria the a xylinum enzyme is not inhibited by nadh but is inhibited by high concentrations of nadph the activity of the enzyme varies with energy charge in a manner consistent with its role in energy metabolism it is suggested that the flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle in a xylinum is regulated by modulation of citrate synthase activity in response to the energy state of the cells
1167,the progesteroneinduced purple phosphatase isolated from the uterine flushings of pigs is activated by a variety of reagents that cleave disulfide bonds including mercaptoethanol dithiothreitol lascorbate lcysteine sulfite and cyanide it is inhibited by various mercurials iodoacetamide oiodosobenzoate and hydrogen peroxide thiols increase the TPS phosphatase activity from to about units per mg of enzyme this activation is accompanied by a shift in the extinction maximum to higher energy to yield a protein with a pink coloration following maximum activation there is a gradual decrease in enzyme activity and protein color which is accompanied by loss of Fe2+ from the protein sodium dithionite at mm or higher causes an immediate inhibition of phosphatase activity and bleaching of color and can be used to prepare the ironfree apoprotein the latter can be partially reactivated by fe salts but not by fe the fe restores the pink form of the enzyme with a specific activity of about unitsmg of protein cu also causes some reactivation but other metal ions were ineffective esr studies showed that the pink form of phosphatase contains approximately atom of high spin Fe3+ per molecule it is concluded that the phosphatase requires a free thiol and fe for activity reduction of the iron leads to complete loss of both color and enzyme activity the color change from purple to pink represents disulfide reduction and is not due to reduction of iron
1168,the tissue CSD of the adenylate kinase isozymes in man has been examined using various substrates the isozymes attributable to the ak and ak loci were identified and an additional set of isozymes probably attributable to a third locus was also found this locus has been provisionally designated ak the ak isozymes show activity with either gtp amp or itp amp but do not show activity with atp amp they also differ from the ak and ak isozymes in electrophoretic mobility and from the ak isozymes in being resistant to silver inhibition they are similar in molecular size to the ak isozymes whereas the ak isozymes are apparently larger the ak isozymes evidently correspond to the enzyme nucleosidetriphosphateadenylate kinase somatic cell hybrid studies indicate that the ak locus is not syntenic with that of ak chromosome the ak locus is however probably syntenic with the ak locus on chromosome genetically determined variation of ak has not been seen in a survey of about individuals
1169,the study of the in vitro accumulation of h chlorpromazine that a state of rapid equilibrium was reached for subcellular particles from cortex midbrain and hindbrain of rats this accumulation was not saturable by increasing the concentration of chlorpromazine and the relationship between accumulation and concentration was not modified by temperature preincubation with high concentration of unlabelled chlorpromazine or by lowering the fraction concentration the highest accumulation of radioactivity was seen in the midbrain region and the lowest in the hindbrain in the cortex and midbrain the membrane fraction showed the highest accumulation the effect of ph on the accumulation indicated that a significnat rise was seen between ph and this factor could also be explained in terms of solubility of the drug in CM studies on the metabolic fate of the drug during incubation indicated that there was a fairly rapid breakdown during incubation the highest being seen with mitochondrail fractions and the least with membrane procedures it is concluded that accumulation of chlorpromazine by subcellular fractions in vitro may be associated with solubility in membranes and that the picture may be complicated by the presence of breakdown products
1170,lipopolysaccharides lps of salmonella typhi strains isolated from carriers and patients suffering from typhoid fever were characterised according to their biochemical properties morphological structure and degree of aggregation of complexes all S9 of lps regardless of their origin were morphologically heterogeneous free electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis demonstrated that lps preparations were composed of components possessing different mobilities in electric fields lps of bacterial strains isolated from both carriers and patients split upon reaction in immunoelectrophoresis with specific antiserum rabbit antiserum to salmonella typhi vi bhatnagar and split into anodic and cathodic fractions the anodic fraction reacted similarly as vi antigen lps from salmonella typhi ty yielded only the cathodic fraction typical for o antigen lps from strains which were passaged twice in nutritional medium possessed identical properties as lps from fresh cultures of salmonella typhi electron microscopy revealed that lps appears as long bands rods ellipsoid forms and amorphous material contrary to amorphous material the bands rods and ellipsoid forms possessed threelayer structure
1171,we have studied the toxicity and immune suppression of supralethal total body irradiation rads co at three dose intensities radsmin radsmin and radsmin in intensively supported radiation control animals the ld tn days for these dose intensities is estimated to be and rads respectively a biomodal DP of early median days and late median days deaths was observed corresponding to histopathological evidence of the intestinal and hematopoietic radiation syndromes random donor bone marrow transplants were performed in animals to test immune suppression afforded by rads and rads at dose intensities of either radsmin or radsmin bone marrow cell dose was varied to analyze its effect on engraftment a greater degree of immunosuppression with less toxicity was achieved at the lower dose intensity a minimum dose of x nucleated allogeneic bone marrow cellskg readily obtainable from living donors resulted in a high percentage of engraftment with lethal graftversushost disease following conditioning with rads midplane at radsmin the optimum regimen employed
1172,at degrees c in vitro and mum of triiodothyronine t produced an increase in resting membrane potential rmp of rana pipens sartorius when the ph of the external solution was the rmp was increased by mum t in the presence of and m ouabain but not in m of dinitrophenol small increases in rmp were observed with mum t in solutions with low [Na+]o at ph mum t produced a small transient increase in rmp Rm rm was found to decline gradually during exposure to mum at a ph of treatment with mum t at ph was accompanied by a transient reduction in rm similar transient changes in rm were produced by and mum t at ph of t reduced membrane resistance in isotonic kso and trisbuffered mn mm solutions indicating that t increases PK direct action potentials were studied at ph OS amplitude and rate of rise of the action potential underwent a gradual decrease in the presence of mum t while thresholds remained unchanged thresholds were increased during SE to mum t whereas OS amplitude and rate of rise underwent transient decreases followed by a return toward control levels
1173,extracts of human articular cartilage contain PRs capable of degrading the proteoglycan component of cartilage matrix at neutral and acid ph these enzymes have been partially purified by ion exchange chromotography and characterized by disc PACE inhibition patterns and action of proteoglycan three distinct metalloproteases are described a neutral protease that digests proteoglycan subunit optimally at ph has been purified up to fold it is strongly inhibited by ophenanthroline alphamacroglobulin and egg WG and to a lesser extent by dpenicillamine and edta inhibition by chelating agents is reversed by cobalt zinc and ferrous ions two acid metalloproteases distinct from cathespins b d and f digest proteoglycan subunit at ph and both are inhibited by OP and activity is restored by cobalt zinc or ferrous ions with electron microscopy it was found that cartilage slices were depleted of ruthenium redstaining matrix proteoglycan T3 incubation in vitro with a partially purified cartilage extract at neutral ph sedimentation gel chromatography sodium dodecyl sulfategel electrophoresis and immunodiffusion studies of digests of isolated proteoglycan fraction produced by the partially purified cartilage extract at neutral and acid ph confirmed that the cartilage enzymes act only on the protein component of proteoglycan subunit producing fragments with to chondroitin sulfate chains the link proteins were not digested
1174,PLB which hydrolyzes both the acyl ester bonds of diacylphospholipids diacylhydrolase and the acyl ester bond of monoacylphospholipids or lysophospholipids monoacylhydrolase or lysophospholipase ec was purified from penicillium notatum about fold over the crude extract the final preparation was homogeneous on disc electrophoresis the apparent molecular weight determined by GF on sephadex g was about the isoelectric point was ph the purified enzyme was a glycoprotein the carbohydrate content was approximately consisting of mannose glucose and glucosamine the CAA composition was also determined the ratio of monoacylhydrolase to diacylhydrolase activities was influenced by the PCS state of the substrate in the assay system it was about or in the presence of absence of triton x respectively and the latter value remained constant throughout the purification procedures both enzyme MICs had the same ph optimum and were HL none of the metals tested had any effect on either activity except for fe and fe DFP at relatively high concentrations CR inhibited both enzyme MICs the MM constants km of the enzyme for egg lecithin were about and mm in the absence and presence of triton x respectively the km value for dicaproyllecithin was mm in the absence of triton x using a mixture of cstearoyllecithin and coleoyllecithin in the presence of triton x as a ATP it was found that the p notatum phospholipase b attacked the acyl ester bonds sequentially first the acyl and then acyl groups
1175,three antigens shared by bile and tissues bt bt and bt and one shared by bile and saliva ba were identified in human gallbladder bile by immunodiffusion the former were detected in all bile specimens examined whereas the latter was detected only in half bt was limited in distribution to kidney urine and bile whereas bt and bt were widely distributed mainly in CL lung and bile the antigens were not present in biles of other mammals tested with the exception of ba which was also present in rhesus monkey all antigens were inactivated by pronase had relative electrophoretic mobilities of SS globulins and separated from each other in sephadex g gel filtration and ammonium sulphate fractionation ethanol inactivated bt and precipitated the other antigens bt and ba were relatively resistant to boiling temperature and acid ph whereas bt and bt were susceptible antigens bt and bt were detected in serum of patients with acute hepatitis but not of patients with other diseases or of normal controls
1176,the surface characteristics of residues obtained from several commercial antibiotic products were studied using SEM microscopy the photomicrographs showed the presence of particulates possessing crystalline or amorphous properties with particle sizes ranging from mum to several mum small welldefined granular crystalline particulates seemed to predominate in residues of products which were processed under optimum ph conditions coalescing or aggregating of small crystalline particles mum to form larger masses was interpreted as a sign of instability of the antibiotic most of the penicillin and semisynthetic PCs produced residues that were characterized as amorphous flaky bulky and of no distinct shape such structures were attributed to the drying of gelatinous particulates the possible sources and causes of the occurrence of these particulates are discussed it appears that in many of the products the particulates are productrelated rather than processrelated and subtle degradation may be involved advice is given to practitioners regarding the preparation storage and administration of these products
1177,human umbilical HCS was found to contain both free folate and folate complexed to a highmolecular weight factor the complexed folate was bound to a very high affinity binder and was present in concentrations equivalent to as much as ng of methyltetrahydrofolic acid per ml of serum acidification of the serum caused disassociation of the folatebinder complex released folates were separated from binder by sephadex GF zonal centrifugation through SU gradients or adsorption onto activated charcoal the separated PBF either saturated or unsaturated with folate had a molecular weight of about on sephadex g chromatography IB of hpteroylglutamic acid was rapid and as in the original endogenous folatebinder complex was essentially irreversible at neutral ph the affinity and specificity of the binder were examined by competition experiments using hpteroylglutamic acid and nonradioactive folate derivatives oxidized folates were bound in preference to reduced derivatives but only three to four times more unlabeled methyltetrahydrofolic acid than pteroylglutamic acid was required to produce an equal level of competition the strong affinity for methyltetrahydrofolic acid the main SF suggests that the binder could be part of the mechanism by which the fetus concentrates maternally supplied folate for its growth and development
1178,the modification of alphachymotrysin with phenacyl bromide has been reinvestigated over a wide ph range evidence is presented that indicates that the nature of the phenacylmodified enzymes prepared by this reaction is dependent upon the ph of the reaction medium the phenacyl alphachymotrypsin produced at low ph is most probably the met phenacylsulfonium salt as proposed earlier since it readily undergoes dealkylation using mercaptoethanol however the phenacylenzyme prepared at neutral ph possesses a much reduced enzymatic activity and does not react with mercaptoethanol to regenerate native alphachymotrypsin in addition incubation of the met phenacyl sulfonium enzyme at neutral ph causes a smooth irreversible NC to the new phenacylenzyme as monitored by changes in enzymatic activity susceptibility to dealkylation using mercaptoethanol and ultraviolet difference absorption spectral properties the stoichiometries of both the low and neutral ph modification reactions have been determined using carbonylcphyenacyl bromide to be phenacyl groupenzyme molecule in efforts to obtain information about the nature and mechanism of formation of the phenacyl alphachymotrypsin produced at neutral ph alkylation reactions of modified alphachymotrypsins produced by his functionalization with tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone and by met oxidation to the sulfoxide have been investigated the combined results of these studies have been initially interpreted in terms of a neutral ph phenacyl bromide modification resulting in formation of a new modified enzyme via the met sulfonium salt
1179,sulfite oxidase purified from livers of tungstentreated rats has been used for epr studies of tungsten substituted at the molybdenum site of the enzyme in a fraction of the molecules the epr signal of wv in SO is quite similar to that of mov in its line shape and in its sensitivity to the presence of anions such as phosphate and fluoride hyperfine interaction with a dissociable proton is also observed in both signals the phdependent alteration in line shape exhibited by the mov epr signal of the rat liver enzyme incomplete reduction of the tungsten center at ph is indicated by attenuated signal intensity at this ph the wv signal has g values lower than those of the mov signal has a much broader resonance envelope and is much less readily saturated by increasing MW power kinetic studies on the reduction of the heme and tungsten centers of sulfite oxidase have shown that reduction of demolybdo forms of sulfite oxidase by sulfite is catalyzed by the residual traces of native molybdenumcontaining molecules reduction is accomplished by electron transfer involving intermolecular hemeheme interaction the wv signal is generated only after all the heme centers are reduced the rate and extent of heme reduction at ph are the same as at ph studies on the reoxidation of wv and reduced heme by o and by cytochrome c suggest that the cytochrome b of sulfite oxidase is the site of electron transfer to cytochrome c whereas oxidase activity is the property of the molybdenum center it appears that the tungsten center in sulfite oxidase is incapable of oxidizing sulfite
1180,pulselabeled ribonucleic acid rna was extracted from polysomes of sporulating cells of saccharomyces cerevisiae and characterized in SU gradients and by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis tRNA ribosomal rna and heterodisperse rna presumed to be messenger rna were synthesized during a min pulse at t and t when labeling was performed in sporulation medium adjusted to ph furthermore ribosomal rna was processed into functional ribosomes during the pulse the TPS activity of pulselabeled rna of cells labeled in sporulation medium where the ph was unadjusted at t ph and t ph was to fold lower than rna from cells labeled at ph the low specific activity resulted from a fold reduction in uptake of labeled precursors when the medium ph was greater than however heterodisperse rna ranging from s in size and transfer rna were synthesized during the pulse at t ph but the low specific activity of ribosomal rna prevented a thorough analysis of its synthesis cellular impermeability at t ph resulted in minimal uptake of label and an analysis of pulselabeled transcripts was impossible a comparison of the percantage of polysomal material indicate however that these cells were at least as active in translation as cells pulselabeled at ph
1181,hypotensive effect of dlmandelamidine olmidine ma in combination with some established antihypertensive drugs was studied in conscious normotensive rats the mean blood pressure and HR rate were measured by means of a pressure transducer via a PE tube inserted into the abdominal aorta of rat according to the method described by weeks the results obtained were as follows the hypotensive effects of guanethidine and hydrochlorothiazide were enhanced in combination with ma the hypotensive effect of reserpine was reduced by ma the hypotensive effects of clonidine c propranolol and hydralazine were uneffected by ma on the other hand changes in heart rate induced by reserpine and c were increased by ma however those induced by guanethidine clonidine propranolol and hydralazine were decreased by ma the slight decrease in heart rate induced by hydrochlorothiazide was uneffected by ma in view of our data it is considered important that investigation of the interaction of AHD be done using conscious animals as these drugs will be clinically prescribed
1182,the purpose of the study was to determine optimal ph values for the enzymic activity of the fungi trichothecium roseum and aspergillus niger hydrolyzing nonstarch polysaccharides of barley and disrupting PCW cytolysis of grain the so called cytolytic enzymes the effect of the acidity of the medium on the stability of these enzymes was also investigated in this connection total cytolytic activity i e total activity of the enzymes hydrolyzing nonstarch polysaccharides of PCW of barley and hemicellulase activity of the fungi at different ph values were measured the activity of these enzymes in aqueous extracts from the fungal culture at optimal ph after preincubation was determined at different acidity C2 the optimum of the hemicellulase activity of both fungi was at the optimum of the total cytolytic activity of tr roseum at ph and of asp niger at ph the enzymes of the fungus asp niger showed a far higher acid stability than those of tr roseum
1183,the phosphoprotein phosphatases acting on muscle phosphorylase a was purified from rabbit liver by acid precipitation high speed centrifugation chromatography on deaesephadex a sephadex g and sepharosehistone enzyme activity was recovered in the final step as two distinct peaks tentatively referred to as phosphoprotein phosphatases i and ii each phosphatase showed a single broad band when examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis the molecular weights derived by this method were approximately for phosphoprotein phosphatase i and for phosphoprotein phosphatase ii the s w value for each enzyme was using this value and values for the stokes radii the molecular weight for each enzyme was calculated to be both phosphatases in addition to catalyzing the conversion of phosphorylase a to b also catalyzed the dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase d G1 phosphorylase kinase phosphorylated histone phosphorylated casein and the phosphorylated inhibitory component of troponin tni the relative MICs of the phosphatases with respect to phosphorylase a glycogen synthase d histone and casein remained essentially constant throughout the purification the activities of both phosphatases with different substrates decreased in parallel when they were denatured by incubation at degrees and degrees the km values of phosphoprotein phosphatase i for phosphorylase a histone and casein were lower than the values obtained for phosphoprotein phosphatase ii with glycogen synthase d as ATP each enzyme gave essentially the same km value utilizing either enzyme it was found that activity toward a given substrate was inhibited competitively by each of the alternative substrates the results suggest that phosphoprotein phosphatases i and ii are each active toward all of the substrates tested
1184,television microscopy was used to quantitate the responses of small arteries and veins in the wings of unanesthetized bats to alterations in the inspired concentrations of o and co mean arterial pressure heart rate and the diameters of small arteries mum and veins mum were measured during a min protocol min with an inspiratory gas mixture of o and n control period min with a gas mixture containing o hypoxic period or or co hypercapnic period and min with the original control gas the hypoxic responses were dilatation of arteries and no change in the veins in both innervated and surgically denervated wings hypercapnia resulted in artery dilatation in innervated wings hypercapnia resulted in i.a. dilatation in innervated wings and constriction in denervated wings the veins constricted in both innervated and denervated wings during the hypercapnia period in another series topical application of krebs solutions ph ranging from to to exposed segments of small arteries and veins produced dilatation of both vessels with decreasing ph artery dilatation during hypoxia and vein constriction during hypercapnia involve nonneural mechanisms while both a neural stimulus for dilatation and a nonneural stimulus for constriction are components in the response of innervated arteries to hypercapnia the nonneural CS- for i.a. and vein constriction during hypercapnia is not a local decrease in ph
1185,the ventilatory responses to transient and steadystate hypoxia were measured in ten patients with hepatic cirrhosis and in ten healthy control subjects successive measurements of these responses were also obtained in six goats before and after the exp production of liver failure changes in the effect of steadystate hypoxia on the VR to hypercapnia were evaluated by successive studies in another goat in spite of a respiratory alkalosis during liver failure the response to transient hypoxia was greater in the patients than in the control subjects this response was increased after the onset of liver failure in all the goats in healthy humans and goats the responses to transient and steadystate hypoxia were similar in magnitude during CL failure there was a disparity between the size of these responses since the ventilatory increment evoked by steadystate hypoxia was unchanged in spite of the increase in response to transient hypoxia steadystate hypoxia consistently enhanced the ventilatory response to hypercapnia in a healthy goat but frequently depressed the response to hypercapnia during liver failure the findings suggest that CL failure heightens the sensitivity of the IP chemoreceptors to the hypoxic stimulus but may increase the tendency of the medullary centres to become depressed in hypoxia
1186,various immunological parameters were measured in serum ME fluid mef and lymphocytes from peripheral blood and mef of infants with acute otitis media due to s pneumoniae or h influenzae approximately half of patients had ige TPS antibody to the infecting bacterium as determined by the indirect fluorescent antibody ifa technique seventyone percent of these ige positive patients had ige specific antibody in the mef total ige concentration was found to be from an average of to times higher in the mef when compared to the simultaneously drawn SS in addition antibody to pneumococcal capsular PSs and to pneumococcal ccarbohydrate was demonstrated in the mef by radioimmunoassay when mef specific antibody was compared to serum antibody it appeared that antibody to ccarbohydrate was more concentrated in the mef that this antibody was of the ige class was suggested by ifa but not conclusively proven evidence exists that conditions for enhanced ige synthesis is concomitantly associated with a decrease in tcell activity tcell function in mef derived lymphocytes as determined by rosette formation and by phytohemagglutinin pha stimulation was approximately onetenth that of the peripheral blood lymphocytes however that tcells may participate in the immune response to PSs was suggested by the observation that polysaccharide stimulated peripheral BL from infants immunized with octavalent pneumococcal capsular vaccine underwent protein synthesis two to three times that of the pha stimulated cells the clinical significance of this finding as well as the nature of the cell responsible for the increased protein synthesis remains to be established it is hypothesized that acute otitis media results from local synthesis of bacteria specific ige antibody which is enhanced by a paucity of local tcell activity
1187,cardiovascular effects of delta and deltatetrahydrocannabinol thc were studied after systemic intravenous administration and intraarterial administration into a perfused vascular bed in the urethaneanesthetized rat intravenous administration of delta and deltathc produced doserelated transient increases in blood pressure followed by more prolonged hypotensive responses and bradycardia intraarterial administration of delta and deltathc into the perfused hindquarters of the rat produced an increase in perfusion pressure indicative of vasoconstriction the vasoconstrictor response to the CBs corresponded temporally to a similar response produced by ia norepinephrine and was in contrast to the more prolonged vasoconstrictor responses produced by vasopressin phentolamine in a dose which reduced the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine by significantly reduced the response to ia deltathc while having no effect on the actions of ia vasopressin it was demonstrated that reserpine pretreatment significantly reduced vasoconstrictor actions of ia tyramine and deltathc but did not alter the responses to norepinephrine these data suggest that delta and deltathc have peripheral vasoconstrictor activity in the rat which may be mediated in part through a tyraminelike action on adrenergic nerve terminals
1188,the mutations in hemoglobin nancy betahc tyr leads to asp and hemoglobin cochinportalroyal betahc his leads to arg involve residues which are thought to be essential for the full expression of allosteric action in hemoglobin relative to the structure of deoxyhemoglobin a our xray T0 of deoxyhemoglobin nancy shows severe disordering of the beta chain coohterminal tetrapeptide and a possible movement of the beta heme iron atom toward the plane of the porphyrin ring these structural perturbations result in a high P50 reduced bohr effect and lack of cooperatively in hemoglobin nancy in the presence of Ins hexaphosphate ihp the hill constant for hemoglobin nancy increases from to but relative to its action on hemoglobin a ihp is much less effective in reducing the P50 and in increasing the bohr effect of hemoglobin nancy this indicates that ihp does not influence the r in equilibrium t equilibrium as much in hemoglobin nancy as in hemoglobin a and this probably is due to the disordering of his beta which is known to be part of the ihp binding site ihp is also known to produce C1 changes in the absorption spectrum of methemoglobin a but we find that it has no effect on the spectrum of methemoglobin nancy in contrast to the large structural changes in deoxyhemoglobin nancy the structure of deoxyhemoglobin cochinportroyal differs from deoxyhemoglobin a only in the position of the side chain of residue beta the intrasubunit salt bridge between his beta and asp beta in deoxyhemoglobin a is lost in deoxyhemoglobin cochinportalroyal with the guanidinium ion of arg beta floating freely in solution this small difference in structure results in a reduced bohr effect but does not cause a NC in the hill coefficient the response to diphosphoglycerate or the oxygen affinity at physiological ph
1189,the presence of ALP phosphatase ec activity has been demonstrated in nuclei of RVP this enzyme activity remained T3 washing of isolated nuclei with triton x an acid phosphatase initially present with the nuclear fraction was removed by this treatment the nuclear alkaline phosphatase examined by utilizing pnitrophenyl phosphate as ATP had a ph optimum of and a broad substrate specificity pnitrophenyl phosphate greater than phosphothreonine greater than betaglycerophosphate greater than phosphoserine the nuclear phosphatase was CS to denaturation by heat or urea treatments and was also inhibited by pi lphenylalanine homoarginine dithiothreitol and edta the edtainhibited enzyme was maximally reactivated by zn although mg or ca were also effective at somewhat higher concentrations orchiectomy of AD rats resulted in an increase in the nuclear alkaline phosphatase activity fold at or h postorchiectomy a decline in the protein dna ratio also occurred following orchiectomy but the increase in phosphatase specific activity was evident whether expressed per unit of protein or per unit of dna testosterone replacement following orchiectomy abolished the increase in nuclear phosphatase activity the results suggest that the prostatic nuclear alkaline phosphatase may be involved in events related to inactivation of the prostate nucleus following androgen ED
1190,the author presents the results of prolonged research into ventricular fibrillation during myocardial ischaemia both from the electrocardiographic and PSA standpoints he emphasises the successive tonic and atonic features of vf due to ischaemia and the difference between the fibrillation in an ischaemic area and in a control area the most original concept is that there is often a difference between the ON of vf in an ischaemic zone and in a control zone this study has been carried out with both acute and progressive ischaemia the biochemical studies were carried out on blood samples taken from the origin of the CAs the coronary veins and from the saphenous veins an important finding was the definite increase in the potassium level of the coronary A-V blood in proportion to the degree of ischaemia the sodium level showed little change and if anything tended to fall but the most important and distinctive finding was that at the onset of vf the sodium and potassium concentrations in the coronary venous blood suddenly increase as the vf continues there is a progressive increase in lactic acid and a fall in ph which is maximal at the onset of the vf these findings are valid under normothermic conditions and when there is no extracorporeal circulation the physiopathological and practical implications of these facts are discussed
1191,a technique of PLT concentrate preparation and storage is presented which permits the maximum number of viable and functional platelets to be preserved for periods of hours although the storage conditions must be followed precisely the method is nevertheless simple to perform and does not require specialized expensive equipment critical factors include preparation of the PLT concentrates with an initial centrifugation of x g for minutes and a second centrifugation of x g for minutes platelet yield a storage bag composed of either fenwals pl or mcgaw plastic constant gentle mixing a ml residual plasma volume and RT storage c in vivo platelet recovery after hours of storage at room temperature averaged per cent and survival was days of fresh platelet viability the function of these platelets as measured by the correlation between one time and platelet count after transfusion of pooled platelets into unimmunized aplastic thrombocytopenic recipients was as good as that of fresh platelets both viability and CF of concentrated platelets stored at c are severely compromised
1192,the tyrosinemonooxygenase activity ltyrosine tetrahydropteridine oxygen oxidoreductase hydroxylating ec of rat adrenal medulla is induced hr after the i.t. of reserpine mumolkg intraperitoneally this and other inducing stimuli increase the cyclic amp camp content in the medulla for longer than min and activate the campdependent protein kinase atp protein phosphotransferase ec for several hours corticotropin acth dopamine and propranolol do not induce the monooxygenase but elicit an increase in the camp content of the medulla which fails to activate protein kinase and lasts less than hr a high and lowmolecularweight protein kinase are separated by gel filtration from the x g pellet extract of AM homogenate the activity of the lowmolecularweight enzyme is expressed as its ability to phosphorylate histone the protein kinase activity of the pellet is increased between and hr after reserpine injection our evidence indicates that this increase is due to a translocation from cytosol to subcellular structures of a kinase that utilizes lysinerich histone as phosphate acceptor the protein kinase activity that is extracted from a purified nuclear fraction prepared from the adrenal medulla of rats injected hr previously with reserpine is greater than that extracted from medulla of salinetreated rats
1193,a simple membrane oxygenator for isolated organ perfusion is described the membrane employed consisted of an ordinary silicone rubber tubing mm internal diameter mm wall thickness the length of the tubing varying according to the required gas transfer when describing the capacity of the oxygenator it was found that the maximum gas transfer rate per unit membrane surface was an inadequate measure since this would vary with both flow rate through the oxygenator and the gas binding capacity of the perfusate the following formula for the function describing the relation between maximally possible change in gas concentration in the perfusate c flow rate f and actual NC in gas concentration in the perfusate u was proposed ucebf b being a constant specific for the gas and the membrane this formula was tested by a series of in vitro experiments and proved to give a valid description of the capacity of the oxygenator it was also found that carbon dioxide was always more easily transferred than oxygen so that oxygen transfer capcity was the limiting factor in the use of the oxygenator to facilitate the construction of the right size membrane a nomogram was constructed for oxygen transfer
1194,the effect of anion binding to ceruloplasmin has been studied using absorption and cirbular dichroism spectral data at anion to ceruloplasmin molar ratios approaching infinite ocn n and scn bind to ceruloplasmin giving rise to similar alterations in circular dichroism and absorption spectra the positive bands at and nm in circular dichroism spectra disappear a negative one apperars at nm and the peak at nm is only slightly modified there is a new negative band at nm welldefined in ocn ceruloplasmin spectra the decrease in absorption at nm is ascribed to the disruption of one type i cuscysteine bond owing presumably to the changes induced by anions in the protein AA structure the new band at nm is assigned to a charge transfer transition from the ligand replacing cysteine at its binding site both absorption and circular dichroism spectra show isobestic points indicating that anion binding to the enzyme disruption of one of the two type i cus bonds and coordination of this cu to another protein residue take place simultaneously
1195,arterial concentrations and net organ metabolism of amino acids aa o co h and gl glc were measured in two dogs before and during hemorrhage and after blood replacement shock caused increased splanchnic and decreased peripheral blood flow and o consumption po decreased more in hepatic venous than in mixed A-V blood ph fell in hemorrhage and increased with retransfusion increased liver output and arterial concentration of glc were observed during hemorrhage differences between animals correlated with NS blood concentrations of most aa showed little change during hemorrhage but increased after retransfusion in contrast Arg concentrations declined sharply IP output and hepatic uptake of most aa occurred during the control period during shock peripheral output and hepatic uptake of total aa and most individual aa declined progressively after retransfusion IP uptake and hepatic output of many aa occurred by contrast IP output and hepatic uptake increased for alanine glutamine serine phenylalanine and tyrosine after retransfusion net transport of some compounds occurred from periphery to CL others from liver to periphery during shock hepatic protein catabolism increased and this catabolism accompanied by decreased hepatic uptake increased hepatic output seemed the main cause of increased blood aa concentrations protein catabolism in peripheral tissue was not a cause of increased blood concentrations pathological changes in ph po and blood flow occurred early in hemorrhage in contrast changes in aa movements and concentrations were within normal limits until late in shock
1196,the cyclic amp generating system in slices of the rat limbic forebrain was investigated in consists of u a noradrenergic system which responds to norepinephrine ne and isoproterenol though the rise of the nucleotide elicited by isoproterenol is more rapid than that caused by ne the maximal effect is less than half of that induced by ne an adenosinedependent system the noradrenergic cyclic amp generating system in the limbic forebrain displays a number of properties of a central ne receptor it develops supersensitivity to ne and isoproterenol following prolonged deprivation of ne at postsynaptic sites chronic treatment with RES or chemosympathectomy with hydroxydopamine when NE terminals are protected from hydroxydopamine by desmethylimipramine the responses to ne are not enhanced responses to ne are blocked by both propranolol and phentolamine while responses to isoproterenol are blocked by propranolol but not by phentolamine the adenosinedependent system does not develop supersensitivity after central chemosympathectomy and is not blocked by either alpha or betaantagonists while not altering the basal level of the nucleotide clinically effective APDs caused a dosedependent inhibition of the limbic NE cyclic amp response with CLZ and pimozide being particularly potent ic and mum respectively APDs do however not affect cyclic amp responses elicited by adenosine the results are compatible with the view that the central ne receptor is closely related to or may be an integral part of an adenylate cyclase system and that its blockade in the limbic forebrain by AP drugs may contribute to their therapeutic action
1197,dimethylphenyltriazene and a series of ringsubstituted derivatives xphinnnchxsubstituents phiphenyl were tested for their mutagenic and toxic action upon salmonella typhimurium g in a liquid incubation system containing g tissue supernatants and an nadphgenerating system the EDC could be grouped into four classes according to their toxicity and mutagenicity after h incubation at degrees c at a concentration of mm in the presence of liver supernatant fractions from phenobarbitonepretreated mice when a liver supernatant from untreated mice was compared with one from phenobarbitonepretreated animals the mutagenic effect of a series of triazenes with xh chloro chloro bromo trichloro in vitro was enhanced twice to ten times the toxicity of triazenes with xmethoxy or acetamido was strongly decreased by a liver fraction from phenobarbitonepretreated mice in the presence of an nadphgenerating system with dimethylphenyltriazene rat CL fractions caused a lower enzymemediated mutagenicity in s typhimurium g than those of mouse liver whereas a g supernatant from brain a major lung for the carcinogenic action of certain triazenes was unable in either species to generate metabolites mutagenic for s typhimurium g
1198,the ph of PTCs was measured by means of antimony microelectrodes during their perfusion with rat ringers solutions at different ph in control and acetazolamide infused rats in capillaries perfused with a solution more acid than blood significant alkalinization was observed at increasing distances from the point of perfusion while during perfusions with more alkaline solutions acidification was observed plotting the ph change observed per micrometer of distance from the perfusion point against the ph of the perfusing solution the ph in equilibrium with tubular cells was interpolated a value of was found for control rats significantly higher than the mean arterial blood ph of this group of in acetazolamide infused rats an equilibrium ph of was found still higher than the blood ph of the slope of these lines was significantly greater in control than in acetazolamide treated rats this Mw was shown to evaluate permeability to the ions responsible for acidbase balance the present data suggest that peritubular alkalinization is reduced after carbonic anhydrase inhibition due to decreased peritubular permeability to the involved ions which represents a further site of action of these inhibitors
1199,pineal denervation by superior cervical ganglionectomy gx decreased high affinity binding of estradiol e to the pineal cytosol of female rats and of testosterone to the cytosol of male rats by and and by and and days after sugery hormone binding remained unchanged up to h after surgery binding to the nuclear fraction decreased sigificantly by weeks after incorporation of h leucine into pineal proteins in gx a single i.t. of e mug to testosterone propionate tp mug failed to increase the gx rats when injected or days after surgery significant increases were observed in shamoperated controls or in rats subjected to bilateral decentralization of ganglia however on the th day an impairment was observed in hormone ability to enhance hleucine incorporation in decentralized rats the administration of isoproterenol and h before sacrifice replenished pinealbinding CS for e and testosterone in gx rats but failed to restore the responsiveness of denervated pineals to hormone administration moreover e or tp treatment blocked the increase in labeled amino acid incorporation into proteins brought about by isoproterenol per se the administration of propranolol and h T3 hormone injection decreased the ability of e and tp to enhance hleucine incorporation by and respectively tyrosine hydroxylase activity of the superior cervical ganglia decreased by and h after e or tp administration and by and after daily injections of the hormones whereas pineal tyrosine hydroxylase remained unchanged hormone treatment for days increased the in vitro uptake of norepinephrine by the ganglia but did not affect uptake in the pineal gland these data indicate that the integrity of neurons of the SCG ganglia is an absolute requirement for e and testosterone to enhance hleucine incorporation into pineal proteins in rats
1200,superoxide dismutase was assayed by a method which takes advantage of the GABA action of superoxide dismutase or tissues which contain superoxide dismutase on the rate of autooxidation of hydroxydopamine incubation of pure superoxide dismutase of homogenates of BB or CL with m diethyldithiocarbamate for hours resulted in total loss of SOD inhibition of superoxide dismutase was not reversed by dialysis but after dialysis enzymatic activity was restored with cuso when g of diethyldithiocarbamatekg were injected into mice the superoxide dismutase activity at hours was decreased by and respectively in whole blood liver and brain a dose of g of diethyldithiocarbamatekg lowered the superoxide dismutase activity by in CL at hours a T0 of the time course for inhibiton of superoxide dismutase in liver after g of diethyldithiocarbamatekg showed a maximum decrease within hour with a slow return to of normal by hours inhibition of superoxide dismutase in vivo and in vitro was confirmed with other assay systems based on the autooxidation of pyrogallol or EN or on reduction of cytochrome c or intro blue tetrazolium treatment of animals with diethyldithiocarbamate may provide a useful experimental MM to study the role of superoxide dismutase in various tissues
1201,the number of angiosperm species for which nuclear dna amount estimates have been made has nearly trebled since the last collected lists of such values were published and therefore publication of a more comprehensive list is over due this paper lists absolute nuclear dna amounts for angiosperm species the dats were assembled primarily for REF purposes and so the species are listed in alphabetical order as this was felt to be more helpful to cyto and biochemists whom it is anticipated will be among its major users the paper also reviews aspects of the history nomenclature methods accuracy and problems of nuclear dna estimation in angiosperms no attempt is made to reconsider those aspects of nuclear dna estimation which have been fully revised previously although the bibliography of such aspects is given instead the paper is intended as a source of basic information regarding the terminology practice and limitations of nuclear dna estimation especially by feulgen MD as currently practiced
1202,the trochanteral hairplate afferents in the metathoracic leg of the CR periplaneta americana were stimulated electrically and at the same time intracellular recordings were made from either MNs interneurones or afferent terminals within the methathoracic ganglion activity in the hairplate afferents evoked short latency excitatory postsynaptic potentials epsps in femur flexor motoneurones the latency of the ipsps was on average ms longer than the RL ofthe epsps intracellular recordings from terminal branches of the hairplate afferents showed that the delay between the peak of the afferent terminal spike and the beginning of the epsps is about ms this finding together with the observations that the amplitude of the epsps is increased by the passage of hyperpolarizing current and decreased following highfrequency stimulation indicates that the eppsps are evoked viamonosynaptic chemical synaptic junctions the observations of the long latency of the ipsps the need for a number of afferents to be simultaneously acive for them to be evoked and the occasional R2 in latency all indicate that the ipsps are evoked via a disynaptic pathway
1203,ovariectomized adult rats with closed uteri were treated for days with different oral and sc doses of oestradiol oestrone oestriol and ethinyl oestradiol all treatments elicited the production of uterine fluid and the potencies of oestrogens were related to the amount of fluid secreted ethinyl oestradiol and oestradiol displayed similar activity when given sc a daily dose of mg oestradiolkg resulted in about mg fluid oestrone was times and oestriol about times less AS orally ethinyl oestradiol was the most potent substance and mg secretion was obtained with a dose of mgkg daily oestradiol was about times oestrone about times and oestriol times less AS than ethinyl oestradiol by this route the viscosity of the secretion was unaffected remaining between and cp the ph of the fluid did not change but that of the uterine lumen diminished slightly these effects of oestrogens were associated with an increase in the weight of the empty uterus and a decrease in body weight
1204,it is shown that the degree of regulatory kinetic behavior of rb muscle phosphofructokinase increases at a given ph and lower temperatures as well as at a given temperature and lower ph values it is also shown that the regulatory kinetic behavior which appears at lower ph values is inherent in the tetrameric active form of the enzyme we conclude that a portion of the mechanism proposed previously bock pe and frieden c j biol chem to describe the ph and temperaturedependent inactivation or reactivation may also be used to explain the ph and temperaturedependent RII kinetic behavior according to this proposal two rapidly equilibrating forms of the enzyme which differ in the degree of protonation of specific residues differ in their ability to bind substrates while the protonated form of the enzyme subsequently becomes inactive by isomerization and dissociation this process is too slow to affect the kinetic results making direct comparisons between the associationdissociation behavior and regulatory kinetic behavior invalid the time dependence of the processes of inactivation or reactivation in the presence or absence of ligands and of the appearance of RII kinetic SMB is discussed in relation to their possible role in metabolic regulation
1205,the lubroldispersed guanylate cyclase from sea urchin sperm was purified and isolated essentially free of detergent by gtp AC deaesephadex chromatography and GF T3 removal of the detergent the enzyme remained in solution in the presence of glycerol the specific activity of the purified enzyme was about mumol of guanosine monophosphate cyclic gmp formed min mg of protein at degrees an activity about times that of a soluble guanylate cyclase purified recently from escherichia coli macchia v varrone s weissbach h miller dl and pastan i j biol chem the cyclic gmp phosphodiesterase activity was negligible and adenosine monophosphate cAMP phosphodiesterase was not detectable in the purified preparation cAMP formation from atp occurred at a rate of of that of guanylate cyclase in the absence of phosphodiesterase or guanosine triphosphatase inhibitors of the added gtp was converted to cyclic gmp the purified enzyme required mn for maximum activity the relative rates in the presence of mg or ca being less than of the rates with mn the purified enzyme displayed classical michaelismenten kinetics with respect to mngtp apparent km is approximately equal to mum in contrast to the positively cooperative kinetic behavior displayed by the unpurified detergentdispersed or particulate guanylate cyclase the molecular weight of the purified enzyme was approximately as estimated on biogel am columns equilibrated in the presence or absence of m nacl the unpurified detergentdispersed enzyme also migrated with an apparent molecular weight of on columns equilibrated with lubrol wx and m nacl but it migrated as a large aggregate molecular weight is greater than x on columns equilibrated in the absence of either the detergent of nacl T3 gel filtration the unpurified dispersed enzyme still yielded positive cooperative kinetic patterns as a function of mngtp na dodecylso gel electrophoresis of the enzyme T3 the deaesephadex or the gel filtration steps resulted in two major protein bands with estimated molecular weights of and whether or not these protein bands represent the subunit molecular weights of guanylate cyclase is unknown at present
1206,performance of accurrate reproducible and interpretable assays for plasma renin activity and other components of the reninangiotensin system in the clinical setting requires a clear understanding of the various reactions in the reninangiotensin cascade and the nature of their interactions plasma renin activity the rate of angiotensin generations from plasma incubated in vitro is the most commonly used clinical index of function in the reninangiotensin system renin activity is measured by radioimmunoassay of angiotensin i generated in vitro under carefully controlled conditions the value obtained for plasma renin activity depends on ph and duration of incubation and on the method used to protect the angiotensin i generated we recommend incubation at neutral ph in buffered plasma for three hours in the presence of either ethylenediaminetetraacetate hydroxyquinolone dimercaprol or ethylenediaminetetraacetate phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride addition of a standard preparation of human renin to the plasma incubation step of the renin activity assay serves the dual purpose of permitting measurement of renin activity and furnishing an internal standard for comparison of assay procedures the many variables among renin CA methods can be cancelled by referring to a common internal renin standard
1207,the physiological disposition of a new salureticuricosuric agent dichloromethyloxophenylindanyloxyacetic acid mk was studied in the rat dog and monkey mk was well absorbed and showed minimal metabolism in these species peak plasma C2 of radioactivity and drug occurred hr after oral administration at a dose of mgkg essentially all of the radioactivity present in the plasma during the first day was intact mk following a single dose a long terminal halflife for plasma radioactivity was observed in the dog approximately hr and monkey approximately hr the chronic administration of mk to dogs resulted in a doserelated plasma profile and showed no tendency to increase or decrease with dosing however upon repeated drug administration to monkeys the plasma levels of drug increased and then decreased possibly due to hypochloremia and secondary metabolic alkalosis fecal excretion was the predominant route of tracer elimination in the dog approximately and rat approximately whereas the monkey eliminated the majority of the dose approximately via the urine minimal metabolism was noted in the three lower species most of the urinary plasma and fecal radioactivity was accounted for as IN drug and its glucuronide conjugate three minor metabolites which were present in dog bile plasma and urine were characterized as ldichloroalphahydroxymethylphenylindanyloxyacetic acid i dichlorohydroxyphenylmethyloxoindanyloxyacetic acid ii and methylphenylhydroxydichloroindanone iii the monkey urine and plasma also contained small amounts of ii
1208,the synthesis of the three types of ALS ec which are responsible for the biosynthesis os isoleucine and valine was observed in aerobacter aerogenes i an isoleucinerequiring mutant when grown on the four kinds of media when the cells were grown on isoleucinerich medium acetolactate synthase CS to feedback inhibition and having an optimum ph at was formed by increasing the amount of potassium phosphate in the medium the catabolite repression of the enzyme having an optimum ph at and which is insensitive to feedback inhibition was released in contrast acetolactate synthase having an optimum ph at and insensitive to feedback inhibition was formd when isoleucine was limited irrespective of phosphate concentrations two insensitive enzymes were not regulated by isoleucine leucine and valine although sensitive ph enzyme was repressed by them thus it may be assumed that the synthesis of insensitive ph enzyme were repressed by limiting the amount of isoleucine is still open
1209,necrotizing enterocolitis of the P0 has an anatomical definition lesions discovered during surgery or on postmortem examination progress in neanatal shock reveals facts already known in the adult and in experimental medicine concept of preferential and circulatory bypass a considerable decrease in blood flow is seen in the latter during shock this shock is sometimes not important MES circulation is the best example this syndrome should therefore be included in the L1 vascular changes of neonatal period vascular and infectious enteropathy is a broader term which seems more AGA because of aetiological and therapeutic implications the aetiology should be considered as a sum of several factors varying from one patient to another multifactorial disease the circulatory component remains very important its severity depends on whether or not it is treated four notions should be defined census of population of subjects with high risk of vascular and infectious enteropathy score trial isolation of clinical pictures corresponding to a medical or surgical stage grouping of elements for immediate and long term prognosis grouping of elements for immediate and long term prognosis proposal of preventive treatment to the high risk patients surgery continuons parenteral and enteral feeding are intientionally left out in this paper the interest of this concept of the disease is to eradicate severe forms as in the neonatal idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome where a similar concept was adopted
1210,it has been shown that for the reaction catalyzed by biodegradative lthreonine dehydratase from e coli strains k and in m phosphatecarbonate buffer ph and ph the plots of initial reaction rate v versus the initial substrate concentration s are characterized by several inflection points i e an intermediate plateau the plot of v versus the AMP amp concentration have very complicated shapes there are several inflection points and also the maximum at lthreonine concentration equal to and m high amp concentrations inhibit the enzyme at high ATP concentrations the reduced glutathion dose not influence the enzyme and does not alter the activating effect of amp on the basis of the data obtained it is proposed that the substrate and amp shift the equilibrium between multiple oligomeric enzyme forms differing in catalytic activity and kinetic manifestations of allosteric interactions between the active and allosteric ampbinding CS towards polymerization thus the functioning the enzyme under T0 is discussed in the frames of the model of dissociating regulatory enzymes with multiple intermediate oligomeric forms
1211,in addition to alphanhistidylriboflavin alphanhistidylriboflavin is also formed during the reaction of nalphablocked histidine with alphabromotetraacetylriboflavin in a yield of of the total histidylflavin fraction the properties of alphanhistidylriboflavin are inditical with those of the histidylflavin isolated from B1 dehydrogenase and betacyclopiazonate oxidocyclase but differ from those of alphanhistidylriboflavin these properties include pka of fluorescence quenching electrophoretic mobility at ph stability to storage and reduction by nabh proof for alpha substitution is shown by the electron paramagnetic resonance and electronnuclear double resonance spectra of the cationic semiquinone form as well as by the PMR spectrum of the Ox form the site of histidine substitution by the alphamethylene of the flavin moiety was shown by methylation of the imidazole ring with methyl iodide cleavage of the methylhistidineflavin bond by acid hydrolysis at degrees c and identification of the methylhistidine isomer by electrophoresis methylhistidine is the product from the nhistidylflavin isomer while methylhistidine is produced from the n isomer the flavin product from reductive zn cleavage of either isomer has been identified as riboflavin the compound obtained on acid treatment of alphanhistidylriboflavin previously thought to be the n isomer differs from the parent compound only in the ribityl side chain since chemical degradation studies show methylhistidine as a product and a flavin product which differs from riboflavin only in mobility in thinlayer chromatography but not in absorption fluorescence and electron paramagnetic resonance spectral properties proof that acid modification involves only the ribityl chain has come from the observations that ALP irradiation of this flavin yields lumiflavin that the proton magnetic resonance spectrum of the compound differs from that of riboflavin in the region of the ribityl proton resonance and that its periodate titer is lower than that of authentic riboflavin the identity of alphanhistidylriboflavin with the histidylflavin from thiamine dehydrogenase and betacyclopiazonate oxidocyclase shows that both isomeric forms of alphahistidylflavin occur in nature
1212,bile composition and secretion were studied in tow elasmobranch species squalus acanthias spiny dogfish shark and raja erinacea small skate after ligation of the common duct and insertion of cannulas into the gallbladder lumen fish were then allowed to swim freely in C1 pools and bile was collected in balloons attached to the externalized cannulas both species secreted bile for periods of days at a maximum rate of mlkg per h in squalus acanthias and mlkg per h in raja erinacea comparison of the composition of cannula and GB bile indicated that hepatic bile could be collected by this technique in both species without ERP contact with gallbladder epithelium the low concentrations of hco and cl and the gigh bile salt levels in dogfish gallbladder bile indicate that mechanisms for concentration and acidification of bile in the gallbladder developed early in vertebrate evolution these results indicate that GB cannulation in freeswimming elasmobranchs is a useful technique for the T0 of bile secretory and excretory function in marine species
1213,the first series of experiments showed that inhibition of the proteins synthesis followed by memory disorders was reflected in decrease of the synaptosomal proteins fraction which was identified as the cholinoreceptor protein another series of experiments training of rats to use unpreferred paw showed the system acetylcholineacetylcholinesterase to be directly connected with SM phenomena and the synthesis of this enzyme to be induced by genetic apparatus the third series of experiments showed that feeding of rats with small doses of aminoacids for a long time leads to regular shifts in distribution of both the aminoacids and the monoamines the aminoacids increasing the brain activity were found to activate the production of cycleadenyl acid those aminoacids which inhibit the brain activity decrease the production of cyclicamp tranquilizers which decrease the level of monoamines and inhibit the brain activity also decrease the production of cyclicamp antidepressants inhibiting mao and increasing the level of monoamines in the brain activate the production of cyclicamp as the monoamines act via cyclicamp and the latter participates in suppression of dna the mechanism of involvement of the genetic apparatus in regulation of memory phenomena and learning becomes more apparent
1214,the behavior of the photosynthetic cytochrome c upon titration with alkali depends on the ionic composition of the medium in water the disappearance of the nm band indicating the displacement of the methionine ligand as well as a remarkable tryptophan fluorescense enhancement follow a single proton titration curve with pk of and n the product is a low spin type protein in saltcontaining media two successive steps are observed in the first one completed at about ph a highspin form of cytochrome c is obtained and relatively small fluorescence enhancement is detected in the second step more profound fluorometric changes occur while the material reverts to its lowspin form addition of salts to an alkaline solution of cytochrome c in water results in the formation of a nm highspin band with a concomitant quenching of tryptophan fluorescence the results imply that at high ph unfolding of the molecule is evident only when the LS product is obtained in the highspin alkaline form the methionine ligand is probably displaced from iron coordination by hydroxyl ions while in the lowspin alkaline form Met may be replaced by a lysyl residue of the cytochrome c protein the results imply that the lysyl residue is available for coordination in salt solutions at a higher ph than in water
1215,it is generally assumed that hepatic transport of bile acids is a carriermediated process however the basic mechanisms by which these organic anions are translocated across the liver cell surface membrane are not well understood since carriermediated transport involved IB of the transported molecule to specific receptor sites we have investigated the possibility that bile acid receptors are present in liver surface membranes isolated liver surface membranes were incubated at degrees c with ccholic acid and ctaurocholic acid and membraneboudn bile acid was separated from free by a rapid ultrafiltration technique through glassfiber filters specific bile acid binding is rapid and reversible and represents approximately of the total bile acid bound to liver surface membranes taurocholic acid binding is independent of the medium ph while CA acid binding demonstrates an optimum at ph analysis of equilibrium data for both cholic and TC binding indicates that specific binding is saturable and consistent with michaelismenten kinetics while nonspecific binding is nonsaturable apparent Bmax capacity and KB values indicate a large capacity system of receptors that have an affinity for bile acids comparable to that of the hepatic transport mechanism scatchard analysis of the saturation kinetics as well as inhibition studies suggest that bile acids bind to a single and noninteracting class of anion that competes with bile acids for hepatic uptake also inhibits CA acid binding in contrast no inhibition was demonstrated with indocyanine green and probenecid TPS bile acid IB is enriched and primarily located in liver surface membranes and found only in tissues involved in bile acid transport specific bile acid IB is independnet of na ca and mg and does not require metabolic energy in addition thiol groups and disulfide are not required for activity at the binding site however specific bile acid IB is markedly decreased by low concentrations of proteolytic enzymes and is also decreased by the action of neuraminidase and phospholipases a and c these results are consistent with the existence of a homogeneous bile acid receptor protein in CL surface membranes the primary surface membrane location of this receptor its IB properties and its ligand specificity suggest that bile acid binding to this receptor may represent the initial interaction in bile acid transport across liver surface membranes
1216,the properties of sadenosyllmethionine accumulating system for both vacuoles and spheroplasts are described yeast vacuoles were obtained by a modified metabolic lysis procedure from spheroplasts of saccharomyces cerevisiae isolated vacuoles accumulate sadenosyllmethionine by means of a highly specific transport system as indicated by competition experiments with structural analogs of sadenosyllmethionine the sadenosyllmethionine transport system shows saturation kinetics with an apparent km of mum in vacuoles and mum in spheroplasts sadenosyllmethionine accumulation into vacuoles does not require glucose phosphoenolpyruvic acid atp adp nor any other tri or diphosphorylated nucleotides it is insensitive to azide and dinitrophenol which strongly inhibit the glucosedependent accumulation of sadenosyllmethionine in spheroplasts the transport of sadenosyllmethionine into vacuoles is optimal at ph and is insensitive to nystatin while the uptake of sadenosyllmethionine into spheroplasts is optimal at ph and is strongly sensitive to nystatin on this basis it has thus been possible to measure both the intracytoplasmic and the intravacuolar pool of sadenosyllmethionine our results indicate the existence of a highly TPS sadenosyllmethionine transport system in the vacuolar membrane which is clearly different from the one present in the plasma membrane of yeast cells
1217,the extracts of LG of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes hydrolyzed a variety of proteins including human and bovine hemoglobin human fibrinogen human and bovine SS Al bovine elastin and casein the hydrolysis of all the proteins except fibrinogen and elastin was increased by addition of urea various inhibitors of TR kallikrein plasmin clr cls and other proteolytic enzymes had no inhibitory effect slight inhibition was observed with polyanethol sulfonate and strong inhibition with NHS SS of patients with hereditary angioneurotic edema having no functional cesterase inhibitor was as effective in inhibiting the proteolysis as NS the inhibitor was localized in s fractions of normal serum fractionated on sephadex g fractionation of normal SS by ammonium sulfate precipitation sephadex g filtration and cmsephadex chromatography did not result in appearance of LIA in more than one protein peak suggesting the possibility that only one inhibitor might be responsible since all fractions which contained the inhibitor of proteolysis also contained alphaantitrypsin since sera of patients having low alphaantitrypsin levels contained less LIA and since antibodies against alphaantitrypsin reversed the inhibition obtained from normal serum the inhibition of proteolysis may be attributed to alphaantitrypsin
1218,synaptosomes prelabeled at degrees c with radioactive amino acids gaba glutamate glycine taurine alphaaminoisobutyric acid phenylalanine leucine and then washed at degrees c on millipore filters dawp lost of the accumulated radioactivity the loss was similar with exogenous tritiated gaba and glutamate and with cgaba and cglutamate metabolically derived from cglucose in contrast radioactive norepinephrine dopamine and hydroxytryptamine were almost totally retained by cold shocked synaptosomes after pretreatment with RES and nialamide the loss of norepinephrine became significantly greater about the uptake of radioactive gaba glutamate and clycine after cold shock was about reduced whereas that of radioactive biogenic amines was less affected reduction of for norepinephrine for hydroxytryptamine and for dopamine the loss of amino acids and the reduction of uptake could be minimized by performing the cold shock in hypertonic conditions in synaptosomes prelabeled with hgaba a good rho was observed among magnitude of CAA pool depletion induced by cold shock or by mm kcl decrease of subsequent accumulation of cgaba and decrease of cgabastimulated hgaba PR homoexchange
1219,a purification procedure is reported for obtaining bovine liver DHF reductase in high yield and amounts of mg a key step in the procedure is the use of an affinity gel prepared by coupling pteroylllysine to sepharose the purified reductase has a TPS activity of about unitsmg and is homogeneous as judged by analytical ultracentrifugation polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and titration with methotrexate the products of the first step of edman Kd indicated a minimum purity of the reductase has a molecular weight of about on the basis of amino acid composition and from equilibrium sedimentation it is not inhibited by AS to the streptococcus faecium reductase isoenzyme unlike the reductase of many other vertebrate tissues the bovine enzyme is inhibited by mercurials rather than activated and it has a single ph optimum at both low and high ionic strength however the position of the ph optimum is shifted and the activity increased by increasing ionic strength automatic edman degradation has been used to determine of the aminoterminal amino acid residues considerable homology exists between this region and the corresponding regions of the reductase from s faecium and from escherichia coli this strengthens the idea that this region contributes to the structure of the binding site for DHF
1220,the single most characteristic morphological feature in icell disease icd is the accumulation of membranebound vacuoles in mesenchymal cells mainly fibroblasts no true storage can be documented in those vacuoles that their contents could have been dissolved during fixation or embedding remains however a possibility remnants consisting of a few lamellar arrays and of small amounts of fibrillogranular material are too scarce for histochemical characterization in hepatocytes C1 cells in the white pulp of the SP and in myocardial fibers vacuoles with fixative insoluble contents have been discovered they are nowhere very abundant and their specificity is questionable because the affected fibroblastic elements represent a small fraction in any organ most secondary biochemical CA are expected to be detectable only in purely fibroblastic tissues our pathological T0 contributes to the understanding of some of the clinical features characteristic of icd and stresses major morphological differences between icd and the many diseases classified as mucopolysaccharidoses and mucolipidoses
1221,cellassociated MD md vaccine was suspended at dilutions normally used for vaccination in seven commercially available diluents and in tryptose phosphate broth the stability of diluted vaccines was determined by CA in cell cultures subjected to to c for to minutes optimum holding temperatures for md vaccine virus survival varied with the specific diluents employed some diluents afforded greatest survival when dilution was at c and held at c while others performed best when dilution was at c followed by cooling and holding at c diluents which allowed greatest survival when tested at c also performed well under other temperature regimes spectinomycin dihydrochloride pentahydrate and various buffering compounds were added to commercial diluents used for diluting md vaccine additives producing osmolality of mosmkg and higher markedly reduced vaccine virus survival the adverse effects of high OP were accentuated by D2 holding time elevated incubation temperature and PCS manipulations including mechanical mixing or expressing through a syringe and needle satisfactory md vaccine virus survival was afforded by a commercial diluent especially formulated to accommodate the ph osmolality changes produced by adding spectinomycin dihydrochloride pentahydrate
1222,fiftyeight neurotic patients with intense anxiety were treated with either lorazepam or diazepam in a double blind betweenpatients trial statistical analysis indicated that the two groups were homogeneous before treatment and that the results of treatment were similar for both drugs according to the global rating of illness week after week after four weeks of treatment more patients on lorazepam than on diazepam were normal or had mild illness vs in the investigators judgment of the patients treated with lorazepam had an excellent or good response compared with of those treated with diazepam the mean reduction in score on the hamilton anxiety scale was for lorazepam and for diazepam however none of the above differences in results were statistically significant the largest dose of lorazepam required in treatment was mg compared with mg of diazepam two patients treated with lorazepam had SE against six with diazepam six patients in the diazepam group did not CR the trial including three who discontinued because of SE rash tremors agitation no patients in the lorazepam group dropped out
1223,ninety subjects were examined healthy males patients with primary hypogonadism patients with klinefelters syndrome and patients with AA hypogonadism the stimulating test with mug lhrh and mug tth was carried out tp all subjects examined applied in two successive ov injections the plasma as regards the C2 of tth prolactin fsh lh acth and sth is investigated every and minutes the levels of tbe mentioned hormones were determined as well as the normal respond reaction the basic lh and fsh C2 are considerabty elevated in patients with primary hypogonadism and klinefelters syndrome and the respond reaction to stimulation is normal or diminished a strict correlation between the number of x chromosomes and the level of fsh and lh was established in the KS with respect to tth the basic level in patients with primary hypogonadism in normal in patients and pathological deviations were found in patients a strict correlation between tth level and the number of xchromosomes exists prolactin level in both groups is decreased in patients with AA hypogonadism the basic level of lh and esh is decreased or at the lower limits of the norm the respond reaction is absent both tth and prolactin levels are pathologically changed as well as the respond reactions to stimulation depending on the etiology of the primary endocrine distrubance that had led to hypoginadism development
1224,cholera toxin consists of five similar b subunits of apparent molecular weight about and one a subunit consisting of two peptides a and a about linked by a single disulfide bond each b S1 also contains one internal disulfide bond which is readily reduced but is protected from carboxymethylation unless the reduced subunits are heated in urea IMT residues in a and in b subunits are readily iodinated but the IN b assembly does not react with iodine upon reaction with the crosslinking reagent dimethyl suberimidate b subunits may be covalently connected to each other to a and to a a and a may also be crosslinked the b subunits are probably arranged in a ring with a on the axis a is required for the reassembly of toxin from its subunits and may serve to hold a on the b ring the maximum activity of cholera toxin in vitro is obtained only when the AS peptide a is separated from the rest of the molecule such separation and the insertion of a into the cytosol must follow the IB of the complete toxin through component b to the exterior of IN cells this binding increases the ERP concentration of the toxin in the vicinity of the plasma membrane possible ways in which a then crosses the membrane are considered in the discussion
1225,the mechanism of action of yeast betahydroxybetamethylglutarylcoenzyme a reductase has been investigated through kinetic studies on the oxidation of mevaldate by nicotinamide adeninine dinucleotide phosphate nadp in the presence of coenzyme a coa and on the reduction of mevaldate by reduced nadp nadph in the absence of presence of coa or acetylcoa nadp and MVA were also used as product inhibitors of the reduction of mevaldate in the reduction of mevaldate to mevalonate coenzyme a and acetylcoa decreased the km for mevaldate and fold respectively both EDC increased the vmax fold these results suggest that coa is an allosteric activator for the second reductive step and that it acts by enhancing the IB of mevaldate the intersecting patterns obtained from initial velocities and the patterns produced by product inhibitions suggest the following features of the mechanism the IB of substrates and release of products proceeds sequentially in both reductive steps and is ordered throughout or random with respect to the IB of the betahydroxybetamethylglutarylcoenzymea and the first nadph the binding of nadph enhances the IB of the betahydroxybetamethylglutaryl portion of the coa ester and the IB of free mevaldate whereas the binding of nadp leads to an increased affinity of the enzyme for the hemithioacetal of mevaldate and coa and for mevalonate thus the replacement of nadp by nadph after the first reductive step promotes the conversion of the hemithioacetal to the free carbonyl form which is then rapidly reduced the products coa and mevalonic acid of the second reductive step leave the enzyme before the release of the second nadp this release of the last product is probably the ratelimiting step for the overall process
1226,acinetobacter ncib was isolated by elective SC on cyclohexanol and grows with this compound as sole source of carbon it displays a restricted growth spectrum being unable to grow on a wide range of alternative alicyclic alcohols and ketones cyclohexanolgrown cells oxidize the growth substrate at a rate of mul of oh per mg dry wt with the consumption of mumol of omumol substrate cyclohexanone is Ox at a similar rate with the consumption of mumol of omumol oxaoxocycloheptane and hydroxyhexanoate are both oxidized at the same slow rate of mul of oh per mg dry wt and adipate is not Ox studies with CE reveal the presence of inducible dehydrogenases for cyclohexanol hydroxyhexanoate and oxohexanoate and a monooxygenase that in conjunction with a lactonase converts cyclohexanone to hydroxyhexanoate the monooxygenase is therefore presumed to be of the lactoneforming type and the pathway for conversion of cyclohexanol to adipate cyclohexanol leads to cyclohexanone leads to oxaoxocycloheptane leads to hydroxyhexanoate leads to oxohexanoate leads to adipate for which key intermediates have been identified chromatographically is identical with the route for the oxidation of cyclohexanol by nocardia globerula cl
1227,spectrophotometric ph titrations of phosphoglycerate kinase ec reveal seven tyrosyl residues in the native state one tyrosyl residue has pkapp equal to another has pkapp of about and five have pkapp values close to titration above ph causes concomitant reduction of the catalytic activity reactivation of the enzyme occurs during storage at ph in m guanidine hcl seven tyrosyl residues with pkapp values equal to appear nitration of three tyrosyl residues occurs easily when tetranitromethane is used in excess four tyrosyl residues appear to be masked or buried the tyrosyl residue having pkapp equal to can be selectively nitrated simultaneously the enzyme loses of its catalytic activity no change in the km value for one or the other of the two substrates mgatp or phosphodglycerate was observed in the mononitrated enzyme on the other hand mgatp protects the tyrosyl residue from nitration whereas phosphodglycerate at corresponding condition appears harmless these results suggest the low ionizing tyrosyl residue to be situated close to the binding site of mgatp possibly in a pocket just behind circular dichroism measurements indicated that minor successive changes occur in the AA structure mainly the betastructure when the enzyme is being nitrated it is reasonable to think that these structural changes possible in combination with steric hindrance are responsible for the decrease in catalytic activity dimerization of the enzyme occurs if the single thiol group is not masked before the tetranitromethane treatment
1228,the HP of human erythrocytes was measured on a flow microcalorimeter with simultaneous analyses of lactate and other metabolites the heat production connected with the lactate formation was about kcal kj per mol lactate formed which corresponded to the sum of heat production due to the formation of lactate from gl and the HP due to neutralization the heat production rate increased as the ph of the suspension increased corresponding to the increase in lactate formation glycolytic inhibitors such as fluoride and monoiodoacetate caused a decrease in the rate of heat production whereas arsenate induced a large transient increase in HP associated with a transient increase in lactate formation decrease in pyruvate concentration was usually associated with increase in HP although the decreased pyruvate concentration was coupled with formation of bisphosphoglycerate when inosine dihydroxyacetone or dglyceraldehyde was used as a ATP an increase in the HP rate was observed addition of methylene blue caused an oxygen uptake which was accompanied by a remarkable increase in heat production rate corresponding to about kcal kj per mol oxygen consumed the value for heat production in red cells in the abovementioned metabolic conditions was considered in relation to earlier known data on free SE and enthalpy changes of the different metabolic steps in the glycolytic pathway
1229,the peroxisomal core from the CL of rats was purified fold as a marker of urate oxidase ec activity this preparation has a high TPS activity of urate oxidase but not of other peroxisomal enzymes damino acid oxidase ec lalphahydroxy acid oxidase ec or catalase ec no activity of marker enzymes for other subcellular particles cytochrome c oxidase ec mitochondria acid phosphatase ec lysosomes or glucosephosphatase ec microsomes was detected in this preparation the core obtained showed a single protein band in sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the position of the band was found to correspond to a molecular weight when the peroxisomal core was subjected to treatment at various phs with m carbonate buffer urate oxidase was almost completely solubulized at ph although approximately of the core protein still remained in the pellet T3 CMS of the core at ph the specific activity of urate oxidase in the supernatant increased about times the density of the insoluble protein remaining in the pellet was identical with the that of the original core on SDG centrifugation
1230,some of the kinetic properties of angiotensinconverting enzyme peptidyldipeptide hydrolase ec purified from hog lung have been determined using hippurylglycylglycine as substrate the effects of ph and ionic environment on CEA are complex and interdependent at m nacl the phactivity curve shows an abrupt decrease in vkm as the ph rises from to implying that ionization of a group in the enzyme with a pk in this range aids in IB of the substrate chloride is required for enzyme activity there are two phases in the effect of nacl at both ph and the first phase up to m nacl is activation the second phase above m at ph is inhibition while at ph there is further activation which appears to be dependent upon ionic strength rather than a specific cleffect activation by cobalt and inhibition by edta are somewhat more ERP at ph than at ph the nonapeptide inhibitor less than glutrpproargproglnilepropro is nearly equipotent at both ph and but argpropro is more inhibitory at ph than at ph
1231,catalytic amounts of bovine betatrypsin bovine alphachymotrypsin and porcine plasmin establish a true thermodynamic equilibrium between virgin i reactive site lysala peptide bond IN and modified i this bond hydrolyzed bovine trypsinkallikrein inhibitor kunitz the very slow reaction rates for attaining equilibrium are phdependent and differ for different enzymes optimal rates are for betatrypsin at ph for alphachymotrypsin at ph and for plasmin at ph under conditions of optimum ph the equilibrium is reached with the highest rate by plasmin in m inhibitor solutions the equilibrium concentrations of virgin and modified inhibitor are established by plasmin after almost days starting from either pure virgin or pure modified inhibitor thus the hydrolysis constant khyd ii is determined to be at ph in spite of many unsuccessful attempts this demonstrates that the reactive site peptide bond lysala in the BT inhibitor kunitz can be hydrolyzed by catalytic amounts of endopeptidase it further confirms that the hydrolyzed lysala peptide bond in modified inhibitor is subject to thermodynamic control resynthesis
1232,the histidine c proton nmr titration curves of ribonuclease speptide residues to and sprotein residues to are reported although sprotein contains histidine residues four discrete resonances are observed to titrate one of these arises from the equivalent histidine residues of unfolded sprotein the variation in area of the four resonances indicate that there is a reversible phdependent equilibrium between the folded and unfolded forms of sprotein with some unfolded material being present at most ph values two of the resonances of the folded sprotein can be assigned to of the histidine residues and from the close similarity of their titration curves to those in ribonuclease these similarities indicate a homology of portions of the folded conformation of sprotein to that of ribonuclease in solution these results indicate that the CR amino acid sequence is not required to produce a folded conformation similar to the native globular protein and they appear to eliminate the possibility that proteins fold from their nh terminus during protein synthesis the low ph inflection present in the titration curve assigned to histidine residue in ribonuclease is absent from this curve in sprotein this is consistent with our previous conclusion that this inflection arises from the interaction of histidine with aspartic acid residue which is also absent in sprotein the third titrating resonance of native sprotein is assigned to the remaining histidine residue at position the properties of this resonance are not identical with either of the titration curves of the active site histidine residues and of ribonuclease the resonance assigned to histidine is the only one significantly affected on the addition of sodium phosphate to sprotein indicating that some degree of phosphate binding occurs in both the absence and presence of phosphate this curve also lacks the low ph inflection observed in the histidine nmr titration curve in ribonuclease this difference presumably arise from a conformational between ribonuclease and the folded sprotein involving a carboxyl group
1233,in the years since the foundation of the schweizerische gesellschaft fur gastroenterologie medicine and with it GI have markedly changed new diseases and syndromes have been discovered and others have disappeared new knowledge in basic sciences influences progress in diagnosis and therapy in diagnostic methods the most evident advances are fiberendoscopy endophotography and biopsy and progress in roentgenology and immunology new drugs new surgical methods and controlled trials have improved treatment however each advance has its drawbacks the growing incidence of iatrogenic diseases the overwhelming literature the flood of congresses the recordbreaking mentality of many clinicians and the hunting and collecting instinct for interesting cases medical art a notion difficult to define is in danger of disappearing it means a harmony of knowledge skill experience intuition and the predominant desire to help the patient this means individualized medicine which is only possible by sympathetic dialogue with the patient not only by specialists in psychiatry or psychosomatics but by every doctor will be able to preserve medicine from inhumanity in spite of technology rationalization and the computer
1234,the results of clinical studies have suggested that inadequate preoperative mechanical preparation of the colon is a significant factor in the pathogenesis of disruption of colonic and colorectal anastomoses a possible explanation for the adverse effect of poor mechanical preparation is that ammonia released from feces has a cytotoxic effect on the healing anastomosis it has been suggested that acidification of the colonic lumen prevents the release of fecal ammonia and protects the anastomoses the effects of mechanical preparation of the colon and colonic acidification were studied in anastomoses in the left colon of rats Tc acidification was produced by the oral administration of a synthetic disaccharide lactulose solution mechanical preparation resulted in a significant increase in the bursting wall tension in anastomoses on the seventh postoperative day the oral administration of lactulose resulted in a reduction in the colonic mucosal ph but this was not accompanied by improved healing of anastomoses as judged by measurements of colonic bursting pressure bursting wall tension and total challagen content mechanical preparation of the colon is an important factor in the safety of colonic anastomosis however the results do not suggest that acidification of the colonic lumen significantly improves the quality of colonic healing
1235,the interaction of a series of antihistamines with monolayers of lalphadipalmitoyl lecithin has been examined an increase in the ML surface pressure was noted for monolayers spread on the antihistamine solutions suggesting penetration of the film by drug molecules at high surface pressures there was an apparent ejection of drug molecules from the film the ability of the antihistamines to increase surface pressure was correlated with their surface activity at the airsolution interface the effect of drug concentration on the magnitude of the surface pressure was examined for diphenhydramine hydrochloride application of the gibbs adsorption equation at low surface compressions indicated an approximate area per molecule for diphenhydramine in the film which was in good agreement with the value previously obtained at the airsolution interface preliminary measurements showed that the surface pressure increase was larger in the presence of phosphate buffer at ph it was not clear whether this effect was caused by the buffer components or was a ph effect
1236,various sites of ferricyanide reduction were studied in spinach chloroplasts it was found that in the presence of dibromothymoquinone a fraction of ferricyanide reduction was DBMIB sensitive implying that ferricyanide can be reduced by photosystem i as well as photosystem ii to separate ferricyanide reduction sites in PS ii orthophenanthroline and dichlorophenyl dimethylurea inhibitions were compared at various phs it was noted that at low ph ferricyanide reduction was not completely inhibited by orothophenanthroline at high phs however inhibition of ferricyanide reduction by orthophenanthroline was CR it was found that varying concentration of orthophenanthroline at a constant ph showed different degrees of inhibition in the study of ferricyanide reduction by photosystem ii various treatments affecting plastocyanin were performed it was found that tween or kcn treatments which inactivated plastocyanin did not CR inactivate ferricyanide reduction these data support the conclusion that ferricyanide accepts electrons both before and after plastoquinone in PS ii
1237,the rectal temperature of male rats was measured in a thermoneutral environment degrees c and at ambient temperatures of and degrees c unless otherwise specified all drugs were i.c.v. icv and all results are reported for the thermoneutral environment exposure to degrees c did not affect the rectal temperature but exposure to degrees c produced hyperthermia at and degrees c mug gaba produced hyperthermia which was longer lasting at the former ambient temperature gaba mug prevented the hyperthermic effect of exposure to degrees c and produced hypothermia in animals maintained at this temperature for hr a low dose mug of na produced hyperthermia and a higher dose mug hypothermia in rats pretreated with sodium salicylate ip mug gaba and mug na produced hypothermia instead of hyperthermia suggesting the release of pge in mediating hyperthermia the hypothermic effect of mug na and of gaba observed at degrees c was blocked by phentolamine an indication of the possibility of alphaadrenoceptor mediation
1238,extracellular nuclease produced by a marine vibrio sp CS no was purified by salting out with AS and by chromatography on a deaecellulose column and twice on a sephadex g column the nuclease was eluted as a single peak in which the deoxyribonuclease dnase activity and ribonuclease rnase activity appeared together polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis showed a single band of stained protein which had both dnase and rnase activity the molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be daltons when using partially purified enzyme from the deaecellulose column the optimum ph for activity was and the enzyme was activated strongly by m mg ions and stabilized by m ca ion these concentrations of mg and ca ions are similar to those of the two cations in seawater indeed the enzyme revealed high activity and strong stability when kept in seawater the presence of particulate matter such as cellulose powder chitin powder hyflosupercel kaolin and marine mud increased the stability of the enzyme when the hydrostatic pressure was increased from to atmospheres the decrements of the enzyme activity were more pronounced at and degrees c than at or degrees c the enzyme activity was restored after decompression to atm at degrees c
1239,larger spotted dogfish scyliorhinus stellaris were exposed to varied AT t in order to determine the behavior of extracellular ph phe pco and bicarbonate concentration as well as intracellular ph phi in three muscle types phe was found to vary with temperature slightly less than expected on the basis of the rule of constant relative alkalinity in juvenile deltaphdeltat per degree centigrade as well as in adult deltaphdeltat fish the absolute phe values of AD fish were about ph units higher than in juvenile fish arterial pco increased with rising temperature the increase being much more marked in adult than in juvenile fish extracellular bicarbonate concentration calculated from the ph and pco values measured in arterial blood was not maintained constant but diminished in juvenile and increased in adult fish with increasing temperature indicating that extracellular ph in dogfish is regulated by variations of both pco and bicarbonate concentration variations of intracellular ph with temperature deltaphideltat for white muscle for red muscle and for heart muscle were significantly different from the values of the extracellular compartment and except for white muscle significantly different from the condition for constant relative alkalinity deltaphdeltat these results are in agreement with the rule of constant relative alkalinity with respect to extracellular ph and possibly also with respect to an overall mean intracellular ph but the rule is not quantitatively followed by the individual body compartments and tissues
1240,pharmacokinetic and metabolic studies with hetilefrine were performed to assess the importance of a firstpass effect on the pharmacodynamic action of this sympathomimetic amine identical amounts of hactivity ca of the dose were excreted in the urine after intravenous or p.o. which indicates CR enteral absorption of the drug comparison of the areas under the plasma curves of unchanged etilefrine after both routes of administration resulted in a bioavailability factor of which can be explained by an extensive firstpass effect the time curve of plasma levels of etilefrine was compatible with an open compartment MM characterized by a rather large volume of distribution vd beta of and a predominant half life of hours the pharmacodynamic action corresponded to the amount of drug in the central compartment the major pathway of metabolism of etilefrine was conjugation to form the phenolic sulphate and a very minor proportion of the drug was excreted as the corresponding hydroxymandelic acid this metabolic pattern seems to confirm our hypothesis that phenylalkylamines with hydroxyl group in the mposition of the BZ ring are predominantly conjugated in contrast to phydroxylated compounds which are mainly deaminated
1241,the ability of dlpropranolol to block RS in response to various extrarenal stimuli such as hemorrhage and hypoglycemia has been interpreted to indicate the presence of an intrarenal beta receptor regulating renin release however two problems complicate this interpretation a the stimuli have effects outside the kidney and b dlpropranolol has a local anesthetic as well as a beta adrenergic blocking action in the present T0 the effects of a purely intrarenal stimulus in the form of renal nerve stimulation rns on renin secretion was examined the effects of dlpropranolol anesthetic and betablocking activity lpropranolol betablocking activity only and dpropranolol local anesthetic activity only on the renin response to rns were examined in a control group of animals two sequential rns increased mean renin secretion from to umin p less than and from to umin p less than in a second group the first rns increased renin secretion from to umin p less than but after dlpropranolol was given rns did not significantly alter renin secretion to umin in a third group the initial rns increased renin secretion from to umin p less than but after lpropranolol was given rns had no significant effect on RS to umin a fourth group of dogs showed a rise in renin secretion from to umin p less than in response to the first rns while the second rns given after an infusion of dpropranolol caused a rise in RS from to p less than the nature of the electrical stimulus was consistent in all CG and caused no detectable changes in renal or systemic hemodynamics or in urinary electrolyte excretion the results therefore indicate that renin secretion can be stimulated through intrarenal beta receptors independent of changes in SVR or renal hemodynamics or in tubular sodium reabsorption hence the effect of beta stimulation on renin secretion would appear to result from a direct action on the reninsecreting cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus
1242,in this paper the literature on helminthiasis in iran is reviewed and the distribution prevalence and intensity of infections caused by helminths are discussed a comparison of prevalence and intensity of infections was accomplished in the recent years by the author hookworm infections are found mostly in the north along the caspian sea but its prevalence is declining trichostrongylus are found in iran with a high prevalence in central country schistosoma haematobium is found in one province in the south but its prevalence is declining because of C1 scale control activities the guinea worm rarely occurs in iran the prevalence of fasciola hepatica is high among livestock and is occasionally found in man taenia saginata is found in most parts of iran taenia solium is seldom found in animals with a prevalence of trichinella spiralis is infrequently found in animals dioctophyma renale is found in straying dogs in the north or iran the percentage is oxyuriasis is widespread among children
1243,effects of alkalinity and hypertonicity on the motile behaviour of leptospira interrogans biflexa b were observed quantified and compared with effects previously shown by similar factors on the motility of eubacteria leptospira interrogans tolerated relatively high concentrations of hydroxide ions motility similar to that in controls was observed at ph values up to but at ph motility declined sharply with time of exposure and there was structural alteration visible as a blebbing of the cell envelope unlike the behaviour of eubacteria immobilization of l interrogans induced by XTT ions could not be reversed by lowering the ph it is suggested that by restricting entry of hydroxide ions the cell envelope protects its motility apparatus from adverse effects leptospira interrogans was completely immobilized in m and msucrose solutions unlike the eubacteria leptospires were incapable of spontaneous reversion to motile forms and resumption of motility was dependent on both concentration and time of exposure to sucrose deuterium oxide did not affect movement suggesting that even though leptospire endoflagella and the exoflagella of eubacteria are analogous the motile behaviour of l interrogans is significantly different from that of eubacteria
1244,study of cases of male subfertility led to a certain number of practical conclusions from a diagnostic viewpoint the fertility of an individual which is difficult to assess depends more on the motility than the number of spermatozoa this is most faithfully reflected in the crossed penetration test which defines the SQ of penetration of a control mucus the value of electron microscopic cytological study in the case of total asthenospermia or major monomorphous teratospermia reflecting an irreversible constitutional abnormality of the ultrastructure of the spermatozoon is emphasised from a therapeutic viewpoint recent progress has involved the technique of surgical treatment for varicocoele as well as hormone therapy it is essential not to neglect empirical minor aids indicated in the case of unexplained abnormalities homologous artifical insemination in the case of abnormalities in the volume of the ejaculate retard androgen therapy in the case of polyzoospermia from a prognostic viewpoint the distinction must be drawn between aetiologies of good prognosis of our success responsible for transient CA in spermatogenesis infections metabolic disturbances varicocoele and aetiologies with an unfavourable prognosis since they cause tubulopathies of greater or lesser severity with a lesional impairment of spermatogenesis
1245,the biotransformation of intramuscularly po clabeled transstilbene was investigated in both rabbits and rats in rabbits radioactivity was excreted in days almost exclusively in the urine in rats feces accounted for more than half of the total excretion in days hydroxylated metabolites in urine and feces were identified by thinlayer chromatography and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting they were hydroxy and dihydroxystilbene and the two monomethyl ethers of dihydroxystilbene and dihydroxybibenzyl in addition four polyhydroxylated metabolites of stilbene and bibenzyl were identified in rat urine by comparison of GLC retention times of their silyl derivatives with synthetic reference EDC they were trihydroxystilbene and dihydroxy trihydroxy and tetrahydroxybibenzyl oxidative cleavage of transstilbene to benzoic acid and OH and dihydroxybenzoic acid was established by the presence of both the free acids and conjugates of these EDC in both rabbit and rat urine their glycine conjugates were identified by TLC and quantitated by reverse isotope dilution procedures from unhydrolyzed rb and rat urine percentages obtained indicate that cleavage of transstilbene is more extensive in rabbits than in rats
1246,in order to test the range of ph values over which the titratable carried model for inorganic anion exchange is valid chloride selfexchange across human red blood cells was examined between ph and at decrees c it was found that chloride selfexchange flux had a minimum near ph and increased again with further increase in hydrogen ion activity the arrhenius activation energy for chloride exchange was greatly reduced at low ph values the chloride flux at ph did not show the saturation kinetics reported at higher ph values but was proportional to the value of the chloride concentration squared in addition the extent of inhibition of chloride selfexchange flux by phloretin was reduced at low ph our interpretation of these findings is that the carriermediated flux becomes a progressively smaller fraction of the total flux at lower ph values and that a different transport mode requiring two chloride ions to form the permeant species and having a low specificity and temperature dependence becomes significant below ph a possible mechanism for this transport is that chloride crosses red cell CM as dimers of hcl at these very low ph values
1247,in one experiment the effect on rumen ph of feeding with restricted amounts of whole or pelleted barley was studied with whole barley there was little variation in rumen ph associated with FF time but with pelleted barley the ph decreased from about before FF to about h after feeding the rate of disappearance of dried grass during incubation in the rumens of sheep receiving either whole or pelleted barley was studied in a second experiment T3 h incubation only mgg incubated had disappeared in the rumen of sheep receiving pelleted barley while mgg incubated had disappeared when it was incubated in the rumen of sheep receiving whole barley the voluntary intake of dried grass of lambs was studied in a third experiment when they received supplements of either or g whole or pelleted barleykg LW at the high level pelleted barley reduced intake of dried grass by gkg but whole barley reduced it by only gkg the digestibility of aciddetergent fibre was reduced more by pelleted barley than by whole barley but there was a tendency for a small increase in digestibility of the barley due to processing the implications of these findings on supplementation of roughages with cereals are discussed
1248,the velocity of the pantothenasecatalysed hydrolysis of pantothenate was studied over ph and in the presence of Ox or oxaloacetate as an inhibitor the phdependence of the reaction can be described by a kinetic equation containing two ionizations of the enzyme with one ionizable group located at the substratebinding site and the other at the inhibitorbinding site the km value of pantothenase to pantothenate depends on the buffer used and phosphate tends to give somewhat lower values than other buffers km also depends on ph the best activities being observed at basic ph values the phindependent km is mm in phosphate buffer at degrees c the corresponding kappm value at ph is mm the pk value of the ionizable group at the substratebinding site was measured by two methods from the phrate profile and from the phkm rofile pk is in phosphate buffer at degrees c ranging in various buffers between and the vant hoff enthalpies of ATP binding and h ion binding werekjmol respectively the inhibition by oxalate or oxaloacetate is of noncompetitive type and depends on ph the inhibitors being effective at acidic ph values the pk value of the ionizable group at the inhibitorbinding site was derived from the measurements of the k values over the ph range the pk value was in oxaloacetate inhibition the phindependent k being mm and the corresponding kappm about mm at ph phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride was capable of inactivating pantothenase
1249,substrateinduced conformational change of porcine muscle adenylate kinase ec is evidenced by a NC in circular dichroism spectra in the near ultraviolet in the absence of tryptophan in porcine muscle adenylate kinase the spectral change may be assigned to a perturbation of tyrosine chromophores the spectral change was specific for adenine nucleotide IB and was greater with atp than with amp in the xray model tyr and tyr are located at a hinge region of two domains which form a deep active site cleft and are therefore susceptible to conformational change on substrate IB adenylate kinase was treated with equimolar TNM the yellowcolored product separated from unmodified enzyme by substrate gradient elution on a phosphocellulose column had about mol of nitrotyrosine per mol of the enzyme by amino acid analysis and showed a slightly higher km value than native enzyme for adp km mm compared with mm for native adenylate kinase spectrophotometric titration of nitroadenylate kinase gave pka for the dissociation constant of the nitrotyrosyl hydroxyl group on binding atp the pka value increased to while amp binding caused very little change by peptide mapping of the carboxypeptidase digestion product mol of nitro group per mol of adenylate kinase was detected on tyr and a small amount of nitro group was also found on tyr from these results it is proposed that tyr is directly or indirectly involved in the IB of atp
1250,the steadystate kinetics of the interconversion of co and hco catalyzed by human carbonic anhydrase c was studied using ho and ho as solvents the phindependent parts of the parameters kcat and km are times larger in ho than in ho for both directions of the reaction while the ratios kcatkm show much smaller isotope effects with either co or hco as substrate the major ph dependence is observed in kcat while km appears independent of ph the pka value characterizing the phrate profiles is approximately unit larger in ho than in ho the hydrolysis of pnitrophenyl acetate catalyzed by human carbonic anhudrase c is approximately faster in ho than in ho in both solvents the pka values of the phrate profiles are similar to those observed for the cohco interconversion it is tentatively proposed that the ratelimiting step at saturating concentrations of co or hco is an intramolecular proton transfer between two ionizing CG in the AS site it cannot be decided whether the transformation between enzymebound co and hco involves a proton trnasfer or not
1251,rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase requires two divalent cations per AS site for catalysis of the enolization of pyruvate in the presence of adenosine triphosphate atp one divalent cation is bound directly to the enzyme and forms a second sphere complex with the bound atp site the second divalent cation is directly coordinated to the phosphoryl groups of atp and does not interact with the enzyme site the essential role of the divalent cation at site is shown by the requirement for mg or mn for the enolization of pyruvate in the presence of the substitution inert cratp complex the rate of detritiation of pyruvate shows a hyperbolic dependence of mn concentration in the presence of high concentrations of enzyme and cratp a dissociation constant for mn from the Pyr kinasemnatpcrpyruvate complex of mum is determined by the kinetics of detritiation of pyruvate and by parallel mn binding studies using electron paramagnetic resonance the essential role of the divalent cation at site is shown by the sigmoidal dependence of the rate of detritiation of Pyr on mn concentration in the presence of high concentrations of enzyme and atp yielding a KB of mum for mn from site this value is similar to the dissociation constant of the binary mnatp complex mum determined under similar conditions the rate of detritiation of pyruvate is proportional to the concentration of the pyruvate kinasemnatpmnpyruvate complex as determined by parellel kinetic and IB studies variation of the nature of the divalent cation at site in the presence of cratp causes only a twofold change in the rate of detritiation of pyruvate which does not correlate with the pka of the metalbound water variation of the nature of the divalent cation at both sites in the presence of atp causes a sevenfold variation in the rate of detritiation or pyruvate that correlates with the pka of the metalbound water the greater rate of enolization observed with cratp fits this correlation indicating that the electrophilicity of the nucleotide bound metal at site determines the rate of enolization of Pyr

1253,effects of pelleted and conventional citrus pulp as a replacement for corn with soybean meal added to keep protein comparable were tested in rations with urea and sugarcane bagasse for fistulated steers thus all rations were low in readily fermented carbohydrates other than those of corn or citrus pulp evaluation criteria were concentrations of urea in blood and of ph ammonia and volatile fatty acids of rumen fluid citrus pulp for diets and was or rumen fluid and blood were sampled h before and and h T3 feed was placed directly into the rumen no differences between pelleted and conventional pulp or among time trends were significant except that for both forms rumen ammonia was lower with the two highest percents of citrus pulp addition of citrus pulp at or of the ration reduced rumen ph blood urea and rumen ammonia decreased in steers fed or pulp thus the acetic to propionic ratio was higher butyric acid changed only in the time trend total volatile fatty acid concentrations were higher at and than at pulp they were higher at and than at
1254,two thin film culture systems the controlled environment steady state system ss and the rocker tube configuration of that system rt were used to identify some of the conditions that appear to maintain morphologic and functional characteristics of cells of human bone marrow explants in vitro the systems configuration assured continual gassing control and easy monitoring of the cultures cytocentrifuge preparations of media of specimens cultured in rt disclosed though in decreasing numbers various hematopoietic cells for periods exceeding one month hematopoietic cells shed from specimens cultured in the ss system were retained in the culture tubes cells of the myelocytic series predominated for the first two weeks while an increasing number of monocytes and macrophages appeared in the media of of older cultures histologic examination of cultured explants disclosed preservation of the marrow architecture and the persistence of hematopoietic cells specimens cultured in rt tubes tended to be less cellular than similar cultures placed in dialysis bags or as cultured in the ss system immunoglobulins ig were released into the culture media at a constant rate throughout the period of culture specimens that were cultured at a controlled ph of released to more than times as much ig as similar specimens maintained at a ph level of there were no definitive differences in ig C2 in the cultures maintained at comparable ph levels and overlaid with various co concentrations ie similarly no differences in ig levels were found in specimens cultured in media containing fetal bovine sera as opposed to horse sera
1255,the effect of copper and plastic intrauterine devices iud on the fibrinolytic activity of the endometrium was studied in the rat a copper or a plastic device was placed in one of the uterine horns while the other horn served as a control biopsy specimens were obtained from both horns and examined histochemically the copper concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy the fibrinolytic activity of the control horn was found to be localized to small vessels in the outer layer of the uterine wall while that of the endometrium was low plastic as well as copper iuds increased the FA which in contrast with what was seen in the controls was localized to the endometrium compared with the effect of the plastic device the increase in the FA induced by the copper device was more widespread in the endometrial area and was accompanied by an increase in the concentration of copper these findings might help to explain why the contraceptive effect of iuds is more reliable when they are partly coated with copper
1256,epinephrine and the alphaadrenergic agonist phenylephrine activated phosphorylase glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis from lactate in a dosedependent manner in isolated rat PC the halfmaximally active dose of epinephrine was m and of phenylephrine was m these effects were blocked by alphaadrenergic antagonists including phenoxybenzamine but were largely unaffected by betaadrenergic antagonists including propranolol epinephrine caused a transient fold elevation of adenosine monophosphate camp which was abolished by propranolol and other beta blockers but was unaffected by phenoxybenzamine and other alpha blockers phenoxybenzamine and propranolol were shown to be TPS for their respective adrenergic receptors and to not affect the actions of glucagon or exogenous camp neither epinephrine m phenylephrine m nor glucagon m inactivated GS in CL cells from fed rats when the glycogen synthase activity ratio glucose phosphate gl phosphate was increased from to by preincubation of such cells with mm glucose these agents substantially inactivated the enzyme incubation of hepatocytes from fed rats resulted in glycogen SD which was correlated with an increase in the GS activity ratio and a decrease in phosphorylase alpha activity in hepatocytes from fasted animals the glycogen synthase activity ratio was and epinephrine glucagon and phenylephrine were able to lower this significantly the effects of epinephrine and phenylephrine on the enzyme were blocked by phenoxybenzamine but were largely unaffected by propranolol maximal phosphorylase activation in hepatocytes from fasted rats incubated with m phenylephrine preceded the maximal inactivation of glycogen synthase addition of gl rapidly reduced in a dosedependent manner both basal and phenylephrineelevated phosphorylase alpha activity in HCs prepared from fasted rats glucose also increased the glycogen synthase activity ratio but this effect lagged behind the NC in phosphorylase phenylephrine m and glucagon x m decreased by onehalf the fall in phosphoryalse alpha activity seen with mm gl and markedly suppressed the elevation of glycogen synthase activity the following conclusions are drawn from these findings a the effects of epinephrine and phenylephrine on carbohydrate metabolism in rat CL PC cells are mediated predominantly by alphaadrenergic receptors b stimulation of these receptors by epinephrine or phenylephrine results in activation of phosphorylase and gluconeogenesis and inactivation of glycogen synthase by mechanisms not involving an increase in cellular camp c activation of betaadrenergic receptors by epinephrine leads to the accumulation of camp but this is associated with minimal activation of phosphorylase or inactivation of GS
1257,the rate and extent of acid consumption of an antacid suspension and tablet were evaluated by in vitro and in vivo techniques four different test procedures were used to estimate in vitro antacid reactivity in vivo effects were determined in the fasted and postcibal states in NHS by a radiotelemetry procedure the duration of elevation of intragastric ph greater than was in agreement with in vitro estimates of total acid consumption of the antacid there was also good correlation between onset extent and duration of in vivo antacid activity and a modified in vitro beekman antacid test procedure there was no significant difference in antacid activity of the tablet or suspension in either in vitro or in vivo test procedures a wide variation in antacid activity was observed between subjects and also in the fasted versus postcibal states these studies emphasize the requirements for standardization of antacid products by comparactive in vitro and in vivo evaluations to facilitate individualized dose titration of the antacid in each patient and correlation of the acid secretion rate in various types of gi disease with the antacid dose
1258,we have isolated mutant strains nit of salmonella typhimurium that are defective in nitrogen metabolism they have a reduced ability to use a variety of compounds including glutamate proline Arg nacetylglucosamine alanine and adenosine as sole nitrogen source in addition although they grow normally on high concentrations of ammonium chloride greater than mm as nitrogen source they grow substantially more slowly than wild type at low concentrations less than mm we postulated that the inability of these strains to utilize low concentrations of ammonium chloride accounts for their poor growth on other nitrogen sources the specific biochemical lesion in strains with a nit mutation is not known however mutant strains have no detectable alteration in the MICs of glutamine synthetase glutamate synthetase or glutamate dehydrogenase the enzymes known to be involved in assimilation of ammonia a nit mutation is suppressed by secondsite mutations in the structural gene for glutamine synthetase glna that decrease glutamine synthetase activity
1259,the eggs of dicrocoelium dendriticum were induced to open by solutions of formic acid and caproic acid table the miracidia hatched in ofree water T3 the eggs had been dried with n or in vacuum the miracidia were able to live for hours if water contained mm nacl mm kcl and mm cacl caions are obviously necessary for the mobility of miracidia the experimental use of intestinal juice of the roman snail helix pomatia gave hatching results which were dependent on the absence of o exposure to n and the presence of bacteria with a still unknown function the dependence on ph seems to be indirect abb studies on the permeabilities of the egg shell and the embryonic membrane vitelline membrane the evidence of an oligosaccharide abb liberated from the spaltraum abb during eggopening and the determination of the osmotic pressure of the hatching process hatching in osmols sucrose ml ho abb led to the following hypothesis of hatching mechanism after the activation of the granular gland of the miracidium an enzyme is released into the extraembryonic spaltraum a polysaccharide is digested to an oligosaccharide which cannot permeate the egg shell and the embryonic membrane the rising OP bursts off the operculum
1260,despite its imperfections arteriography when it demonstrates aneurysms is an important PE in diagnosis in all those cases in which histological findings are not definitive it should be carried out before renal biopsy given the risk of traumatic rupture of a possible aneurysm the discovery of isolated distal arterial stenoses is not characteristic though in the presence of a suggestive clinical picture amy be considered as an argument in favour of the diagnosis they occur frequently in the arteries of the digestive tract even in the absence of any abdominal symptoms or signs arteriography also has a prognostic value in establishing the extent of arterial lesions and finally is useful in the diagnosis of certain complications such as visceral haematomas and digestive haemorrhages we thus feel that polyarteritis nodosa should be the object of a CR V1 exploration including aortography with selective renal studies but also coeliomesenteric opacification in the light of the clinical context the distal limb arteries may also be explored thus the diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa is not purely histological but also arteriographic
1261,the activity of serotonergic ht neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus was inhibited by the iv administration of certain AP drugs methiothepin clozapine and thioridazine however other AP agents chlorpromazine haloperidol and pimozide did not inhibit raphe cell firing the GABA potency of these drugs on raphe activity correlates with reported central noradrenergic blocking efficacy an alphaadrenergic blocking agent piperoxane but not the betablocking agents propranolol and mj inhibited raphe activity when administered systemically all of these drugs appear to act indirectly since they and ne have relatively weak or variable effects when applied microiontophoretically to raphe neurons the depressant effects of certain antipsychotic drugs and piperoxane on ht SN appears to be mediated by a cnetral adrenergic system since the depression could be reversed by the catecholamine releasing agents and damphetamine the depression could be abolished by destruction of adrenergic pathways in the cns by chemical mechanical or electrothermic lesions while a precise localization has not yet been obtained the data suggest that these drug effects may be mediated by an adrenergic pathway ascending from the lower BS
1262,the role of descending spinal catecholamine cacontaining SF in cardiovascular regulation was examined monoaminecontaining fibers were visualized by fluorescence histochemical methods at the cervical thoracic and lumbar spinal segments two major groups of descending cacontaining axons were located in the lateral funiculus at the midcervical spinal level at the thoracolumbar spinal segments cacontaining terminals were concentrated mostly around cells of the IML nucleus in addition a distinct cacontaining fasciculus was observed at the level of the sympathetic nucleus which appeared to course toward the opposite site of the cord to evaluate the role of the efferent cacontaining fibers changes in heart rate arterial pressure femoral blood flow and calculated peak vascular resistance were elicited by electrical stimulation of selected sites in the midcervical spinal cord although changes in femoral flow and arterial pressure were evoked from many midcervical CS there was a distinct correlation between the magnitude of peak femoral resistance elevation and density of cacontaining axons activated furthermore efferent spinal vasoconstrictor outflow to the hindlimbs crosses below the cervical level this observation is in good agreement with fluorescence microscopy studies revealing cacontaining SF which appear to decussate pharmacological studies also were undertaken to evaluate transmission in spinal vasopressor pathways in these studies alphaadrenergic receptor antagonists and agonists were perfused into the spinal SAS HR rate arterial pressure femoral flow and femoral resistance responses elicited from efferent spinal pathways were significantly att following superfusion of the spinal cord with the alphaantagonists be heat and phentolamine it was shown that inhibition of the centrally evoked responses was due to actions of the alphaantagonists at a spinal locus and not due to peripheral vascular alphareceptor blockade spinal perfusion with the alphareceptor agonist norepinephrine potentiated cardiovascular responses likewise loading with the norepinephrine F0 dihydroxylphenylalanine ldopa enhanced vasoconstrictor responses evoked in the crossperfused hindlimb of pchlorophenylalaninepretreated cats these observations support the idea that bulbospinal cacontaining SF relay excitatory impulses to preganglionic vasoconstrictor neurons and that spinal alphaadrenergic receptor activation is necessary for transmission of this information
1263,both gastrin and the VN play a part in the pathogenesis of the DU ulcer which of these two factors is of greater significancethis problem is still subject to discussion as is the question whether other factors such as duodenal neutralization are more important than hitherto assumed at this time no reliable and harmless drugs that speed up the healing of duodenal ulcers and prevent relapses are yet available candidates for this are h receptor blockers prostaglandines and possibly substances resembling sec only some of the participants considered it necessary to do endoscopic and radiological followups in duodenal ulcers PT gastric vagotomy for the treatment of DUs is still undergoing clinical trials at present this method should only be used by surgeons with a special interest in gastric surgery who also dispose of the technology and the staff for careful postoperative checks on these patients the advantages of proximal gastric vagotomy consist in sparing truncation low mortality and good functional results in gastric ulcerscontrary to DU onesmalignancy should always be suspected if medical treatment does not lead to pCR within a few months surgery must be performed many surgeons still prefer resection to vagotomy and excision in the management of gastric ulcers
1264,following four generations of inbred mating brothersister in three direct lineages of cba strain mice sterility appeared which from that generation forward became more frequent the genital organs in animals of both sexes were altered there was a noticeable occurrence of cysts in the ovaries of female animals already following the third month in mice approximately one year of age this condition was followed by cystic glandular hyperplasia of the endometrium sometimes complicated by disturbances in blood circulation inflammation or even malignancy in some female animals manifesting due to cysts completely degenerated ovaries the rest of the genital system was severely atrophic male animals frequently showed severe atrophy of the seminiferous epithelium along with preserved interstitial cells and hypertrophic seminal vesicles these pathological changes represent an independent nosologic unit for which the label genital dyscrinism has been proposed the authors have considered an endocrine mechanism as the possible cause of these pathological changes which are presumed to be genetically CS
1265,a single electroconvulsive shock ecs of v for s increased the concentration of rat brain hydroxyindoleacetic acid hiaa but did not alter BB hydroxytryptamine ht or tryptophan concentrations h later a single ecs decreased ht synthesis h and h later synthesis was back to normal T3 hours the ecstreated rats did not show greater hyperactivity produced by the increased BB ht accumulation following administration of ltryptophan and tranylcypromine at any time up to h later this suggests that a single electroshock does not alter ht functional activity twentyfour hours after the final ecs of a series of shocks given once daily the rats were given tranylcypromine and ltryptophan they displayed greater hyperactivity than control rats not treated with ecs suggesting that ecs increases ht functional activity brain concentrations of ht hiaa and tryptophan were then unchanged by ecs ht synthesis and accumulation of ht following tranylcypromine and ltryptophan were not altered by ecs the hyperactivity following administration of the ht agonist methoxy DMT was enhanced by repeated day ecs suggesting altered postsynaptic responses to ht receptor stimulation repeated ecs enhanced locomotor activity following tranylcypromine and LD it did not alter brain noradrenaline or dopamine concentrations the latent period before a pentylenetetrazolinduced convulsion was shortened by repeated ecs following repeated ecs there appears to be increased neuronal sensitivity to certain stimuli producing centrally mediated behavioural stimulation this is discussed in relation to the mechanism by which electroconvulsive therapy ect produces its therapeutic effect
1266,the effect of hreceptor blockade on intragastric acidity was studied in nine normal males the ph of their gastric contents was measured at hourly daytime and two hourly nighttime intervals for hours the subjects ate identical meals drank identical volumes of fluid and smoked the same number of cigarettes during the two study days their physical activity was unrestricted in a ward environment blood cimetidine and plasma gastrin were measured in serial blood samples the nine subjects were treated in random sequence with cimetidine g on one day and placebo capsules on the other the drug was given in four divided doses four subjects received it before and five T3 the three main meals all took the fourth dose at HS replicate studies in an additional subject given PL on both T0 days showed good reproducibility r p less than cimetidine therapy decreased intragastric acidity in all nine subjects the decrease was similar in the two groups taking the drug before or T3 meals mean h intragastric hydrogen ion activity being lowered by and respectively nocturnal anacidity was recorded in only two of samples administration of cimetidine before meals produced earlier and higher drug blood C2 than postprandial medication but when it was taken after food the blood C2 were highest at the time when the buffer capacity of the food was waning blood concentrations of cimetidine exceeded the sec ic level for most of the time between doses the results show that cimetidine gday in four divided doses produces a striking and consistent decrease of intragastric acidity although variation in the timing of the dose in relation to meals did not affect the decrease of acidity the absorption data suggest that patients should take the drug after meals
1267,the monoaminesynthesizing enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase th dopaminebetahydroxylase dbh and tryptophan hydroxylase trh were immunocytochemical localized in dopaminergic noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons of rat BB by light and electron microscopy in dopaminergic and serotonergic SN the respective synthesizing enzymes th and trh were distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the neuronal perikarya dendrites axons and terminals the most selective accumulation of reaction product for the specific enzyme was associated a in perikarya with endoplasmic reticulum golgi apparatus and MTs b in processes with microtubules and c in terminals with dense granules or clear vesicles the labeled terminals were characterized by their content of labeled organelles and the absence of synaptic junctions in noradrenergic neurons both th and dbh were localized in the perikarya similar to th in dopamine neurons th and dbh differed in their localization within PT axons and dendrites in that th was associated with MTs but dbh was not these results provide ultrastructural evidence to suggest that monoamines may be a synthesized by enzymes which are associated with different organelles depending on the portion of the neuron and the type of enzyme b synthesized in both axons and dendrites and c released from terminals without postsynaptic membrane specializations
1268,a method of isolating polynucleotidephosphorylase pnpase containing polyribosome fraction from rat liver is described pnpase is found to be bind to rna in polyribosomes with weak electrostatic bonds which are easily broken down in a weak alkaline medium with ionic strength more than betaplabelled adp gdp udp and cdp are found among the products of endogenous rna degradation in the fraction of total polyribosomes in the presence of porthophosphate a considerable change in the base composition of pnpdegraded rna is observed at different incubation times of total polyribosomes with porthophosphate gcau ratio increased from to and purinespyrimidines ratiofrom to with the increase of the incubation time specific activity of pnp in ribosome fractions obtained under UC of total polyribosomes in succrose density gradient m increased in the direction from the fraction of heavy polysomes to trimers and dimers and then dropped at the region of monomers s particles the data obtained give no possibility to determine the type of pnpbound rna in polyribomes of rat CL
1269,the kinetics of sheep kidney gammaglutamyl transpeptidase was studied using a novel substrate lalphamethylgammaglutamyllalphaaminobutyrate when the ATP was incubated with the enzyme in the presence of an amino acid or peptide acceptor the corresponding lalphamethylgammaglutamyl derivatives of the acceptors were formed in the absence of acceptor only hydrolysis occurred and no transpeptidation products were detected the presence of the methyl group on the alphacarbon apparently prevents enzymatic transfer of the lalphamethylgammaglutamyl residue to the amino group of the substrate itself autotranspeptidation when the enzyme was incubated with conventional substrates such as glutathione or gammaglutamylpnitroanilide and an amino acid acceptor hydrolysis autotranspeptidation and transpeptidation to the acceptor occurred concurrently initial velocity measurements in which the concentration of lalphamethylgammaglutamyllalphaaminobutyrate was varied at several fixed acceptor concentrations and either the release of alphaaminobutyrate or the formation of the transpeptidation products was determined yielded results which are consistent with a pingpong mechanism modified by a hydrolytic shunt a scheme of such a mechanism is presented this mechanism predicts the formation of an alphamethylgammaglutamylenzyme intermediate which can react with an amino acid to form the transpeptidation product or in the absence of or in the presence of low concentrations of amino acids can react with water to form the hydrolytic products kinetic derivations for the reaction of the enzyme with the conventional ATP gammaglutamylpnitroanilide predict either linear or nonlinear doublereciprocal plots depending on the prevalence of the hydrolytic autotranspeptidation or transpeptidation reactions the results of kinetic experiments confirmed these predictions
1270,the phosphorylated form of CL glycogen phosphorylase alphaglucan orthophosphate alphaglucosyltransferase ec phosphorylase a is AS and easily measured while the dephosphorylated form phosphorylase b in contrast to the muscle enzyme has been reported to be essentially inactive even in the presence of amp we have purified both forms of phosphorylase from rat liver and studied the characteristics of each phosphorylase b activity can be measured with our assay conditions the phosphorylase b we obtained was stimulated by high concentrations of sulfate and was a substrate for muscle phosphorylase kinase whereas phosphorylase a was inhibited by sulfate and was a ATP for liver phosphorylase phosphatase substrate IB to phosphorylase b was poor km glycogen mm glucosep mm compared to phosphorylase a km glycogen mm km glucosep mm CL phosphorylase b was AS in the absence of amp however amp lowered the km for glucosep to mm for purified phosphorylase b and to mm for the enzyme in CE ka mm using AGA substrate buffer and amp concentrations assay conditions have been developed which allow determination of phosphorylase a and of the phosphorylase b activity in liver extracts interconversion of the two forms can be demonstrated in vivo under acute stimulation and in vitro with little change in total activity a decrease in total phosphorylase activity has been observed T3 prolonged starvation and in diabetes
1271,LL was isolated and identified from the gastric contents of patients with gastric ulcer and erosive and atrophic gastritis the methods used involved methanolic extration column chromatography on silica gel and sephadex gel filtration followed by preparative thin SL chromatography identification of lysolecithin was verified in one sample by thin layer chromatography and elementary analysis a method for quantitation of lysolecithin in human gastric fluid for routine clinical analysis is described based on the procedure used for identification of this phospholipid further a hemolysis test is proposed for screening gastric contents for lysolecithin concentrations above approximately mg ml with the quantitative method an average concentration of mg of lysolecithin in ml gastric content was found in the group of patients the screening test was positive in all samples but was negative with native gastric juice in persons serving as controls when the gastric fluid of the controls was concentrated however samples gave a positive hemolytic reaction from these specimens the lysolecithin concentration was found to average mg ml these findings afford evidence that LL may be involved as a factor in the pathogenesis of gastric ulceration
1272,the number of protons ejected per pair of electrons passing each energyconserving site in the electron transport chain the hsite ratio has been investigated in rat liver mitochondria by means of the oxygen PP technique introduced by mitchell and moyle biochem j the usual hsite values of observed by this method were found to be substantially underestimated as a result of the influx of phosphate into the mitochondria this was shown by three different kinds of experiments addition of nethylmaleimide or mersalyl inhibitors of mitochondrial phosphate transport increased the hsite ratio from to the dependence of this effect on the concentration of either inhibitor was identical with that for inhibition of phosphate transport added phosphate diminished the hsite ratio to values below in the absence of nethylmaleimide nethylmaleimide protected the elevated hsite ratio of against the deleterious effect of added phosphate but did not prevent a lowering effect of weak acid anions such as hydroxybutyrate prior washing of mitochondria to remove the endogenous phosphate that leaks out during the anaerobic preincubation led to hsite ratios near which were not increased by nethylmaleimide addition of low concentrations of phosphate to such phosphatedepleted mitochondria decreased the hsite ratio to addition of nethylmaleimide returned the ratio to lowering the temperature to degrees which slows down phosphate transport led to hsite values of even in the absence of nethylmaleimide the hsite ratio of observed in the absence of phosphate movements was not dependent on any narrowly limited set of experimental conditions it occurred with either ca or k in the presence of valinomycin as mobile permeant cation it was independent of the concentration of succinate oxygen mitochondria or rotenone additions of ca li or na and was independent of medium ph between and inhibitors of the transport of ions or acids other than phosphate did not affect the hsite ratio these results indicate that reuptake of endogenous phosphate lost from mitochondria during anaerobic preincubation reduces the observed h ejection and leads to underestimated hsite ratios of in the oxygen pulse method when phosphate movements are eliminated by the procedures described above the observed hsite ratio is about this value appears to be closer to the true hsite ratio for the primary h ejection process during electron transport
1273,red cell concentrations of hemoglobin mchc h na k mg cl were measured in femoral venous blood of six UT ut six endurance trained tr and three semitrained st subjects during graded increasing work and mkps min on each step on a bicycle ergometer before exercise no significant differences were detected for the measured variables when comparing ut and tr during exercise mchc na k and mg remained constant indicating lack of water shift into the erythrocytes in spite of a marked acidosis lowest ph blood value this lack resulted from an elevated extracellular osmolality hery and clery maximally increased by x eqkg ho and meql respectively the NC was markedly greater in ut than in tr at equal load however if h ery and cl ery were related to ph of whole blood differences between groups almost disappeared and the ions were distributed as predictable from in vitro experiments fitzsimmons and sendroy behaviour of h and cl may be of importance for oxygen dissociation under in vivo conditions
1274,hlalprenolol a potent competitive beta adrenergic antagonist binds to sites in rat pineal gland membranes the properties of these binding CS were compared to those of the receptors which mediate the beta adrenergic activation of pineal adenylate cyclase both sites are highly stereospecific the lstereoisomers of alprenolol and propranolol were at least two orders of magnitude more potent than the dstereoisomers in inhibiting isoproterenolstimulated adenylate cyclase or hlalprenolol IB the dissociation constants kd of the lstereoisomers of both alprenolol and propranolol were to nm as determined by competition for binding CS or by inhibition of isoproternolstimulated adenylate cyclase beta adrenergic agonists which stimulated adenylate cyclase also competitively inhibited the binding of hlalprenolol they showed the same order of potency isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than or equal to EN and the same individual affinities in the two systems alpha adrenergic blockers were ineffective in inhibiting either adenylate cyclase stimulation or hlalprenolol binding isoproternol stimulation of adenylate cyclase acrivity and hlalprenolol IB were rapid and rapidly reversible the hlalprenolol IB sites were saturable and bound pmol of ligand per mg of added protein the data suggest that the binding of hlalprenolol occurs at sites indistinguishable from the pineal beta adrenergic receptor
1275,the wang anxiety rating scale wars was designed to evaluate degrees of anxiety in patients receiving anxiolytic medication wars contains pertinent symptoms of anxiety nervousness restlessness excitability irritability worrying disturbed concentration palpitation insomnia hostility tremors smoking and excessive perspiration frequently encountered SE of anxiolytic medications are excluded the validity of the wars was determined by correlation with the hamilton anxiety rating scale hars in a singleblind study in which chronically anxious patients consecutively received placebo three days mg clorazepate dipotassium two weeks and mg clorazepate dipotassium two weeks both anxiety scales a side effect scale and a global assessment were completed at regular intervals periods results show highly significant correlation p less than between wars and hars for periods greater rho between hars and side effect scale than between wars and side effect scale greater correlation between wars and global assessment than between hars and PGA correlated changes in scores for wars hars and global assessment demonstrate tau of active medication
1276,dsDNA dnadependent ribonucleic acid rna polymerase ec from acinetobacter calcoaceticus was purified to apparent homogeneity and its properties were compared with those of the escherichia coli b enzyme the molecular weights of the two native AS enzymes as well as their alpha and beta subunits appeared to be similar no S1 corresponding to that of sigma from e coli was found and furthermore no separation between the beta subunits could be detected by gel electrophoresis a number of different dnas were transcribed by the enzyme from a calcoaceticus maximal rna synthesis occurred at ph mm mg or mm mn and at a total ionic strength of higher ionic strengths led to increasing inhibition of transcription and at mu complete inhibition was observed the mechanism of inhibition of salt was not related to the initiation event as observed with t core rna polymerase rkleppe in an attempt to understand the mechanism of inhibition by salt the effect of ionic strength on the sedimentation properties of the enzyme was investigated at LIS enzyme species with sedimentation coefficients sw of s s and s were present in buffers with higher ionic strengths the relative amounts of the s species decreased it is suggested therefore that the inhibition of activity at higher salt concentrations is caused by a decrease in concentration of the active enzyme species
1277,the dna of a sulfonamideresistant pneumococcal strain heterozygous for sulrc and that of three highly resistant and persistently heterozygous cd transformants derived by introducing sulrc marker into a stable sulfonamide resistant strain sulrd were studied to analyze the genetic basis of their merodiploidy the physical properties of the native and denatured dna from the heterozygotes and the nonheterozygous strains were not distinguishable the denaturability and the renaturability of biological activity for the heterozygous markers were essentially identical to those of the normal markers the heterozygosity extends to the closely linked locus giving rise to four different configurations of cd and cd transformants characterized by their frequencies of segregation and donormarker MICs the markeractivity ratios and the frequency of cotransfer of heterozygous markers were found to remain the same in each when the donor dna was native denatured or reannealed without fractionation or reannealed after remixing of resolved strands possible models were weighed against these observations and these considerations led to the suggestion that tandem duplication of a gene region may be responsible for the heterozygosity and instability of this region a more detailed examination of this model will be presented in an accompanying paper
1278,the results of electrooculographic recordings made T3 caloric vestibular stimulation cog in severe head injured patients are discussed it was found that the cog correlates with the state of consciousness of the patients the rate of improvement of the cog correlates with the rate of the clinical improvement a prediction of the duration of unconsciousness can be made by repeated cog scores as well as by repeated scoring of the clinical state in all patients a paradoxical response is present except in those who have regained clear consciousness and in those persisting in a VS so the presence of a paradoxical response indicates the possibility of further improvement it was supposed that in patients with a paradoxical response a PET brain dysfunction was present which was at least partly caused by disturbed neurotransmitter metabolism therapeutic trials with ldopa and physostigmine were successful in patients with a paradoxical response but without any result in those without this phenomenon the responses to ldopa and to physostigmine are related respectively to motor pattern and to verbal or nonverbal communication
1279,a new procedure is described for selecting nitrogenasederepressed mutants based on the method of brenchley et al brenchley je prival mj and magasanik b j biol chem for isolating histidaseconstitutive mutants of a nonnfixing bacterium nitrogenase levels of the new mutants in the presence of nh were as high as of the nitrogenase activity detected in the absence of nh PSA characterization of these nitrogen fixation nif derepressed mutants reveals that they fall into three classes three mutants strains sk and requiring glu for growth synthesize nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase constitutively in the presence of nh a second class of mutants strains sk and requiring glutamine for growth produces derepressed levels of nitrogenase activity and synthesized catalytically inactive glutamine synthetase protein as determined immunologically a third class of glutaminerequiring nitrogenasederepressed mutants strain sk and synthesizes neither a catalytically active glutamine synthetase enzyme nor an immunologically crossreactive glutamine synthetase protein fprime complementation analysis reveals that the mutant strains sk map in a segment of the klebsiella chromosome corresponding to the region coding for glutamine synthetase since the mutant strains sk and sk produce inactive glutamine synthetase protein it is concluded that these mutations map within the glutamine synthetase structural gene
1280,clostridium perfringens sialidase was purified by affinity chromatography kinetic properties of the enzyme were examined with sialyllactose and with mixed sialoglycolipids gangliosides as substrates with the latter ATP in m trisacete in the absence of strong electrolyte the ph optimum for enzymatic activity was addition of strong electrolyte to m nac to the reaction medium caused an acidic shift and a broadening of the ph optimum enzymatic activity at ph rose approximately fold a concomitant loss of activity at ph was also observed the alteration of enzymatic activity caused by strong electrolyte were dependent upon changes in vmax km remained nearly invariant thus a reversible transition of the enzyme from a relatively inactive to a highly active form occurred as a CF of strong electrolyte concentration determination of the pk values of the active functional groups of c perfringens sialidase revealed that the effects of strong electrolyte were exerted upon the pka group of the enzyme strong electrolyte appeared to shield unfavorable electrostatic interactions between polyanionic sialoglycolipid micelles and the enzyme molecule thus protecting the pka group from inactivation in comparision with the effects of strong electrolyte upon enzymatic activity toward the sialoglycolipid substrate those observed with the monovalent substrate sialyllacthose were minor collectively these findings indicate that ionic environment may effectively control the activity and relative ATP specificity of c perfringens sialidase at a given ph furthermore they explain the low ph optima and skewed ph profiles previously reported for enzymatic activity toward high molecular weight substrates
1281,the fleas hind legs are the chief source of jumping power but in species which execute C1 jumps takeoff is accelerated by elastic energy released from a resilin pad rat with the wing hinge ligaments of flying insects situated in the pleural arch a central click mechanism operated by a rapid twitch of the trochanteral depressor the starter muscle synchronizes the separate sources of energy which power the jump cinÃ© photos confirm the morphological evidence that the flea takes off from the trochanters not the tarsi the loss of wings associated with lateral compression of the body and the shortening of the pleural ridge which thus lowers the position of the pleural arch together with modifications of the direct and indirect flight muscles are some of the main morphological features associated with the change from a flying to a saltatorial mode of progression the fleas takeoff basically resembles that of other panorpoid insects diptera mecoptera etc the release of elastic energy from the pleural arch is a system by which the force used to move the wings of flying insects is rapidly fed back into the legs and adds SP to the jump
1282,intraparenchymal renal aneurysms have been reported with increasing frequency yet to our knowledge this subject has not been reviewed in radiologic literature the spectrum of such aneurysms includes congenital aneurysms those AA to disease usually affecting the main renal arteries those associated with renal masses microaneurysms and false or pseudo aneurysms seemingly unrelated conditions such as atherosclerosis bacterial endocarditis and trauma can all produce similar radiographic appearance of aneurysmal dilatation within the kidney albeit through differing mechanisms in addition there are several etiologies for renal microaneurysms even though this finding has been considered specific for polyarteritis in the past although there were a few guidelines for recognizing certain specific etiologies based solely on the angiographic appearance it must be appreciated that many of these conditions may be indistinguishable the possibility of hemorrhage from such intrarenal aneurysms and the question of whether such lesions are responsible for renovascular hypertension are also discussed
1283,newcastle disease virus ndv can interact in at least two ways with rat t cells by adsorbing to circulating lymphocytes the virus can transiently deflect the cells from lymph nodes and inflammatory exudates induced in the peritoneal cavity TA are affected regardless of age state of activation or position in the MI cycle the effect is reversible and is mediated not only by infectious indv but also by uvndv which cannot achieve a complete replication cycle in eggs but indv has another lasting effect on G1 t cells it is revealed in the failure of virustreated TD lymphocytes to transfer cellular resistance to listeria monocytogenes delayedtype hypersensitivity to soluble antigens of the parasite and the permanent exclusion of labeled sphase lymphocytes from inflammatory foci activated t cells are inhibited by virus multiplicites which have little if any effect upon the proliferative potential of antigensensitive TA or localization of labeled small lymphocytes in lymph NO the underlying mechanism has not been determined however there are reasons for thinking that ndv has a lethal effect upon activated t cells because the latter are permissive for virus replication

1294,specific betaadrenergic receptors present in membrane S9 of frog erythrocytes were identified by IB of hdihydroalprenolol a potent competitive betaadrenergic antagonist the hdihydroalprenolol binding sites could be solubilized by treatment of a purified erythrocyte membrane fraction with the plant glycoside digitonin but not by treatment with a wide variety of other detergents the binding sites appeared to be soluble by several independent experimental criteria including a failure to sediment of x g for hours b passage through mu millipore filters c chromatography on sepharose b gels and d electron microscopy the soluble receptor sites retained all of the essential characteristics of the MB sites namely rapid and reversible binding of betaadrenergic agonists and antagonists strict stereospecificity toward both betaadrenergic agonists and antagonists appropriate structureactivity relationships saturability of the sites at low concentrations of ligand no affinity for alphaadrenergic drugs nonphysiologically active catechol EDC and catecholamine metabolites based on gel chromatography in the presence of detergent the molecular weight of the soluble receptor is estimated to be no greater than to equilibrium IB studies indicated a kd for the soluble receptor of nm hill coefficients nh of and curved scatchard plots suggested the presence of negatively cooperative interactions among the solubilized receptors in agreement with previous findings with the MB sites kinetic studies indicated an association rate constant k x m min and a reverse rate constant k x min at degrees the kinetically derived kd kk of nm is in reasonable PA with that determined by equilibrium studies the soluble receptors were labile at temperature greater than degrees but could be stabilized with high concentrations of edta guanidine hydrochloride and urea produced concentrationdependent losses of IB activity which were partially reversible upon dialysis TR and phospholipase a both degraded the soluble receptors but a variety of other proteases and phospholipases as well as dnase and rnase were without effect experiments with groupspecific reagents indicated that free lysine tryptophan serine and sulfhydryl CG may be important for receptor binding these studies suggest that the receptor is probably a protein which requires lipids for PET integrity data obtained with the solubilized IB sites are consistent with the contention that these sites represent the physiologically relevant betaadrenergic receptors which have been extracted from the membranes with full retention of their properties

1296,glutamate dehydrogenase from candida utilis undergoes a reversible conformational transition between an AS and an inactive state at low ph and low temperature this conformational transition can also be followed by fluorescence measurements the temperaturedependent equilibrium between the AS and the inactive state is characterized by a transition temperature of degrees c and a delta h value of kcalmol kjmol the temperature dependence of the enzymic activity above degrees c yields an activation energy of kcalmol kjmol a larger value than that for the beef liver enzyme kcalmol kjmol in contrast to the yeast enzyme the arrhenius plot is linear and therefore the beef CL enzyme is not transformed into an inactive conformation at low temperatures sedimentation analysis shows that the inactivation of the candida utilis enzyme is not caused by change in the quaternary structure the ph dependence of the conformational transition at low ph measured by fluorescence change is characterized by a pk value of for the enzyme in the absence and of for the enzyme in the presence of oxoglutarate with a hill coefficient of in both cases similar results are found when the ph dependence of the enzymic activity is analyzed with the beef CL enzyme the same pk value is obtained but with a hill coefficient of indicating cooperativity only in the case of the candida utilis enzyme the best fit of the ph dependence of the rate constants of the fluorescence changes was obtained with pk values of and for the active and the inactive state respectively in this MM the lowest time constant which is obtained at the ph of the equilibrium was found to be s preincubation experiments with the ATP oxoglutarate but not with the coenzyme shift the equilibrium to the active conformation the coenzyme obviously reduces the rate constant of the conformational transition the sedimentation coefficient so w and the molecular weight were found to be s and respectively the enzyme molecule is built up by six polypeptide chains each having a molecular weight of
1297,ornithine carbamoyltransferase from escherichia coli w was purified to homogeneity the enzyme has a molecular weight of it is composed of three apparently identical subunits with molecular weights of the mechanism of the ornithine carbamoyltransferase enzyme system from e coli w was investigated kinetically by using the approach of product inhibition and deadend inhibition of both forward and reverse reactions on the basis of the kinetic data and binding studies it appears that the mechanism of the reaction involves a compulsory sequence of ATP binding to the enzyme in which carbamoylphosphate is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme and phosphate the last product to be released the same studies also indicate that the mechanism involves deadend complexes the reaction mechanism appears consistent with that proposed by theorell and chance values have been determined for the michaelis and dissociation constants involved in the combination of each reactant with the enzyme comparison of the values for the kinetic constants which are common to both forward and reverse reaction have shown that they are always of a comparable magnitude
1298,plasma carcinoembryonic antigen cea and serum enzyme levels of PHI phi gammaglutamyl transpeptidase psigtp and lactate dehydrogenase ldh were measured in patients with malignancy levels were higher in patients particularly with gi breast and lung cancers than in normals or in patients with CA in clinical remission elevations of cea and of all three enzymes in blood were most frequent in patients with hepatic metastases cea elevations correlated directly with phi levels seventyeight percent of patients with M1 gi cancer could be identified by cea greater than ngml alone as well as with breast cancer and with lung cancer but only of other cancers could be identified by cea alone cea or one or more enzymes was elevated in of metastatic breast cancer patients of lung cancer and of other cancers but enzyme measurement did not increase ID of gi CA over that achieved by cea alone these findings suggest that circulating C2 of cea phi psigtp and ldh may reflect a direct contribution from the malignant tissue andor liver malfunction secondary to liver replacement
1299,a technique has been developed to separate and measure kallikrein in a heterogeneous population of rat renal cortical cells in suspension T3 rat kidneys were perfused in situ in anaesthetized rats viable counted cortical cell suspensions were obtained cells were suspended in a sucrosetris buffer containing deoxycholate homogenized centrifuged dialyzed and gel filtered on sephadex g column chromatography on deaecellulose resulted in a single peak of esterase activity between to m naclsodium phosphate buffer subsequent elution yielded an alkaline esterase which was identical to kallikrein isolated from rat urine insofar as ph optimum effects of inhibitors bioassay activity and immunological properties were concerned calculated yields were about of the total esterase activity present in the parent cell homogenates recoveries of a purified rat urinary kallikrein added to the cell homogenates the deaecellulose columns or the eluates from the columns ranged from mean using this technique it was found that the amount of kallikrein activity present in nonincubated renal cortical cells ranged from to alphantosyllarginine methyl ester tosargome esterase units per cells however cells incubated in a nutrient medium at degrees c for h contained no measurable kallikrein activity whereas the surrounding medium had kallikrein activity which could be significantly increased by aldosterone and decreased by spironolactone
1300,a series of headinjured patients in coma were treated with hyperbaric oxygen ohp at atm CBF blood flow cbf cerebral metabolic rates of oxygen cmro glucose cmrgl and lactate cmrl act and various cerebrospinal fluid csf parameters were measured before and h after the treatment preohp and postohp average values of arterial blood and csf lactate and cmrl act were higher than normal while cbf cmro and csf PtiO2 po were lower cbf tended to increase T3 ohp in some patients and to decrease in others this discrepancy and the conflicting results of the literature can be tentatively explained in assuming that there is a different effect of ohp on normal brain circulation as compared to impaired brain circulation changes of cerebral metabolic rates were inconsistent and did not relate to changes of cbf except with repeated studies of the same patient a correlation was found between the variations of cmrgl and those of arterial blood and csf glucose content csf po csf acidbase balance and csf lactate content did not vary and arterial po showed a consistent fall in two patients who were neurologically improved T3 ohp exposure the cbf and metabolic changes were not the same
1301,seven strains of viridans streptococci of the species streptococcus sanguis s mutans and s mitis were investigated for autolysis the effect of ph salt concentration and temperature on the autolytic process was studied in nahponahpo buffer whole cells and walls of all strains autolysed most rapidly at ph values above autolysis of whole cells of s sanguis and one strain of s mitis atcc was maximal in to m buffer while the two s mutans strains and s mitis atcc showed maximal autolysis in and m buffers cultures harvested in the stationary phase of growth possessed only slightly decreased autolytic activity compared with those from the exponential phase whole cells autolysed more rapidly at degrees c than at degrees c and degrees c autolysis of isolated walls of three strains of s mitis atcc atcc and atcc was maximal at ph and and in m buffers streptococcus mitis atcc also showed maximal lysis in m and m buffers an endopeptidase action of the autolytic system of s mitis atcc was indicated by the progressive PR of soluble amino groups during autolysis of the walls no release of reducing groups was observed several free amino acids were released during autolysis of these walls alanine lysine and glu being in greatest quanitity
1302,it was shown by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecylsulphate solution that MCC from achromobacter ivs is composed of two different subunits with molecular weights of about and respectively the biotin is bound to the heavier S1 it was previously found that methylcrotonylcoa carboxylase contains four biotin molecules per complex a complex composed of four of each S1 would thus have a molecular weight of about this is compatible with the molecular weight of determined earlier by analytical ultracentrifugation both subunits were isolated preparatively as the subunits unlike the complex are very sensitive to oxygen special precautions had to be taken during isolation the biotincontaining subunit was isolated by chromatography on deaecellulose in m urea it no longer catalyzed the overall reaction yet could still carboxylate free biotin the biotinfree subunit was separated after dissociation of the enzyme by threedays dialysis at ph under nitrogen on chromatography over a sepharosebound avidin column the biotinsubunit was fixed and the biotinfree subunit was eluted unretarded the latter subunit showed no enzymic activity after the addition of the biotincontaining subunit overall activity was regenerated the speed of reassociation is very much enhanced by methylcrotonylcoa it was shown by reassociation experiments under different conditions that probably an initial complex axby is formed possessing a IB site for methylcrotonylcoa upon the binding of this ATP the conformation may be changed to a form favourable for reconstitution finally the structures of biotin enzymes from different sources are compared in the course of evolution there is a tendency toward integration of the different constituent proteins into only one polypeptide chain
1303,the abnormal accumulation of lipids due to myoinositol deficiency in saccharomyces carlsbergensis and the mechanism involved was investigated the deficient cells contained much more neutral lipids with a greater ratio of unsaturated fatty acids compared to the supplemented cells whereas there was no significant change in their phospholipid contents the biosynthesis of fatty acids and sterols from acetate and of triacylglycerols and sterol esters from palmitate was markedly augmented in the deficient cells acetylcoa carboxylase activity of the deficient supernatant was to fold higher than that of the supplemented however the activity from both sources was not significantly different after sephadex g GF of the supernatant suggesting the presence of low molecular effectors in the deficient supernatant there was a great increase in acidsoluble glycogen trehalose and fructosep as well as a drastic decrease in citrate in the deficient cells their intracellular levels were calculated so that their effects on acetylcoa carboxylase was examined over the range of physiological concentration citrate strongly inhibited the enzyme activity of the supernatant but it had no effect on the preparation after gel filtration on the other hand fructosep stimulated the enzyme activity both before and T3 gel filtration the acetylcoa carboxylase activity in the gel filtrate was measured as a CF of citrate concentration at several fixed concentrations of fructosep citrate counteracted the activation by fructosep in a dosedependent manner citrate lacked the inhibitory effect in the absence of fructosep it was concluded from these results that neutral lipid accumulation in the deficient cells reflected an increase in the synthesis of fatty acids at least partly based on an enhancement of acetylcoa carboxylase activity and that the operation of a reciprocal regulation of the enzyme by fructosep and citrate caused a marked elevation of the enzyme activity in the deficient cells with a high fructosep level and a low citrate level
1304,exobetanacetylmuramidase or betaacetamidoodcarboxyethyldeoxydglucoside acetamidodeoxyglucohydrolase is produced by Bs b growing in a succinatepeptonesalts medium at the end of exponential growth and occurs partly in the medium and partly bound to the cells a lysozyme digest of micrococcus lysodeikticus cell walls oacetamidodeoxybetadglucopyranosyl leads to acetamidoodcarboxyethyldeoxydglucose and oacetamideodcarboxyethyldeoxybetadglucopyranosyl leads to acetamidodeoxydglucose in decreasing order of efficiency induce the enzyme but oacetamidodeoxybetadglucopyranosyl leads to acetamidodeoxydglucose does not do so the enzyme was purified from the growth medium after removal of the cells by continuous centrifugation by ammonium sulphate precipitation continuous filtration through xm membranes to remove the MW material which renders the enzyme sedimentable in lowionicstrength solutions diafiltration through pm CM and ionexchange chromatography on deaesephadex and cmsephadex two peaks of activity were obtained peak a was purified fold and was homogenous on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis a second heterogeneous fraction peak b was also collected exobetanacetylmuramidase is most stable at ph and has a molecular weight of about the results of studies on its ability to attack several synthetic and NK substrates are given the km and v values for methylumbelliferylacetamidoodcarboxyethyldeoxybetadglucose and oacetamidoodcarboxyethyldeoxybetadglucopyranosyl leads to acetamidodeoxydglucose are respectively and mm and and mumol min mg from these results and those of inhibition studies it is concluded that the enzyme is TPS for substrates with nonreducing nacetylmuramic acid end CG possible roles for this enzyme are discussed
1305,psychomotor skills and visual functions related to driving were measured doubleblind crossover in ten healthy volunteers before and and h after a single oral administration of diazepam mg medazepam mg or lorazepam mg the late effects of lorazepam were tested in seven other subjects and h after the administration lorazepam impaired almost all the measured skills more p less than to than diazepam medizepam or the placebo the lorazepam impairment of reactive skills and flicker fusion discrimination remained statistically significant p less than for as long as h medazepam impaired only reactive skills and flicker fusion the latter remaining impaired p less than for as long a h after the administration the magnitude and duration of the effects of diazepam were intermediate between those of lorazepam and medazepam diazepam impaired perceptual speed and reactive and coordinative skills as well as flicker fusion discrimination and visual parameters related to driving slight impairments in performance were measurable for up to h T3 administration but at h the results resembled those measured after the placebo the lack of alterations in adaptation to darkness sensitivity to brightness or visual discrimination ability in bright counterlight at a time when flicker fusion discrimination was severely depressed suggests that an impaired ability to discriminate flickering CS is of no or little clinical significance to driving ability it is concluded that patients receiving a mg dose of lorazepam should not drive or operate machinery for h T3 the administration after diazepam mg or medazepam mg patients should refrain from driving or participating inskilled performances for only to hours
1306,the inactivation of the neurohypophyseal hormones arginine vasopressin and oxytocin both clabelled in the CT glycine residue by enzymes present in kidney homogenates of various species has been investigated and some of the enzymes responsible have been partially purified and characterized the leugly peptide bond of oxytocin is generally most effectively cleaved by kidney homogenates although with certain species enzymic activity hydrolyzing the proleu bond is significant degradation of Arg vasopressin is slower than oxytocin in all species studied and appears to occur by a different overall mechanism since cleavage of the proarg bond is more significant than hydrolysis of the arggly bond the enzyme releasing glycinamide from oxytocin and the postproline cleaving enzyme which releases cterminal dipeptide from oxytocin and arginine vasopressin were partially purified from lamb kidney by AS fractionation and column chromatography the two enzymes are shown to be separate entities with different ph profiles the prolyl peptidase activity released the CT dipeptides from oxytocin and arginine vasopressin at similar rates and was inhibited by pchloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid phenanthroline ltosylamidophenylethylchloromethyl ketone co ca and zn but significantly enhanced by dithiothreitol the prolyl peptidase preparation cleaves prolinecontaining peptide substrates at the prox bond the rate of cleavage is dependent on the nature of residue x and with the conditions used there is no cleavage when x equals pro however cleavage occurs when x is a d isomer mpr darg vasopressin is inactivated at a rate similar to mpr arg and mpr lys vasopressin suggesting that the known prolonged biological action of mpr darg vasopressin is not due to resistance to the prolyl peptidase in all characteristics tested the lamb kidney prolyl peptidase was identical to the postproline cleaving enzyme isolated earlier from human uterus in vivo experiments in the cat suggested that both the glycinamidereleasing enzyme and postproline cleaving enzyme are present and ERP in inactivating neurohypophyseal hormones in the intact animal
1307,the perturbational effects of monovalent and divalent cations on human EA membranes were analyzed by examining their influence on kinetic and structural characteristics of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid tnbs incorporation into the amino groups of protein and phospholipid structural components the stimulatory effects of monovalent cations on tnbs incorporation which were sizeindependent and attributed to nonspecific membrane alterations resulting from ionic strength factors contrasted with the more pronounced stimulatory properties of divalent cations which were markedly sizedependent these stimulatory effects of cations on tnbs incorporation were associated with alterations not only in rate but also in activation energy in incorporation changes in activation energy produced by divalent cations paralleled their ability to perturb membrane protein components and probably reflected changes in probe permeation the rate of tnbs incorporation exhibited a dependence on divalent cation ionic radius which paralleled ioninduced perturbations in the labelling of the membrane amino phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine divalent cations differed both in the relative extent and in the characteristics of protein and phospholipid perturbation alkaline earth cations behaved as a rather homogeneous group while ni co and mn constituted a second heterogeneous group the influence of monovalent and divalent cations on the hemolytic behavior of intact erythrocytes paralleled their effects on tnbs incorporation into isolated membranes rather closely it is suggested that tnbs incorporation may provide a valuable means of analyzing functionally relevant cationinduced alterations in biological membranes in GA
1308,the influence of temperature on glucose metabolism of a psychotrophic CS of bacillus cereus was investigated the ph of the GM and sporeforming frequencies of b cereus varied when grown at or c radiorespirometric analyses revealed that vegetative cells of b cereus metabolized glucose by simultaneous T0 of the embdenmeyerhofparnas pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway as the growth temperature decreased gl was metabolized with increased participation of the pentose phosphate pathway the shift of cells grown at a higher temperature to a lower temperature increased the relative participation of the PPP whereas the shift of cells grown at low temperatures to a higher temperature had the opposite effect cells of late logarithmic phase grown at and c oxidized acetate by the TCA cycle reaction however cells grown at c failed to oxidize acetate to co to any appreciable extent the extracellular products resulting from the metabolism of glucose decreased as the growth temperature was lowered organic acids were the major extracellular products of cultures grown at and c acetic acid lactic acid and pyruvic acid together accounted for and of extracellular radioactivity respectively at the two temperatures the relative ratio of these three acids varied between the temperatures little or no acid accumulated at c
1309,the effect of gradual disruption of the outer membrane of intact chloroplasts on co fixation electron transport and phosphorylation was investigated the results suggested that whilst ferricyanide and ATP amounts of adp enter intact chloroplasts only very slowly methyl viologen rapidly penetrates the outer membrane preparatwons of intact pea chloroplasts had an atpconsuming reaction which resulted in decreased adpo ratios when noncyclic electron transport was measured T3 disruption of the outer membrane the atpconsuming reaction was removed into the supernatant T3 washing the disrupted chloroplasts the resulting washed chloroplasts gave adpo ratios of for ferricyanide and for methyl viologen S9 of intact spinach chloroplasts had lower activity of the atpconsuming reaction and gave similar adpo ratios to washed pea chloroplasts the adpo ratios of spinach chloroplasts did not alter significantly T3 washing an investigation of the effect of various CA conditions on the adpo ratio showed that the phosphate concentration was critical in obtaining optimal values for adpo ratio decreasing the phosphate concentration below mm decreased the adpo ratio significantly it is suggested that the maximum adpo ratio of chloroplasts is but that lower values can be obtained in the presence of an atpconsuming reaction under suboptimal CA conditions or where the chloroplasts are structurally damaged
1310,the kinetics of the heterologous recombination reaction of alkylated h chains of a myeloma protein jo with alkylated l chains of another myeloma protein ita were studied by following changes with time in the circular dichroism at nm and the results were compared with those for the autologous recombination of joh chains with joh chains reported previously t azuma et al j biochem and the preceding paper the rat reaction also followed secondorder kinetics the secondorder rate constant kapp for rat recombination was about seven times smaller than that for autologous recombination at ph while they were similar between ph and the apparent association constants kapp for the reaction hlhl were determined by measuring the ellipticities at nm of mixtures of h and l chains in various ratios the values of kapp for the autologous and heterologous recombinations were both phdependent and changed from m at ph to m at ph using these values of kapp and kapp the halftime for the dissociation of autologous hl to h and l at ph was estimated to be hr
1311,cardiac SO was measured by a pulse contour method in renovascular hypertensive rats deoxycorticosterone doc hypertensive rats and normotensive control wistar rats in the conscious state all rats were male in sex and weeks of age weeks T3 operation in the hypertensive rats cardiac output per body weight was not significantly different among the groups therefore the hypertension in the experimentally hypertensive rats in the conscious state was ascribable to an increased total IP resistance T3 anesthesia with pentobarbital and thoracotomy the doc rats were no longer hypertensive however in the renovascular hypertensive rats the hypertensive state due to an increase in V1 resistance persisted T3 anesthesia thoracotomy and even ganglion blockade with hexamethonium bromide indicating the importance of nonneural factors in the renovascular hypertension aortic compliance measured in vivo under anesthesia was smaller in either the renovascular or doc hypertensive rats than in the control rats before and after ganglion blockade which suggests a nonneural hardening of elastic vessels in the exp hypertensions
1312,the two tripeptide antibiotics laminomethylphosphinobutyrylalanylalanylalanine lphosphinothricylalanylalanine and lnphosphonomethioninessulfoximinylalanylalanine both inhibitors of the glutamine synthetase are transported into the cell of escherichia coli k via the oligopeptide transport system the uptake by this system is proved first of all by crossresistance with trilornithine using oligopeptidetransportdeficient mutants and secondly by antagonism tests demonstrating competitive reversal of the action of the antibiotic by several peptides which have been shown to be transported via the Opp eg trilalanine tetralalanine trillysine trilserine triglycine glycylglycyllalanine and the synthetic tripeptide lazadenylaminohexanoylalanylalanine on the other hand there is no effect on the action of the antibiotic in antagonism tests with EDC which use different transport systems such as lalanylalanine llysyllysine glutathione and the synthetic amino acid azaadenylaminohexanoic acid ie aminoaminohvtriazolodpyrimidinylhexanoic acid another inhibitor of the glutamine synthetase lmethioninesdioxide methioninesulfone could be converted into a tripeptide form by linkage to lalanylalanine analogously to the tripeptide antibiotics described above whereas the free lmethioninesdioxide seems to be transported via the methionine transport system the tripeptide form is transported via the oligopeptide transport system thus this glutamine synthetase inhibitor can be taken up by the cell via two different transport mechanisms our results indicate that this could provide a synergistic effect the syntheses of the new tripeptides lazaadenylaminohexanoylalanylalanine and lmethioninesdioxidylalanylalanine were performed by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide couplings of the unusual nprotected lalphaamino acids azaadenylaminohexanoic acid and lmethioninesdioxide to lalanylalaninetertbutyl ester followed by common deprotection steps trilornithine was synthesized without carboxyl protection via two successive couplings of hydroxybenzotriazol esters of nalphabutoxycarbonylndeltabenzyloxycarbonyllornithine
1313,candida utilis was grown in batch and continuous culture on prickly pear juice as sole carbon and SE source in batch SC the maximum TPS growth rate mum and the ATP yield coefficient yps varied according to sugar concentration when the fermentation was carried out with sugar mum and ys were h and respectively the best yields occurred in a chemostat at the ph range of to and temperature of c a beneficial effect on ys was observed when the dilution rate d was increased at a d of h the productivity was gliter per h the maintenance coefficient attained a value of g of sugarg of biomass per h increases of d produced higher protein contents of the biomass the information obtained indicates that protein production with candida utilis using prickly pear juice should be carried out a high dilution rates where the ys and protein content of the cell mass are also higher
1314,an extracecular alphaglucosidase alphadglucoside glycohydrolase ec of a thermophile bacillus thermoglucosidius kp was purified about fold the purified enzyme had a TPS activity of mumol of pnitrophenylalphadglucopyranoside hydrolyzed per min at degrees c and ph per mg of protein the molecular weight was estimated at the ph and temperature optima for activity were and degrees c respectively below degrees c the activity was less than of the optimym the enzyme showed a high specificity for alphadglucopyranoside the maximal hydrolyzing velocity per substrate diminished in the order phenylalphadglucopyranoside pnitrophenylalphadglucopyranoside isomaltose methylalphaglycopyranoside the respective km values were and mm the activity was trace for turanose and not detectable for sucrose trehalose raffinose melezitose maltose maltotriose phenylalphadmaltoside dextran dextrin and starch tris pnitrophenylalphadxylopyranoside glucose and gluconodeltalactone blocked competitively the enzyme with respect to pnitrophenylalphadglucopyranoside the ki values were and mm respectively the activity was affected by heavy metal ions but insensitive to edta pchloromercuribenzoate and iodoacetate the enzyme was SD up to degrees c and inactivated rapidly at temperatures beyond degrees c the ph range for stability was at degrees c and at degrees c at degrees c the enzyme failed to be inactivated in ethanol in m urea and in sodium dodecyl sulfate but the tolerance was extremely reduced at degrees c
1315,the purple membrane of halobacterium halobium acts as a lightdriven proton pump ejecting protons from the cell interior into the medium and generating electrochemical proton gradient across the cell membrane however the type response of cells to CS as measured with a ph electrode in the medium consists of an initial net inflow of protons which subsides and is then replaced by a net outflow which exponentially approaches a new lower steady state ph level when the CS turned off a small transient acidification occurs before the ph returns to the original dark level we present experiments suggesting that the initial inflow of protons is triggered by the beginning ejection of protons through the purple membrane and that the initial inflow rate is larger than the continuing lightdriven outflow when the initial inflow has decreased exponentially to a small value the outflow dominates and causes the net acidification of the medium the initial inflow is apparently driven by a preexisting EC gradient across the membrane which the cells can maintain for extended times in the absence of light and oxygen treatments which collapse this gradient such as addition of small concentrations of uncouplers abolish the initial inflow the triggered inflow occurs through the atpase and is accompanied by atp synthesis inhibitors of the atpase such as nndicyclohexylcarbodiimide dccd inhibit atp synthesis and abolish the inflow they also abolish the transient lightoff acidification which is apparently caused by a short burst of atp hydrolysis before the enzyme is blocked by its endogenous inhibitor similar transient inflows and outflows of protons are also observed when anaerobic cells are exposed to short oxygen pulses
1316,visual photoreceptors from both vertebrates and invertebrates are characterized by extensive elaboration of membrane which contains visual pigment rhodopsin visual pigments in all phyla examined are chemically similar the chromophore is cis retinaldehyde attached by an aldimine linkage schiff base to a membrane protein opsin the effect of CS is to isomerize the chromophore to the alltrans configuration beyond these fundamental similarities several specific areas are discussed in which variations and differences appear CS causes vertebrate visual pigments to bleach liberating the chromophore most invertebrate visual pigments do not bleach in the CS but instead form a thermally stable metarhodopsin with the chromophore in the alltrans configuration still attached to the opsin in the disk CM of vertebrate rod and cone outer segments the rhodopsin molecules are oriented with their chromophores nearly coplanar with the disks within this plane however both rotational and translational diffusion are possible in the microvillar membranes of arthropod and cephalopod rhabdoms on the other hand the situation is less clear there is evidence for some preferential orientation of chromophores that implies restrictions on brownian rotation in the outer segments of vertebrate receptors absorption of light by rhodopsin causes the plasma membrane to hyperpolarize due to a decrease in sodium conductance possibly mediated by calcium ions in most invertebrate photoreceptors light causes a depolarization due to an increase in conductance principally to sodium ions a subsequent entry of calcium causes a partial repolarization of the membrane due to a decrease in sodium conductance for vertebrate receptors log threshold is directly proportional to the fraction of rhodopsin bleached dowlingrushton relationship the proportionality constant varies in different S9 from less than four to more than and the physical basis for the relationship is unknown for invertebrates by contrast the dependence of sensitivity on rhodopsin concentration is much less dramatic and may well depend simply on the probability of quantum catch in most species vertebrate and invertebrate the accumulation of photoproduct probably has no effect on Gm but several possible exceptions exist photoregeneration of rhodopsin from metarhodopsin is likely an important mechanism of recovery in certain arthropods such as diurnal insects but dark mechanisms of recovery also exist in all phyla in no single case are they adequately understood
1317,an aminopeptidase alphaaminoacyl lpeptide hydrolase ec was purified to homogeneity from autolysates of brewers yeast the enzyme which is responsible for most of the yeast cells aminopeptidase activity is a glycoprotein containing about of conjugated carbohydrate and zn and having a complex quaternary structure the active species has a molecular weight of approx and an isoelectric point of the enzyme is remarkably stable even in dilute solutions all types of lamino acid and peptide derivatives containing a free amino terminus are attacked including CAA amides and esters as to its substrate specificity the enzyme belongs to the so called leucineaminopeptidases it is strongly and specifically activated by zn and cl or br and inactivated by metalchelating agents the activation by zn seems to be mediated by a conformational transition which affects exclusively v and leads to a form of the enzyme which enhanced stability against heat halide anions on the other hand are acting as positive allosteric effectors modulating both v and km
1318,caesarean sections and hysterectomies were carried out in gilts and sows with different body weight table i the neuroleptic azaperone and the hypnotic metomidate were used for anaesthesia with different administration table ii local analgesia and premedication with atropine the duration of the anaesthesia was minutes and where prolongation was necessary metomidate azaperone or barbiturates were used alone or in combinations once or more the indications table iii for caesarean section were retarded birth in sows dislocation of uterus in sows and in sows by other indications hysterectomy was indicated by retarded birth in sows dislocations of uterus in cases and in cases by other indications in operations table iv living piglets were delivered and were alive at discharge the chances of survival depends on the composition of the litter in litters of piglets alive only survived at discharge in litters consisting of both alive and stillborn survived and survived in litters consisting of piglets alive and post mortem piglets the total survival of the sows was T3 caesarean section and after hysterectomy it is pointed out that most of the patients operated were in a very late phase of birth
1319,these experiments have investigated the role of bacterial interference as a determinant in the epidemiology of renal infection two unrelated strains of escherichia coli e coli and isolated from cases of clinical PN were used although both strains had identical morphology on conventional media they could be differentiated using genetically SD markers for streptomycin resistance and arabinose utilization when the strains of e coli were introduced into the kidney simultaneously by direct inoculation mixed infections were readily established on the other hand although both strains of e coli were equally invasive as individual pathogens PN when induced using a VA challenge with a mixed culture of the same organisms was almost invariably caused by the strain alone further experiments showed that bacterial interference occurred within the kidney and determined the pattern of infection when unilateral renal infections were established with e coli and the animals subsequently challenged with e coli it was found that e coli infection never occurred in kidneys INF with e coli but infection was established in the contralateral kidney the experiments have shown that mixed renal infection with e coli are uncommon even when both pathogens are equally nephropathogenic and are introduced simultaneously into the bladder
1320,experiment gerbils were TR in a tshaped maze to discriminate the effects produced by pentobarbital pbarb mgkg ip and the effects of saline the response a left or right turn in the maze was thus contingent upon the prevailing training condition pbarb or saline the criterion of performing correct first trial choices in consecutive sessions was reached within training sessions tests with descending doses of pbarb yielded an ed of mgkg tests with phenobarbital mgkg or diazepam and mgkg solely maintained the drug response pbarb discrimination was reversed by megimide ed mgkg and metrazol ed mgkg thus megimide was approximately times more ERP than metrazol metrazol and mgkg also counteracted the phenobarbital and diazepam response picrotoxin and mgkg was less effective whereas caffeine mgkg and piracetam mgkg did not upset pbarb discrimination experiment naive gerbils had to discriminate mixtures of pbarb mgkg plus either or mgkg of metrazol from saline already at the start of the discriminative training the drug combinations produced discriminable effects since most gerbils reached the acquisition criterion although more slowly than gerbils trained with pbarb solely gerbils trained without a drug simulus saline vs saline never attained the criterion during consecutive sessions in conclusion reversal of established discrimination expt does not necessarily mean that the same drug combination lacks discriminable effects as demonstrated in experiment
1321,a soluble protein with a molecular weight of has been isolated from bovineheart mitochondria which stimulates the following atpdependent reactions of submitochondrial particles treated with mm edta and m nhoh reverse electron transfer from succinate to nad transhydrogenation from nadh to nadp and atppi exchange the factor has no effect on the nadh oxidase succinate oxidase and atpase MICs of the particles the stimulatory effect of the factor in the atpdependent reduction of nad by succinate is mumolminmg of the factor protein however the nhohedta treated particles are saturated for maximal activation of the above reaction by very small amounts of the factor about mug factor per mg particle PACE of the factor preparation on polyacrylamide gels showed a single protein band plus a nonprotein material which moved at the dye front and was weakly stained with coomassie blue the protein was shown to be required for activation of the particles whether the fastmoving nonprotein material is also required is not known the factor is inhibited by mercurials and nethylmaleimide the former but not the latter inhibition is CR reversed by dithiothreitol the nhohedta treated particles are also stimulated by rutamycin up to about nmol of rutamycin per mg particle higher rutamycin concentrations inhibit depending on the particle preparation the factor stimulates up to about nmol per mg particle but does not inhibit at higher concentrations in addition under certain conditions in which appropriate concentrations of rutamycin fail to stimulate the particles the factor still does
1322,the antihypertensive and pulseslowing effects of racemic propranolol oxprenolol pindolol practolol and dpropranolol were assessed in HT drug dosage was selected to be proportionate to betaadrenoreceptorblocking potency dpropranolol dosage equalled approximately that of racemic propranolol dpropranolol had onlyslight antihypertensive effect the four other drugs were found to have a considerable and approximately equal antihypertensive effect the degree of slowing of HR rate varied with the different drugs being greatest with racemic propanolol the effect on PP rate did not correlate with the effect on blood pressure for most of the drugs the falls in blood pressure induced by racemic propanolol were strongly correlated with those induced by each of the other drugs the small falls in blood pressured induced by dpropranolol correlated also with those induced by practolol which had no membrane activity and are presumably due to its weak betaadrenoreceptorblocking action the betaadrenoreceptorblocking action per se is responsible for the antihypertensive action of these drugs
1323,salicylamide glucuronide samg in and hoursurine specimens was determined T3 p.o. of salicylamide in normal volunteers nv in cases of various CL diseases and hyperbilirubinemias and in cases after drug administration to predict the in vivo drug metabolism in man and its change by drugs maximal glucuronide formation was obtained by g of salicylamide po to nv thus this dosage was used in the present T0 samg as percent of total salicylamide the percent of samg from hoursurine specimens was high and constant in nv mean sd of the total SAM was confirmed as free salicylamide in hoursurine specimens of nv the percent of samg of hoursurine specimens was in acute hepatitis in CH and in CL cirrhosis mean sd free salicylamide increased slightly in liver diseases SB levels tended to be inversely correlated with the percent of samg in most cases of gilberts syndrome the percent of samg remained at a normal level the percent of samg in cases with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemias of other geneses were almost within normal limits bucolome and phenobarbital increased the percent of samg in patients with various liver diseases T3 rifampicin or phenytoin administration the percent of samg of the patients with lung tuberculosis or epilepsy did not surpass that of nv
1324,antibodies against a naked particles b virus envelope and c whole herpes simplex virus hsv type were investigated immune rabbit serum against naked particles and formalized naked particles contained virus neutralizing vn antibody in a low titre as compared to the titre of complementfixing cf antibody immune rb SS against the viral envelope had similar titres of vn and cf antibodies in gel double diffusion precipitation tests whole hsv gave two precipitation zones with antibodies against naked particles two zones with antibodies against the virus envelope several zones with antibodies against whole virus and two marked zones against human convalescent serum viral nucleocapsid reacted with two zones with antibodies against the nucleocapsid and a faint zone with antibodies against the virus envelope the envelopes gave two zones with antibodies against whole virus and a faint zone with antibodies against naked particles human convalescent SS gave a single precipitation zone with viral nucleocapsid and two zones with virus env and whole virus
1325,a particulate fraction prepared from mycobacterium phlei grown in a metaldeficient medium exhibited a greatly reduced activity of stearoylcoa desaturase compared to that from normally grown cells metal deficiency however had no effect on the faddependent nadphcytochrome c reductase activity which has been suggested to participate in the desaturation process when the cells were grown in the deficient medium supplemented with both fe and mg the desaturase activity was restored to the normal level supplementation with mg CT promoted growth but did not restore the desaturase activity whereas fe alone did cause a significant restoration among the various metal ions tested only fe and fe enhanced the formation of desaturase activity in the deficient medium when added to the CA medium in vitro fe and fe did not stimulate the desaturase activity of the particulate fraction from the deficient cells cultivation in the metaldeficient medium had essentially no effect on the levels of cytochromes in the particulate fraction but dramatically decreased the nonheme iron content and the amount of a highspin ferric species exhibiting an esr signal at g no labile sulfur could be detected in the normal or metaldeficient particulate fractions it is concluded that the presence of iron ions in the culture medium is necessary for the synthesis andor assembly of the terminal portion of the desaturase system
1326,administration of kc mmolkgday to subjects undergoin prolonged starvation reduced daily urinary ammonium and betahydroxybutyrate excretion by onethird these changes were accompanied by an improvement in potassium balance and an increased rate of chloride excretion a similar fall in ammonium excretion occurred in a second group of subjects C2 of khco mmolkgday ketone body and bicarbonate excretion remained unchanged in this group while potassium balance improved in both the first and second groups urine ph fell significantly as the rate of excretion of urinary buffer ammonium decreased when the dose of khco was increased to mmolkgday in fasting subjects the urine was alkalinized and ammonium excretion fell to negligible levels resulting in nitrogen sparing of gday the results indicate that onehalf of the increase in ammonium excretion observed in starvation is due to potassium deficiency nitrogen wastage caused by losses of urinary ammonium during starvation can be virtually eliminated by potassium supplementation and urinary alkalinization the decrease in betahydroxybutyrate excretion T3 potassium chloride administration was not caused by a fall in the rate of nonionic diffusion of this organic acid related to the reduction in urine ph the reason for the fall in betahydroxybutyrate excretion is not apparent though it was associated with an increase in chloride excretion
1327,the effect of blood injected into either subarachnoid space or subcortical brain tissue upon lactate and pyruvate concentrations as well as acidbase balance of cerebrospinal fluid csf was studied in the anesthetized dog csf lactate and L/P ratio lp ratio increased progressively following the intracranial injection of blood and reached the maximum level at six hours after injection these changes were significantly greater in animals with intracerebral hematoma than in those with subarachnoid hemorrhage sah an increase in csf lactate and lp ratio in hemorrhagic csf seems to be caused by two different factors shed blood cells per se produce lactate and pyruvate and blood in the SAS and IC hematomas cause secondary changes in brain tissue metabolism by a probable reduction of CBF blood flow therefore an increase in csf lactate with a concomitant rise in csf lp ratio is a useful indicator for brain tissue hypoxia even when csf is hemorrhagic the association of an increase in csf lactate to a disproportionate decrease in csf hco was also observed in these animals
1328,aspirininduced gastritis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were reviewed and discussed on the basis of currently available literature acute hemorrhagic gastritis occurs in from to of all patients taking aspirin is not directly related to dose size and can be severe enough to cause death in a few cases no tolerance appears to ever develop the mechanism that causes this bleeding is not definite but the back diffusion of h ions accross the gastric barrier seems to bear primary responsibility with PCS erosion prolonged platelet bleeding and the effect of low ph values also being possible explanations there appears to be less acid present in the stomach when bleeding occurs but this is a masking effect of the aspirin that causes increased absorption of the h ions factors important in determining pharmaceutical formulation are method of administration particle size of the aspirin duration of contact between the drug and the mucosa presence of buffers in the drug to raise the gastric ph dissolution rate of the drug in the stomach and ionization characteristics of the drug itself gastrointestinal BL caused by aspirin can be minimized by administering the drug in one of these formsa dilute solution of acetylsalicylatean intravenously injected solutiona very rapidly dissolving and rapidly absorbed tableta solution with sufficiently C1 amounts of antacid addeda finegrain highly buffered aspirin tabletan EC tablet that does not dissolve in the stomach oran aspirin substitute such as acetaminophen
1329,the fluorescence properties of various alphasulfurlinked flavinyl peptides and related flavin analogues were investigated as the ph solvent temperature and flavin concentration were varied substitution in the alpha position by a thioetherlinked peptide brings about a marked quenching of fluorescence up to in water a slight bathochromic shift and broadening of the fluorescence emission spectra and a slight decrease in the fluorescence lifetimes oxidation of the thioether function to a sulfone partially releases this fluorescence quenching without further changes in the fluorescence emission spectra the primary effect on the fluorescence intensity is due to an interaction between the nonbonding electrons of the thioether the hydrogenbonding polar solvent and the isoalloxazine ring dissolving these flavinyl peptides in nonaqueous solvents increases the fluorescence intensity as much as fold a AA effect on flavinyl fluorescence can be attributed to a collisional quenching by the vicinal tyrosyl residue within tyrosinecontaining flavinyl peptides the fluorescence properties provide further confirmation of the identity of the synthetic and naturally obtained flavinyl peptides and of the interaction between the freehydroxyl functions of the ribityl side chain and the thioether
1330,isoinhibitor k is the main component of the complex mixture of isoinhibitors of broad specificity secreted into the mucus by the roman snail helix pomatia the disulfide pairing was determined after the amino acid sequence had been elucidated two cystinecontaining peptides with the disulfide bridges cyscys and cyscys plus cyscys were obtained after thermolytic hydrolysis of the native inhibitor at degrees c and chromatographic separation of the peptides using sesephadex the cyscys disulfide bridge could be reduced selectively by sodium borohydride with no loss in biological activity this property and the covalent structure correspond to that of the intracellular inhibitor from bovine organs which is largely homologous in its CAA sequence to the secretory inhibitor from the snail the complete covalent structure of isoinhibitor k will be presented the snail inhibitor is less SD against proteolytic inactivation by thermolysin and against thermal denaturation at ph than the inhibitor from bovine organs kunitz inhibitor
1331,proparglyglycine aminopentynoate and vinylglycine aminobutenoate have been examined as substrates and possible inactivators of two flavo enzymes damino acid oxidase from pig kidney and lamino acid oxidase from crotalus adamanteus venom vinylglycine is rapidly oxidized by both enzymes but only lamino acid oxidase is inactivated under CA conditions the loss of activity probably involves covalent modification of an active site residue rather than the flavin adenine dinucleotide coenzyme and occurs once every turnovers we have confirmed the recent observation horiike k hishina y miyake y and yamano t j biochem tokyo that dproparglglycine is oxidized with a timedependent loss of activity by damino acid oxidase and have examined some mechanistic aspects of this inactivation the extent of residual oxidase activity insensitive to further inactivation is about at which point labelssubunit have been introduced with proparglycglycine as substrate lproparglyclycine is a substrate but not an inactivator of lamino acid oxidase and the product ahat accumulats in the nonnucleophilic nhydroxyethylpiperazinenethanesulfonic acid buffer is acetopyruvate in the presence of butylamine hcl a species with lambdaman nm epsilon accumulates that may be a conjugated eneamine adduct the same species accumulates from damino acid oxidase oxidation of dpropargylglycine prior to inactivation the inactivated apo damino acid oxidase has a new peak at nm that is probably a similar eneamine a likely inactivating species is ketopentadienoate arising from facile rearrangement of the expected initial product keto pentynoate vinylglycine and proparglyglycine show inactivation specificity then for land damino acid oxidase respectively
1332,methoxyphenylethylhydroxymethoxyphenylpropyliperazinedihydrochloride zipeprol respilene is a substance of nonphenanthrenic chemical structure in the cat it antagonised cough induced by stimulation of the SLN nerve or by direct mechanical excitation of the sensitive tracheobronchial receptors the efficacy of zipeprol after enteral administration made it possible both to establish good intestinal absorption and to rank it favourably in relation to several major antitussive REF products codeine codethyline dextromethorphan diphenhydramine and pentoxyverine the activity of zipeprol was superior or equal to that of all these substances excdept codeine the antitussive properties appeared to be due to a CE action other properties have been demonstrated which suggest at least a supplementary mechanism in the inhibition of cough in addition to the central action these consisted of slight antihistamine and anticholinergic properties marked localanesthetic potency and bronchospasmolytic activity this latter property was demonstrated by the inhibition of histamine and serotonin induced bronchospasm in the guineapig in vitro using human sputum zipeprol had a mucolytic action shown by a decrease in sputum vis viscosity and lysis of dna and amps fibrils in the dog at high doses zipeprol unlike codeine did not inhibit CE stimulation of respiration by hypercapnia in addition no modification of ventilatory dynamics or blood gases was seen on the basis of these results zipeprol can be considered as possessing no respiratory depressant effect even in the upper ranges of its antitussive doses
1333,the microsomal fraction of m cells an established cell L1 of myeloid leukemia was capable of catalyzing acylation of snglycerol phosphate by longchain fatty acylcoa thioesters the principal lipid product formed was identified as phosphatidic acid palmitylcoa stearylcoa and oleylcoa were more ERP acyl donors than linoleylcoa and arachidonylcoa m cells and macrophages differentiated from them exhibited similar levels of snglycerol phosphateacylating activity which were approximately onehalf that in mouse liver and approximately four times that in peritoneal macrophages the C2 of acetylcoa carboxylase activity in m cells and macrophages differentiated from them were not significantly different from each other and were comparable to those in mouse liver whereas no activity was detected in peritoneal macrophages these results indicated that differentiation of the myeloid leukemic cells which results in loss of leukemogenicity and mitotic activity is not associated with changes in the activities of these lipogenic enzymes although the cultured cells exhibited remarkably higher MICs than freshly harvested peritoneal macrophages furthermore the present study supports the view that the glycerophosphate pathway makes an essential contribution to the de novo synthesis of phospholipids in m cells as well as in both types of macrophages
1334,the interaction between cedilanidd and metoprolol a selective beta receptor blocking agent on exercise tolerance and systolic intervals was studied in patients with AP the patients had been treated with MET for several months in a dose of mg three times daily one patient received mg three times daily each patient participated in two studies separated by at least week after arriving at the laboratory each received mg of MET orally thereafter either cedilanidd or placebo was infused intravenously in a doubleblind study performed in randomized order when the effect of the drugs was maximal the systolic intervals and the HR volume were recorded at rest and the exercise tolerance was tested with a bicycle ergometer the mean maximal value of PC of metoprolol assessed during the study was about ngml but the variation among subjects was great to ngml after administration of cedilanidd there was a shortening of the preejection period and left ventricular ET compared with results T3 placebo the reduction was similar to that found T3 administration of cedilanidd without beta blocking drugs the total HR volume decreased by an average of ml but the individual R2 was great the patients average work capacity expressed as total work was not altered by cedilanidd when compared with results T3 placebo no relation was found between initial heart size and the effect of cedilanidd on capacity for physical work it therefore appears that there is no indication for the routine use of digitalis during beta blocking therapy in patients with angina pectoris who do not have cardiac failure
1335,the effects of catecholamines on hepatic k and na movements were studied in anesthetized dogs by measuring systemic arterial and hepatic venous electrolyte composition following intraportal injections of adrenergic agonists all CAs studied caused the initial loss and subsequent uptake of k by the liver the loss of hepatic k was accompanied by an uptake of na at a ratio this accumulation of na continued although at a slower rate for at least min epinephrine and norepinephrine were much more potent in these effects than either phenylephrine or isoproterenol neither alpha nor betaadrenergic blockade singly or in combination had an appreciable effect on the magnitude or duration of the observed ion shifts it is concluded that the predominant effect of catecholamines is to produce a net accumulation of hepatic na and that the mechanism governing hepatic ion movements is nonadrenergic as defined by stimulation by specific adrenergic agonists and inhibition by specific adrenergic antagonists
1336,physiological and pharmacological studies of more than patients with movement disorders are reported particular attention is paid to the differentiation of various types of tremor on the basis of rate rhythm and pattern of emg activity in antagonistic muscles the typical tremoratrest of parkinsons disease hz activity which alternates between antagonistic musclesis suppressed at least briefly during voluntary activity at which time typical hz physiological tremor may be seen essential tremor and its familial or senile SCV also have a characteristic emg DP during voluntary activity hz bursts of activity which are synchronous in antagonistic muscles this type of tremor may also be present in patients with parkinsons disease and in certain kinships with a charcotmarietooth polyneuropathy other tremors in association with polyneuropathy neuropathic tremor have different physiological characteristics myoclonus is of essentially two types positive with emg bursts and negative with brief pauses in ongoing activity as with asterixis and may at times mimic tremor certain TPS tremors respond predictably to specific pharmacological therapy
1337,the method of ALP elution provides a sensitive measure of dna singlestrand length distribution in mamalian cells and is applicable to a variety of problems concerning dna damage repair and replication the physical basis of the elution process was studied the kinetics of elution above the ALP transition ph were found to occur in two phases an initial phase in which singlestrand length is rate limiting followed by a phase in which elution is accelerated due to the accumulation of alkaliinduced strand breaks the range of dna singlestrand lengths that can be discriminated by elution above the alkaline transition ph was estimated by calibration relative to the effects of x ray and was found to be x daltons shorter dna strands elute within the ph transition zone which D2 from ph to when tetrapropylammonium hydroxide was used as base this elution was relatively rapid but was sharply limited by ph according to the length of the strands the length of the strands eluted increased with increasing ph alkaline elution was inhibited by treatment of cells with low concentrations of nitrogen mustard a bifunctional alkylating known to crosslink dna on investigation of the possibility that dna subclasses may differ in their elution behavior satellite l strands were found to elute more slowly from cells exposed to a low dose of x ray than did the bulk dna
1338,the investigation of newborns has shown that during the first weeks of life the abnormal lipoproteinx lpx was present in the SS of nearly of the infants with no clinical chemical evidence of cholestasis the percentage of lpx positive tests was even higher in the group of immature newborns there was no rho between the bilirubin concentration and the PCD of lpx the activities of leucine arylamidase ec and gammaglutamyltransferase ec as well as the concentrations of total and free cholesterol did not differ in the lpx positive and negative infants except in one case lpx was never detectable on the first day of life the earliest date of appearance was the second day in the serum of some infants who were lpx positive shortly after birth the lipoprotein could still be found at the age of months the incidence of lpx was not higher in newborns with blood group incompatibility than in newborns with unspecific hyperbilirubinaemia after exchange transfusions lpx disappeared in most cases but it could later often be detected again in some newborns who were lpx negative a few DAB lpx was first detected at the age of months the lpx test is of no use for th diagnosis of cholestasis in newborn infants the test is TPS for cholestasis only after the first year of life the increased incidence of positive lpx tests in newborns is discussed as a consequence of immature CL function
1339,human placental microsomal nucleotidase ec was prepared free of ALP phosphatase by isoelectric focusing a total of seven electrophoretic variants were isolated during the preparation of six placentas only three to six variants were found in a single placenta the isoelectric phs were and these were found to be composed of variable quantities of a large medium and low molecular weight form the apparent molecular weights of the medium and light form of the enzyme were and respectively as estimated from stokes radius and sedimentation velocity determinations the electrophoretic variants were not distinguishable with respect to specific activity and Km for amp gmp or cmp or inhibition by atp ctp or adenosine these electrophoretic SCV appeared to be pseudoisozymes based upon different states of aggregation of a common primary sequence there was a wide range of ATP specificity among nucleoside monophosphates which included deoxyribose compounds with amp as ATP activity was cmp nmn gmp imp xmp and udpglucose the michaelis constants for amp gmp and cmp ranged from mum from mum and from mum respectively although nucleotidase was AS in the absence of divalent cation mm mgcl stimulated the CEA to of control and shifted the ph optimum of to a plateau from ph
1340,the effects of oral HS triazolam mg and flurazepam mg on the laboratory sleep of insomniacs were compared in a double blind crossover study a consecutive night schedule was used nts placebo first drug PL no drugs PL second drug placebo in ss first drug was triazolam and second drug was flurazepam in the other ss the drug order was reversed effects on sleep were assessed objectively by conventional eegeogemg sleep recordings and subjectively by questionnaires administered each morning side or toxic effects were assessed by physical exams clinical lab tests and twice daily questionnaires during their administration the two drugs were practically indistinguishable in their effects both significantly reduced objective and subjective measures of insomnia such as total wake time and sleep latency on discontinuation the drugs differentially affected sleep eg on the first post flurazepam night TST was significantly more than baseline whereas on first post triazolam night TS time was significantly less than baseline there were no remarkable side or toxic effects with either drug
1341,the intracellular ph phi of squid giant axons has been measured using glass ph microelectrodes resting phi in ASW asw ph at degrees c was if corrected for liquid junction potential exposure of the axon to co at constant external ph caused a sharp decrease in phi while the subsequent removal of the gas caused phi to overshoot its initial value if the exposure to co was prolonged two additional effects were noted a during the exposure the rapid initial fall in phi was followed by a slow rise and b after the SE the overshoot was greatly exaggerated application of external nhcl caused phi to rise sharply return to normal asw caused phi to return to a value below its initial one if the exposure to nhcl was prolonged two additional effects were noted a during the exposure the rapid initial rise in phi was followed by a slow fall and b after the exposure the undershoot was greatly exaggerated exposure to several weak acid metabolic inhibitors caused a fall in phi whose reversibility depended upon length of exposure inverting the electrochemical gradient for h with mm kasw had no effect on phi changes resulting from ST exposure to azide a mathematical MM explains the phi changes caused by nhcl on the basis of passive movements of both nh and nh the simultaneous passive movements of co and hcocannot explain the results of the co experiments these data require the postulation of an active proton extrusion andor sequestration mechanism
1342,adenosine phosphorylase ec activity present in sarcoma cells grown in culture and in rat CL is shown to be distinct from inosineguanosine phosphorylase by several criteria a treatment of sarcoma cell extract with pchloromercuribenzoate inhibited the two activities to a different extent b adenine selectively protected the adenosine phosphorylase activity of sarcoma and rat LE against heat inactivation while hypoxanthine selectively protected inosineguanosine phosphorylase activity c at nearly saturating substrate concentrations and using sarcoma extract the rates of ribosylation of a mixture of adenine hypoxanthine or adenine guanine but not of hypoxanthine guanine were found to be almost equal to the sum of their individual rates as measured separately d inosine selectively inhibited the ribosylation of hypoxanthine and guanine catalysed by sarcoma and rat liver extract while chloroadenosine selectively inhibited the ribosylation of adenine and nfurfuryladenine e ph vs activity curves were similar with hypoxanthine or guanine as the substrate but they were markedly different from the curve with adenine as the substrate the potential role of adenosine phosphorylase activity in vivo is discussed
1343,concentrations of pregnenolone deltap dehydroepiandrosterone dhea alphahydroxydehydroepiandrosterone alphaoh dhea pregnenolone sulfate deltaps and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate dheas were measured simultaneously by radioimmunoassay in individual paired umbilical i.a. ua and vein uv sera from normal term pregnancies in labor not in labor mean ua and uv levels sem ngml were for deltap dhea alphaoh dhea deltaps dheas umbilical artery deltaps dheas and dhea levels were significantly higher than uv levels whereas the reverse was true for deltap and alphaoh dhea the inverse arteriovenous av gradient for alphaoh dhea was contrary to previous published reports using pooled samples comparison by linear regression of paired ua and uv steroid concentrations of deltap deltaps dhea and dheas revealed a significant correlation p less than for each steroid labor was associated with a significant increase in ua C2 of dheas and a smaller but not quite significant increase in ua C2 of deltaps while similar changes for unconjugated deltabetahydroxysteroids were not observed mean av gradients between the group of patients in labor and those not in labor were not significantly different these data demonstrate that a significant difference between ua and uv concentrations exists for deltap dhea alphaoh dhea deltaps and dheas there is a significant correlation between ua and uv concentrations for deltap dhea deltaps and dheas implying that each fetoplacental unit maintains an equilibrium relative to these steroid concentrations in the umbilical circulation labor is associated with a significant increase in ua levels of dheas and probably of deltaps
1344,an automated potentiometric procedure was used in dissolution rate studies to determine the effects of various hydrodynamic conditions on dissolution rate determinations changes in the hydrodynamics of the system resulted from using various sizes and shapes of dissolution vessels dissolution rate constants for BA prills in distilled water at phstat were used as a measure of the agitation intensities present in the different shaped vessels great variations in the dissolution rates occurred in vessels with the same diameter and stirrer blade position when the shapes of the bottom of the vessel were varied a similar order of dissolution rates was obtained at and rpm for the individual vessels at various propeller heights the order differed from one vessel to another depending on the shape of the bottom concave convex or flat of the vessel in some cases a change in the type of bottom resulted in the opposite order of rates for vessels with the same diameter
1345,transtubular potential differences and TPS resistances were measured in rat proximal tubules by means of single and double barrelled glass microelectrodes tip localization was made by observation of effective resistance changes measured with double barrelled microelectrodes upon passage of oil droplets and by perfusion with choline c mean early PT pds of the order of to mv and late values of to mv were found mean specific resistances ranged from to omega cm diffusion potentials and single ion relative conductances were evaluated perfusing the lumen with solutions differing only with respect to one salt concentration na and k conductances were similar and greater than those of c luminal and peritubular perfusions with hypotonic solutions showed the occurrence of streaming potentials in this structure suggesting the existence of pores lined with negative charges the effective diameter of these pores appeared to be reduced by hypotonic perfusion as evidenced by a significant increase in resistance indicating that the main ion path across this structure is represented by ICS
1346,maternal dosefetal teratogenic response data were obtained for a variety of narcotic and related compounds by single subcutaneous injections of the drugs into pregnant hamsters during the critical periods of central nervous system organogenesis the number of abnormal fetuses from females injected with diacetylmorphine heroin thebaine phenazocine pentazocine propoxyphene and methadone increased as the maternal dose of the compounds was increased by contrast morphine hydromorphone and meperidine produced an increase in the number per cent of fetal anomalies only up to a certain maternal dose level further increases in maternal dose C2 did not produce additional fetal anomalies comparative studies of single and multiple maternal doses indicated that diacetylmorphine heroin and methadone produced a four to sixfold increase in fetal anomalies with repetitive doses whereas the percentage of malformed fetuses remained the same with HM dilaudid the narcotic antagonists nalorphine naloxone levallophan and cyclazocine blocked the teratogenic effects of both single and multiple doses of the narcotics
1347,purified acidthermostable ribonuclease ribonucleate pyrimidinooligonucleotidohydrolase ec from human pancreas degrades doublestranded rna at the rate for singlestranded rna the activities against singlestranded rna and doublestranded rna were shown to be due to a single enzyme with properties similar to bovine pancreatic rnaase a for purposes of comparison the activities against doublestranded rna of crystalline ribonucleases of the whale rat and cow were assayed and found to be and respectively of their MICs against ssDNA rna both human serum and urine contain rnase components of pancreatic origin which hydrolyze dsDNA rna at and respectively of the rates against singlestranded rna by contrast purified acidthermostable rnaases from human spleen and liver hydrlyze dsRNA at least fold more slowly than human pancreatic rnaase relative to the corresponding rates against ssDNA rna the human pancreatic and serum enzymes exhibit appreciable activity against the polyc component of the doublestranded polyipolyc they also attack polyc itself at approximately times the rate for polyu and at more than times the rate for ssDNA rna
1348,in normal subjects in patients with duodenal ulcer du and in patients with Bi billroth i SS gastrin rose significantly T3 an oral and intraduodenal test meal the highest increases were observed in du patients after the oral as well as after the intraduodenal test meal after the intraduodenal test meal in normal subjects and in du patients an increase of gastric acid secretion and serum gastrin was measured in basal state after an intraduodenal or an oral test meal du patients with normal gastric acid secretory capacity had higher serum gastrin concentrations than du patients with gastric hypersecretion there was a good correlation between peak serum gastrin levels after the oral and after the intraduodenal test meal from these data it is concluded intraduodenal application of a test meal results in PR of gastrin from extragastric sites extragastric gastrin is biologically AS du patients are able to release more antral and more extragastric gastrin in response to a test meal further studies however are necessary to show the significance of these findings in the pathogenesis of PU disease
1349,the stabilitytime profiles of the active ingredient of five generically equivalent brands of penicillin v potassium for oral solution and of five generically equivalent brands of ampicillin for oral suspension were studied three controlled conditions were employedrefrigerated room and elevated temperatureand all the samples were assayed chemically for drug remaining at TPS time intervals after reconstitution the results showed that considerable variations in the initial concentrations of active component existed among the various ampicillin and penicillin products in one penicillin product the official content requirement was not met the data also showed that although the labels on each of the commerical penicillin products tested indicate that the reconstituted products may be stored in a refrigerator for days without significant loss of potency only one penicillin product still met of label claim minimal potency requirement of the USP for dry powder all ampicillin products tested were stable when stored at the conditions recommended by the manufacturers but the trihydrate forms exhibited greater stability than the anhydrous forms probably because of the more rapid dissolution rate of anhydrous ampicillin
1350,the contribution to acidification of the stomach contents of pigs by HCl secretion or by LA produced by fermentation was studied in fifteen suckling pigs from six litters born and reared either in a conventional environment or in an isolated clean environment sequential samples of stomach contents obtained during periods of up to h were analysed for their chloride and lactic acid contents ph and total titratable acidity these values gave a measure of organic and inorganic acids respectively six pigs from two litters born and reared in a clean environment had acid secretion in the stomach at d of age and the concentrations of lactic acid in stomach contents remained low mmoll throughout the suckling period eight pigs from three litters born and reared in a conventional environment and a ninth pig born in this environment but moved to the clean environment at h of age had LA in concentrations of up to mmoll in stomach contents within the st week of life the pattern of LA production and hence the acidity of stomach contents was governed by frequency of suckling both between and withinlitter variation in the age of ON of hc secretion was evident in the group reared in a conventional environment and when hc secretion did occur it was usually accompanied by a reduction in LA production it is concluded that the environment at birth is important in determining the fermentative ability of the stomach flora that if lactic acid is produced in large amounts in the stomach it may partly or completely inhibit acidification by hc
1351,the subcellular localizations of guanylate cyclase and cyclic CNP in sea urchin sperm were examined both the TPS and total activities of these two enzymes were much higher in sperm flagella tails than in the heads in addition to the observation that guanylate cyclase in the flagella was particulatebound and solubilized by triton x more than of the cyclase activity in the flagella was found in the plasma membrane fraction whereas the activity of cyclic CNP was observed in both the axonemal and plasma MF the observations indicated that the cyclase in the flagella appeared to be associated with the plasma membrane cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in the BPM fraction as well as the axonemal fraction hydrolyzed both cyclic gmp and cyclic amp however the rates of hydrolysis for cyclic gmp were obviously higher than those for cyclic amp the enzymic properties of guanylate cyclase and cyclic CNP in sperm flagella were also briefly described
1352,the kinetics and equilibria of the borate interaction at ribose with nad and nmn have been measured using as a chromophoric probe the perturbation effect borate has on the addition of sulfite to the position of the nicotinamide ring nad and nmn have more favorable borate association constants than do their corresponding sulfite addition complexes the rate of interaction of the ribose moiety with borate at low borate buffer concentration is dependent on the concentration of both borate and boric acid at high borate concentration the rate becomes independent of borate concentration indicating the existence of a twostep process for the interaction of nadsulfite with borate with a NC of ratedetermining step from the interaction of the ribose hydroxyl group with borate at low borate to an elimination of sulfite at high borate concentration a linear free SE relationship with a slope of describes an increased reactivity of the nucleotide for sulfite as the affinity of the nucleotide for sulfite increases
1353,when nc acetylbenzotriazole presented here as a new agent for the acetylation of proteins reacted at ph and degrees c with deltachymotrypsin amino CG the epsilonamino groups of lysing residues and the alphaamino terminus of halfcystine and two phenolic groups those of the two exposed tyrosine residues were acetylated with respective pseudo firstorder constants of and min surprisingly in contrast with the acetic anhydride reaction the alphaamino group of ile was found to be not acetylated as shown by nterminus determination and activity measurements the modified deltachymotrypsin or acetylated deltachymotrypsin was fully active after neutral dialysis only a transient inactivation due to the incorporation of one c acetyl group per mole of catalytic site was observed the kinetic constant found for reactivation at ph was min at degrees c the enzymecatalyzed hydrolysis of nacetylbenzotriazole was described by a kcat value of min at ph and degrees c circular dichroism changes observed at nm during the reaction at ph of acetylated deltachymotrypsin with nacetylbenzotriazole indicated a total conversion of the amount of enzyme molecules which were in the inactive or ALP conformation at this ph into the AS or neutral one benzotriazole alone was unable to induce such a conformational NC the rate constant of the reverse structural process from the neutral to the alkaline conformation was min MZ to that of the deacetylation of the catalytic site thus the unusual lack of acetylation of ile alphaamino group during deltachymotrypsin treatment with nacetylbenzotriazole is interpreted as a stabilization of the enzyme neutral conformation where the ile alphaamino group is buried thus inaccessible to the reagent the properties of the deltachymotrypsin modification using nacetylbenzotriazole led to practical uses direct spectrophotometric titration of chymotrypsin operational normality at ph and rapid preparation of acetylated deltachymotrypsin as a protein reagent nacetylbenzotriazole is particularly interesting because of its CR towards amino and phenolic groups of amino acid residues its stability at acid ph ie khydrolysis x min at degrees c ravaux et al tetrahedron letters and its aromaticity responsible for optical properties
1354,certain climatic and edaphic conformations in the bavarian subalpine mountains and in the alps favor above all the development of a land utilization system and farm structures similar to those in the northern part of scandinavia in the years of the highest environmental contamination up to the present we established in beef samples from the round or shoulder of male and female cattle mainly highland cattle close connections between the cscontamination of green crop and the long lastnig yearly precipitation quantities as well as certain relations between the cscontamination of meat and differences in the FF and keeping of the animals during summerseasons apriloctober beef of cattle from pastures with heavy rainfall alps was contaiminated by cs up to times more than that of confined animals hereby the rate of cscontamination in the meat of grazing cattle was nearly proportional to the quantities of precipitation when confined cattle were fed on pastures in autumn after harvesting for to weeks a quick increase of cscontamination of the meat was caused within this time up to values which in this district were otherwise only observed in grazing cattle the lower cscontent in meat of cattle housed during the summer season is due to the more varied fodder which is at that time less contaminated than green crop during the winter season november to march the highest contaminations in the meat of confined bohemian forest or grazing cattle alps was measured when the animals in these districts were almost exclusively fed with fodder from the own farmground or with leafy silage the highest contamination was almost regularly noticed in january february and march as generally during these months the highly contaminated first cut hay is fed here the meat was often even more contaminated than that of grazing cattle after the quick decrease of cs in fallout noticed in the years and in a dependance in the cscontamination of beef on the methods of keeping and feeding could still be observed in only the extreme cases alps bavarian and bohemian forest though in general meat of animals from districts with heavy rainfall was slightly more contaminated than meat of animals from regions with less precipitation
1355,S9 of rat lung microsomes containing nmole of cytochromes p and b per mg microsomal protein have been observed to contain significant levels of fatty acid desaturase activity both stearoyl coa and palmitoyl coa are desaturated to their monounsaturated analogues oleic acid and palmitoleic acid respectively activity per mg microsomal protein of the lung preparations varied according to the diet of the animals prior to killing in the order fat free diet greater than normal rat chow greater than starvation all S9 exhibited approximately inhibition when incubated in the presence of mm cn Vmax was obtained with the mm nadh less activity with equal amounts of nadph and there was no synergistic interaction of nadh and nadph together the rate of desaturation was linear with protein concentrations between mg microsomal proteinincubation at incubation times up to min a ph optimum range of was observed for all variables of HFA desaturase activity which were examined the rate of desaturation of stearoyl coa was approximately twice that for palmitoyl coa these results indicate that the same fatty acid desaturation system which is functional in the liver is also present in significant amounts in mammalian lungs
1356,the effect of denaturants on the quantitation of free sulfhydryl groups in the enzyme rhodanese thiosulfate sulfurtransferase ec has been reinvestigated in some detail the sulfhydryl assay with the colorimetric reagent dithiobis nitrobenzoic acid nbs shows four sulfhydryl groups per enzyme molecule mol wt when the colorimetric reagent is added to the assay mixture before the denaturant sodium dodecyl sulfate on the other hand only two sulfhydryl groups per molecule are observed when nbs is added T3 denaturation has been initiated the time dependence observed in this latter procedure indicates that the loss of the two CG is rapid and permanent the results depend on the denaturant used urea acts like sodium dodecyl sulfate while DTG reveals four sulfhydryl groups independent of reagent order the CA also gives four sulfhydryl CG independent of reagent order the CA also gives four sulfhydryl groups independent of reagent order with urea or sodium dodecyl sulfate under conditions which are expected to limit metal ioncatalyzed oxidation of sulfhydryl groups eg oxygen exclusion or metal ion chelation recent studies have shown that rhodanese has a molecular weight of no disulfides and four sulfhydryl groups per molecule these results together with the observations reported here are taken to indicate that a disulfide can be formed during denaturation of rhodanese and that the pathway of denaturation determines the result obtained
1357,pretreatment of bafj mice with damphetamine hcl mgkg twice daily for days produced a fold increase in the running response to a test dose of mgkg amphetamine amphetamine pretreatment decreased wholebrain norepinephrine C2 to of control values and wholebrain dopamine to the test dose of mgkg amphetamine lowered whole BB norepinephrine C2 of control mice from mugg to mugg in h in amphetaminepretreated mice this injection caused an increase in wholebrain NE from mugg to mugg at min followed by a decrease to mugg at min no change in whole brain dopamine levels was observed in either group amphetamine sensitization and norepinephrine depletion were still evident days after pretreatment no cross sensitization to morphine or cocaine was observed RES pretreatment resulted in a fold increase in locomotor activity following injection of damphetamine mgkg no sensitization or changes in catecholamine levels were observed in amphetaminetreated aj mice these results suggest that the sensitization produced by amphetamine i.c.v. may be related to the SD of brain norepinephrine
1358,maltohexaose producing amylase ec is the fourth known exoamylase the three previously known being glucoamylase betaamylase and pseudomonas stutzeri maltotetraose producing amylase the enzyme T3 release from aerobacter aerogenes cells by sodium lauryl sulfate extraction was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation deaesephadex column chromatography and sephadex g GF to fold of the original sodium lauryl sulfate extract activity it gave a single band on disc electrophoresis and the molecular weight by gel filtration was this amylase showed Vmax at degrees c and ph the ph stability range was relatively wide the enzyme retaining more than of its initial activity in the range of of the activity was retained T3 min at degrees c this enzyme produced maltohexaose from starch amylose and amylopectin by exoattack but did not act on alpha or betacyclodextrin pullulan or maltohexaitol also the enzyme acted on betalimit dextrins of amylopectin and glycogen to form branched oligosaccharides the unusual reaction of this enzyme on betalimit dextrin is discussed from the standpoint of the stereochemistry of alpha and alphaglucosidic bonds this is the anomalous amylase for which it is recognized that alphaglucosidic linkages in the substrates can mimic the effect of alphabonds as previously observed in pseudopriming reactions of e coli phosphorylase
1359,the effect of an aldosterone antagonist on the protective action of carbenoxolone sodium on the gastric mucosal barrier has been studied in three dogs with heidenhain pouches the net fluxes of hydrogen ion and sodium ion were measured before during and T3 contact with a mm bile acid solution at ph in pouches which had not been treated with drugs in pouches treated with carbenoxolone sodium and in pouches treated with both carbenoxolone sodium and the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone hydrogen ion back diffusion from and sodium ion gain by the untreated pouch was increased by mm bile acid solution addition to the pouches of either carbenoxolone sodium CT or carbenoxolone sodium and spironolactone reduced the hydrogen ion back diffusion after exposure to the bile acid solution the spironolactone did not change the protective effect of carbenoxolone on the gastric mucosal barrier carbenoxolone did not change the increased sodium ion diffusion caused by bile
1360,the commonest intracellular organelle characteristic of the phylum cnidaria or coelenterata subclass zoantharia is the spirocyst based on scanning and transmission electron microscopy of the tentacles of sea anemones and corals it appears that the tip of the spirocyst is either exposed to the environment or covered by a thin plasma membrane and often has a pebbled or knobby appearance surrounding the spirocyst tip is a ringlike structure which seems to be formed by the junction of the enclosing cell the spirocyte and the tip of the spirocyst the spirocyst thread is continuous with the capsule wall and emerges from within the apical ring during discharge no ciliary structures appear to be associated with spirocysts instead two different types of microvilli have been found short MV on the spirocyte itself and long microvilli furnished by the cell or cells surrounding the spirocyte the significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the reception of stimuli for spirocyst discharge
1361,wet dog shake wds SMB in rats well known as morphinewithdrawal syndrome could be elicited without concomitant PS for the first time chemically in nonmorphineaddicted animals the capability to produce wds was correlated with a TPS chemical structure among the titlecompounds the thresholddose of the most effective agents was mgkg rather independent of the mode of application maximal response of wds per min and animal were reached after application of mgkg wds SMB appeared within the first minutes after dose and lasted up to several hours detailed information is given on wdsaction of the substance sgd alpha chlorobenzylideneaminooxyisobutyric acid and the influence by different pharmacologie agents thereon inhibition of wds was produced by narcotic analgesics narcotic antagonists psychosedativ drugs yohimbine dlamphetamine cocaine apomorphine and clonidine without influence on wds were physostigmine atropine ganglionic or adrenergicblocking drugs dopa maoinhibitors serotonin and histaminantagonists and nonnarcotic analgesics to some extent chemically induced wds seemed to be susceptible like precipitated wds so sgd could be qualified for differentiating narctic analgesics for a quasiabstinence agent in research of dependence mechanisms and for a tool in neuroanatomical studies of the cns
1362,MM kinetics are observed in studies of HP bovine adrenal glucosephosphate dehydrogenase at ph in m bicine the km for nadp is mum and for glucosephosphate mum at ph km for nadp increases to mum the enzyme is inhibited by nadph both at ph and at with a kip of mum at ph inhibition is competitive with respect to both substrates implying that addition of substrates is random ordered the data are also interpreted in terms of reducing charge the mole fraction of coenzyme in the reduced form this appears to be the major mechanism for regulation of the pentose shunt dglucose oxidized by the enzyme at a very slow rate is also a competitive inhibitor for the NK substrate with a ki of m phosphate is a competitive inhibitor for glucosephosphate oxidation but both phosphate and sulfate accelerate glucose oxidation suggesting a common binding site for the two anions and the phosphate of the NK ATP while binding of acth to our enzyme preparations has been observed we have not been able in spite of repeated attempts to demonstrate augmentation of the activity of the enzyme by the addition of acth
1363,"in individuals age day to years with congenital heart disease blood oxygen transport function was studied in order to evaluate adaptive changes in shunt hypoxemia and to investigate the in vivo regulation of erythrocyte 2,3-DPG concentration rbc dpg in the presence of HbF hbf arterial po and oxygen content oxygen capacity acid base status oxygen affinity hbf fraction plasma ph red cell ph and rbc dpg were determined during the first days of life values of standard p stdp ph actual in vivo p actp rbc dpg o capacity arterial plasma ph and red cell ph were scattered around the normal range although tending to low values for stdp and arterial plasma ph and to high values for o capacity after the third month stdp actp rbc dpg o capacity and red cell ph were found to be elevated plasma ph and actp were scattered around the normal range figs and intraerythrocytic ph in hypoxemic infants was increased compared with normal children when related to plasma ph fig a close to normal intraerythrocytic ph was therefore found in the hypoxemic infants with low plasma ph and an increased intraerythrocytic ph in the hypoxemic children with normal plasma ph fig a significant negative correlation exists between erythrocyte h ion and dpg concentration fig regression constants derived from data at high mean and low mean fractions of hbf are not significantly different regression equations and in table thus the known difference in dpg binding to fetal or adult deoxyhemoglobin does not measurably influence the EA dpg concentration indicating that in vivo the dpg synthesis in hypoxia is virtually regulated by the EA ph which in turn is determined by plasma ph and the oxygenation state of hemoglobin"
1364,in an attempt to clarify the role of central neurotransmitters in gh and acth regulation chairadapted unanesthetized adult male rhesus monkeys and chronic indwelling intratrial cannulae were given min infusions of various agonists known to affect central amines and plasma samples were withdrawn for gh and cortisol determinations infusion of acidsaline vehicle alone had no significant effect on plasma gh or cortisol p less than ldihydroxyphenylalanine ldopa and mgkg but not AP mugkg a specific dopaminergic agonist produced significant elevations of gh both noradrenergic clonidine hcl and mugkg and dlthreodihydroxyphenylserine dlthreodops mgkg and 5-HT 5-HTP htp mgkg agonists induced significant gh responses these findings suggest that gh is regulated in the rhesus monkey by noradrenergic and 5-HT neurons whereas participation of dopaminergic SN has not been established significant cortisol responses were only observed following infusion of htp mgkg DA and noradrenergic agonists not only failed to alter resting cortisol levels but also did not affect the cortisol response to htp in the rhesus monkey serotoninergic mechanisms appear to be responsible for the regulation of resting cortisol levels a catecholamine GABA mechanism was not demonstrated in this species
1365,this syndrome is characterised by changes in the pulmonary capillary bed allowing filtration of edema fluid rich in proteins it provokes an alveolocapillary block and a fall in compliance positive diagnosis is envisaged from the clinical circumstances implicating a change in the pulmonary capillaries blast shock microemboli the fall in po is early and intense the fall in compliance is later and leads to hypoventilation necessitating VE assistance diffuse radiological opacification of both pulmonary fields is characteristics in its appearance and also in its prolonged course in the differential diagnosis one should try to eliminate acute pulmonary edema and refractory hypoxia of bronchogenic origin prognosis of the condition is fixed by the course of the po of possible hypoventilation of the radiological pictures under treatment although persistance of the syndrome for more than one or two weeks is of bad prognosis cases have been known to progress for more than three weeks and to heal leaving no aftereffects the syndrome can be complicated by cardiac incompetence organic renal failure which again aggravate the prognosis
1366,a radiochemical method for the studies on the microsomal udpglucuronic acid metabolism has been developed the rat liver microsomes caused a rapid hydrolysis of udpglucuronic acid to dglucuronic acid phosphate and further although much slower to free dglucuronic acid in trishcl buffer ph they were produced in ratio no other metabolites were found in measurable amounts the pyrophosphatase splitting udpglucuronic acid showed a ph optimum at but the liberation of dglucuronic acid from udpglucuronic acid had two ph maxima ph and edta appeared to be less powerful inhibitor of pyrophosphatase than previously suggested about per cent of the udpglucuronic acid hydrolyzing activity was still remaining in the presence of mm edta dglucarolactone was found to have a slight inhibitory action on the pyrophosphatase activity citrate inhibited powerfully the hydrolysis of udpglucuronic acid and the liberation of free dglucuronic acid phosphate was also GABA in the presence of an exogenous udpglucuronosyltransferase ATP nitrophenol the formation of dglucuronic acid phosphate and free dglucuronic acid were slightly reduced and dglucuronic acid phosphate nitrophenylglucuronide and free dglucuronic acid were produced in ratio when mm edta was added to diminish the hydrolytic consumption of the glucuronyl donor substrate the corresponding ratio was still as unfavorable as the measurable activity of udpglucuronosyltransferase was lower in the presence of phosphate or citrate than in trishcl buffer although they protected the glucuronyl donor ATP against hydrolysis the results indicate that even in the presence of added glucuronyl acceptor ATP the hydrolysis of udpglucuronic acid predominates the conjugation in rat CL microsomes the rate of the hydrolysis of udpglucuronic acid is quite considerable even in the presence of edta and it is recommended to control the udpglucuronic acid pyrophosphatase activity when udpglucuronosyltransferase and glucuronidation reactions are studied free GlcA appears to be produced from udpglucuronic acid for further use via dglucuronic acid phosphate the ratelimiting step being the hydrolysis of this intermediate udpglucuronosyltransferase glucuronides of either endogenous or exogenous aglycones and betaglucuronidase have only a minor role in this respect in rat CL microsomes
1367,a microsomal enzyme preparation from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae catalyzes the transfer of mannosyl units from gdpmannose to mannose and a number of mannosecontaining oligosaccharides and glycosides whereby different glycosidic bonds are formed of the EDC tested besides mannose only those containing an alphalinked mannosyl unit at the nonreducing position of their molecule were effective as acceptors monodeoxyanalogues of mannose as well as alphamannose phosphates did not serve as acceptors in the above reaction the structure of the product formed with mannose as acceptor was determined to be oalphadmannosyl leads to mannose with alphaman leads to mannose as the acceptor the product was alphaman leads to mannose and with alphaman leads to mannose the product was tentatively characterized as a mixture of alphaman leads to alphaman leads to mannose and alphaman leads to alphaman leads to mannose the enzymes catalyzing the formation of different types of glycosidic bonds differed in their acceptor specificity phactivity curves and rates of heat denaturation radioactive disaccharides were unable to enter the mannan protein molecule in the CF system while free radioactive mannose did incorporate into polysaccharide to a minor extent under the same conditions
1368,the rate of atp synthesis of illuminated chloroplasts is correlated with the electric conductance of their inner membranes in agreement with previous studies it is shown that atp synthesis is paralleled by an increased conductance of the thylakoid membrane this conductance together with the ability to form atp is abolished if chloroplasts are treated with an antibody against the coupling factor cf it is not influenced by the fragmented monovalent antibody this parallels the lack of influence of the fragmented antibody on atp synthesis in contrast to its influence on hydrolysis and exchange reactions we conclude that there are different sites for the interaction of the coupling factor with adenine nucleotides SE of the coupling factor is shown to increase the membrane conductance by more than two orders of magnitude reincorporation of the crude coupling factor partially restores the net conductance of the membrane increase in resistance by a factor of while a higher degree of restoration was observed for atp synthesis and the proton conductivity of the membrane we conclude that the extraction procedure opens different conductive channels in the membrane a proton TPS one possibly associated with the binding protein for the coupling factor plus other channels for nonprotons which in contrast to the proton channel cannot be plugged by reincorporation of the coupling factor
1369,in case of cranial trauma early respiratory troubles either of central or peripheral origin often accelerate the deterioration of the neurological situation the different values of pco po ph and alcaline reserve measured on samples of csf in comatose patients prove the central acidosis related to metabolic and vascular disorders in the damaged Az our results confirm the correlation between the importance of this disturbances and the severity of the trauma it is thus necessary to insure patients of satisfactory respiration conditions the tracheobronchial cleansing is applicable to intubated or tracheotomized patients by an instillation of ml of simple or bicarbonated physiological serum to times a day followed by repeated aspirations and associated to a preventive ET instillation of mg of gentamycin times a day moreover we use controlled respiration which does not modify the gazometric parameters in the csf but which assures patients a normoxia and moderate hypocapnia with a decrease of intracranial hypertension treatment by controlled hyperventilation must be precocious because the recuperation at the level of the damaged zones is very slow
1370,obelin the caactivated luminescent protein from the hydroid obelia geniculata was sealed inside pigeon EA ghosts in order to investigate effects on their permeability of different methods of preparation and of the bivalent cation ionophore a changes in free ca within the ghosts were studied by following the rate of luminescence of obelin the possibility that the obelin might have been released from the ghosts during an experiment was investigated by studying the PR of inulin and pyruvate kinase from the ghosts less than of the inulin or pyruvate kinase sealed within the ghosts was released under any of the experimental conditions triton x vv made the ghosts highly permeable to ca in the presence of mmca and triton of the obelin was utilized within s a timecourse of resealing ghosts at degrees c showed that over a period of min the ghosts became gradually less permeable to ca ghosts which remained at degrees c retained only a small concentration of obelin and atp and were highly permeable to ca EA ghosts resealed for min at degrees c rather than degrees c were more permeable to ca as shown by the fact that of the obelin in the ghosts was utilized during the first s after the addition of mmca as opposed to for ghosts resealed at degrees c haemolysis at ph rather than resulted in ghosts which were highly permeable to ca after resealing for min at degrees c of the obelin in the ghosts produced by haemolysis at ph was utilized in the first s T3 the addition of mmca compared with for ghosts produced at ph the bivalent cation ionophore a increased the permeability of the ghosts to ca maximum effects of the ionophore mugml were obtained by preincubating the ghosts with the ionophore a mugml in the presence of a low concentration of mg and in the absence of ca
1371,a glc assay was used to study the excretion of PB and its metabolites in the urine of human subjects following oral doses of and g from to of the dose was found in the urine the major metabolite probenecid acyl TG accounted for of the dose approximately equal amounts of the mononpropyl AA alcohol and carboxylic acid metabolites were excreted in the unconjugated from with only traces in the conjugated form the primary alcohol metabolite was not found in measurable amounts the terminal halflives for excretion of all metabolites were in the range of hr were independent of dose and were limited by their rates of formation a prolonged time course of excretion of the metabolites particularly at higher doses suggests that PB being poorly soluble in water precipitates from solution in the gi tract forming a depot of drug from which absorption is dissolution rate limited the urinary excretion of unchanged probenecid which accounts for of the dose is dependent on both the ph and flow rate of urine
1372,phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase which has been isolated from chicken liver mitochondria in essentially homogenous form carries out the irreversible decarboxylation of oxalacetate to pyruvate in the presence of catalytic amounts of gdp or idp as well as the reversible decarboxylation of oxalacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the presence of ATP amounts of gtp or itp the pyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvateforming reactions are similar in their nucleoside specificity and appear to be carried out by the same protein however the two activities vary markedly in their response to added metal ions and sulfhydryl reagents phosphoenolpyruvate formation is completely dependent on the presence of a divalent metal ion with mn the most effective species this reaction is also stimulated by sulfhydryl reagents such as mercaptoethanol in contrast the pyruvateforming reaction is strongly inhibited by divalent metal ions including mn and also by moderate concentrations of sulfhydryl reagents these observations and the demonstration that Pyr kinaselike activity is very low or absent make it unlikely that Pyr formation proceeds via phosphoenolpyruvate as an intermediate although the pyruvateforming reaction is inhibited by added metal ions the reaction is also inhibited by metalchelating agents such as hydroxyquinoline and OP suggesting that the reaction is dependent on the presence of a metal ion it has not been possible however to demonstrate that the enzyme is a metalloprotein
1373,eight healthy male subjects received single mg oral doses of lorazepam containing mucimg of clorazepam multiple venous blood samples were drawn during the first hr after the dose and all urine and stool were collected for hr after dosing concentrations of lorazepam and its metabolites in body fluids were determined by appropriate analytic techniques following a lag time lorazepam was absorbed with an apparent firstorder halflife of min the peak plasma concentration was ngml measured in the pooled sample drawn hr after the dose this corresponded to the time at which clinical effects appeared to be maximal the apparent elimination halflife of lorazepam was about hr biotransformation to a pharmacologically inactive glucuronide metabolite appeared to be the major mechanism of lorazepam clearance a mean of of po radioactivity was recovered in urine and was recovered in stool lorazepam glucuronide comprised of urinary reactivity its renal clearance was mlmin other identified metabolites included hydroxylorazepam a quinazolinone derivative and a quinazoline carboxylic acid all of these were quantitatively minor

1375,the administration of guanethidine to adult rats has been shown by morphological criteria to destroy sympathetic neurons the objective of this study was to evaluate by biochemical and functional criteria the degree and permanence of this sympathectomy young adult male rats g were injected with saline controls or with guanethidine for weeks the status of the sympathetic nervous system in the animals was evaluated and to months after cessation of treatment seven months after cessation of treatment the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in the SCG ganglia of treated animals was greatly reduced as were the norepinephrine levels in peripheral tissues the concentration of epinephrine and the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in adrenals were not different from controls at any of the times studied norepinephrine concentrations in several areas of the CE nervous system were unchanged increases in blood pressure in response to stimulation of the sympathetic vasomotor outflow in the pithed rat preparation were markedly and permanently reduced in guanethidinetreated animals isolated intestinal nervemuscle preparations from guanethidinetreated animals usually contracted in response to nerve stimulation rather than relaxing as in controls the response to stimulation of the hypogastric nerve in vas deferens preparations was reduced month T3 cessation of treatment the responses of the vas deferens from guanethidinetreated and control animals were the same months after treatment despite a reduction in norepinephrine concentration the data demonstrate that the administration of guanethidine to adult rats produces a marked and permanent destruction of the peripheral sympathetic NS
1376,the spot leiostomus xanthrus has a single tetrameric hemoglobin structural studies indicate the presence of alpha and betalike chains with coohterminal sequences of arg and tyrhis respectively the same as is found in human hemoglobin spot hemoglobin possesses a root effect a heterotropic control mechanism like the bohr effect but with more extreme ph dependence in the equilibria and kinetics of o and co binding the root effect seems to be a molecular adaptation in that ph and anionsensitive hemoglobins may help fish achieve neutral buoyancy by facilitating QO2 to the swim bladder changes in the kinetics of both on and off processes contribute to the greatly decreased ligand affinity of spot hemoglobin at low ph the time course ofligand combination at low ph is biphasic and wavelength dependent suggesting a differential effect of ph on the alpha and betalike chains the change in the shape of the ligandbinding curve with ph may be interpreted in terms of a protondependent transition between low t and high r affinity conformations however this may not be the only mechanism since differential ph effects on the two types of chains may also contribute to the observed ph dependence
1377,a cinnamoylcoenzyme a reductase catalyzing the nadphdependent reduction of substituted cinnamoylcoa thiol esters to the corresponding cinnamaldehydes was isolated from cell suspension cultures of soybean glycine max l var mandarin a fold purification of the enzyme was achieved by nhso fractionation chromatography on deaecellulose hydroxyapatite and sephadex g and affinity chromatography on ampsepharose the apparent molecular weight of the reductase was found to be about on the basis of the elution volume from a sephadex g column maximum rate of reaction was observed between ph and in m citrate buffer at degrees c the enzyme was markedly inhibited by thiol reagents the reductase showed a high degree of specificity for cinnamoylcoa esters feruloylcoa was the substrate with the lowest km value mum and highest v nkatmg followed by hydroxyferuloylcoa sinapoylcoa pcoumaroylcoa caffeoylcoa and cinnamoylcoa no reaction took place with acetylcoa the km value for nadph varied with the type of substrate km values of and mum were found with feruloylcoa sinapoylcoa and pcoumaroylcoa respectively the rate of reaction observed with nadh was only about of that found with nadph the reaction products coash and nadp inhibited the reaction the ki values were in the range of mm and the inhibition was of a MK-801 mixed type the role of the reductase in the biosynthesis of lignin precursors is discussed
1378,the influence of a low protein diet on the immunologic function of nzb mice was investigated the low protein NI was associated with decreased weight gain in both male and female nzb mice the mice fed the low protein diet did not develop splenomegaly which generally occurs by to months of age in nzb mice fed a normal amount of protein further to monthold nzb mice fed the low HP maintained more vigorous antibody production to sheep red blood cells greater capacity to produce graftvshost reactions and more vigorous cellmediated killer cell immunity after immunization against dba mastocytoma cells than did nzb mice on a normal protein diet the decrease of pha and con a response which normally occurs with aging in nzb mice was abrogated to some degree by protein restriction however response to lps which also declines with age in nzb mice did not appear to be influenced by diet
1379,the photoinduced reaction of phenylalanyltrna synthetase ec from ecoli mre with trnaphe containing photoreative pnchnhcochgroup attached to thiouridine su azidotrnaphe was investigated the attachment of this group does not influence the KB of the complex of phetrnaphe with the enzyme however it results in sevenfold increase of km in the enzymatic aminoacylation of trnaphe under irradiation at nm at ph the covalent binding of cpheazidotrnaphe to the enzyme takes place moles of the reagent being attached per mole of the enzyme trna prevents the reaction phenylalanine atpadpamp adenosine and pyrophosphate xx m dont affect neither the stability of the trnaenzyme complex nor the rate of the affinity labelling the presence of the mixture of either phenylalanine or phenylalaninol with atp as well as phenylalaninol adenylate exhibits inhibition of the photoinduced reaction therefore the reaction of cpheazidotrna with the enzyme is significantly less sensitive to the presence of the ligands than the reaction of chlorambucilyltrna with the reactive group attached to the acceptor end of the trna studied in it has been concluded that the kinetics of the affinity labelling does permit to discriminate the influence of the low molecular weight ligands of the enzyme on the different sites of the trna enzyme interaction
1380,the effect of doses of estradiol ranging from to mug on the uterine weight of the spayed rat was studied h T3 a single sc i.t. of the hormone the lowest dose inducing a significant increase in uterine weight was mug when histamine dihydrochloride mg was simultaneously injected with the hormone the effect of small doses of oestradiol mug was significantly increased when oestradiol and histamine were po for successive days the uterine weight of animals receiving mug oestradiol if compared with untreated controls was increased only in the histaminetreated group when mug oestradiol was po histamine did not modify the increase already produced by the hormone spermidine and burimamide two substances structurally related to histamine increased hoestradiol uptake by the spayed rat uterus the latter an antihistamine drug acting on hreceptors as well as pyrathiazine a histamine releaser having antihistamine properties decreased the effect of histamine on oestradiol uptake whereas diphenhydramine an antihistamine drug blocking hreceptors did not modify it pyrathiazine was itself able to diminish oestradiol uptake
1381,present knowledge of the mechanisms regulating PR of renin is reviewed with particular emphasis on neural factors evidence is given for a direct effect of renal innervation on beta adrenergic receptors in juxtaglomerular cells and for the involvement of reflex PR of renin in conditions such as tilting and acute salt depletion participation of neural and nonneural mechanisms of control is also shown to occur in other conditions such as aortic constriction and hemorrhage the view is held that neural sympathetic factors might explain some of the renin disturbances found in essential hypertension first in patients with high renin hypertension part of the hypertension is renindependent and these pressor levels of renin seem to be neurally induced since they can commonly be suppressed by beta adrenoreceptor blocking agents second the hypothesis is presented that patients with low renin hypertension at least those who have no volume disturbance have a blunted sympathetic control of renin release therefore a sufficiently precise test of sympathetic activity and possibly of body fluid volumes should be associated with renin profiles for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of arterial hypertension and as a better guide to therapeutic management indeed most of the available antihypertensive drugs act on sympathetic activity body fluid volume or renin and this multifaceted profile would provide more rational guidelines for treatment
1382,fifty one patients from different surgical units hence anesthetized by different anaesthesists underwent reinterventions in abdominal surgery the indications for the first intervention essentially involved the supramesocolic region of the abdomen out of cases the operative risk during the first MI was on the average pour cent the protocol of the first anaesthesia which was known in cases was of the narcoataralgestic type the date of the return to the operation table varied from to days the state of the patients was in general catastrophic organic renal failure acute respiratory failure here again the anaesthesia was of the narcoataralgesic type but the choice of drugs varied depending on the patients state however non significant difference was noted in the average hourly drug consumption between the two interventions apart from one circulatory arrest during induction in one patient with hemorrhagic shock no death was attributable to the anesthetic technique the authors using these findings attempt to pick out a practical line of behaviour
1383,over a wide range of ph horseradish peroxidase compound i can be reduced quantitatively via compound ii to the native enzyme by only molar equivalent of pcresol since molar equivalents of electrons are required for the single turnover of the enzymatic cycle pcresol behaves as a electron reductant with pcresol and compound i in a ratio compound ii and pmethylphenoxy radicals are obtained in the transient state compound ii is then reduced to the native enzyme a possible explanation for the facile reduction of compound ii involves reaction with the dimerization product of these radicals molar equivalent of dihydroxydimethylbiphenyl if only molar equivalent of pcresol is present than at high ph the reduction stops at compound ii the major Css peroxidase oxidation product of pcresol with pcresol in large excess compared to the enzyme concentration is pummerers ketone pummerers ketone is only reactive at ph values greater than about where significant amounts of the enol can be formed via the enolate anion therefore in alkaline solution it is reactive with compound i but not with compound ii which is converted into an unreactive basic form these results indicate that pummerers ketone cannot be the intermediate free radical product responsible for reducing compound ii in the single turnover experiments it is postulated that pummerers ketone is formed only in the Css by the reaction of the pmethylphenoxy radical with excess pcresol
1384,the dalton glycoprotein gp purified from rauscher murine leukemia virus rmulv by affinity chromatography specifically binds to murine but not other rat cells in culture binding is prevented by specific AS raides to gp antigp the binding assay as described in this report can detect receptors on as few as murine cells and with x cells gives significant binding with sec the results show that the purified glycoprotein retians biologic activity and can form a stable complex with specific receptors on mouse cell membranes the assay can therefore be used to characterize the nature of the cellular receptors that are essential for one virus infection purified gp binding to mouse cells is prevented if the cells are actively producing related ecotropic type c viruses presumably because the receptors are occupied and are not available to bind exogenously applied gp the IB of gp to mu cells is enhanced by the presence of calcium ions and low ph binding studies performed using an excess of igp indicate the niht cells bind approximately x molecules of igp per cell
1385,some properties of rat skin benzoylargininenaphthylamide hydrolase types i preparations i and ai and ii S9 ii and nii were studied both types were activated by dithiothreitol and edta but responded differently to mm kcn when benzoylargininenaphthylamide bana was used as a substrate type i was inhibited while type ii was activated when leucinenaphthylamide was used as a substrate both types were activated by kcn thiol proteinase inhibiting substances like heavy metals iodoacetic acid chloromercuribenzoic acid and tosyllysine chloromethylketone inhibited the enzymes diisopropylfluorophosphate phenylmethylsulfonyfluoride aminobenzamidine and highmolecularweight trypsin inhibitors were without effect the ATP specificity of rat skin bana hydrolase resembled that of an CAA naphthylamidase naphthylamides of methionine lysine arginine and alanine being hydrolyzed most rapidly the rate of hydrolysis of bana was only of that of methionine naphthylamide amino acid esters with a free alphaamino group were also good substrates the transformation of type ii to type i at acidic ph was studied during the transformation amino acids or peptides were formed and probably some inhibitor present in type ii was destroyed proteolytically
1386,a transplantable mouse testicular teratoma ott which displays a spectrum of neuroepithelial differentiation was evaluated biochemically for concentrations of cAMP camp serotonin ht and enzymes involved in the metabolism of the BA and acetylcholine these values were compared between teratomas with NEP differentiation as the major or minor component and brains of neonatal and AD mice of related strains camp ht tryptophan hydroxylase tph aromatic amino acid decarboxylase aadc and MAO-A mao were present in addition enzymes of the adrenergic system ie IMT hydroxylase th and dopaminebetahydroxylase dbh and of the ACh system ie choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase were studied biochemical differences in RT groups probably reflected variations in the proportion of NEP components trends suggested an increase of camp and an increased activity of tph aadc th and dbh in tumors with increased proportions of NEP cells these findings indicate that the NEP component of the mouse teratoma may serve as a model for the study of neuronal differentiation in primitive neuroepithelial neoplasms
1387,the nearultraviolet circular dichroism cd of three homogeneous antitype iii pneumococcal antibodies in the absence and the presence of the specific hexasaccharide ligand was studied in addition recombinations and hybridizations of h and l chains derived from two of these antibodies were carried out and the cd spectra of bound and free reconstituted igg molecules were measured the results indicate that the cd spectra of the native antibodies in the nm range are very similar in shape and sign and exhibit a positive band at nm the homologous reconstituted antibody molecules exhibited cd spectra very similar in shape and sign to those of the native antibody molecules although recombinant molecules are no longer stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds upon addition of the hexasaccharide ligand a significant decrease in amplitude of the cd spectra occurred in all three native antibodies and their fab fragments as well as in the homologous recombinant molecules no cd spectral changes could be detected upon interaction of the hapten ligand with the rat recombinants all homogeneous antibodies studied exhibited fluorescence quenching upon oligosaccharide binding and a blue shift of the emission maximum this property allowed the determination of the binding constant of one selected antibody to be made taken together cd and fluorescence spectroscopic data suggest that oligosaccharide ligands induced detectable conformational changes in the fab fragment of the antibody
1388,gastric juice from normals patients with gastric ulcer and patients with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis was investigated in respect of its activity on unheated and heated Fn plates and its content of fdp and plasminogen or PL with immunochemical methods gastric juice from normals showed no activity on unheated and heated Fn plates and no fdp or plasminogen could be demonstrated in the patients with gastric ulcer the gastric juice showed little or no fibrinolytic activity on fibrin plates except in who had regurgitation of duodenal juice and neutral ph of the juice these patients had equally high activity on heated as on unheated plates and no plasmin could be demonstrated it was shown that this activity was not due to fibrinolysis but to nonspecific proteolytic activity probably trypsin the patients with erosive haemorrhage gastroduodenitis exhibited quite a different picture the gastric juice from these patients showed extremely high activity on fibrin plates the activity was higher on unheated than on heated plates the activity was inhibited in vitro by addition of eaca and in vivo T3 administration of amca the occurence of plasmic could be demonstrated directly immunologically in the gastric juice by comparsion of plasmin and trypsin in various assays it could further be improved that the gastric juice in these cases contained plasminogen activator and plasmin the patients with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis showed no increase in fibrinolysis in the blood but low values for plasminogen and alpham and the serum contained fdp these findings in the blood and gastric juice were interpreted as signs of local fibrinolysis in the stomach and duodenum there is reason to assume that this gastric fibrinolysis contributes substantially to the bleeding tendency the effect of administration of amca on FA and the haemorrhage lends support to the assumption of such a mechanism
1389,human marrow transplantation has resulted in observations of fundamental significance in understanding both AA and HAL for example the observation that transplanted marrow can grow successfully in patients with AA indicates that the disease is due to a defect in the marrow F0 cells and not in the marrow microenvironment similarly the observation of recurrent one in donor cells has important implications nonetheless marrow transplantation is sufficiently established therapeutically to be considered the treatment of choice for patients with severe aplastic anemia and a realistic alternative for patients with recurrent acute leukemia we suggest that patients be managed with regard to marrow transplantation according to the general RPA outlined in table marrow transplantation and histocompatibility typing are available at increasing numbers of institutions throughout the world more and more patients with either severe aplastic anemia or recurrent acute leukemia should have marrow transplantation available to them when it is indicated as part of optimal management of these no longer hopeless diseases
1390,adult mice of cbl cba cba x cbl f cba x cbl f f x cba and f x cbl strains were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with a constant dose of B6 bone marrow cells at the th day T3 the bone marrow transplantation the colony count was performed in SP of irradiated recipients in the SP of f cba and B6 mice were registered low intermediate and high numbers of colonies respectively the segregation ratios in f progeny were close to low intermediate high the segregation ratios in backcross f x cba were close to low intermediatenumbers of colonies backcrosses f x cbl were distributed to low and high numbers of colonies with the ratio the number of spleen colonies of males and females was the same in all segregating progeny the results of hybrid analysis suggest that a single pair of allelic genes is involved in genetic control of allogenic inhibition and that the resistance manifestation of inhibition to cbl stem cells is conferred by the dominant S2
1391,attempts were made to find a PSA correlate with previously observed behavioral alterations after administration of alphamelanocytestimulating hormone msh and msh releaseinhibiting factor mifi brains of intact and hypophysectomized hypox rats were analyzed for endogenous catecholamine levels and the Kd of endogenous norepinephrine ne after treatment with the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor alphamethylparatyrosine ampt the studies undertaken show the following after the injection of msh mugkg ip daily x and ampt samples in different CG of IN and hypox rats were taken at and hrs in different brain Az in the midbrain area for the IN group of rats the Rd of ne was faster and for the hypox rats it was slower than the rate for control rats not treated with the peptides ne levels in the same area at time were percent lower than controls in hypox rats and unchanged in unoperated animals T3 the i.t. of mifi mgkg ip daily x in similar experiments as with msh a reduced rate p less than of ne disappearance for the first hr and an increased rate p less than of ne disappearance for the last hr of the experiments occurred for both the intact and hypox rats in the midbrain area where endogenous ne levels were lowered by and percent at min in no other brain Az were alterations in ne breakdown found in both the IN and hypox rat groups behavioral changes have been found previously under similar exp conditions in both intact and hypox rats rates of dopamine disappearance in experiments similar to those described for ne disappearance indicated that in the striatal BB area no NC was found in the IN rats after either msh or mifi whereas a decrease in da disappearance was found for hypox rats during the six hour exp period only T3 msh the results indicate that a rho between behavioral changes rates of disappearance and endogenous levels of ne in the midbrain area may occur after mifi at the times examined but that a similar correlation for msh did not appear likely
1392,synthesis of five of the enzymes of the common pathway of aromatic biosynthesis has been shown to be unaffected by either the aromatic amino acidsthe product of the first reaction deoxydarabinoheptulosonic acidphosphate or the product of the last reaction chorismateor by the state of regulator gene loci tyrr on the other hand the rate of synthesis of these enzymes and of several other enzymes for which repression control was inactive because of mutations in relevant regulator genes was found to NC with growth rate these changes were found to correlate at faster growth rates than those observed in glucose minimal medium with the alterations in the relative frequencies of the corresponding structural genes which occur at these growth rates it was found that when wildtype cells were grown at these faster growth rates in medium lacking the aromatic amino acids complete derepression of the tyrosineinhibitable deoxydarabinoheptulosonic acidphosphate synthetase occurred in strong contrast to the situation when wildtype cells are grown in gl minimal medium
1393,the teleostean gill is characterized by an exceptionally low permeability to water water moves along the osmotic gradient across the gill being gained in FW and lost in sea water coupling of water movement to solute movement has not been reported in fresh water the gill is the site of independent active uptake of sodium and chloride na uptake is coupled to h or nh excretion cl uptake to hco excretion amiloride blocks sodium transport and thiocyanate inhibits the chloride pump in sea water sodium and chloride exchanges across the gill are about times faster than in fresh water up to of the internal sodium or chloride being exchanged per hour chloride is actively excreted while sodium movement may well be passive the chloride pump is associated with a mechanism for nak exchange both pump and nak exchange are blocked by thiocyanate and possibly by ouabain three enzymes are involved in the ionic pumps carbonate dehydratase ec carbonic anhydrase sodiumpotassiumstimulated adenosinetriphosphatase ec atpase and anionstimulated atpase specialized cells chloride cells are presumably the site of the active transport
1394,benorylate is obtained by esterification of acetylsalicylic acid and nacetyl paminophenol acetamidophenyl acetoxybenzoate experimentally this new product has been shown to be a good analgesic and antiinflammatory agent a clinical trial was carried out in order to T0 the tau side effects and tolerance of this new product in a group of hospitalised patients aged from to years who were treated with this new product had ankylosing spondylitis had chronic progressive rheumatoid ICA had RS had psoriatic arthropathy had osteoarthrosis of the hip and had various forms of rheumatism the drug was po orally in suspension form initially three times per day then twice the total daily doses being ml g or ml g treatment was regarded as ERP in of the cases and of these good and very good results were obtained in of the patients tolerance was satisfactory and of these it was excellent in only in cases did treatment have to be discontinued on account of side effects from the biological point of view uricaemia was significantly reduced in patients and in patients uricuria increased with regard to the level of salicylate in the blood assays showed that it is the same for g benorylate and for g aspirin benorylate has been shown to be an effective treatment for both inflammatory and degenerative rheumatic disorders the results of its use can be compared with those obtained by acetylsalicylic acid but is better tolerated in addition in chronic disorders it is better to have to take the product only twice per day
1395,the acetylcholine reversal potential er of cultured rat myotubes is mv when activated the receptor is permeable to k and na but not to cl ions measurement of er in trissubstituted nafree medium also indicated a permeability to tris ions unlike AD frog muscle the magnitude of er was insensitive to change in external ca up to mm or to changes in external ph between and the equivalent circuit equation describing the electrical circuit composed of two parallel ionic batteries ek and ena and their respective conductances gk and gna which has been generally useful in describing the er of AD rat and frog muscle could also be applied to rat myotubes when er was measured over a wide range of external na concentrations the equivalent circuit equation could not be applied to myotubes bathed in media of different external k concentrations in this case the er was more closely described by the goldman constant field equation under certain circumstances it is known that the receptor in adult rat and frog muscle can be induced to reversibly shift from behavior described by the equivalent circuit equation to that described by the goldman equation attempts to similarly manipulate the responses of cultured rat myotubes were unsussessful these trials included a reduction in temperature degress c partial alphabungarotoxin blodkade and activation of responses with the cholinergic agonist decamethonium
1396,dibutyryl cyclic amp dbcamp elicits a concentrationdependent stimulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the striatal and mesolimbic synaptosomes the per cent of stimulation is significantly higher in the mesolimbic synaptosomes than in the striatal synaptosomes dbcamp and depolarizing agents ouabain or veratridine have an additive effect on synaptosomal tyrosine hydroxylase activity indicating that they stimulate tyrosine hydroxylase activity by different mechanisms camp does not stimulate soluble striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity unless it is added in combination with atp and mg compounds required for the activity of campdependent protein kinase the camp elicited per cent stimulation of soluble tyrosine hydroxylase activity is dependent upon the concentration of added protein kinase and upon the ph of the reaction dbcamp has the same effect on the kinetic state of IMT hydroxylase in synaptosomes as camp on the soluble tyrosine hydroxylase the nucleotide does not alter the apparent km for IMT reduces the km for the pteridine cofactor and increases the ki for dopamine thus camp increases the affinity of tyrosine hydroxylase for the pteridine cofactor and concomitantly decreases the affinity for the endproduct inhibition
1397,in this paper the synthesis of collagen crosslinks in vitro was investigated in a defined system consisting of highly purified chick cartilage lysyl oxidase and chick bone collagen fibrils crosslink synthesis in vitro was quite similar to the biosynthesis of collagen crosslinks in vivo enzymedependent synthesis of crosslink intermediates and crosslinked collagen derived from lathyritic collagen occurred the concentration of the two principal reducible crosslinks ndehydrodihydroxylysinonorleucine and ndehydrohydroxylysinonorleucine increased to a peak value of approximately two crosslinks per molecule and then decreased synthesis of histidinohydroxymerodesmosine and a second polyfunctional crosslink of unknown structure began T3 synthesis of bifunctional crosslinks was largely completed and proceeded linearly afterwards inhibition of lysyl oxidase after the bulk of bifunctional crosslink synthesis had occurred did not alter the rate of decrease in reducible crosslink concentration but did inhibit further histidinohydroxymerodesmosine synthesis these results indicate that lysyl oxidase and collagen fibrils are the only macromolecules required for crosslink biosynthesis in vivo it is likely that the decrease in reducible crosslinks observed during fibril maturation results from spontaneous reactions within the collagen fibril rather than additional enzymatic reactions
1398,the activity of alphahemolysin increased at the log growth phase in the SC of e coli p hly hemolytic strain this activity diminished with the NC into the stationary phase and then fell sharply replacement of the culture medium in the stationary growth phase by fresh one led to restoration of the hemolytic activity of the culture the culture fluid separated from the cells at the stationary growth phase produced an GABA action on the Hly ca ions G1 and stabilized the alphahemolysin sodium citrate and sucrose served as hemolysis inhibitors the action of alphahemolysin was maximal against human erythrocytes at ph hemolytic activity was characterized in time by a distinct lagphase and the phase of the greatest rate of reaction the duration of the lagphase and also the rate of hemolysis depended on the concentration of alphahemolysin with the increase of the hemolysin concentration lagphase was shortened and the reaction was accelerated there proved to be a linear relationship between the amount of erythrocytes taken into the reaction and the rate of hemoglobin release and also there was noted a temperature activation of the hemolytic reaction
1399,chloroplast nadplinked G3P dehydrogenase was resolved into three forms that differed in molecular weight a larger than or equal to million b and c less than or equal to after preincubation with an effector atp nadph or pi the activity of forms a and c was unaffected whereas the activity of b the RII form was increased fold activation was accompanied by the exposure of previously hidden sulfhydryl CG the rate of activation was slower than the rate of catalysis and resulted in a lag phase during the measurement of activity when the enzyme was preincubated in the absence of an effector the addition of one of several compounds as a second effector at a concentration which itself was nonactivating in the presence of a first effector enhanced activation by lowering the concentration of the first effector required for halfmaximal activation pi constantatp or nadph varied atp or nadph constantpi varied other combinations of effectors caused little change in activity atp constantnadph varied nadph constantatp varied glyceraldehyde phosphate added as a second effector induced contrasting changes an increase in the atpmediated activation and a decrease in the nadphmediated activation the results are consistent with the view that the products of the photochemical reactions of chloroplasts atp and nadph in conjunction with other metabolites regulate the activity of G3P dehydrogenase in the photosynthetic assimilation of co
1400,after a review of kÃ¼ntshers intramedullary nailing the author resumed the informations about the interlocking medullary nail and its technique a new device as a guide SF-36 for easier application of the transverse bolts was constructed on the basis of authors concept using the new technique and guide instrument xray television controll is not necessary for placing the bolts in their right places through a small incision the time of T0 and the risk of infection was also diminished by the new technique the indications for the interlocking medullary nailing have been completed by the author with the pathologic fractures the first cases treated by the new technique of the interlocking medullary nailing are analysed and a few cases are reported in detail good results have been obtained as regards both the bone union and the functional results based on the good results the new technique of the interlocking medullary nailing is recommended by the author
1401,kinetic parameters of mouse thymocyte adenylate cyclase activity were determined naf and cholera toxin stimulated adenylate cyclase stimulation by either agent did not change the ph or mg optima relative to control unstimulated cyclase the km value for atp of adenylate cyclase stimulated by naf was significantly reduced from control by contrast cholera toxin treatment did not change the km relative to control adenylate cyclase when stimulated by naf had an optimum for mn alone or mn in combination with mg at least twice that of control in contrast cyclase activity prepared from cells treated with cholera toxin remained unchanged with regard to these divalent cations when compared to control addition of naf to adenylate cyclase prepared from cells treated with cholera toxin resulted in a significant reduction in activity suggesting that both naf and cholera toxin were acting on the same cyclase naf inhibition of cholera toxinstimulated activity was shown to be a direct interaction of fluoride on the stimulated cyclase enzyme this inhibition appeared to be immediate and independent on ph mg or atp concentrations although naf inhibition was lost when mn was present in the reaction mixture the activity expressed by addition of naf to cyclase prepared from cholera toxintreated cells was much less than by addition of naf to control as observed with cholera toxin stimulation alone activity expressed by the inhibited enzyme cholera toxin treated naf exhibited a km for atp and an optimum for mn CT or in combination with mg similar to control
1402,the interaction of chemoreflex and pulmonary inflation reflex control of the coronary circulation was examined in conscious dogs by comparing the responses to chemoreflex stimulation intracarotid injection of nicotine when ventilation was allowed to increase with those when ventilation was controlled the responses were also compared with those elicited by both forced mechanical and spontaneous hyperinflation when the HR rate was constant intracarotidly po nicotine induced an increase in the depth of respiration followed closely by an increase in late diastolic CF from to mlmin and a reduction in late diastolic coronary resistance from to mm hgml min after betareceptor and cholinergic blockade a similar coronary dilation in response to nicotine occurred only when ventilation was allowed to increase however when ventilation was controlled intracarotidly administered nicotine increased coronary resistance T3 combined betareceptor and ACh blockade the reflex coronary dilation was not observed after CSN nerve section or after alphareceptor blockade thus nicotine stimulation of the carotid chemoreflex results in a striking coronary dilation that has two components the minor component involves a chemoreflex with its efferent pathway in tthe vagi the major component of coronary dilation follows an increase in the depth of respiration and its efferent component appears to involve withdrawal of alphaadrenergic constrictor tone an almost MZ period of reflex coronary dilation followed either forced mechanical or spontaneous hyperinflation in the conscious dog
1403,the relative ability of arylacetamide deacetylase enzyme systems of dog liver to carry out the deacetylation of the carcinogens acetylaminobiphenyl acetylaminofluorene and acetylaminaphthalene was examined the arylacetamides were incubated with unfortified dog CL microsomes and CEA nmol arylaminemg proteinhr was estimated by colorimetric quantitation of the resulting arylamines the dog CL enzyme system displayed characteristics similar to those described for the rodent liver enzyme system in that enzyme activity was greatest in liver tissue was localized in the microsomal subcellular fraction required no cofactors and was inhibited by heat sodium fluoride and thiol reagents in five replicate assays the relative rates of deacetylation were about and with acetylaminobiphenyl acetylaminofluorene and acetylaminonaphthalene respectively as a canine urinary bladder carcinogen acetylaminobiphenyl is considered more potent than acetylaminofluroene while acetylaminonaphthalene is devoid of detectable carcinogenic activity despite the fact that aminoaphthalene is a wellestablished canine urinary bladder carcinogen removal of the acetyl group may be a requirement for urinary bladder carcinogenesis accordingly the present studies demonstrate the appearance of a direct relationship between dog CL deacetylase enzyme specificity and UB susceptibility to these carcinogenic arylacetamides
1404,ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase ec from thiobacillus a has been purified to homogeneity on the basis of PAGE and uv analysis during sedimentation velocity studies the enzyme had an optimum ph of about with trishcl buffers the molecular weight was about with an srel of km for rubp was mum for total co it was mm and for mg mum the absolute requirement for a divalent cation was satisfied by mg which was replaceable to a certain extent by mn activity was not significantly affected by so so or so at mm at this concentration s caused a stimulation all mercurials tested were inhibitory phmb was the most potent causing about inhibition at mm this inhibition was reversible by low concentrations of cysteine cyanide was also inhibitory its mode of inhibition with respect to rubp was uncompetitive and with a ki of mum lost activity could be restored partially by gsh or cu although azide at the concentration tested had no significant effect on enzyme activity dinitrophenol at mm caused inhibition finally activity was also affected by energy charge
1405,the contractile proteins from arterial smooth muscle are highly soluble and can be extracted at i however they can be precipitated by a prolonged dialysis at ph to give an actomyosin with a high although variable actinmyosin ratio the sedimentation behavior of this actomyosin at high ionic strength was examined as a CF of ph protein concentration and composition by preparative ultracentrifugation comparisons with synthetic skeletal muscle actomyosins of similar composition demonstrated significant differences in the behaviors of these two systems it was found that much smooth muscle AM is not dissociated by normally relaxing conditions and that it sediments at a slower rate than factin the solubility of the supernatant protein a myosinenriched actomyosin in m k cl ph depended on the ph during centrifugation a lower solubility was associated only with a higher actin concentration in the supernatant suggesting a dependence on actin repolymerization pure myosin was selectively precipitated from the supernatant by polyethylene glycol but only when the protein was soluble at low ionic strength the solubility of purified S1 was similar to that of myosin from striated muscles a relationship between the presence of depolymerized actin and the high solubility of smooth muscle contractile proteins is suggested
1406,man and laboratory rodents exposed to chemical carcinogens both show changes in growth characteristics of colonic epithelial cells during neoplastic transformation progressive phases of abnormal cell development appear in colonic epithelial cells which gain an increased ability to proliferate and accumulate in the mucosa these phases in the expression of neoplastic transformation of Tc cells are best defined in the dominant inherited disease of man as adenomatosis of the colon and rectum individuals with inherited adenomatosis and those in lesser risk categories can be classified by cell phenotype based on changes in the proliferation and maturation of colonic and other cells these classifications are leading to new predictive indices which identify heightened degrees of susceptibility of individuals who are at increased risk for CC and the stage of development of their disease the indices also are being used to study the contribution of specific elements in the enviroment that modify or accelerate the progression of disease
1407,SCRs scrs heart rate hr and respiration were recorded in various rest cold pressor cp and cp REC phases in former drug users dg and control ss cg matched on sex and age in a repeated measures design with regard to the abused drugs barbiturates and narcotic analgesics the hypothesis was tested that autonomic responses are decreased T3 longterm use of barbiturates and narcotic analgesics the results partially supported that hypothesis a scrs hr change and hr deceleration were significantly lower in dg compared to control ss b hr baseline QO2 rate and amplitude however tended to be increased in dg in the rest and cp phases a second hypothesis addressed to different habituation rates of scrs and hr in both groups was confirmed for scrs and partly for hr indicating that the habituation rates of scrs hr change and hr deceleration were greater in dg than in cg a third question concerned the consistency of scr and hr results in both sessions a trend for consistent results was found as the direction of the group differences was the same in sessions and the cp results were compared with similar findings in the same ss during visual and auditory stimulation
1408,the authors measured regional cerebral xenon xe blood flow rcbf intraventricular pressure ivp CSF fluid csf ph and lactate systemic arterial blood pressure sap and arterial blood gases during the acute phase in comatose patients with severe head injuries the ivp was kept below mm hg the rcbf was measured repeatedly and the response to induced hypertension and HV was tested most patients had reduced rcbf no correlation was found between average cbf and clinical condition and neither global nor regional ischemia contributed significantly to the reduced brain CF no correlation was found between cbf and ivp or cbf and CBF perfusion pressure cpp the csf lactate was elevated significantly in patients with brainstem lesions but not in patients with pure cortical lesiosn the xe clearance curves from areas of severe cortical lesions had very fast initial components called tissue peaks the tissue peak areas correlated with areas of early veins in the angiograms indicating a state of relative hyperemia referred to as tissuepeak hyperemia tissuepeak hyperemia was found in all patients with cortical laceration or severe contusion but not in patients with brainstem lesions without such cortical lesions the peaks increased in number during clinical deterioration and disappeared during improvement they could be provoked by induced hypertension and disappeared during hyperventilation the changes in the tissuepeak areas appeared to be related to the clinical course of the cortical lesion
1409,a method for the quantitative determination of several nmethylcarbamates in natural waters and the applicability of the derivative to soil samples using a previously published SE procedure are described after extraction of the carbamates from the substrate the carbamates are hydrolyzed in a methanolpotassium hydroxide solution to form the phenolic hydrolysis products which are isolated and derivatized with pentafluorobenzyl pfb bromide to produce the pfb ether derivatives the pfb derivatives are cleaned up and fractionated on a ODS microcolumn and determined by electron capture gasliquid chromatography glc eight organophosphate pesticides and DHP acid esters that hydrolyze to phenols or phthalic acid were evaluated as potential interferences and were found not to interfere with any of the carbamates tested quantitative determinations of mug carbofuran and ketocarbofuran and mug carbaryl metmercapturon and mobam in a l water sample are possible propoxur was not determined at C2 less than mugl due to the short glc PR time of the derivative and interferences from the reagents at the lower levels
1410,the effects of a metabolic and respiratory acidosis and alkalosis on intracellular ph phi and k have been compared in cardiac and skeletal muscle from the anesthetized rb the extracellular space and phi were calculated from the CSD volumes of cr edta and cdmo respectively when phe was varied by altering pco the slope of the L1 relating phi to the extracellular ph phe was greater p less than than that obtained during metabolic changes of phe in right and LVs atria diaphragm and quadriceps during metabolic acidosis and alkalosis the slope of phiphe L1 did not vary between tissues during respiratory acidosis there was no difference in slope between cardiac tissues but it was less in left ventricle than quadriceps p less than in left IVT intracellular k increased in a metabolic p less than or respiratory acidosis p less than whereas in diaphragm it decreased p less than intracellular k correlated with phe and phephi changes in phi but not intracellular k could explain known differences in myocardial CF in respiratory and metabolic acidosis
1411,ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase was G1 by incubation with co and mg and inactivated upon removal of co and mg by gel filtration the activation process involved co rather than hco the activity of the enzyme was dependent upon the preincubation concentrations of co and mg and upon the preincubation ph indicating that activation involved the reversible formation of an equilibrium complex of enzymecomg the initial rate of activation was linearly dependent upon the co concentration but independent of the mg concentration kinetic analyses indicated that the enzyme reacted first with co in a ratedetermining and reversible step followed by a rapid reaction with mg to form an active ternary complex see eq in text the pseudofirst order rate constant kobsd for the activation process at constant ph was derived kobsdkco kkkmg experimentally kobsd was shown to be linearly dependent upon the co concentration and inversely dependent upon the mg concentration the activity of the enzyme after preincubation to equilibrium at constant concentrations of co and mg increased as the preincubation ph was raised indicating that co reacted with an enzyme group whose pk was distinctly alkaline it is proposed that the activation of ribulose biphosphate carboxylane involves the formation of a carbamate
1412,the glycolytic fermentation of molluscs is rather complex multiple end products accumulate lactate alanine octopine succinate propionate acetate and co which are partly formed in the cytoplasm and partly in the mitochondrion various schemes have been presented to account for these end products as well as for the maintenance of the redox balance with respect to the role of alanine there are two opinions alanine accumulation is continuous and is essential for the generation of the mitochondrial nadh required in the reduction of fumarate and succinate and alanine initial end products accumulate in different compartments and their accumulation occurs independently both statements are evaluated in the light of the latest experimental observations including the regulatory properties at the phosphoenolpyruvate branchpoint and the effect of ph and energy charge for nervous tissue the function of oxygen can be replaced by the lipochrome pigment which enables carbohydrates to be totally Ox to co and water the simultaneous mobilization of carbohydrates and amino acids is not supported by the experimental data various advantages of the glycolytic fermentation in molluscs as compared with classical glycolysis in skeletal muscle are discussed
1413,crossclamping of the ascending aorta in dogs for min produced severe neurological deficit observed for up to h immediately after restoration of the circulation the intracranial pressure in the cisterna magna increased transiently to a mean peak of torr sd because of a compensatory increase in systemic arterial pressure without a fall in cerebral perfusion pressure the intracranial pressure returned to control values min after ischaemia and showed no secondary rise during the h of observation the electroencephalogram became isoelectric s mean sd after circulatory occlusion and was abnormal when it reappeared h min sd h min after the circulation was restored the IMP of the BB increased immediately after ischaemia and returned rapidly towards preischaemic values during reperfusion the cerebral water had not increased measurably h T3 ischaemia T3 ischaemia the lactate concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid increased to mequivsem and the ph decreased to sem both returned to control values after h the cerebral glucose uptake was decreased min after ischaemia CMRO2 remained unchanged but cerebral blood flow decreased p less than at min immediately T3 cardiac arrest recovery was impaired more by the presence of focal abnormal brain perfusion than by intracranial hypertension
1414,responsiveness of ovarian ACs to luteinizing hormone lh found to be to fold in CF preparations under optimal conditions required gentle homogenizations and storage in sucrosecontaining media assay conditions required the use of an atpregenerating system consisting of creatine kinase creatine phosphate and myokinase for the preservation of atp C2 lhstimulated adenylyl cyclase ac in rb cl showed the following properties the ph optimum of basal activity was about that of lhstimulated activity was about the relative response to lh was low to fold at mm atp and increased with increasing atp but not with increasing gtp at low mm atp gtp increased catalytic efficacy of the system both in the absence and in the presence of lh no effect on relative stimulation the optimal relative stimulation by lh was obtained at about mm mgcl in excess of added magnesiumbinding ingredients the sensitivity to stimulation by lh about mugml nihlhb was unaffected by either ph nucleotides atp and gtp or mgcl concentration under the CA conditions used activity was stimulated by prostaglandin e pge about to fold and by epinephrine about to fold in all aspects tested lhstimulated ac in rat cl resembled that in rabbit cl except that about fold higher concentrations of nihlhb were needed for halfmaximal stimulation the ac activity in pig graafian follicles however differed from that in rabbit cl in that the atp concentration needed for optimal stimulation by lh was lower in the micromolar rather than the millimolar range catecholamines elicited only a to fold stimulation and nihlhb elicited halfmaximal stimulation at to mugml we were unable to detect lhresponsive ac activity in either homogenates or washed particles of cl from either cycling or pregnant pigs lh fractions of three origins human bovine and ovine and of varying TPS activities from to nihlhs unitsmg were tested and the relative potencies by oaad assay were found to correlate well with the relative potencies in the aca assays rat cl rb cl and pig follicles consistent with the possibility that ac receptors are responsible for biologic actions of lh
1415,in refractory hypertensives a hydrallazine beta blocker combination was added to or substituted for previous antihypertensives over a mean period of months a good or satisfactory blood pressure response resulted in patients each while six others had an unsatisfactory outcome good diastolic pressure dp less than mmhg satisfactory deltadp greater than mmhg or dp mmhg unsatisfactory dp greater than mmhg or deltadp less than mmhg twelve of the patients had significant renal disease with serum creatinine greater than mg ml but in these there was no evidence that renal hydrallazine retention potentiated an antihypertensive effect those with an unsatisfactory response were receiving slightly higher doses hydrallazine and propranol when compared with good responders the average dose of hydrallazine was mgday and of propranolol mgday transient headache was not uncommon at the commencement of hydrallazine therapy angina and VBI were each aggravated in one patient but resolved with dosage adjustment a lupuslike rash developed in one patient a slow acetylator on mg hydrallazineday who had received a total of g over eleven months the genetically determined acetylator phenotype was assessed in subjects a little over one third were found to be rapid acetylators those with slow acetylator phenotype did not show a more favourable phenotype did not show a more favourable bloodpressure response to equivalent doses of hydrallazine
1416,when calcium and phosphate ions were mixed so that their final concentration was mmol and the ph was kept at an amorphous precipitate immediately formed and this changed into crystalline material with an apatitelike structure after a period of time the formation of either or both types of precipitate could be slowed down or prevented by adding to the crystallising medium trace amounts of pyrophosphate or citrate which are known inhibitors of the formation of calcium phosphate or C1 quantities of sodium chloride which increased the ionic strength of the solution and hence the solubility of calcium phosphate both common duct and GB bile from patients with gallstones composed of cholesterol andor calcium carbonate had a very pronounced inhibitory action on the formation of these precipitates only very small amounts of bile were necessary to produce these effects which therefore were not due to an increase in ionic strength ultrafiltration of bile showed that material with a molecular weight greater than was mainly responsible for this activity because the inhibitor was present in both common duct and gallbladder bile the CL is the likely source of origin the possible identity of this material is examined the powerful inhibitory effect of bile on the crystallisation of calcium phosphate is probably a contributory factor to the rare occurrence of the calcium phosphates AP and whitlockite in gallstones
1417,active transport of pyridoxine pyridoxal and PM occurs in resting cells of saccharomyces carlsbergensis and can lead to intracellular concentrations of free vitamin much higher than those supplied externally the initial km for pyridoxine uptake is x m at degrees and ph which are optimum for growth transport is inhibited by many unphosphorylated vitamin analogs the most effective being deoxypyridoxine deoxypridoxal toxopyrimidine deoxypyridoxine and aminodeoxypyridoxine two distinct uptake systems that differ in structural specificity and ionic requirements are present one with optimum ph of transports pyridoxal effectively but not pyridoxamine the other optimum ph transports pyridoxamine effectively but not pyridoxal both systems transport pyridoxine while neither transports pyridoxal phosphate other properties of these systems are similar indicating that they share certain elements in common an initial temperature optimum of degrees is observed for pyrodoxine transport and at this temperature an overshoot in intracellular vitamin C2 with subsequent decrease to a constant level occurs with time it appears that intracellular vitamin or a derivative activates the exit mechanism for the vitamin exit rates also depend on the resuspension buffer and are increased in the presence of glucose and decreased by azide above degrees net uptake of pyridoxine drops initially then rapidly increases to a second optimum at degrees the uptake system is inactivated at about degrees the optimum at degrees apparently results from activation of inflow as exit is rapid and is accelerated by azide no overshoot was detected at degrees so it appears that the exit system is not regulated by intracellular vitamin at this temperature a Tm in membrane lipids occurs at degrees and may be responsible for the NC in properties of the inflow and exit mechanisms above this temperature
1418,to investigate the role of guanosine monophosphate cyclic gmp in cultured cells we have measured guanylate cyclase and cyclic gmp phosphodiesterase MICs and cyclic gmp levels in normal and transformed fibroblastic cells guanylate cyclase activity is found almost exclusively in the particulate fraction of normal rat kidney nrk and balb t cells enzyme activity is stimulated to fold by treatment with the detergent lubrol px however enhancement of guanylate cyclase by fibroblast growth factor could not be demonstrated under a variety of CA conditions in both nrk and balb t cells guanylate cyclase activity is low during logarithmic growth and increases as the cells crowd together and growth slows guanylate cyclase activity is undetectable in homogenates of nrk cells transformed by the kirsten sarcoma virus knrk cells either in the presence or absence of lubrol px guanylate cyclase activity is also greatly decreased in nrk cells transformed by moloney schmidtruppin or harvey viruses balb TA transformed by rna viruses kirsten harvey or moloney by a dna virus sv by methylcholanthrene or spontaneously all have diminished but readily detectable guanylate cyclase activity cyclic gmp phosphodiesterase activity is found predominately in the soluble fraction of nrk cells this activity increases slightly as nrk cells enter the stationary growth phase cyclic gmp phosphodiesterase activity is undetectable in two clones of knrk cells under a variety of assay conditions and is decreased relative to the level present in nrk cells in a third knrk clone however both moloney and schmidtruppintransformed nrk cells have a phosphodiesterase activity similar to that found in nrk cells boiled supernatant from both nrk and knrk cells is observed to appreciably enhance the activity of activatordeficient phosphodiesterase from bovine HR this result indicates that the absence of cyclic gmp phosphodiesterase activity in knrk cells is not due to a loss of the phosphodiesterase activator the intracellular concentration of cyclic gmp is found to be very low in transformed nrk cells when compared to levels measured in confluent nrk cells the low C2 of cyclic gmp in transformed nrk cells reflect the greatly decreased guanylate cyclase activity observed in these cells these results do not appear to support the suggestion that cyclic gmp promotes the growth of fibroblastic cells
1419,peroxisome proliferation has been induced with methylptetrahydronaphthylphenoxypropionic acid su dna protein cytochrome oxidase glucosephosphatase and acid phosphatase concentrations remain almost constant peroxisomal enzyme activities NC to approximately and of the controls for catalase urate oxidase lalphahydroxy acid oxidase and damino acid oxidase respectively for catalase the change results from a decrease in particlebound activity and a fivefold increase in soluble activity the average diameter of peroxisome sections is mum in controls and mum after treatment therefore the measured peroxisomal enzymes are highly diluted in proliferated particles T3 tissue fractionation approximately onehalf of the normal peroxisomes and all proliferated peroxisomes show matric SE with ghost formation but no change in size in homogenates submitted to mechanical stress proliferated peroxisomes do not reveal increased fragility unexpectedly su stabilizes lysosomes our results suggest that matrix SE and increased soluble enzyme activities result from transmembrane passage of peroxisomal proteins the changes in concentration of peroxisomal oxidases and soluble catalase after su allow the calculation of their halflives these are the same as those found for total catalase in normal and treated rats after allyl isopropyl acetamide about days a result compatible with peroxisome degradation by autophagy a sequential increase in liver rna concentration cleucine incorporation into docsoluble proteins and into immunoprecipitable catalase and an increase in CL size and peroxisomal volume per gram liver characterize the trophic effect of the drug used in males su is more active than cpib another peroxisome proliferationinducing drug in females only su is AS
1420,yeast hexokinase a atpdhexose phosphotransferase ec dissociates into its subunits upon reaction with SA the chemically modified subunits could be isolated in a catalytically active form the km values found for atp and for glucose were of the some order as those found for the native enzyme of the amino groups present per enzyme subunit of these groups might be located in the proximity of the region of subunit interactions the loss of the initial activity which follows the succinylation of these more reactive amino CG does not seem to be due to the modification of a residue on the enzyme AS site or to a change of the tertiary structure of the protein this loss of the enzyme activity may be related to the dissociation of the dimer into monomers both native enzyme and the succinylated subunits have the same hdependent denaturation rate profiles in response to m urea moreover the apparent pk of the group involved in the transition from a more stable conformation of the protein in the acid range to a less SD one at alkaline ph seems to be similar to the pk of the group implicated in the transition between the protonated inactive form of the enzyme and an active deprotonated form the succinylated subunit presents negative cooperativity with respect to atp at slightly acid ph however the bursttype slow transient in the reaction progress curve and the activation effect induced by physiological polyanions effects observed for the native enzyme were not detected in the standard exp conditions with the succinylated S1
1421,the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase from freshly isolated mitochondria was shown to be dependent upon the nutritional and metabolic state of the animal prior to sacrifice such that mitochondria from the livers of hr starved diabetic or high fat fed rats had lower enzyme activity than normal chow fed rats the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and the rate of lipogenesis were shown to correlate to a certain extent when a reconstituted cell free system consisting of x g supernatant of rat CL and isolated mitochondria was used this system was employed so that the role of the mitochondrion and Pyr dehydrogenase in lipogenesis could be investigated DCA increased the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and increased the rate of lipogenesis suggesting that the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase is an important factor in determining the rate of lipogenesis in the reconstituted system it was observed however that dichloroacetate was more effective in stimulating the activity of Pyr dehydrogenase than the rate of lipogenesis when mitochondria from starved animals were used to reconstitute lipogenesis furthermore the cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphateadenosine diphosphate ratios and phosphorylation potentials atpadp x pi maintained in the reconstituted system by mitochondria isolated from starved animals were found to be significantly lower than those maintained by mitochondria isolated from chow fed animals it is proposed that the lower energy pressure maintained in the reconstituted system by mitochondria isolated from starved animals severely limits lipogenesis at the atp requiring steps of the process
1422,the localization of the previously postulated interface recognition site irs in porcine pancreatic phospholipase a required for a specific interaction between the enzyme and organized lipidwater interfaces was investigated by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy by measurements of the intrinsic fluorescence of the unique trp residue and by protection experiments against specific tryptic hydrolysis using the enzymically nondegradable ATP analogues cnhnoochchnchhoh it is shown that the rather hydrophobic nterminal CS of the enzyme viz alaleutrpglnphearg is directly involved in the interaction with the lipidwater interface besides hydrophobic probably also polar interactions contribute to the binding process at neutral or acidic ph the presence of a salt bridge between the nterminal alphanh group and a negatively charged side chain stablizes the interface recognition site and allows the enzyme to penetrate micellar surfaces even in the absence of metal ion at ALP ph interaction of the enzyme with micellar interfaces requires the presence of ca ba ions
1423,dihydropteridine reductase isolated from the bacterium pseudomonas species atcc a has been purified approximately fold byammonium sulfate precipitation and diethylaminoethylcellulose chromatographic procedures the preparation is at least pure as judged by PAGE its molecular weight was determined to be about both dihydropteridine reductase and phenylalanine hydroxylase activities were found to be higher in cells adapted to a medium containing lphenylalanine or Tyr as the sole carbon source than in those grown in lasparagine the substrate of the reductase is quinonoid dihydropteridine and the product is tentatively identified as a tetrahydropteridine through its ability to serve as a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase the enzyme shows no marked specificity for the pteridine cofactor that occurs naturally in this organism lthreoneopterin the ph optimum for the reductase is and nicotinamide adenine CpG reduced form is the preferred cosubstrate inhibition of the reduced and untreated enzyme by several sulfhydryl reagents was observed a metal requirement for the reductase could not be demonstrated dihydropteridine reductase was found to be inhibited by aminopterin in a competitive manner with respect to the quinonoid dihydro form of aminohydroxydimethyltetrahydropteridine
1424,alphagalactosidase has been examined in various mu tissues using the ATP methylumbelliferylalphagalactoside mouse CL appears to contain a single major form of the enzyme as judged by chromatography and electrophoresis the enzmye was purified fold with a yield of about by a method involving chromatography on concanavalin asepharose it has Vmax at ph a km value of mm and energy of activation of calmol and a molecular weight of at ph it is inhibited at high concentrations of myoinositol and appears to contain nacetylneuraminic acid in these characteristics it resembles human alphagalactosidase a the enzyme from various tissues differs in electrophoretic mobility after treatment with neuraminidase however the enzyme from all tissues comigrates as a single band of activity by this criterion the alphagalactosidase of liver is most heavily sialylated and that from kidney the least as estimated by gel filtration the enzyme from liver and kidney exists as species of molecular weight and depending upon ph and ionic strength this appears to be the result of aggregation of the enzyme since the forms are interconvertible and under some conditions a single molecular weight species is observed the CL enzyme is primarily lysosomal while the kidney enzyme is distributed approximately equally between lysosomal and microsomal fractions
1425,escherichia coli contains two glutaminases a and b with ph optima below ph and above ph respectively neither glutaminase a nor b is released from e coli by osmotic shock glutaminase b has been purified fold and the purified preparation is estimated to contain about GA b the enzyme has a molecular weight of and an isoelectric point of glutaminase b exhibits a broad ph optimum between and only lglutamine is deamidated by GA b lasparagine and dglutamine are not deamidated the ATP saturation curve for GA b shows an intermediary plateau region like many RII enzymes glutaminase b is coldlabile the enzyme is inactivated by cooling and activated by warming both processes are first order with respect to time the activation energy for activation by warming was calculated to be calmol activation by warming increased the vmax and decreased the s for lglutamine but did not alter the molecular weight of the catalytically active enzyme borate and glutamate protected GA b from inactivation by cold
1426,incorporation of radioactive galactose into tcainsoluble material of galactosemic fibroblasts is more sensitive to low ph than is the incorporation by normal human fibroblasts this study was undertaken to determine whether there was any ph which could correct or counteract the galactosemic defect relative to Gal incorporation and whether the low ph effect was specific for galactose metabolism or whether GA cellular metabolism in galactosemic cells was more CS to low ph than that in normal cells the ph dependencies of incorporation of radioactive Gal and gl into cellular macromolecules were investigated in galactosemic and normal cells normal cells have a biphasic curve with respect to galactose incorporation with peaks at ph and galactosemic cells have only the high ph peak the maximum incorporation by galactosemic cells was never more than about that seen by normal cells under the conditions of these experiments thus manipulation of the ph CT cannot correct the galactosemic defect the rate of incorporation of radioactive galactose was studied in normal galactosemic and galactokinase deficient cells at ph and at ph at ph galactosemic cells incorporate galactose at a linear rate which is to that of normal cells while incorporation by kinasedeficient cells is between and of normal at ph the incorporation is also linear however galactosemic cells now exhibit the same rate as kinasedeficient cells in which the low level of incorporation is unaffected by ph these results suggest that incorporation of Gal by galactosemic cells at low ph is not due to metabolic death of the cells but may be due to the inhibition of some specific step or steps along a metabolic route of Gal metabolism other than the leloir pathway
1427,equations for proton equilibria of a singlephase binary buffer system have been applied to temperatureinduced changes in ph and pco of separated dog plasma at constant carbon dioxide content predicted behaviour measured as deltaphdeltat and deltalog pco deltat and ph and pco as a function of temperature range degrees c are in reasonable PA with theory theory predicts and data confirm that deltaphdelta t and deltalog pcodeltat functions of temperature no single temperature correction factor is applicable comparison of whole blood with binary buffer equations also shows acceptable agreement between theory and experiment blood and separated plasma show similar responses in deltaphdeltat and deltalog pcodelta t when compared over identical temperature intervals for blood or plasma with initial ph at degrees c values in the range deltaphdelta t u degrees c values are degrees c and degrees c comparable deltalog pcodeltat values are degrees c and degrees c the charge state of protein components in this system remains nearly constant as temperature varies
1428,a crosssectional T0 was carried out on boys aged years with unilateral or bilateral testicular maldescent urinary excretion of testosterone deltaandrostenedione lh and fsh was investigated the results were related to chronological age BA and sexual maturation stage urinary testosterone excretion was elevated in unilateral and bilateral cases of undescended testis under years of age the pubertal increase of testosterone excretion seemed to be moderately delayed in the patients in pubertal stage v the testosterone excretion was normal the mean testosteroneandrostenedione relationship was normal in all age groups up to years and increased in patients above this age after hcg stimulation the testosterone excretion increased at all ages studied whereas the androstenedione excretion increased only in bilateral cases under years of age urinary lh excretion was diminished in bilateral cases aged years and elevated in unilateral cases in pubertal stage v urinary fsh excretion was normal below years of age moderately elevated in BL cases aged years and increased in unilateral cases in pubertal stage v patients with BL anorchia in pubertal stage i had normal basal testosterone and androstenedione excretion while the lh and fsh levels were increased the findings in this T0 indicated that disturbances in the pituitarygonadal function of cryptorchids might be operative from early childhood and throughout pubertal years
1429,particulate membrane preparations from neurospora crassa incorporated mannose from gdpc mannose into endogenous lipid and particulate protein acceptors synthesis of the mannosyl lipid is reversible in the presence of gdp chemical and chromatographic characterization of the mannosyl lipid suggest that it is a mannosylphosphorylpolyisoprenol the other endogenous acceptor was precipitated by trichloracetic acid gel filtration and electrophoresis studies before and T3 treatment with proteolytic enzymes indicate that the second acceptor is a glycoproteins beta elimination studies on the mannosyl protein formed from gdpc mannose with mg in the reaction mixture or formed from mannosyl lipid indicate thad with the peptide chain several lines of evidence indicate that in neurospora crassa the mannosyl lipid is an obligatory intermediate in the in vitro mannosylation of the protein a at degrees c the initial formation of the mannosyl lipid is faster than the initial formation of the mannosyl protein b exogenous partially purified mannosyl lipid can function as a mannosyl donor for the synthesis of the mannosyl protein this reaction was also dependent on a divalent metal the rate of this reaction was optimal at a concentration of triton x which effectively inhibited the transfer of mannose from gdpc mannose to lipid and protein indicating that gdpmannose was not an intermediate in the transfer of mannose from lipid to protein the mannosyl protein formed in this reaction was indistinguishable by several criteria from the mannosyl protein formed from gdpc mannose and mg c the effect of a chase with an excess of unlabeled gdpmannose on the incorporation of mannose into endogenous acceptors was immediate cessation of the synthesis and subsequent turnover of the mannosyl lipid in contrast however incorporation of mannose into protein continued and was proportional to the loss of mannose from the mannosyl lipid
1430,the relationship of femoral venous k h osmolality osm po and inorganic phosphate pi with heart rate hr ventilation ve and calculated leg blood flow q were investigated during bicycle exercise in endurance trained tr and untrained ut test subjects at a given vo the increases of k osm pi and the decrease of po were significantly lower in tr than in ut in the same proportion the increases of hr ve and q were diminished thus in tr and ut identical and highly significantly correlated regression lines of k h osm pi and po with hr ve and q were obtained these constituents changed in the same proportion as the relative vo in tr and ut no relationships with na ca and mg were found by means of a multiple regression analysis the partial influence of k h osm po and pi upon the total NC of hr ve and q was estimated to compare with data from infusion experiments the findings were discussed in view of the hypothesis that these candidates may provide linkage between metabolic events circulatory and ventilatory adjustments during work
1431,claviceps purpurea prl grew on partially dissociated succinic acid ph but not on fully dissociated succinic acid ph myeclium suspended in mm solution of partially ionized succinic acid ph nonionized monoanion and dianion k salt over a period of min accumulated more succinic acid carbon than mycelium suspended in highly ionized solution ph nonionized monoanion and dianion the greater accumulation from partially ionized solution was not attributable solely to metabolism of succinic acid nor to the lower external concentration of potassium ion rate of uptake by sodium azide and iodoacetatetreated mycelium was proportional to external concentration at least up to mumolml external potassium or sodium ion was not required for uptake by inhibited or uninhibited mycelium and external sodium ion and glucose did not allow concentration of succinic acid the internal concentrations of succinic acid carbon expressed as succinic acid in cell water were about the same as the external concentrations uptake was not appreciably affected by extent of ionization of external succinic acid but accumulation was markedly affected a plot of accumulated succinic acid carbon against external ph produced a bimodal curve with the two maxima corresponding to the maximal concentrations of nonionized and monoanion succinic acid the bimodal curve probably results from overlapping of two separate curves the nonionized form accumulating efficiently because of one interaction with the cell and the monoanion form accumulating efficiently because of another interaction uptake from concentrated solution is by DWI and efflux is rapid but not CR efflux is not retarded by presence of phosphate in the external solution
1432,although the alphaadrenergic antagonist phentolamine potentiates glucosestimulated insulin secretion of intact animals it either does not alter or it inhibits in vitro insulin secretion this may be because in the higher concentration used in in vitro studies phentolamine exerts a second pharmacological effect that counterbalances its primary effect of blocking monoamine action we recently demonstrated that pancreatic islets contain substantial amounts of MA oxidase mao and that mao inhibitors such as iproniazid and tranylcypromine can alter insulin secretion in the present study we determined if other drugs that affect insulin secretion alter the mao activity of homogenates of rabbit pancreatic islets collagenase technique or liver phentolamine phenoxybenzamine and propranolol mum and mum inhibit islet and hepatic mao haloperidol mum inhibits hepatic but not islet mao while haloperidol mum does not inhibit mao in either tissue ethanol to mm inhibits islet mao hepatic mao is inhibited by high to mm but not by low to mm concentrations of ethanol collagenase digestion does not increase the sensitivity of islet and liver mao to inhibition by phentolamine or ethanol in the absence of added monoamines phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine do not alter basal or glucosestimulated insulin secretion from rabbit pancreas preincubation of rabbit pancreas with the serotonin precursor hydroxytryptophan htp increases the beta cell serotonin content and inhibits glucosestimulated insulin secretion alpha adrenergic antagonists not only fail to block but actually potentiate the serotonin inhibition of insulin secretion we conclude that inhibition of islet mao may cause an increase in islet MA content and these monoamines may alter in vitro insulin secretion one mechanism through which adrenergic antagonists and ethanol modify in vitro insulin secretion may be by inhibiting pancreatic islet mao
1433,a culture filtrate of irpex lacteus polyporus tulipiferae was fractionated initially by salting out with AS and a cellulase ec fraction with high avicelhydrolyzing activity formerly called avicelase was extensively purified by a series of column chromatography procedures this purified endocellulase showed a less random hydrolytic mechanism and was obtained in a yield of with respect to the starting material its specific activity was enhanced approximately times over that of the starting material the cellulase component showed a single peak on both ultracentrifugal and acrylamide disc electrophoretic analyses its molecular weight was estimated to be it contained carbohydrate the L1 sugar constituents were glucose and mannose regarding the CAA composition the contents of aspartic acid and glycine were highest followed by those of glutamic acid serine and theonine the cellulase component was not markedly inhibited by most metal ions tested excepted for hg this purified endocellulase attacked a series of cellooligosaccharides betacellobioside cmcellulose and insoluble cellulosic substrates in the digests from insoluble substrates glucose cellobiose cellotriose and cellotetraose were detectable but the amount of cellobiose was the largest by far in constrast TC and gl were produced in almost equal amounts from betacellobioside
1434,a high molecular weight s plant dna polymerase from axenic vinca rosea TC cells has been purified fold and characterized the enzyme has a molecular weight of sodium dodecyl sulfateacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme yields polypeptide subunits having molecular weights of and the purified enzyme has a ph optimum of a cation requirement optimum of mm mg or mm mn an apparent requirement for zn a km of mum for dttp and a fold stimulation by mm kcl the enzyme is sensitive to nethylmaleimide mm heparin mum ethanol pyrophosphate mum and ophenanthroline mm but is insensitive to rifamycin denatured dna is found to be the best NK template and only negligible activity can be demonstrated with the ribopolymer templates polydtnpolyran and pdtpolyran in addition to the polymerization reaction the enzyme catalyzes a pyrophosphate exchange reaction antibody to calf thymus s dna polymerase does not inhibit dna polymerase from vinca rosea suggesting no antigenic relationships between the mammalian and plant enzymes
1435,the mechanism responsible for the changes in serum and liver gammaglutamyl transpeptidase gammagt activity was studied in a model of experimental hexachlorobenzene porphyria in rabbits porphyria followed the administration of hexachlorobenzene in doses of mumol kg body weight which were given daily through a gastric tube over a day period SS gammagt activity and the MICs of the lysosomal enzymes betanacetylglucosaminidase and alphamannosidase were increased whereas laspartate oxoglutarate aminotransferase and lalanine oxoglutarate aminotransferase and lalanine oxoglutarate aminotransferase remained unaltered there was a considerable increase in liver microsomal protein gammagt cytochrome p anilinehydroxylase aminopyrinedemethylase and deltaaminolevulinic acid synthase in the CL gammagt was detected in the microsomes as well as in the cytoplasm where enzymatic activity was higher the high correlation coefficient between liver gammagt cytochrome p and deltaaminolevulinic acid synthase witnesses a hexachlorobenzeneinduced gammagt formation in the liver a statistically significant correlation between serum and CL gammagt activity was also found these data strongly suggest that the increase in SS gammagt activity may result from the induction of the enzyme in the liver
1436,hydrolysis of collagen was studied in the bull bone tissues by the str griseus crystalline protease the amount of collagen hydrolyzed by it composed and after hour and hour hydrolysis respectively when the ES ratio is hydrolysis proceeds most intensively with a decrease in the ratio up to the average amount of peptides increase from up to amino acidic residua respectively under conditions of denaturated collagen hydrolysis the content of hydroxyproline in solution as compared with the native one increases in this case the links with the presence of iminoacids are easier to split the more resistant being those formed by hydroxyproline within the limit of degrees c hydrolysis of protein intensifies with a temperature rise within the ph range of the maximal amount of alpha nhgroups and hydroxyproline is observed at ph the minimalat ph hydroxyproline in the composition of peptides appears at the beginning of hydrolysis whereas the free one of enzymes of the longer effect h after the beginning of the experiment composes of its total content in the solved products in the insoluble part of the substrate after hour hydrolysis IMT composes less than of its initial amount in protein whereas phenyl alanineover T3 hour hydrolysis the solved part of the system contains about of alanine and and of glycine proline and hydroxyproline respectively
1437,the microflora and ph of gastric contents were determined in breastfed and in bottlefed normal infants in well nourished infants with acute diarrhoea and in infants with chronic diarrhoea and proteincalorie malnutrition the last group of infants was reevaluated after REC from diarrhoea and proteincalorie malnutrition a bactericidal ph effect below was observed bottlefed controls had low ph values and low bacterial concentrations whereas infants with chronic diarrhoea and proteincalorie malnutrition had high ph values and bacterial overgrowth essentially of GN bacilli T3 recovery the only remaining alteration was the frequent isolation of yeastlike fungi in low concentrations infants with acute diarrhoea except for the isolation more frequently of yeastlike fungi presented no alterations this seems to indicate that ph alterations and gramnegative bacilli overgrowth occurred during the evolution of the disease to a chronic state breastfed normal infants had hydrogenion concentrations similar to those of the chronic diarrhoea group but without GN bacilli overgrowth suggesting that other factors besides ph regulate bacterial growth in the gastric contents of these groups of infants
1438,antibioticresistant shigella are increasingly prevalent lactulose a nonabsorbable disaccharide was investigated as an alternative therapy for shigella infection on the hypothesis that the shortchain fatty acids inhibitory to shigella resulting from metabolism of lactulose by normal colonic flora would diminish shigella excretion a LT antibioticrefractory carrier LB excreting to shigella sonneig of feces was given two courses of lactulose of and days duration during lactulose therapy excretion of shigella was greatly diminished day course or suppressed below detectable levels day course but returned to pretreatment levels upon discontinuation of lactulose the volunteers who developed induced shigellosis during an efficacy test of oral shigella flexneri a vaccine were randomly given oral ampicillin lactulose or PL in doubleblind fashion daily rectal cultures were taken T3 days of therapy cultures were still positive in four out of four men on lactulose three of three on placebo and none of three on ampicillin mean stool ph of men receiving lactulose was significantly lower than those getting ampicillin p or PL p only in the lactulose group was mean stool ph during therapy significantly decreased compared with the level off therapy versus p lactulose shows promise for the treatment of shigella carriers but appears ineffective in treatment of acute shigellosis
1439,intracellular ph phi was measured using phsensitive glass microelectrodes the effects on phi of co applied externally and hco h and nh injected iontophoretically were investigated the transport numbers for iontophoretic injection into aqueous microdroples were found by potentiometric titration to be for hco and for h exposure to ringer ph equilibrated with co caused a rapid but only transient fall in phi within or min phi began to return exponentially to normal with a time constant of about min when external co was removed phi rapidly increased and then slowly returned to normal the phi changes with co application or removal gave a calculated intracellular buffer value of about mequiv hph unit per litre injection of hco caused a rise in phi very similar to that seen on removal of external co the phi responses to co application co removal and hco injection were slowed by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide h injection caused a transient fall in phi in co ringer phi fell less and recovered faster than in cofree ringer calculation of the internal buffer value from the phi responses to h and hco i.t. gave very similar values the internal buffer value measured by h injection was greatly increased by exposure to co ringer acetazolamide reduced this effect of co suggesting that the CF of intracellular carbonic anhydrase may be to maximize the internal buffering SP in co it was concluded that the internal hco was determined primarily by the co level and phi that internal hco made a large contribution to the buffering power and that T3 internal acidfication phi was restored to normal by active transport of h oh or hco across the CM the AS transport was much faster in co than in cofree ringer
1440,in experiments designed to elucidate the role of divalent cations in maintaining the integrity of the epidermis P0 mouse skin was incubated in ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid edta or ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid egta in edta epidermolysis occurred and was confirmed by rubbing the specimen to demonstrate that a sheet of epidermis could be split off after min incubation in moledta the split occurred in the lower granularupper spinous layer T3 min it was in a spinoussuprabasilar location and at min and later at the dermalepidermal junction ultrastructurally a clear zone of apparent intracellular oedema occurred along the cell membranes the split then occurred intracytoplasmally through this clear zone and the adjacent cell membrane was lost since incubation in egta at ph did not result in epidermolysis we suggest that the removal of magnesium rather than calcium is responsible for epidermolysis thirty min after the addition of either calcium or magnesium to edtatreated specimens epidermolysis could no longer be demonstrated
1441,the packaging of vertebrate blood hemoglobins within cells places subtle constraints on hemoglobin evolution since the concentration of hemoglobin is near the solubility limit a selective advantage should exist for a noncomplementary external topology of amino acid residues further any change in charge on the protein should alter ion distribution across the cell membrane and so modify ionsensitive oxygen transport an efficient hemoglobin must not only combine readily with oxygen at prevailing environmental oxygen pressures but must also PR it at metabolically AGA pressures these adaptations frequently employ different strategies to achieve the same objective in different animals some hemoglobins have evolved special properties unrelated to the transport of oxygen to metabolizing tissues thus many teleost fish have hemoglobins that discharge much of their oxygen at low ph even at high oxygen pressures this property appears to aid in filling the swim bladder with oxygen the hemoglobins of elasmobranchs have evoked a unique resistance to urea as a consequence of the high urea content of their blood sometimes the PET adaptations of hemoglobins are achieved by multiple hemoglobins in the same cells often however different red cell populations with functionally unique hemoglobins arise sequentially during ontogeny
1442,acidic alphamannosidase ec optimum ph is absent from the plasma of angus calves with mannosidosis and the residual alphamannosidase activity has an optimum ph of intermediate between that of the acidic and neutral alphamannosidases this intermediate alphamannosidase differs from the acidic form in its kinetic properties its lack of marked inhibition by edta and its thermolability at degrees c and physiological ph isoelectric focusing and IEC show that it exists in at least two forms the presence of a secondary peak at ph in the phactivity profile of normal plasma and the effect of heating at degrees c indicate that such a form is present in normal plasma the residual activity in the plasma of a calf with mannosidosis is therefore probably not the product of the defective gene a differential assay based on their different stabilities at degrees c has been developed for measuring the acidic and intermediate alphamannosidases in plasma there was no correlation between the concentrations of the two enzymes in the plasma of angus cows heterozygous for mannosidosis or in the plasma of normal animals this precludes the use of the intermediate form as a REF enzyme for the acidic activity in a test for heterozygosity for mannosidosis based on the genedosage phenomenon the concentrations of the intermediate activity were comparable in normal animals and animals homozygous or heterozygous for mannosidosis
1443,the CM from bacillus megaterium km contained a ddcarboxypeptidase with optimum activity under the following conditions ph ionic strength m temperature degrees c and below degrees c it did not require any divalent cation but was inactivated by cu and hg it was stimulated by mercaptoethanol and low concentrations of PCMB the membrane preparation also catalyzed a simple transpeptidation reaction using as carboxyl acceptors dalanine or glycine the conditions for optimum activity temperatureinactivation temperaturedependence of the activity carboxyl donor specificity sensitivity to betalactam antibiotics and insensitivity to potential peptide inhibitors of both enzyme activities was MZ the ddcarboxypeptidase showed inhibition by dalanine and acllysdala the inhibition by betalactam antibiotic was reversible for both enzymic activities and the timedependence for their REC was MZ the ddcarboxypeptidase was very sensitive to changes in the configuration and size of the sidechains of the CT dipeptide of the ATP amino acid residues at the cterminus that precluded the peptide from being a ddcarboxypeptidase ATP were not acceptors in the transpeptidation reaction dipeptides were not acceptors for the model transpeptidase it is suggested that both activities are catalysed by the same enzyme molecule whose physiological role is not the formation of peptide crosslinks during peptidoglycan biosynthesis
1444,within the last years we have learned to identify mycobacterium leprae determine its viability screen the efficacy of antileprosy drugs and monitor the bacilli for drug sensitivity we have evidence that subclinical infections occur frequently among contacts of patients with leprosy and that the different manifestations of leprosy reflect differences in resistance to m leprae we are developing hypotheses about the mechanism of these differences we have experimentally transmitted LL leprosy to normal armadillos and from these we can obtain amounts of leprosy bacilli which fully substitute for harvests from in vitro cultures furthermore if susceptibility of armadillos can be determined without infecting them and if we can breed them under controlled conditions we would have an animal model for investigating fundamental and applied areas of leprosy which otherwise are intractable how much our knowledge has advanced is illustrated by a project of the world health organization which calls for the preparation of pure specific antigens from the now available abundance of leprosy bacilli which might become valuable as diagnostic and epidemiologic tools and as immunoprophylactic and even immunotherapeutic weapons
1445,alkaline phosphatases from different trematodes occupying the same habitat have identical ph otima but different C2 of enzyme activities isoparorchis hypselobagri from the fish wallago attu shows four to six times more enzyme activity than fasciolopsis buski gastrodiscoides hominis and echinostoma malayanum from the pig sus scrofa and fasciola gigantica gigantocotyle explanatum cotylophoron cotylophorum and gastrothylax crumenifer from the buffalo bubalus bubalis at least two peaks of activity at different levels of ph were obtained for each trematode examined both gastrodiscoides hominis and isoparorchis hypselobagri enzymes had three peaks of alkaline phosphatase activity the optimum temperature for maximum enzyme activity was degrees c above which rapid inactivation occurred at temperatures below degrees c the enzymes of fish and rat trematodes did not behave similarly i hypselobagri enzyme being active over a wider range of temperature degrees degrees c various concentrations of kcn and arsenate proportionately inhibited enzyme activity naf did not significantly influence CEA while mg and co acted as activators the extent of inhibition or activation of enzyme activity of different trematodes varied probably due to species differences both inhibition and activation of i hypselobagri enzyme was higher than in the case of other trematodes
1446,several years ago theorell and czerlinski conducted experiments on the system of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and imidazole using the first version of the temperature jump apparatus with detection of changes in fluorescence these early experiments were repeated with improved instrumentation and confirmed the early experiments in GA terms however the improved detection system allowed to measure a slight concentration dependence of the relaxation time of around ms furthermore the chemical relaxation time was smaller than the one determined earlier by factor the data were evaluated much more rigorously than before allowing an AGA interpretation of the results the observed relaxation time is largely due to rate constants in an interconversion of ternary complexes which are faster than three of the four dissociation rate constants determined previously by theorell and mckinleymckee this fact contributed to earlier difficulties of finding any concentration dependence however the IB of imidazole to the binary enzymecoenzyme complex can be made to couple kinetically into the interconversion rate of the two ternary complexes the observed signal derives largely from the ternary complexes a substantial fluorescence signal change is associated with the observed EC50 process suggesting a relocation of the imidazole in REF to the nicotinamide moiety of the bound coenzyme nine models are considered with two types of coupling of preequilibria noneall quantitative evaluations favor the MM with two ternary complexes connected by an interconversion outside the fourstep bimolecular cycle the ternary complex outside the cycle has much higher fluorescence yield than the one inside the interconversion equilibrium is near unity for imidazole if it would be shifted very much to the side of the deadend complex as in isobutyramide stimulating action could not take place
1447,the ability of deazaisoalloxazines to substitute for the isoalloxazine flavin coenzyme has been examined with several flavoenzymes without exception the deazaflavin is recognized at the AS site and undergoes a redox change in the presence of the specific enzyme substrate thus deazariboflavin is reduced catalytically by nadh in the presence of the beneckea harveyi nadphflavin oxidoreductase the reaction proceeding to an equilibrium with an equilibrium constant near unity this implies an e of v for the deazariboflavindihydrodeazariboflavin couple much lower than that for isoalloxazines with this enzyme both riboflavin and deazariboflavin show the same stereospecificity with respect to the pyridine nucleotide and despite a large difference in vmax for the two both have the same ratedetermining step hydrogen transfer direct transfer of the hydrogen is seen between the nicotinamide and deazariboflavin in both reaction directions deazafmn reconstituted yeast nadph acceptor oxidoreductase old yellow enzyme and deazafad reconstituted damino acido oxidoreductase and aspergillus niger dglucose o oxidoreductase are all reduced by ATP at approximately the rate of holoenzyme none are reoxidized by oxygen or any of the tested artificial electron acceptors though deazafadhbound to damino acido oxidoreductase is rapidly oxidized by the imino acid product direct hydrogen transfer from ATP to deazaflavin has been demonstrated for both deazafadreconstituted oxidases these data implicate deazaflavins as a unique probe of flavin catalysis in that any mechanism for the flavin catalysis must account for the deazaflavin reactivity as well
1448,a procedure for the quantitative measurement of the omethylnucleoside constitutents of rna has recently been developed in this laboratory gray mw can j biochem this CA method is based on the resistance of omethylnucleoside phosphates pnm generated by phosphodiesterase hydrolysis of rna to subsequent dephosphorylation by venom nucleotidase ec in the present investigation two basemodified nucleotides each displaying an unusual resistance to nucleotidase have been identified these EDC have been characterized by a variety of techniques as n ndimethylguanosine phosphate pmg and aminocarboxypropyluridine phosphate pabuu because of their resistance to nucleotidase pmg and pabuu are isolated along with the pnm in the mononucleotide fraction of venom hydrolysates of transfer rna under hydrolysis conditions the stability of pabuu is comparable to that of a pnm allowing quantitative assay of the nucleotide the proportion mean sd of pabuu in venom hydrolysates of wheat embryo and escherichia coli trna has been determined to be n and n mol respectively the absence of pabuu in venom hydrolysates of yeast trna implies the absence of the corresponding nucleoside in yeast trna in PA with existing data the variable recovery of pmg from venom hydrolysates of wheat embryo and yeast trna indicates that under hydrolysis conditions this basemodified nucleotide is only partially resistent to nucleotidase the CR absence of pmg in venom hydrolysates of e coli trna is consistent with the known absence of n ndimethylguanosine in this rna these observations demonstrate that resistance to nucleotidase is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for concluding that a nucleotide is omethylated when applied to wheat embryo ribosomal rna the analytical methods described in this report failed to reveal any compound having the distinctive charge properties of pabuu it therefore appears that methylaminocarboxypropylpseudouridine recently characterized as a constituent of the s rrna of chinese hamster cells saponara ag enger md biochim biophys acta may not be present in wheat embryo ribosomal rna
1449,the rate of coronary flow reaching the oxygenlinited heart appears to be crucial in determining the myocardial tissue metabolic response the tissue metabolic response to anoxia well studied in hearts perfused with anoxic media differs in many important ways from the response to ischemia in regional ischemia developing infarction there is still a residual oxygen uptake which is reduced approximately to the same extent as the delivery of o there is also decreased delivery of substrates and decreased removal of co h and lactate with increased concentrations of these metabolites contents of hexose monophosphates rise rather than fall in anoxia measurements of glycolytic intermediates show an initial burst of accelerated glycolytic flux lasting less than minute T3 CAL thereafter rates of flux decrease to control values or even less at minutes relative inhibition of phosphofructokinase pfk activity may be explained by a slow rate of fall of atp and a developing intracellular acidosis in this MM glucose accounts for a greater part of the residual oxidative metabolism than does free fatty acid ffa
1450,continuous hydrogen ion titration curves of deionized solutions of horse heart ferricytochrome c have been obtained at degrees c at a constant ionic strength of from ph to titration of the oxidized protein in kcl required equiv over that ph range and a small hysteresis between the forward and reverse limbs was displayed the linderstromlang approximation which takes into account electrostatic interactions between charged groups on the protein surface was used in a computer simulation program to analyze the forward and reverse limbs of the titration curve separately the results indicated alpha beta and gamma and heme propionic carboxylic imidazole phenolic and epsilonamino residues appear to titrate normally variations in the electrostatic interaction factor omega suggest conformational changes in the protein at the extremes of ph although the relationship of the variations in omega to the magnitude of the conformational changes does not appear to be strictly quantitative for cytochrome c these results show the acidbase SMB of cytochrome c to be complex in nature and suggest that the lindenstromlang MM may not be adequate for cytochrome c
1451,we previously reported that alpha but not betaadrenergic agonists stimulate renin PR from mouse submaxillary glands in vivo the present studies were undertaken to determine if these in vivo effects were due to a direct action on the submaxillary glands and to find out if cyclic amp camp might be involved in submaxillary renin PR pooled mouse submaxillary gland slices were incubated in krebsringer bicarbonate medium following a preincubation period and renin release was measured by a radioimmunoassay for the direct measurement of submaxillary gland renin tissue camp levels were also measured addition of the alphaadrenergic agonists phenylephrine or norepinephrine significantly increased renin PR p less than vs control while decreasing tissue camp C2 p less than vs control in contrast addition of the betaadrenergic agonist isoproterenol markedly increased camp levels p less than vs control and decreased renin PR p less than vs control pretreatment of the slices with the alphablocker phenoxy genzamine inhibited the effect of phenylephrine these results indicate that alphaadrenergic agonists cause renin release from submaxillary glands which is accompanied by a fall in tissue camp levels this is in contrast to renin release from the kidney which is stimulated by betaadrenergic agonists
1452,xray absorption spectra near the kalpha edge have been measured in various iron group compounds using the intense SR at the stanford synchrotron research project in the cubic EDC kmf where m mn fe co ni and zn well resolved lines were observed and assigned to the s leads to d s leads to s and s leads to p EMT the observed energies agreed rather well with the spectroscopic energy levels of the z ion and the intensities are shown to agree with those expected on the basis of one electron EMT of the form z sdnls leads to z sdnnlls the energies of the intense s leads to p transition increase by about v going from kfef to knafef but only by about v from kfecn to kfecn the transitions confirm that upon oxidation of the hexacyanides the iron electronic structure barely changes in the iron sulfur protein Rd where the iron is bound to a tetrahedron of sulfurs the s leads to d transition was about seven times more intense than the same transition in an octahedrally coordinated compound these intensities parallel those observed in the dd transitions of optical spectra because in both types of spectra the intensities depend upon p admixture in the heme protein cytochrome c upon oxidation the s leads to p transition shifts only about v to higher energies similar to the iron hexacyanides these results are discussed in terms of covalent bonding
1453,photosystem ii reaction center components have been studied in small system ii particles prepared with digitonin upon illumination the reduction of the primary acceptor was indicated by absorbance changes due to the reduction of a PQ to the semiquinone anion and by a small blue shifts of absorption bands near nm c and nm the SQ to chlorophyll ratio was between and in various S9 the terminal electron donor in this reaction did not cause large absorbance changes but its GSSG was revealed by a hitherto unknown electron spin resonance esr signal which had some properties of the wellknown signal ii but a linewidth and gvalue much nearer to those of signal i upon darkening absorbance and esr changes decayed together in a cyclic or back reaction which was stimulated by dichlorophenyldimethylurea the donor could be oxidized by ferricyanide in the dark illumination in the presence of ferricyanide induced absorbance and esr changes rapidly reversed upon darkening which may be ascribed to the oxidation of a chlorophyll a dimer possibly the primary electron donor of photosystem ii in addition an esr signal with to gauss linewidth and a slower dark decay was observed which may have been caused by a secondary donor
1454,b pertussis suspension was tested by de voe et al method and its modification with the solutions of a definite ionic composition and a lysozyme the best results were obtained by the following modification elaborated by the authors the microbes were grown on the caseincarbon agar for hours and were washed with chilled m nacl the suspension was washed times with the same solution and then the precipitate was suspended in saccharose solution m in hours the saccharose was replaced by a solution of salts with lysozyme T3 a hour incubation at degrees c the substance was centrifugated for T2 and the precipitate suspended in the trisbuffer at ph the following changes were observed after the washing and incubation with saccharose there was seen a strong stretching and separation of the cell wall cw from the cytoplasmic membrane cpm cells without the cw were rarely revealed after the lysozyme treatment there were many cells of spherical shape phasiccontrast microscopy without any cw limited by the cpm only morphologically they were no different from the true protoplasts of the grampositive bacteria the chemical analysis also confirmed a possibility of obtaining the true protoplasts of the gramnegative bacteria
1455,the effect of various inhibitors on the substratedependent quenching of the fluorescence of aminoacridine was measured in IO membrane vesicles of escherichia coli the rate of fluorescence quenching in the presence of inhibitors was dependent on the rate of electron transfer through the respiratory chain with nadh succinate dlactate or dlglycerol phosphate as substrates several patterns of response were given by the inhibitors inhibitors competitive with substrate or those acting only on the dehydrogenases gave a direct relationship between the extent of inhibition of oxidase activity and the rate of quenching a biphasic relationship was given by heptylhydroxyquinoline noxide and piericidin a which was due to these compounds acting both as inhibitors of the RC and at higher concentrations as uncoupling agents uncouplers inhibited fluorescence quenching with minimal inhibition of oxidase activity the transmembrane ph difference was calculated from the extent of fluorescence quenching and the intravesicular volume the maximum ph difference of units was generated by each of the substrates tested
1456,experiences of years with sugarless chewing gums and lozenges tab i and ii regarding their tooth protective properties are reported telemetry of interproximal PI ph allows to assess acid formation from carbohydrates by PI bacteria under almost natural conditions altogether chewing gums and lozenges containing sorbitol or mixtures of sorbitol and hydrogenated OS were investigated lowest ph values during and after chewing sugarless gums varied between ph and when sucking sugarless lozenges the recorded ph values were between and in contrast to lozenges the consumption of sugarless chewing gums becomes particularly important due to their greater stimulation of saliva and buffering capacity of oral fluid all products tested did not acidify interproximal plaque below the critical ph and therefore comply with the regulations of the swiss federal health authorities with respect to the labeling or marketed sweets with safe for teeth new nonfermentable sugarreplacing substrates are being developed their utilization in foodstuffs and sweets is being discussed
1457,the collagens are the major structural glycoproteins of connective tissues a unique primary structure and a multiplicity of posttranslational modification reactions are required for normal fibrillogenesis the posttranslational modifications include hydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues glycosylation folding of the molecule into triplehelical conformation proteolytic conversion of F0 procollagen to collagen and oxidative deamination of certain lysyl and hydroxylysyl residues any defect in the normal mechanisms responsible for the synthesis and secretion of collagen molecules or the deposition of these molecules into extracellular fibers could result in abnormal fibrillogenesis such defects could result in a connective tissue disease recently defects in the regulation of the types of collagen synthesized and in the enzymes involved in the posttranslational modifications have been found in heritable diseases of connective tissue thus far the primary heritable disorders of collagen metabolism in man include LH deficiency in ehlersdanlos syndrome type vi pcollagen peptidase deficency in ehlersdanlos syndrome type vii decreased synthesis of type iii collagen in ehlersdanlos syndrome type iv lysyl oxidase deficency in slinked cutis laxa and ehlersdanlos syndrome type v and decreased synthesis of type i collagen in osteogenesis imperfecta
1458,daily FF of mg of alphachlorohydrin per kg body weight to boars prevented fertility CR when the ejaculate was used for insemination the semen charactreated than in UT boars but the sperm morphology was otherwise normal in vitro addition of mgepididymal contents from the treated boars revealed normal na k and glycerylphosphorylcholine concentrations the movement of sperm cytoplasmic droplets was completed on all spermatozoa more distally in treated than in untreated boars but the sperm morphology was otherwise normal in vitro addition of mg ml of alphachlorohydrin to ejaculate boar semen completely inhibited and mg ml decreased fertility removal of the ACH prior to insemination partially restored fertility calphachlorohydrin was shown to be more firmly bound to boar spermatozoa than ccarboxyinulin and could not be removed from the spermatozoa with washings the contraceptive mechanism of the drug is suggested to be alkylation of the sperm membrane by free alphachlorohydrin in the epididymis
1459,the total kinetic thermal stability of a protein molecule expressed as the total free energy of activation in thermal denaturation reactions can be separated into an intrinsic contribution of the polypeptide chain and a contribution due to the binding of calcium ions the theory for this procedure is applied to thermal denaturation data obtained at the ph of optimum stability for the serine proteases thermomycolase and subtilisin types carlsberg and bpn and for the zinc metalloendopeptidases thermolysin and neutral protease a the results obtained from arrhenius plots at high and low free calcium ion concentrations reveal a considerable R2 in the calcium ion contribution to the total kinetic thermal stability of the various enzymes in the serine protease group at degrees c the stability is largest for thermomycolase mainly due to a relatively high intrinsic contribution for the metalloendopeptidases the total kinetic thermal stability is largest for thermolysin the difference between thermolysin and neutral protease a being dominated by bound calcium ion contributions the intrinsic kinetic thermal stability of the polypeptide chain of TLN is considerably smaller than that of any of the serine proteases and is probably of the same order of magnitude as that of neutral protease a thus the well known total kinetic thermal stability of thermolysin is due mainly to a single calcium ion voordouw g and roche r s biochemistry that binds with high affinity even at very high temperatures k congruent to x m at degrees c
1460,MA storage sites in paraganglionic pg cells of the rat SCG were investigated by electron and fluorescence microscopy following treatment with pchlorophenylalanine pcpa disulfiram or guanethidine respectively dense core LDV in pgcells are significantly decreased p less than in number following pcpa and in the majority of these cells following disulfiram and guanethidine however in a minor portion of pgcells the latter agents cause an increase in number and in size of dense core LDV in parallel with structural alterations in agreement with these electron microscopic findings fluorescence microscopic and cytophotometric evaluations reveal a general decrease in catecholamine content with few cells showing an increase the findings provide a morphological basis for the assumption that monoamine storage CS in pgcells can be decreased by inhibition of monoamine synthesis following administration of pcpa disulfiram and guanethidine however the two types of responses of pgcells which occur T3 disulfiram and guanethidine demonstrate a functional heterogeneity of this cell system in the rat SCG which is discussed
1461,the lowfield portions of the mhz h nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of native and chemically modified basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor have been studied as a CF of ph over the range ph in derivatives selectively reduced and carboxamidomethylated at cystine resonances associated with of the protons of the aromatic rings of the four tyrosines of the inhibitor have been located and assigned to specific tyrosyl residues titrations of ph yielded pks for tyrosines and in the modified inhibitor of and respectively resonances associated with the three nitrotyrosine protons of the mononitrated derivative and the six nitrotyrosine and protons of the dinitrated derivative have been similarly located assigned and titrated yielding pks for nitrotyrosines and of and respectively previously reported results for derivatives with cystine IN have been revised on the basis of new data comparison of these revised results with the new data for derivatives with modified cystine reveals no changes in pks for any tyrosine or nitrotyrosing ring and no changes in chemical shift for resonances of nitrotyrosine or tyrosines and however modification of cystine causes significant changes in chemical shifts of resonances of the nearby nitrotyrosine and IMT and rings tyrosine remains relatively immobile rotating less than timess at degrees c for phs in the range
1462,enzymic studies performed with chemically modified yeast hexokinase atp dhexosephosphotransferase confirm previous results indicating that the sulfhydryl imidazol and most of the reactive amino groups do not seem to be directly implicated in the enzyme active site on the other hand the modification of these functional CG of the enzyme does not affect the transition between the acidic inactive form to an active enzyme form after deprotonation the chemically modified forms of hexokinase and the native enzyme are affected in the same way by activators citrate dmalate phosphoglycerate and pi when the activity was measured at ph moreover the loss of enzyme activity observed in the course of the chemical modifications is accompanied by an increase of the activation effect this increase must be related to some reorganization of the enzyme active site in presence of the effectors since the same effect was observed when hexokinase was denatured with m urea at ph however no increase in the activation effect was observed when the denaturation was carried out at ph at this ph the loss in activity and the NC of optical absorption at nm were much slower than at ph which indicates a great difference in the protein structure between these phs
1463,the hydrolytic and transfer reactions catalysed by rat kidneygammaglutamyltransferase ec were studied in vitro with substrates ucglutamic acidlabelled glutathione and methionine initialvelocity patterns isotopeexchange and binding studies were consistent with a branched nonsequential mechanism in which a gammaglutamylenzyme intermediate may react either with water hydrolysis or with methionine gammaglutamyl transfer the michaelis constant for glutathione in hydrolysis was mum for glutathione in transfer it was mum and for Met as ATP it was mm at substrate concentrations in the ranges of their respective michaelis constants the rate of transfer was about ten times higher than that of hydrolysis but at concentrations of methionine approximating to the physiological mum in rat plasma the transfer is negligible the enzyme is reported to lie on the luminal surface of the PT straight kidney tubule in this situation if the kinetic results obtained with the detergentsolubilized enzyme are relevant to the behavior of the enzyme in vivo it appears likely that the main function of renal gammaglutamyltransferase is not in CAA transport but rather to hydrolyse glutathione in the renal filtrate
1464,addition of succinate to valinomycintreated mitochondria incubated in kcl causes a large electrolyte penetration the process depends on a steady supply of SE and involves a continuous net extrusion of protons rates of respiration and of electrolyte penetration proceed in a parallel manner a passive penetration of k salt of permeant anions occurs in respiratoryinhibited mitochondria T3 addition of valinomycin addition of succinate at the end of the passive swelling starts an active extrusion of anions and cations with restoration of the initial volume the shrinkage is accompanied by a slow reuptake of protons the initiation of the AS shrinkage correlates with the degree of stretching of the inner membrane the extrusion of electrolytes is inhibited by nigericin while it is only slightly CS to variations of the valinomycin concentration larger than two orders of magnitude passive swelling and active shrinkage occurs also when k is replaced by a large variety of organic cations the rate of organic cation penetration is enhanced by tetraphenylboron while the rate of electrolyte extrusion is insensitive to variation of the tetraphenylboron concentration active shrinkage either with k or organic cation salts is inhibited by weak acids the phosphate inhibition is removed by sh inhibitors the AS shrinkage is also inhibited by mersalyl to an extent of about three models of AS shrinkage are discussed a mechanoprotein b electrogenic proton pump and c protondriven cation anion pump
1465,reinvestigating the accuracy of the commonly used values for molar absorptivities epsilon of betanadh and betanadph at hg hg or nm we obtained the following results the maximum of absorbance of nadh is shifted from about nm at degrees c to about nm at degrees c the corresponding maxima of nadph are located at about nm longer wavelengths in addition the absorption curves of both coenzymes broaden with increasing temperature for these reasons the epsilonvalues of nadh and nadph are generally different from each other and are temperaturedependent only at nm are they almost identical and nearly independent of temperature therefore this wavelength is recommended for precise measurements the epsilonvalues of these coenzymes are influenced by ionic strength and ph to determine the absolute values of the molar absorptivities we performed the glutamate dehydrogenase or lactate dehydrogenase CA with carefully purified oxoglutaric acid or pyruvic acid in the presence of excess coenzyme the purity of the substrates was checked through differential scanning calorimetry moisture analysis gasliquid chromatography gas chromatography in combination with mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the epsilonvalues observed under the various conditions are about higher than those currently used
1466,betaadrenergic stimulation of the ventral prostate cyclicamp system was investigated by examining the influence of isoproterenol on endogenous cyclicamp levels as well as on the activities of adenylate cyclase cec and cyclicampdependent and independent protein kinases ec administration of isoproterenol mgkg ip resulted in rapid elevation of adenylate cyclase activity and cyclicamp C2 the observed isoproterenolstimulated changes in cyclicamp metabolism of the VP were timedependent and maximal stimulation was seen min after treatment with this betaadrenergic agonist the increases in prostatic adenylate cyclase and cyclicamp also were related to the dose of isoproterenol administered and maximal enhancement of these parameters was seen with mgkg dose of the agonist whereas i.c.v. of rats with propranolol mgkg ip partially reversed these alterations administration of an alphaadrenergic antagonist phentolamine even at a dose of mgkg failed to elicit any appreciable effect stimulation of prostatic soluble protein kinase by isoproterenol was associated with a decrease in the activity of the cyclicampdependent protein kinase with a concomitant increase in that of the independent enzyme whereas the ability of the enzyme to bind cyclich amp in vitro was decreased following isoproterenol treatment the protein kinase activity ratio cyclicampcyclic amp was significantly elevated from to although propranolol alone had little or no effect on these parameters it inhibited partially the isoproterenolinduced alterations in cyclicampdependent protein kinase and the cyclicamp binding capacity treatment with propranolol also blocked the increases in the kinase activity ratio and in the activity of cyclicampindependent enzyme seen with isoproterenol data suggest that the concentration of VP cyclicamp as well as the MICs of adenylate cyclase and cyclicampdependent and independent form of protein kinases are subject to modulation by betaadrenergic stimulation
1467,effects of catecholamines and their inhibitors on the electrical activity of the smooth muscle of the guineapig stomach were studied by using pressure electrodes the spontaneous electrical activity of antrum and corpus preparations consisted of SWs with or without superimposed spikes in quiescent fundus preparations the spike activity and slow waves were generated by tea catecholamines noradrenaline isoprenaline and adrenaline suppressed or blocked the spike discharges and the generation of slow waves however the spike activity was enhanced at a higher concentration of phenylephrine in the antrumand fundus preparations inhibitory responses of the smooth muscles from whole regions to adrenaline noradrenaline or isoprenaline were antagonized by propranolol or dci but not by phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine therefore inhibitory actions of these amines appear to involve betaadrenoceptors T3 treatment with tetrodotoxin noradrenaline and isoprenaline blocked the spike activity and the generation of SWs phenylephrine or adrenaline potentiated the spike activity in the presence of tetrodotoxin after treatment with dci or propranolol phenylephrine potentiated the spike activity of the antrum and fundus preparations these excitatory effects were antagonized by phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine it is concluded that excitatory actions of these amines are mediated by alphaadrenoceptors rather than via a nervous pathway
1468,SA is a disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by the generalized formation of granulomas and is accompanied by elevation in the serum in less than half the patients of angiotensin converting enzyme a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin i to the pressor octapeptide angiotensin ii and lhistidyllleucine mean activity of angiotensin converting enzyme was elevated generally more than fold in granulomacontaining CL nodes but not in lung in which normally it is abundant in of patients with sarcoidosis angiotensin converting enzyme in lymph NO from subjects with SA was similar to the enzyme from normal lung and CL node with respect to activity as a CF of ph inhibition of activity by edta and ophenanthroline gel filtration on sephadex g and requirement for chloride for activity but appeared to be more heat labile the data suggest that the granulomas in sarcoidosis may be the source of the elevated serum enzyme and that cells of the granulomas particularly the epitheloid cells which appear by electron microscopy to have active protein biosynthesis may be actively synthesizing the enzyme
1469,gastric reflux of bile has been reported to be essential for the production of acute gastric mucosal lesions by intragastric aspirin in the rat the purpose of the present study was to determine whether bile duct legation of pylorus ligation in the rat inhibits asprininduced gastric lesions and if so what the protective mechanisms are operations were performed under ether anesthesia asprin mg per kg was instilled into the stomach hr postsurgery bile duct ligation or pylorus ligation four hours later the rats were killed the stomachs were examined and mucosal lesions were scored bile duct ligation but not pylorus ligation significantly protected against aspirininduced gastriclesions BDL in pylorusligated rats inhibited gastric acid output by instilling hcl aspirin in bile ductligated rats restored lesion formation shunting bile to the colon to prevent bile reflux did not prevent aspirin lesions salicylate determination to ascertain whether BDL altered asprin absorption revealed no significant differences between bile duct ligation and aspirin shunt aspirin and sham shunt aspirin in plasma and gastric tissue salicylate concentrations
1470,changes of the holding potential applied to the membrane of myelinated nerve fibres induced slow variations of the peak sodium current which are superimposed on the effect of sodium inactivation these slow variations are EMT between various steady C2 of available sodium conductance their time course can be described by the CF erfc square root ttau where tau is the time and erfc the error function complement the characteristic time tau lies in the range min and depends on the membrane potential changes of extracellular ph cause a rapid change of the peak sodium current followed by a slow variation as observed T3 changes of the holding potential this slow variation can be prevented by applying simultaneously an appropriate NC of the holding potential eg the effect of changing ph from to is balanced by changing the potential from to mv the results are interpreted by postulating charged components DWI slowly within the nodal membrane their transverse distribution controls the number of sodium channels available at a given membrane potential the equivalence between NC of ph and voltage is explained by assuming negative fixed charges at the outer surface of the membrane which are protonated at low ph and thus affect the intrinsic membrane potential it is concluded that effects which are ascribed to the action of agents on individual sodium channels have to be QTc for variations in the number of available channels if these agents influence the intrinsic membrane potential eg changes of extracellular ph
1471,a sensitive technique for the direct calorimetric determination of the energetics of photochemical reactions under low levels of illumination and its application to the T0 of primary processes in visula excitation are described enthlpies are reported for various steps in the bleaching of rhodopsin in intact rod outer segment membranes together with the heats of AGA model reactions protonation changes are also determined calorimetrically by use of buffers with differing heats of proton ionization bleaching of rhodopsin is accompanied by significant uptake of heat energy vastly in excess of the energy required for simple isomerization of the retinal chromophore metarhodopsin i formation involves the uptake of about kcalmol and no net change in proton ionization of the system formation of metarhodopsin ii requires an additional energy of about kcalmol and involves the uptake on one hydrogen ion from solution the energetics of the overall photolysis reaction rhodopsin leads to opsin alltransretinal are ph dependent and involve the SE of an additional titrating group on opsin this group has a heat of proton ionization of about kcalmal characteristic of a primary amine but a pka in the region of neutrality we suggest that this group is the SB lysine of the chromophore binding site of rhodopsin which becomes exposed on photolysis the low pka for this AS lysine would result in a more SD retinalopsin linkage and might be induced by a nearby positively charged group on the protein either arginine or a second lysine residue this leads to a MM involving intramolecular protonation of the schiff base nitrogen in the retinalopsin linkage of rhodopsin which is consistent with the thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of the system we further propose that the metarhodopsin i leads to metarhodopsin ii step in the bleaching CS involves reversible hydrolysis of the schiff base linkage in the chromophore binding site and that subsequent steps are the result of migration of the chromophore from this site
1472,anthopleurina apa a polypeptide with mw ca amino acids isolated from the sea anemone anthopleura xanthogrammica brandt elicited a potent PIE but without an accompanying chronotropic effect on the isolated cardiac muscles of rat rabbit guinea pig and cat similarly in dogs and cats in situ ip injections of apa increased the contractile force without effect on HR rate or blood pressure the cardiotonic potency for apa was equivalent to that of isoproterenol but much greater than that for ouabain or glucagon on the isolated cardiac muscle apa increased the contractile force cardiac output and decreased atrial pressure in dog heart during pentobarbitalinduced failure this inotropic effect was not inhibited by propranolol i.c.v. the ca requirement to restore the contractile force was less in apatreated than in ouabain or isoproterenoltreated tissues T3 apa treatment the dP/dt was more resistant to hypoxia and to low or high temperature AS than ouabaintreated or control preparations apa at m increased the duration of the action potential its mean rate of rise and conduction in the M2 and ventricles at the maximum effective concentration apa did not inhibit na kactivated adenosine triphosphatase phosphodiesterase high km and low km and cyclic adenosine monophosphate content of guineapig heart apa x to x m neither contracted nor relaxed the isolated vascular smooth muscle the results suggest that apa may be useful in the clinical management of cardiac failure and as an experimental tool to study the pharmacology and physiology of cardiac muscle
1473,nsilas nonsuppressible insulinlike activity soluble in acid ethanol is a serum peptide that has insulinlike and growthpromoting activities we have demonstrated previously that liver plasma CM possess separate receptors for nsilas and insulin and have characterized the insulin receptor in detail in the present study we have characterized the properties and specificity of the nsilas receptor and compared them to those of the insulin receptor in the same tissue both insilas and iinsulin bind rapidly and reversibly to their receptors in CL membranes maximal nsilas IB occurs at degrees while maximal insulin IB is seen at degrees the ph optimum for nsilas binding is broad to in contrast to the very sharp ph optimum to for insulin binding both receptors exhibit a high degree of specificity with the insulin receptor nsilas and insulin analogues compete for binding in proportion to their insulinlike potency insulin greater than PI greater than nsilas with the nsilas receptor nsilas is most potent and the order is reversed nsilas greater than proinsulin greater than insulin furthermore six preparations of nsilas which varied fold in biological activity competed for insilas binding in order of their potencies nsilas which had been inactivated biologically by reduction and aminoethylation and growth hormone were less than as potent as the most purified nsilas preparation purified S9 of fibroblast growth factor epidermal growth factor nerve growth factor and somatomedins b and c were less than as effective as nsilas in competing for the insilas suggesting that these AF act through other receptors in contrast somatomedin a was as AS as nsilas and multiplicationstimulating activity was fully as AS as nsilas in competing for the nsilas receptor analysis of the data suggests that there are approximately times more insulin receptors than nsilas receptors per liver cell while the apparent affinity of nsilas receptors is somewhat higher than that of the insulin receptor
1474,this T0 was designed to determine the effect of acute HV on distal nephron hydrogen ion secretion the blood pco declined and stabilized rapidly when bicarbonate loaded rats were hyperventilated in contrast the urine pco declined slowly resulting in an early increase in the urine minus blood ub pco which could not be obliterated by carbonic anhydrase infusion within approximately min the ub pco in the hyperventilated and carbonic anhydrase infused rats approached zero consequently equilibrium between collecting duct urine and arterial blood pco was then presumed to exist this provided the basis for the subsequent studies on a series of rats the ub pco decreased from a control of mm hg meansem to mm hg meansem with hypocapnia and rose again to its control value when the blood pco returned to prehyperventilation values this decline in ub pco with acute hyperventilation could not be attributed to changes in urine flow phosphate or bicarbonate excretion suggesting therefore a decrease in distal nephron probably collecting duct hydrogen ion secretion with acute HV possible pitfalls in the interpretation of the ub pco are illustrated
1475,the role of the different cytochromes p in the metabolism of the anaesthetic agent fluroxene and the mechanism of production of toxic effects seen after pretreatment of the animals with pehnobarbital prior to anaesthesia have been investigated male rats were anaesthetized with fluroxene or with trifluroethyl ethyl ether or with ethyl vinyl ether in an attempt to ascertain the in vivo toxic effects of the three anaesthetic agents the resultant hepatic histology is reported a T0 of the binding and metabolism of fluroxene by isolated rat hepatic microsomes was also made we conclude that it is elevated levels of cytochrome p which potentiate the toxicity of fluroxene anaesthesia in phenobarbital treated animals and that cytochrome p does not bind or metabolize fluroxene the potential toxicity of the fluroxene molecule is considered to reside in the trifluoroethyl moiety while the vinyl group of fluroxene appears to play a role in the observed liver damage
1476,the specificity of ca for the interaction of beta adrenergic agonists with their receptors in rb RA atrial muscle was evaluated this was accomplished by substituting ca by an equimolar concentration of sr doseresponse curves which demonstrate the effect of norepinephrine and isoproterenol on the rate of electrical activity in the presence of ca or sr were made in addition the antagonistic action of propranolol x m in a cacontaining or srcontaining medium was determined the results clearly demonstrate that sr can effectively substitute for ca in maintaining electrical and mechanical activity in cardiac muscle also norepinephrine and isoproterenol can increase the rate of electrical activity in a ca or srcontaining medium this effect of these beta agonists is mediated through the betareceptors since propranolol effectively blocked their action it appears that ca per se is not required for beta agonist or antagonistreceptor interaction in cardiac muscle the results are discussed in relation to the dependency on extracellular ca for beta agonists to cause a change in the rate of EA after receptor occupancy
1477,laromatic aminoacid decarboxylase has been purified more than thousand times from homogenates of rat BB in several steps centrifugation deaecellulose cm cellulose hydroxylapatite deae sephadex its properties have been studied most of them on an intermediate fraction of the purification because of the instability of the purified enzyme in spite of the addition of different stabilizing agents the enzyme decarboxylates hydroxytryptophan htp and dopa in a ratio constant throughout the purification but does not decarboxylate tryptophan IMT histidine at a measurable rate optimum ph km vm have been measured with htp and dopa as substrates the enzyme has a molecular weight of an apparent isoelectric point of it is inhibited by serotonin dopamine some cations cu fe ni by nethylmaleimide SDS some pyridoxal phosphate plp remains strongly bound to the enzyme for relatively weak concentrations of substrate the enzyme is inhibited by an excess of plp for weak concentrations of plp the enzyme in inhibited by an excess of substrate particularly of dopa we also observe a spontaneous decarboxylation of the substrates that reaches a plateau and is enhanced by high concentrations of plp by serotonin dopamine cu and reduced by mercaptoethanol and the presence of crude or boiled homogenates several possible explanations of the spontaneous decarboxylation and of the enzymic inhibitions by an excess of plp and by the substrates are given
1478,to establish optimum conditions for creatine kinase ec activity measurement with the creatine phosphate in equilibrium creatine reaction we reexamined all kinetics factors relevant to an optimal and standardized enzyme assay at and degrees c we determined the ph optimum in vaious buffers considering the effect of the type and concentration of the buffer as well as the influence of various buffer anions on the activity the relation between activity and ATP concentration was shown and the apparent michaelis constants of creatine kinase for creatine phosphate and adp were evaluated we tested the effect on creatine kinase measurement of the concentration of substrates glucose and nadp in the auxillary and indicator reactions especially the influence of the added auxiliary hexokinase and indicator glucosephosphate dehydrogenase enzymes on the lag phase at different temperatures the nadp concentration proved to be the factor limiting the duration of constant reaction rate we studied the inhibition of creatine kinase and adenylate kinase by amp and established a convenient amp concentration for reactivation of creatine kinase NAC as sulfhydryl compound was introduced finally we examined the relationship between activity and temperature
1479,the superoxide anion radical o reacts with ferricytochrome c to form ferrocytochrome c no intermediate complexes are observable no reaction could be detected between o and ferrocytochrome c at degrees c the rate constant for the reaction at ph to is m s and as the ph increases above the rate constant steadily decreases the dependence on ph is the same for tuna HR and horse heart cytochrome c no reaction could be demonstrated between o and the form of cytochrome c which exists above ph approximately the dependence of the rate constant on ph can be explained if cytochrome c has pks of and and o reacts with the form present below ph with k m s the form above ph with k m s and the form present above ph with k the reaction has an activation SE of kj mol and an enthalpy of activation at degrees c of kj mol both above and below ph it is suggested that o may reduce cytochrome c through a track composed of aromatic amino acids and that little protein rearrangement is required for the formation of the activated complex no reduction of ferricytochrome c by ho radicals could be demonstrated at ph but at ph ho radicals oxidize ferrocytochrome c with a rate constant of about m s
1480,this study was undertaken to compare the ability of l and disomers of amino acids bathing the oxyntic gland area to stimulate acid secretion in conscious dogs with heidenhain pouch hp gastric fistula gf and pancreatic fistula pf acid outputs from hp were determined by an intragastric titration method when amino acid solutions were perfused into hp at various concentrations ph values and distention pressures only lisomers of all natural amino acids were found to stimulate acid secretion whereas disomers of amino acids tested were completely inert in this respect the comparison of the secretagogue activity of amino acids shows that lhistidine among essential amino acids and glycine among nonessential amino acids exhibited the strongest stimulation of acid outputs reaching respectively and of the maximal response to histamine decreasing the ph of lhistidine solution perfused into hp in sequential order from to resulted in a stepwise reduction of acid SO falling at ph to about of the peak response achieved at ph local irrigation of hp by xylocaine and intravenous infusion of atropine mug per kg per hr or metiamide mg per kg per hr reduced but did not abolish hp response to chemical stimulation and the ph dependency of this response we conclude that only l and not disomers of amino acids bathing the oxyntic gland area stimulate acid secretion by a local gastrinindependent mechanism sensitive to distention pressure and ph
1481,the effect of hemicholinium hc on responses of the rat isolated bladder and ileum to acetylcholine and carbachol was investigated in the absence and presence of a number of anticholinesterases responses of the bladder to acetylcholine were potentiated by dfp edrophonium bwc and physostigmine but were unaffected by the specific butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor isoompa responses to carbachol were not potentiated by the anticholinesterases hc x m inhibited responses to carbachol without affecting those to acetylcholine in the presence of physostigmine or dfp responses to acetylcholine were inhibited by hc but no such inhibition was observed in the presence of bwc edrophonium or isoompa or a combination of the latter two anticholinesterases responses to carbachol were also inhibited to a greater extent in the presence of dfp in the ileum responses to acetylcholine were increased in the presence of dfp edrophonium and physostigmine but were unaffected by isoompa responses to carbachol were not increased by any of the anticholinesterases hc x m inhibited responses to both acetylcholine and carbachol in the ileum and the degree of inhibition was not significantly altered by the presence of any of the anticholinesterases used although a weak anticholinesterase hc was also found to decrease the GABA action of physostigmine on the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by homogenates of rat ileum a similar effect was noted with dfp but not with edrophonium the results obtained do not support a prejunctional action for hc in antagonizing responses to carbachol it is concluded that in addition to an inhibitory action on the postjunctional muscarinic receptor hc may interfere with the anticholinesterase activity of some cholinesterase inhibitors such as physostigmine and dfp but not edrophonium
1482,from testing a new benzodiazepine derivative chlorophenyltetrahydrohbenzodiazepinone bu as measured against a placebo in a doubleblind trial the following conclusions can be drawn the test was carried out over two periods of a fortnight each with a changeover between the two periods the changeover method has proven suitable to reveal side effects of the substance which last for at least two weeks owing to the substances sequelae however statistical analysis of the second treatment periods information is not possible with this experimental design the statistical methods used proved more effective than the usual methods as they allow clearer statements to be made on the efficacy of the substance within the first period of days both the group receiving the placebo and the drug treated group showed a decrease in the intensity of anxiety the sequelae of bu can be described as an increase in restiveness and anxiety in those patients who received the PL in the second treatment period
1483,subtilisin bpn was immobilized to porous glass via isothiocyanate coupling the ph optimum of the enzyme was shifted to the alkaline side on IB this effect was more pronounced with ethyl lactate than with ntosyl Arg methyl ester tame presumably the shift is a reflection of the negative charge on the surface of the glass the michaelis constant and vmax of soluble subtilisin bpn with tame were two and one orders of magnitude respectively lower than with ethyl lactate vmax calculated per g of AS enzyme with tame as the substrate was not affected by immobilization while vmax with ethyl lactate decreased greater than tenfold the apparent km decreased on immobilization with ethyl lactate as substrate and increased with tame results are explained in terms of diffusional resistance and a possible attraction of ethyl lactate to the glass surface active site titration indicated that about of the immobilized enzyme was AS
1484,an activator of the ca plus mgstimulated atpase present in the human erythrocytes membrane has been isolated in soluble form from hemolysates of these cells partial purification has been achieved through use of carboxymethylsephadex chromatography the resulting activator fraction contained no hemoglobin and only of the total adenylate kinase activity of the cell whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in miosm buffer at ph or at ph only the CM prepared at ph were affected by it whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in miosm buffer at ph or at ph only the membranes prepared at ph were affected by it when ca plus mgatpase activity was measured by pi release from gammapatp freezethawed erythrocytes as well as membranes prepared at ph and at ph expressed lower values than noted by CA for total pi PR when adp instead of atp was used as ATP significant amount of pi were released by these erythrocyte S9 further study revealed a production of atp and amp from adp with CM and hemolysate alone and b exchange of the gammaand bposition phosphate on gamapatp in the presence of membranes plus hemolysates these observations established the presence of adenylate kinase activity in the membranefree hemolysates and in membranes it further supports the conclusion that pi release from adp by human erythrocytes freezethawed and by their isolated membranes is due to formation of atp by adenylate kinase and hydrolysis of this generated atp by ca plus mgatpase the following points were also established a absence of an adpase in human erythrocytes b the ca plus mgatpase activator enhanced cleavage only of the gamaposition of atp and c the ca plus mgatpase activator is neither adenylate kinase nor hemoglobin
1485,a basal diet or a basal diet plus of cholesterol and CA acid was fed to rats for varying lengths of time and the MICs of liver phosphoenolpyruvatecarboxykinase pepck tyrosine transaminase tt and SDH sd the rate of total hepatic protein synthesis and the concentration of hepatic reduced glutathione gsh were quantitated the specific activity of pepck was significantly depressed by cholesterol plus cholic acid feeding while the specific activity of tt was unchanged no significant effect of dietary cholesterol plus cholic acid was found on the total liver activities in contrast sd specific activity was increased fold the rate of uclleucine incorporation into total tca precipitable protein following ingestion of cholesterol plus acid was significantly reduced when the data were expressed as dpm uclleucinemg protein after correcting this expression for SRA of the liver tissue free leucine pool no significant effect of dietary cholesterol plus cholic acid on hepatic protein synthesis existed in fact the amount of cleucine incorporated into protein on a total liver basis was greater for the cholesterol group on a per gram of CL basis the concentration of gsh in the liver of rats fed a cholesterol plus cholic acid diet was significantly decreased considering the liver enlargement in rats fed cholesterol plus CA acid total organ gsh was found to be significantly greater than for rats fed a BD
1486,when a pair of stimuli separated by an appropriate interval is given to the right visceropleural connective of aplysia californica the amplitude of the second epsp elicited in cell r is usually smaller than the amplitude of the first epsp in the present paper we show that this phenomenon synaptic depression can be analyzed in terms of the material flow model of neurotransmitter economics developed in our preceding publications we specifically show how changes in the model parameters a the available pool of transmitter f the fraction of the available pool released by a presynaptic action potential m the rate of transmitter mobilization into the available pool and d the rate constant of demobilization of transmitter from the available pool all effect synaptic depression in addition we show how transient changes in f and m that are observed immediately and for seconds T3 a stimulus influence the time course of synaptic depression using this analysis we then tested our previous inferences about changes in the model parameters produced either by pharmacological manipulations or repetitive stimulation by comparing the observed effects of these manipulations on synaptic depression with the theoretical predictions the theoretical and experimental findings agreed thereby strengthening both our previous conclusions of the mode of action of these manipulations and the model itself
1487,a combined mitochondrial and CS mitochondrial fraction and a microsomal fraction were isolated from bovine thyroid gland and fractionated further in a bxiv zonal rotor a density gradient ranging from to ww sucrose was used the rotor was operated for h at revmin all manipulations were performed at degrees c and at ph membranous material was recovered in two zones zone i containing microsomal material derived from both SER and plasma membranes and probably also from other smooth membranes zone ii containing material from rough endoplasmic reticulum increasing the ph of the medium up to or the addition of mg to the medium resulted in the formation of a single zone at intermediate densities aggregation of CM an analogous effect was obtained after treatment with pb no in the presence of heparin iuml the bulk of the membranes was found in zone i this was due to the release of ribosomes from the RER
1488,MAO-A activity in platelets prepared from the blood of patients with irondeficiency anaemia was significantly lowered when compared with that in platelets from normal subjects the km values of the platelet enzyme for the substrates dopamine hydroxytryptamine phenylethylamine and kynuramine were similar for the platelet enzyme from irondeficient and normal groups heatinactivation studies showed that the platelet MA oxidase from irondeficient subjects was more labile to this treatment when compared with the platelet enzyme from normal subjects the sensitivity of PLT monoamine oxidase to the inhibitors clorgyline and deprenil was increased in irondeficiency anaemia binding studies with the cbinding irreversible MA oxidase inhibitor deprenil showed that the amount of enzyme capable of binding this inhibitor was lowered by in platelets from irondeficient patients when compared with platelets from normal subjects the results show that there is a lowered amount of AS enzyme in platelets from irondeficient subjects it is suggested that iron is necessary either for the synthesis of MAO-A apoenzyme or is a cofactor for an enzyme which attaches flavinadenine dinucleotide covalently to the MAO-A apoenzyme
1489,the mechanism of biosynthetic transferase atpase and transphosphorylation reactions catalyzed by unadenylylated glutamine synthetase from e coli was studied activation complexes involved in the biosynthetic reaction are produced in the presence of either mg or mn however with the mnenzyme inhibition by the product adp is so great that the overall forward biosynthetic reaction cannot be detected with the known assay methods binding studies show that substrates except for nh and nhoh which are not reported here can bind to the enzyme in a random manner and that binding of the atpglutamate adppi or adparsenate pairs is strongly synergistic inhibition and binding studies show that the same binding site is utilized for glutamate and glutamine in biosynthetic and transferase reactions respectively and that a common nucleotide IB site is used for all reactions studied studies of the reverse biosynthetic reaction and results of FL titration experiments suggest that both arsenate and orthophosphate bind at a site which overlaps the gammaphosphate site of nucleoside triphosphate in the reverse biosynthetic and GOT reactions atp serves as a substrate for the mnenzyme but not for the mgenzyme the atp supported GOT activity of mnenzyme is probably facilitated by the generation of adp through atp hydrolysis when amp was the only nucleotide substrate added it was converted to atp with concomitant formation of two equivalents of glutamate under the reverse biosynthetic reaction conditions and no adp was detected the reversibility of transfer between orthophosphate and gammaacyl group of glutamate was confirmed atpase activity of mg and mn unadenylylated enzymes is about the same both enzymes forms catalyze transphosphorylation reactions between various purine nucleoside triphosphates and nucleoside diphosphates under biosynthetic reaction conditions the data are consistent with the hypothesis that a single active center is utilized for all reactions studied two stepwise mecanisms that could explain the results are discussed
1490,an anticoagulant protein has been isolated by deae cellulose chromatography and GF from the venom of the vipera berus orientale eastern europe purification has been completed by elution on CM cellulose with continuous gradient at constant ph the inhibitor of coagulation was separated from the other venom enzymes eg procoagulant fibrinogenolytic aminoesterase and amino acid oxidase MICs it was also separated from other phospholipase components which were not related to the anticoagulant property the inhibitor appeared as a simgle polypeptidic chain protein formed by amino acid residues with a molecular weight of and an isoelectric point of at low saline molarity a monomertrimer transition of this protein was observed both forms had the same CAA composition there were six disulfide bridges without free sh CG per phospholipase molecule deprived of any proteolytic activity the clotting inhibitor displayed a high phospholipase activity in the presence of calcium activity did no appear with edta buffer deprived of cation finely dispersed micellar suspensions were found suitable for obtaining the highest phospholipase activity high sodium cholate concentration or methanolchloroformether solvent were effective without loss of enzymatic activity as characteristis of phospholipase a ec the degradation products identified on TLC chromatography induced hemolysis of human erythrocytes the apparent km value m was determined on phosphatidylcholine isolated from ovolecithin this purified berus inhibitor would be of value for investigating the involvement of phospholipids in the clotting mechanism
1491,as part of an investigation into death by poisoning in switzerland we were able to examine the register of deaths at the swiss federal bureau of statistics all the medical reports which named analgesic nephropathy as being the basic illness and the main cause of death have been taken into consideration in this work deaths occurred in the five year period and were studied as closely as the documents allowed the earliest cases of death arose in the thirties the maximum number however occurring between the age of and between the onset of kidney damage and the actual death elapses a period of about years the ratio from woman to man is almost the occurrence is particularly frequent among childless housewives the victims are people of widely different occupations and social classes the AN resulting from addiction and leading to death is most frequently encountered among the population of the cities and the german swiss cantons as well as among people of protestant faith the shocking number of deaths in five years in there were a further cases bears witness to the need for adequate preventive measures
1492,the potencies of fifteen betaadrenoceptor agonists of widely differing chemical structures were compared with that of isoprenaline on bronchial muscle soleus muscle blood pressure and heart rate in the anaesthetized cat the betaadrenoceptor antagonist potencies of propranolol and practolol were determined against isoprenaline in the same MM isoprenaline was the most potent agonist and its action was essentially unselective thus on all four parameters the minimal ERP dose was mugkg and maximal or near maximal responses were produced by mugkg trimetoquinol was also an essentially unselective agonist for thirteen of the remaining fourteen agonists potency was similar on bronchial muscle soleus muscle and blood pressure but significantly lower on heart rate the remaining agonist ah hydroxyalphamethyldiphenylpropylaminomethylmxylenealpha alphadiol acetate was also significantly less potent on heart rate than on the other parameters in addition it was clearly less potent on soleus muscle and blood pressure than on bronchial muscle when hydroxytryptamine ht was used to induce bronchospasm however when acetylcholine was used instead of ht the potency of ah on induce bronchospasm however when acetylcholine was used instead of ht the potency of ah on bronchial muscle soleus muscle and blood pressure was very similar ah may therefore possess a TPS ht antagonist action in addition to its betaadrenoceptor agonist action the fifteen test agonists were longer acting than isoprenaline and this was particularly true of trimetoquinol and soterenol the betaadrenoceptor antagonist potency of propranolol was almost MZ on bronchial muscle soleus muscle and blood pressure and very slightly lower on the heart practolol was times more potent on the HR than on bronchial muscle soleus muscle and blood pressure these findings suggest that it may not be possible to separate the bronchodilating and tremorenhancing properties of betaadrenoceptor agonists the results with agonists and antagonists are in accord with lands dual betaadrenoceptor subclassification
1493,effects of some bittertasting compounds on frog taste receptors were examined by recording glossopharyngeal nerve responses the order of effectiveness of the compounds was quinine greater than brucine greater than formanilide greater than caffeine greater than urea when the effects of quinine brucine and caffeine on electrical responses in taste cells were examined they all produced a depolarization associated with an increased input resistance the action of the three EDC on taste receptors therefore operates with a similar mechanism the electrical responses in cells produced by quinine progressed slowly with time such effects with quinine are similar to those with procaine after adaptation to quinine the nerve responses to various chemical stimuli were gradually reduced in magnitude while the electrical responses in taste cells during stimulation by chemicals became smaller the mechanism of the effects of bitter stimuli are discussed in light of recent findings on the interaction of bitter stimuli with lipid monolayers and the extraction of lipid from bovine taste papillae by bitter stimuli
1494,two acid PRs one hydrolysing hemoglobin and the other hydrolysing benzoyl arginine naphthyamide bana were separated and partially purified from human skin buffer extract the acid protease hydrolysing hemoglobin was purified about fold by sephadex g gel filtration and deaecellulose chromatography it hydrolysed hemoglobin at ph casein at ph and skin protein ATP at ph it did not markedly hydrolyse synthetic protease substrates the molecular size of this protease was the protease was insensitive to common protease modifiers and closely resembles cat d purified from other organs the banahydrolysing acid protease was purified about fold by sephadex g gel filtration and affinity chromatography on organomercurial sepharose b gel it preferentially hydrolysed baee bana and baa with an optimum at ph the hydrolysis of bapa leuna and protein substrates was very low this acid protease was found to be highly dependent on reducing agents as dtt and chelating agents as edta and was inhibited by pcmb and tlck the molecular size of the enzyme was this protease closely resembles cat b purified from other organs human skin was also shown to contain a low activity of benzoyl arginine amide baa hydrolysing acid protease with a molecular size of about and resembling cathepsin b human skin contained an inhibitor with a molecular size of about against human skin cathepsin b this inhibitor did not inhibit trypsin chymotrypsin or skin PRs other than cathepsin b
1495,the effects of acute and chronic ethanol NI on the startle response was examined in male rats ethanol given ip produced a dosedependent decrease in the amplitude of the startle response measured min later with a dose of gkg the effect was evident at min and had recovered substantially by min the effect of ethanol on the startle response was potentiated by pretreatment of the animals with pimozide haloperidol and pchlorophenylalanine but not by propranolol phenoxybenzamine alphamethyltyrosine or pargyline after weeks on an ethanolcontaining diet the startle response was greater than that shown by rats on the control isocaloric sucrosecontaining diet T3 ethanol withdrawal the startle response was further increased with a peak about to hr after discontinuation of ethanol thereafter the response declined this time course of heightened startle response during ethanol withdrawal corresponds to the time course of the activation of noradrenergic neurons during withdrawal it appears that dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons are involved in the mediation of the startle response in rats
1496,isolated rb hearts were perfused with rabbit red cells suspended in ringer solution a small volume of perfusate was recirculated for min at pco of or mmhg hypercapnia resulted in an increase in perfusate hco concentration that was smaller than that observed when isolated perfusate was equilibrated in vitro with the same co tensions delta hcoe mm p less than this difference is consistent with a net movement of hco into or h out of the mycardial cell and cannot be accounted for by dilution of hco in the myocardial interstitium recirculation of perfusate through the coronary circulation at normal pco for two consecutive min periods was not followed by changes in perfusate hco concentration a high degree of rho r was observed between intracellular hcoe concentration and the corresponding delta hcoe in individual experiments the results suggest that transmembrane exchange of h or hco is a buffer mechanism for co in the myocardial cell
1497,by studying the dissociation of iinstulin from its receptors in the absence and phe negatively cooperative type for the insulin receptors in the present T0 we extend oy purified mouse and rat CL CM as well as in human circulating monocytes and human cultured lymphocytes demonstrated negative cooperativity that was extraordinarily simn membranes more slowly than it does from its receptors on whole cells the dissociaty a small percentage of the receptor CS to are sufficient to accelerate dissociation of hormone from receptor at these insulin concentrations insulin is entirely monomeric and in fact at higher concentrations of insulin greater than m where insulin dimers predominate the cooperativity effect is progressively lost the dissociation rate of iinsulin alone that is at very low fractional saturation of receptors was markedly accelerated by dripping the ph from to whereas the dissociation of iinsulin at high receptor occupancy was only slightly accelerated by the fall in ph the dissociation rate was directly related to temperature but the dissociation rate of iinsulin at low receptor occupancy was much more affected by reduction in temperature and showed a sharp transition at degrees urea at concentrations as low as m produced a marked acceleration of iinsulin dissociation divalent cations calcium and magnesium appear to stabilize the insulinreceptor interaction since higher degrees of receptor occupancy were required to achieve a given rate of dissociation of iinsulin these data make it likely that the insulin receptors exist as oligomeric structures or clusters in the plasma membrane insulin receptor sites appear to switch from a slow dissociating state to a fast dissociating state when their occupancy increases the proportion of CS in each state is a CF of occupancy of the receptor sites by the insulin monomer as well as of the physiochemical environment other models which could explain apparent negative cooperativity besides sitesite interactions ie polymerization of the hormone steric or electrostatic hindrance due to ligandligand interactions or unstirred noyeswhitney layers are considered unlikely in the case of insulin receptors on both experimental and theoretical grounds
1498,seventyfour patients aged months to years classified as asa i and ii were anesthetised with ethrane for surgical interventions of mean duration T2 with the exception of patients who were directly anesthetised with ethrane the others received ethrane T3 induction with penthiobarbitone maintenance of anesthesia was ensured with to p concentrations of ethrane and p oxygen and p nitrous oxide tracheal intubation was facilitated by injection of mgkg of succinylcholine induction with enflurane is rapid with no phenomena of excitation or irritation of the ear passages the cardiovascular apparatus is stable with no arrythmia but an increase in heart rate of to p is noted and in p of the cases SH of p of the intitial value during spontaneous ventilation a type of rapid and superficial QO2 is observed with a flow volume of mlkg for an average frequency of min the arterial blood gases show slight hypercapnia myorelaxation is significant and better than that obtained with halothane coming round poses few problems apart from agitation in adolescents response to simple orders appears at minutes trembling and rigidity occur in p of the cases for to minutes from the hepatic point of view no lastin enzyme changes were noted and no renal toxicity was demonstrated ethrane appears to be a good anesthetic agent but the few advantages mentioned means that it does not fulfil ideal conditions
1499,starved cells of candida utilis accumulated zn by two different processes the first was a rapid energy and temperatureindependent system that probably represented binding to the cell surface the cells also possessed an energy ph and temperaturedependent system that was capable of accumulating much greater quantities of the cation than the IB process the energydependent system was inhibited by kcn nahaso mchlorophenyl carbonylcyanide hydrazone nethylmaleimide edta and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid the system was TPS inasmuch as ca cr mn co or cu did not compete with inhibit or enhance the process zn uptake was inhibited by cd the system exhibited saturation kinetics with a halfsaturation value of mum and a maximum rate of nmol zn min mg dry wt at degrees c zn uptake required intact membranes since only the binding process was observed in the presence of NYS toluene or sodium dodecyl sulphate cells did not exchange recently accumulated toluene or sodium dodecyl sulphate cells did not exchange recently accumulated zn following the addition of a large excess of nonradioactive zn similarly cells preloaded with zn did not lose the cation during starvation and efflux did not occur when gl and exogenous zn were supplied after the starvation period efflux was only observed T3 the addition of toluene or nystatin or when cells were heated to degrees c cells fed a large quantity of zn contained a protein fraction resembling animal cell metallothionein in batch culture cells of c utilis accumulated zn only during the lag phase and the latter half of the exponentialgrowth phase
1500,the hepatic uptake and biliary excretion of htaurocholate and houabain was studied in the rat during saline control and dehydrocholate infusions dehydrocholate mumolhr did not influence the plasma disappearance nor the biliary excretion of taurocholate after a single iv i.t. mumolkg bile production in the dehydrocholate experiment was increased to fold compared with controls the biliary transport maximum for exogenously po taurocholate was determined by constant infusion to be mumolhr mumolming of liver concomitant infusions of mumol of dehydrocholate per hr did not alter the maximal taurocholate output the effects of the two bile salts on bile flow were additive dehydrocholate mumolhr reduced the biliary excretion of houabain mumolkg and elevated the secondary slow component of the plasma disappearance of the cardiac glycoside the hepatic levels of ouabain were increased compared with controls it is concluded that dehydrocholate interferes with ouabain transport at the canalicular level but not with primary hepatic uptake taurocholate mumolhr failed to influence the total biliary SO of ouabain these differences and the lack of interaction between dehydrocholate and taurocholate suggest a hepatic transporting pathway for taurocholate which differs from that for taurocholate which differs from that for dehydrocholate andor its metabolites
1501,the lightevoked release of hglycine from retina in cat in vivo after preretinal perfusion and in rb in vitro after intravitreal i.t. was studied the site of uptake of hglycine into retina was checked by autoradiography and was found to be almost exclusively in a type of amacrine cells if the retina loaded with hglycine was stimulated by light flashes the release increased significantly in both in vivo and in vitro experiments when the flashing CS was exchanged for continuous light there was not NC in the spontaneous efflux of radioactivity chromatographic experiments showed that the main part of the radioactivity released by light was glycine the lightevoked PR of glycine from retina was dependent on temperature and ca low temperature to degrees c abolished the increased release if ca was ommitted from the perfusion medium and edta was added there was no lightinducable change in the efflux of radioactivity in retinas loaded with hvaline the present results that CS stimulation will PR glycine from the retina both in vivo and in vitro are further criterion for it as neurotransmitter
1502,recent work has indicated that superoxide is involved in the manganesestimulated oxidation of nadph by crude granule S9 of guinea pig neutrophils the characteristics of a model manganeserequiring nadphoxidizing system that employs a defined ogenerator have now been compared to the original neutrophilgranule system with respect to ph dependence cyanide sensitivity and reduced pyridine nucleotide specificity the properties of the two systems are very similar additional information has been obtained concerning cation specificity and the kinetics of the metalcatalyzed nadph oxidation from the similarities between the properties of the model and neutrophil particle systems we postulate that the manganesedependent nadph oxidation observed in the presence of neutrophil granules represents in large part of nonenzymatic free radical chain involving the oxidation of nadph to nadp with o as both the chain initiator and one of the propagating species in this reaction the neutrophil particles serve only as a source of o further the same changes in kinetics decrease in apparent km for nadph observed previously when granules from phagocytizing rather than resting cells were employed could be mimicked by varying the rate of ogeneration by the model system we conclude from these results that it is unnecessary to invoke a manganeserequiring enzyme as a component of the phagocytically stimulated respiratory system of the neutrophil
1503,the resting PD varies from to mv according to type of gland cell and species the rp depends mainly on the large transmembrane concentration gradient for k maintained by a pump mechanism extruding na and accumulating k since the na permeability pna is much smaller than pk the na concentration gradient is less important in addition to the dominant electrodiffusional control of rp the na pump itself contributes since the AS transport of na out exceeds that of the active k uptake gland cells are generally electrically coupledie the junctional Rm is much lower than the surface Rm the coupling may be widespread eg liver or confined to one acinus eg SSG and pancreas the specific surface cell membrane resistance may be about omega cm a number of neurotransmitters and hormones control cellular transport processes by their action on surface cell membrane receptors agonistreceptor interaction causes prominent changes in membrane potential and resistance in many cases of a complex nature most gland cell CM so far investigated in detail appear to be electrically inexcitable ie stimulation does not cause the appearance of action potentials eg salivary glands exocrine pancreas and CL but prominent exceptions to this are the endocrine pancreas betacells and the adrenal cortex the main importance of agonistinduced membrane permeability changes is to alter the intracellular ion activities an increase in na seems to be important whenever stimulation results in fluid transport and an increase in ca triggers exocytosis
1504,properties of glutaminedependent glutamate synthase have been investigated using homogeneous enzyme from escherichia coli k in contrast to results with enzyme from e coli strain b miller r e and stadtman e r j biol chem this enzyme catalyzes nhdependent glu synthase activity selective inactivation of glutaminedependent activity was obtained by treatment with the glutamine analog laminooxochloropentanoic acid chloroketone inactivation by chloroketone exhibited saturation kinetics glutamine reduced the rate of inactivation and exhibited competitive kinetics iodoacetamide other alphahalocarbonyl compounds and sulfhydryl reagents gave similar selective inactivation of glutaminedependent activity saturation kinetics were not obtained for inactivation by iodoacetamide but protection by glutamine exhibited competitive kinetics the stoichiometry for alkylation by chloroketone and iodoacetamide was approximately residue per protomer of molecular weight approximately the single residue alkylated with iodo cacetamide was identified as cysteine by isolation of scarboxymethylcysteine this active site cysteine is in the large subunit of molecular weight approximately the active site cysteine was CS to oxidation by ho generated by autooxidation of reduced flavin and resulted in selective inactivation of glutaminedependent enzyme activity similar to other glutamine amidotransferases glu synthase exhibits glutaminase activity glutaminase activity is dependent upon the functional integrity of the active site cysteine but is not wholly dependent upon the flavin and nonheme iron collectively these results demonstrate that glu synthase is similar to other glutamine amidotransferases with respect to distinct CS for glutamine and nh utilization and in the obligatory function of an active site cysteine residue for glutamine utilization
1505,the agedependent peculiarities of the acidbase balance at rest and with standard loads were studied in rats it was found that with age the ph value of blood decreases the tension of the carbonic acid increases but the values of bb be sb and ab do not undergo any significant changes with loads old animals showed more profound changes in the system and these changes were of decompensated character the maximal changes in young animals were registered hours after loading in old rats hours T3 the normalization of the shifts in old rats occurred much more slowly than in young animals and it does not reached the initial value by hours after loading the analysis of the data obtained shows that with aging the reserve potentialities of the organisms mechanisms of the acidbase balance regulation greatly decrease which under certain conditions results in disturbance of the given system compensation thus exerting a negative effect on the body vital processes
1506,a brush border preparation from rat intestine was incubated with rat intrinsic factorvitamin b complex in m trishcl buffer ph the cob uptake to brush borders was proportional to the amount of protein or to alkaline phosphatase activity in the preparations the uptake increased with time of incubation at degreesc the uptake after incubation for min was of that for one hr the uptake at degreesc was approximately of that at degreesc ther was no difference as a result of adding glucose to the incubation medium the uptake was observed in the alkaline environment above ph maximum uptake occurred at ph brush borders washed with KRB ph exhibited no difference in b uptake whether in the presence or absence of calcium ion but brush borders washed with ethylenediaminetetraacetate exhibited no uptake when incubated in calciumfree medium the uptake reached a maximum by addition of calcium ion at a concentration of mm and was not alter up to mm addition of magnesium ion exhibited no uptake calciumdependent b uptake was markedly inhibited by manganese ion magnesium ion seemed to slightly inhibit the calciumdependent uptake
1507,it is rather difficult to draw up a list of the drugs most frequently used during pregnancy and to specify their action on the mother the uterus ans the fetus bearing in mind the differences between them this difficulty results in particular from the high number of drugs owing to the frequency of prescriptions and selfmedication in the Pr woman who suffers from numerous disorders and the possibility of a pathology associated with the pregnancy or a pathology due to the pregnancy itself thereby defining the high risk pregnancy on this BG already modified by pregnancy under the hold of numerous drugs an anesthetic can be necessary in addition during labour or delivery the frequency of which can be estimated as being approximately per cent it is not possible to T0 all therapeutic agents in a single communication one can only evoke the influence of the most currently used drugs analgesics antibiotics diuretics sleeping tablets antihypertensives and those aimed at the neuropsychiatric system antidepression agents neuroleptics tranquillizers which are so frequently used at present finally during labour the number of parturients who receive no drugs is rare ocytocic and antispasmodic agents can also interfere with an anesthetic all of these ideas which are more and more difficult to acquire are important to know in fact the person in charge of the delivery must prescribe as little drugs as possible in order to avoid multiple drug interference which is rather difficult to predict knowing the possible action of drugs on the fetus in order to allow best adaptation to life in our atmosphere T3 delivery and foreseeing the possible necessity for an anesthetic in his turn the anesthetist should have a good knowledge of obstetrical physiology and pathology and the drugs capable of being used during pregnancy and labour in order to be able to choose the best adapted anesthetic this emphasized the importance of a well integrated obstetricoanesthetic team in which each member knows the problems of the other with the aim of being the least possible noxious for the mother and the future newborn the fetus this also emphasizes the necessity for anesthetists attached to the ostetrical unit knowing like the obstetrician the histories of those women with high risk pregnancies obstetrical anesthetics cannot be improvised
1508,a retrospective crosssectional T0 was carried out on data derived from single h urine collections from male idiopathic calcium stoneformers the daily urine volume and ph and the exretions of calcium oxalate phosphate creatinine and magnesium were related to the time of year when the urine was collected and the saturation of urine with calcium Ox and octocalcium phosphate calculated for each month there were significant seasonal variations in the urinary excretion of calcium and oxalate each showing a maximum during the summer months and a minimum in the winter there was no significant seasonal variation in urinary ph volume creatinine phosphate or magnesium there was a significant increase in the saturation of urine with calcium oxalate and a trend towards higher saturation levels of octocalcium phosphate in the summer these changes were dependent only on the seasonal variation in urinary calcium and Ox and not on urine volume a retrospective study of the seasonal incidence of stone episodes among these stoneformers showed that the rate of stone passage per month was higher in the summer than in the winter there was no significant seasonal R2 in the incidence of stones removed surgically
1509,LG were isolated from the cytoplasm of the amebocytes of limulus polyphemus the horseshoe crab by disruption of cells obtained from blood which had been drawn into mm propranolol the LG subsequently were purified by centrifugation through a sucrose gradient that contained heparin extracts of the granules were prepared by freezing and thawing the granule preparations in DW transmission and SEM microscopy of the granules revealed round or ovoid particles however only one type of granule appeared to be present the ultraviolet spectrum of the extract of amebocyte LG demonstrated a peak at nm at ph and a shift into two peaks of nm and nm at alkaline ph analytical UC revealed a pattern similar to that observed with lysates prepared from IN amebocytes PAGE in the presence of urea at ph demonstrated patterns similar to those observed with amebocyte lysate extracts of the granules were gelled by bacterial endotoxin the blood of the horseshoe crab contains only one type of cell the amebocyte previous studies have shown that the blood coagulation mechanism of limulus is contained entirely within amebocytes the current studies suggest that the granules which pack the cytoplasm of these cells contain all of the factors required for the coagulation of blood including the clottable protein the intracellularly localized coagulation system is released from amebocytes when their granules rupture during cell aggregation
1510,the solution conformation of the extracellular polysaccharide of the bacterium xanthomonas campestris is examined by optical rotation viscometry and potentiometric titration measurements of optical rotation vs temperature for solutions of the polysaccharide at LIS reveal a sharp transition to a denatured structure which is reversible if sufficient salt is present the temperature tm at the transition midpoint increases as log na or log ca viscositytemperature profiles substantiate a structural change of the polysaccharide at tm the intrinsic viscosity of the native molecule at zero shear rate exceeds mlg this high figure is indicative of a stiff chain the viscosity of the native molecule is relatively insensitive to salt whereas the denatured molecule collapses if salt is present hydrogenion titration shows that the pkapp of the coo groups of the polymer decreases from in m nac to in m nac all these data suggest that the native polysaccharide possesses ordered AA structure stabilized by nonionic interactions outweighing the repulsion between adjacent coo groups
1511,the adenosinetriphosphatase atpase ec activity in azotobacter vinelandii concentrates in the membranous r fraction that is directly associated with azotobacter electron transport CF sonically disrupted azotobacter cells were examined for distribution of atpase activity and the highest specific activity and activity units was consistently found in the particulate r membranous fraction which sediments on ultracentrifugation at x g for h when the sonication time interval was increased the membranebound atpase activity could neither be solubilized nor released into the supernatant fraction optimal atpase activty occurred at ph mg ion when added to the CA was stimulatory Vmax always occurred when the mgatp stoichiometry was on a molar ratio at the mm concentration level sodium and potassium ions had no stimulatory effect the reaction kinetics were linear for the time intervals studied min the membranebound atpase in the r fraction was stimulated fold by treatment with trypsin and fractionation studies showed that trypsin treatment did not solubilize atpase activity off the membranous r electron transport fraction the atpase was not cold labile and the temperature during the preparation of the r fraction had no effect on activity overnight refrigeration at degrees c however resulted in a loss of activity as compared with a loss when the r fraction was stored overnight at degrees c a marked inactivation although variable usually about did occur by overnight freezing degrees c and subsequent sonication failed to restore atpase activity this indicates that membrane reaggregation by freezing was not responsible for atpase inactivation the addition of azide ouabain dinitrophenol or oligomycin to the CA system resulted in neither inhibition nor stimulation of the atpase activity the property of trypsin activation and that atpase activity is highest in the r electron transport fraction suggests that its probable PET role is in coupling of electron transport to oxidative phosphorylation
1512,the binding site of nadph in nadphadrenodoxin reductase was examined using crystalline enzyme from bovine HPA mitochondria by studies on the effects of photooxidation and chemical modifications of amino acid residues in the reductase photoxication decreased the enzymatic activity of nadphadrenodoxin reductase photooxidation of the reductase was prevented by nadp adrenodoxin or reduced glutathione but not nad photoinactivation caused loss of a histidyl residue but not of tyrosyl tryptophanyl cysteinyl or methionyl residues of the reductase it did not affect the circular dichroism spectrum of the reductase appreciably nadphadrenodoxin reductase activity was inhibited by diethyl pyrocarbonate and the inhibition was partially reversed by addition of hydroxylamine the inhibition was prevented by nadp but not nad nadphadrenodoxin reductase activity was inhibited by dithiobisnitrobenzoate and the inhibition was reversed by reduced glutathione it was also protected by nadp but not nad the results indicate that a histidyl residue and a cysteinyl residue of nadphadrenodoxin reductase are essential for the IB of nadph by the reductase
1513,two proteinase inhibitors designated as inhibitors i and ii were purified from adzuki beans phaseolus angularis by chromatographies on deae and cmcellulose and gel filtration on a sephadex g column each inhibitor shows unique inhibitory activities inhibitor i was a powerful inhibitor of trypsin ec but essentially not of chymotrypsin ec on the other hand inhibitor ii inhibited chymotrypsin more strongly than trypsin the molecular weights estimated from the enzyme inhibition were and for inhibitors i and ii respectively assuming that the inhibitions were stoichiometric and in molar ratio the amino acid compositions of both inhibitors closely resemble those of low molecular weight inhibitors of other leguminous seeds they contain C1 amounts of halfcystine aspartic acid and serine and little or no hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids inhibitor i lacks both tyrosine and tryptophan residues the molecular weights were calculated to be and for inhibitors i and ii respectively the reliability of these molecular weights was confirmed by the sedimentation equilibrium and m guanidine gel filtration methods on comparison with the values obtained from enzyme inhibition it was concluded that inhibitor i and two trypsin inhibitory sites on the molecule whereas inhibitor ii had one chymotrypsin and one TR GABA sites on the molecule
1514,a report is given on the recent discovery of outstanding immunological properties in ba ncyanoethyleneurea having a low molecular mass m experiments in ds CS bearing wistar rats have shown that ba at a dosage of only about percent ld mg kg and negligible lethality percent results in a REC rate of percent without hyperglycemia and in one test of percent with hyperglycemia under otherwise unchanged conditions the REF substance ifosfamide if a further development of cyclophosphamide applied without hyperglycemia in its most efficient dosage of percent ld mg kg brought about a recovery rate of percent at a lethality of percent contrary to ba min hyperglycemia caused no further improvement of the REC rate however this comparison is characterized by the fact that both substances exhibit two quite different complementary mechanisms of action leucocyte counts made T3 application of the said cancerostatics and dosages have shown a pronounced stimulation with ba and with ifosfamide the known suppression in the posttherapeutic interval usually found with standard cancerostatics in combination with the cited PI test for ba blood pictures then allow conclusions on the immunity status since if can be taken as one of the most efficient cancerostaticsthere is no other chemotherapeutic known up to now that has a more significant effect on the ds carcinosarcoma in rats these findings are of special importance finally the total amount of leucocytes and lymphocytes as well as their time behaviour was determined from the blood picture of tumourfree rats after iv application of ba the thus obtained numerical values clearly show that further research work on the prophylactic use of this substance seems to be necessary and very promising
1515,MCV propagated in fl cells of human amnion origin has a onestep growth cycle time of to h the appearance and exponential increase of intracellular virus preceded the PR of extracellular virus by approximately h demonstration of comparable titers of extracellular and intracellular virus at the end of the replication cycle indicated that a substantial amount of virus remained associated with cells exhibiting cytopathogenic changes mean buoyant density values of virus in sucrose ranged from to gcm but in cscl the virus banded at densities at to and to gcm although virus infectivity was not affected by high concentrations of cscl it was found by PAGE that the salt removed several nonglycosylated polypeptides with estimated molecular weights of to this suggested that the highdensity band to may reflect the loss of these structural components the halflife of virus infectivity was approximately h at degrees c and h at degrees c although the virus was rapidly inactivated at degrees c it could be stabilized at this temperature by the presence of m mgcl virus did not agglutinate newborn chick adult chicken or type human erythrocytes virus infectivity was found to be CS to acid ph but resistant to treatment with diethyl ether or chloroform the replication of molluscum virus in fl cells was not inhibited by iododeoxyuridine bromodeoxyuridine or cytosine arabinonucleoside in noncytotoxic concentrations of to mugml but greater than reduction in the yield of herpes simplex virus or vaccinia virus in fl cells was obtained with mug of these compounds per ml guanidinium chloride in concentrations of to mugml reduced molluscum virus yields by more than
1516,two dna polymerases of high molecular weight pol a molwt and pol b molwt ooo have been purified fold and fold respectively from an extramitochondrial supernatant of a bleached CS of euglena gracilis they have very similar requirements when assayed with an activateddna primertemplate the optimum conditions of ph and ionic k and mn composition being mm and mm respectively mmmn was about fold as effective as mmmg owing to substrate activation by deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates in the presence of mn km values for the triphosphates in the absence of activation were about m with mn and x m with mg for both enzymes they were inhibited to the same extent by nethylmaleimide NB and ophenanthroline but differed in their chromatographic behaviour on deaecellulose and in their electrophoretic mobilities on polyacrylamide gel no evidence was found for the existence in these cells of a dna polymerase of low molecular weight but there were indications that a third enzyme of high molecular weight might exist
1517,i.v. of carrageenin mgkg iv from the st to the rd day and then each nd or rd day inhibited paw swelling in adjuvant ICA of the rat during the time of treatment i.v. from the th to the th day were ineffective the level of plasma kininogen was slightly decreased but the total complement serum level was significantly lowered and mg carrageeninkg respectively were toxic after repeated injections after a single administration the C2 of plasma kininogen and of total serum complement were decreased by although paw swelling was not affected pentosane polysulfoester mgkg iv did not influence paw swelling despite daily administration from the st to the th day heparin iekg iv was likewise ineffective single or repeated injections of compound mgkg iv mgkg ip mgkg sc reserpine mgkg ip cyproheptadine mgkg iv bromolysergic acid diethylamide x mgkg iv or metiamide mgkg iv were without effect on paw swelling neither did compound effect the complement SS level daily administration of chloropromazine mgkg po or of promethazine mgkg sc or po inhibited paw swelling in the first phase of adjuvant arthritis but not in the second one the soybean trypsin inhibitor mgkg iv inhibited paw swelling significantly up to the th day the kunitz inhibitor ekg iv was ineffective the content of prostaglandin e of the inflamed paws was increased threefold in both phases of arthritis the results are discussed with regard to the putative role of mediators of inflammation histamine serotonin kinins prostaglandins lysosomal enzymes lymphokines complement
1518,adenosine deaminase exists in multiple molecular forms in human tissue one form of the enzyme appears to be particulate three forms of the enzyme are soluble and interconvertible with apparent molecular weights of approximately and designated small intermediate and C1 respectively the small form of adenosine deaminase is convertible to the C1 form only in the presence of a protein which has an apparent molecular weight of and has no adenosine deaminase activity this conversion of the small form of the enzyme to the large form occurs at degrees exhibits a ph optimum of to and is associated with a loss of conversion activity the small form of the enzyme predominates in tissue S9 exhibiting the higher enzymespecific MICs and no detectable conversion activity the large form of adenosine deaminase predominates in tissue extracts exhibiting the lower enzyme specific activities and abundant conversion activity the small form of adenosine deaminase shows several electrophoretic variants by isoelectric focusing the electrophoretic heterogeneity observed with the large form of the enzyme is similar to that observed with the small form with the exception that several additional electrophoretic variants are uniformly identified no organ specificity is demonstrable for the different electrophoretic forms the kinetic characteristics of the three soluble molecular species of adenosine deaminase are MZ except for ph optimum which is for the intermediate species and to for the C1 and small forms
1519,the transport of moo into dinitrogenfixing cells of clostridium pasteurianum was investigated transport of molybdate in this organism is energy dependent SU is required in the minimal media and the system is inhibited by the glycolysis inhibitors naf IAA and arsenate the cells accumulate molybdate against a concentration gradient and the uptake shows a marked dependence on temperature optimum c and ph optimum the rate of molybdate uptake with increasing molybdate concentrations shows saturation kinetics with an apparent km and vmax of x m and nmolg of dry cells per min respectively inhibition studies with the anions so so wo and vo show that so and wo competitively inhibit moo uptake apparent ki so is x m apparent ki wo is x whereas so and vo have no inhibitory effect exchange experiments with moo show that only a small percentage of the moo taken up by the cells is exchangeable exchange experiments with wo and so indicate that once inside the cells wo and so cannot substitute for moo
1520,the role of target organs in the maturation of adrenergic SN was studied in the neonatal rat the superior cervical ganglion scg and its end organs the salivary PG and iris were employed as a model system unilateral sialectomy and iridectomy in dayold animals prevented the normal OD of ganglion IMT hydroxylase toh and dopa decarboxylase activities these enzymes are highly localized to adrenergic SN in the scg and were used to monitor maturation of these cells CEA remained depressed for at least two months the longest time tested in contrast total ganglion protein a measure of ganglion growth as a whole initially developed normally six weeks T3 surgery however protein content was significantly lower in ganglia deprived of the normal field of innervation failure of normal enzyme maturation was apparently dependent on removal of ipsilateral end organs only since bilateral sialectomy exerted no greater effect than unilateral sialectomy in adults unilateral sialectomy and iridectomy did not significantly alter ganglion toh activity or protein in rats followed up to one month T3 surgery
1521,rats fed either a stock deit or a purified diet based on casein were tested for their ability to convert sesodium selenite to volatile selenium dimethyl selenide in vivo this conversion was also studied in CL and kidney in vitro when injected with a subacute dose of selenite mg sekg rats previously fed stock diet volatilized more than twice as much of the dose compared to rats fed the purified diet confirming earlier findings parallel dietary effects were also observed in vitro using subcellular fractions incubated with seselenite glutathione tpnh and sadenosylmethionine the x g supernate prepared from rats fed stock diet synthesized dimethyl selenide at approximately twice the rate of that prepared from rats fed purified diet a fourfold higher activity was observed with CL microsomal fractions from rats fed the stock diet whereas cytosol was slightly more active in rats fed the purified diet kidney fractions showed analogous changes with diet although the activity of kidney microsomal fraction was very low only minor differences in the levels of glutathione reductase nonspecific disulfide reducatse and NPSH were observed in liver and kidney from rats fed the two diets considering the effects of diet on the various enzymes known from our previous studies to be involved in dimethyl selenide synthesis it was concluded that the enhanced ability of rats fed stock diet to synthesize dimethyl selenide results from the induction of a liver microsomal enzyme apparently a semethyltransferase caused by unknown substances in the stock diet
1522,the potent alphaadrenoreceptor blocking agent azapetine has been catalytically reduced with tritium gas to form hdihydroazapetine hdihydroazapetine retains significant ability to block alphaadrenoreceptors and has been used as a ligand to T0 the receptor in a subcellular fraction containing membrane fragments from RVD SB of hdihydroazapetine rapidly reaches equilibrium and is also reversible and saturable with a dissociation constant similar to that determined pharmacologically the IB capacity is approximately pmolmg of protein all alphaadrenergic blockers tested were able to inhibit specific binding high concentrations of alprenolol atropine or chlorpheniramine had no effect in addition all alphaadrenergic agonists of the imidazoline class inhibit binding in low concentrations whereas soterenol or carbamylcholine did not there is good correlation r between blockade or stimulation of the receptor in intact tissues and inhibition of IB of hdihydroazapetine to the subcellular fraction these findings suggest that the fraction contains alphaadrenoreceptorrelated proteins alphaadrenergic agonists structurally related to norepinephrine caused a stereoselective increase in binding in favor of the isomer possibly reflecting an allosteric interaction at a different binding site on the receptor protein the possibility of two different modes of binding for structurally dissimilar agonists is suggested
1523,CBF blood flow cbf and cerebral avdifferences of oxygen and circulating substrates were measured in normocapnic infants during GA before elective surgery in order to study possible agedependent variations cbf was determined by a minor modification of the ketyschmidt technique from desaturation curves of nitrous oxide no in arterial and cerebral venous blood no analysed by gas chromatography on mul blood samples after reduction of inhaled no from to the reproducibility was lactate pyruvate and oxygen were determined in whole blood and amino acids in plasma by ionexchange chromatography reliable avdifferences of glucose acetoacetate and dbetahydroxybutyrate could be calculated from plasma values and hematocrits mean values from infants age days months were cbf ml gmin cerebral uptake in mumoles gmin oxygen glucose acetoacetate dbetahydroxybutyrate cerebral PR lactate and pyruvate significant uptake of amino acids was found only for histidine and arginine significant correlations between arterial concentration and cerebral exchange were found for Orn arginine phenylalanine aspartic acid serine glutamine and acetoacetate cbf and substrate exchange were unrelated to age within the group infants had higher mean cbf and greater uptake of ketone bodies than has been reported in adults
1524,simultaneous measurement of hydrogen ion production transmural potential difference and intermittent shortcircuit current scc was made in the rat proximal jejunum in vitro similarly potassium and sodium ion movements were measured to investigate the relationship of acidification to electrogenic events and associated ion movements in the jejunum acidification correlated significantly with the SCC and both were inhibited by mm serosal ouabain or mm mucosal aminophylline both inhibitors had effects on net potassium movement but not on net sodium movement moreover in isotope studies whereas mm serosal ouabain reduced the jms sodium flux mm mucosal aminophylline had no effect ie aminophylline can reduce both shortcircuit current and acidification without perceptibly altering the serosally directed sodium flux in lowsodium buffers in which acidification still occurs although reduced transmural potential differences occur of reversed polarity that are apparently unrelated to sodium diffusion potential differences as evidenced by isotopic sodium efflux experiments and which could be caused by hydrogen ion production in low sodium buffers however the inhibitors have opposing effects ouabain causing an increase and aminophylline a decrease in the reversed PDs a model for acidification that of potassium rather than sodium ion exchange for the hydrogen ion and hydroxyl for chloride ion exchange is proposed to explain the present experimental findings and other diverse observations in the literature although either step might be the electrogenic step acidification must be also considered as a component of the jejunal SCC
1525,fragments of isolated rat liver plasma membrane possess a ribonuclease activity which at ph in the presence of mm edta can digest polyuridylic acid polyu and polycytidylic acid polyc but not polyadenylic acid polya and polyguanylic acid polyg under these conditions the membrane preparation does not degrade native or denatured dna the products of the reaction with polyu mm edta present can be separated on deaesephadex into oligonucleotides of increasing chain length most of the products are di to hexanucleotides which contain terminal phosphate CG when edta is not present ph or the plasma membrane preparation degrades both polya and polyu with polya the product is all nucleoside while with polyu as ATP most of the product is nucleoside but also some oligonucleotides are produced the ribonuclease releases acid soluble products very slowly from high concentrations of polyu mgml UR trinucleotide with and without a terminal phosphate group is degraded by rat liver plasma membrane the trinucleotide diphosphate is rapidly hydrolyzed to nucleoside while the CAG itself is slowly digested and yields intermediate products including nucleoside
1526,nadh and nadphferredoxin oxidoreductases have been studied in clostridium acetobutylicum cl tyrobutyricum and cl pasteurianum the study of the CSD and regulation of these enzymatic activities in welldefined culture conditions reveals that the essential function of nadphferredoxin oxidoreductase is to produce nadph while nadhferredoxin oxidoreductase can depending on cellular conditions produce or oxidize nadh when these clostridia use glycolysis regulation of the nadhferredoxin oxidoreductase by acetylcoa obligatory activator of nadhferroxin reductase activity and by nadh competitive inhibitor of ferredoxinnad reductase activity allow the enzymes to CF correlatively with G3P dehydrogenase and thus control the levels of nad and nadh in the cell in cl tyrobutyricum and cl pasteurianum the FNR activities are regulated by nad and nadh in accordance with the intracellular concentrations of these coenzymes in cl tyrobutyricum growing on pyruvateacetate nadh and nadphferredoxin reductase MICs cannot be detected only the ferredoxinnad and FNR activities are found in this clostridium regulation of the ferredoxinnadp reductase activity is the same whether it is grown on glucose or Pyr contrary to this the ferredoxinnad reductase activity undergoes a drastic NC since nadh no longer controls the enzymatic activity in this case regulation is no longer necessary since glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase does not function
1527,sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments isolated from dog cardiac muscle possess a calciumaccumulating system associated with a series of enzymes linked to glycogenolysis these enzymes include adenylate cyclase cyclic ampdependent protein kinase phosphorylase b kinase phosphorylase ba debrancher enzyme and glycogen to mgmg of protein the sarcoplasmic reticulum preparation produced glucose phosphate and gl from either endogenous or exogenous glycogen both the calciumaccumulating and glycogenolytic enzymes sediment in a single peak at sucrose on a linear continous SU density gradient and the complex remains intact throughout repeated washing glycogen particles appear to be associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum in situ as well as in the isolated microsomal fraction the sarcoplasmic reticulumglycogenolytic complex monitored by a linked enzyme spectrophotometric assay shows several features a activation of phosphorylase activity to peak rate occurs over a very rapid time course which cannot be duplicated using combinations of purified enzymes b activation is inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor c phosphorylase b functions as in the purified form with respect to amp km mm d in the presence of limiting amounts of glycogen optimal phosphorylase b activity in the sarcoplasmic reticulum requires the presence of debrancher and the activity is CS to inhibitors of that enzyme such as tris which suggests the possiblity that the enzymes bear a TPS structual relationship to the glycogen present phosphorylase b leads to a activation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum was completely resistant to DDE glycol bisbetaaminoethyl eithernntetraacetic acid egta inhibition of calcium accumulation by or release of bound calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum by xa ro did not alter the egta resistance these results suggest that cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum is a complex organelle containing functions that may be related to excitationcontraction coupling and intermediary metabolism
1528,dansyl chloride at low molar ratio inactivates ferredoxinnadp reductase nadphferredoxin oxidoreductase ec the complete protection afforded either by nadp or nadph suggests a direct involvement of the AS site experiments with mec dansyl chloride showed that about residues per flavin were dansylated by differential labelling experiments using nadp it has been proved that enzyme inactivation is due to dansylation of one residue the group modified has been identified as the epsilonamino group of a lysine the phinactivation profile indicates that this essential group has an apparent pka of the dansylated flavoprotein seems to maintain its native conformation it shows a fluorescent chromophore with a peak at nm the modified enzyme has lost the capacity to form a complex with nadp nevertheless it interacts normally with ferredoxin it is concluded that the loss of catalytic activity which parallels the dansylation of a lysyl residue occurs because this residue is essential for the binding of the pyridine nucleotide substrate protection experiments with a series of coenzyme analogs further indicate that this lysyl residue interacts most likely with the phosphate moiety of nadph
1529,treatment of the cell wall tetrasaccharide glcnacbeta leads to murnacbeta leads to glcnacbeta leads to murnac with alkali resulted in the formation of the unsaturated tetrasaccharide glcnacbeta leads to murnacbeta leads to glcnacbeta leads to deltaacetamidodeoxydglucoseen the same compound was also formed by transglycosylation upon incubation of the unmodified tetrasaccharide with the unsaturated disaccharide glcnacbeta leads to deltaacetamidodeoxydglucoseen tipper d j biochemistry and HEL the unsaturated tetrasaccharide was further characterized by paper electrophoresis amino sugar analysis and nmr from nmr analysis it is concluded that the deltaacetamidodeoxydglucoseen at the reducing end of the unsaturated tetrasaccharide has a halfchair conformation this conformation is similar to the one proposed for the sugar at subsite d in the lysozymesubstrate complex in the TS addition of the unsaturated tetrasaccharide to a solution of HEL quenched the fluorescence of the enzyme and shifted the fluorescence maximum to the blue similar to the effect produced by the parent compound the association constant of the unsaturated tetrasaccharide and lysozyme was measured at ph and degrees by spectrofluorimetry and microcalorimetry and found to be x m and x m respectively the average value is times higher than that found for the binding of unmodified tetrasaccharide to the enzyme under the same conditions the unsaturated tetrasaccharide proved to be a better inhibitor of the lysis of micrococcus luteus cells than the parent compound by a factor of these results support the hypothesis that the AS site of the enzyme is constructed so as to bind the TS for the reaction it catalyzes more firmly than the substrate itself
1530,the rabbit pulmonary artery contains postsynaptic alphaadrenoceptors which meidate smooth muscle contraction its NE nerves contain presynaptic alphaadrenoceptors which mediate inhibition of the release of the transmitter evoked by nerve impulses DRCs for the pre and postsynaptic effects of eight alphareceptor agonists were determined on superfused strips of the artery in the presence of cocaine corticosterone and propranolo according to the concentrations which caused of the Emax ec post the postsynaptic rank order of potency was adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than tramazoline greater than alphamethylnoradrenaline greater than methoxamine the pa values of phentolamine againstoxymethazoline phenylephrine alphamethylnoradrenaline and methoxamine were and respectively for the investigation of presynaptic effects the arteries were preincubated with hnoradrenaline all agonists inhibited the overflow of 3H evoked by transmural sympathetic nerve stimulation according to the concentrations which reduced the stimulationinduced overflow by ec pre the rank order of potency was adrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than tramazoline greater than alphamethylnoradrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than methoxamine m phentolamine shifted the presynaptic DR curves for moradrenaline and oxymethazoline to the RA the ratio ec preec post was calculated for each agonist as an index of its relative post and presynaptic potency according to the ratios the agonists were arbitrarily classified into three groups group ratio about preferentially postsynaptic agonists comprised methoxamine and phenylephrine group ratio near similar pre and postsynaptic potencies comprised noradrenaline adrenaline and naphazoline group ratio below preferentially presynaptic agonists comprised oxymetazoline alphamethylnoradrenaline and tramazoline as well as clonidine preferentially presynaptic and preferentially postsynaptic agonists had opposite effects on the basoconstrictor response to nerve stimulation methoxamine and phenylephrine either did not change or enhanced but never reduced the response in contrast oxymetazoline alphamethylnoradrenaline and tramazoline at low concentrations selectively inhibited the response to stimulation at low frequency hz it is concluded that alphaadrenoceptor agonists vary widely in their relative pre and postsynaptic potencies possibly because of structural differences between pre and postsynaptic alphareceptors pre and postsynaptic components contribute to their overll postsynaptic effec in actively transmitting synapses the preferential activation of presynaptic alphareceptors results in alphaadrenergic inhibition of synaptic transmission
1531,glutamine synthetase has been purified to homogeneity from b subtilis degrees b stearothermophilus degrees and b caldolyticus degrees those characteristics compared include size x daltons quaternary structure su amino acid content substrate kms and specificity for structural analogs metal ion activation number and kind of separate FB modifier sites and the complexity of modifiersubstrate and modifiermodifier site interactions although the degrees and degrees systems are quite similar the degrees system shows important alterations in substrate specificity and modes of modifier action whereas at degrees and degrees amp inhibits synergistically with amino acids glycine glutamine histidine the degrees enzyme is inhibited directly by the products adp which assumes the role of amp and glutamine plus other ligands ligand binding domains are compared and found to be very different thermostabilization occurs by a protection by bound lglutamate b protein aggregation c trends in the content of total polar residues total asx flx residues the average hydrophobicity and d disulfide bond crosslinking such studies provide insights to molecular evolution occurring with changes in environmental AS
1532,secretion of serotonin from platelets induced by plateletactivating factor paf derived from antigenstimulated igesensitized rb basophils was studied to further characterize the biochemical requirements inhibition of secretion with DFP dfp was observed if the dfp was present during the reaction but not if platelets or paf were pretreated with the inhibitor this suggested a role for an activatable serine protease in the secretion supporting evidence came from the observation that other protease inhibitors and a variety of low molecular weight amino acid esters were also inhibitory tame was most effective and aglme and leume were inactive indicating a specificity for different esters secretion was reduced by agents that increased intracellular cyclic amp camp but enhanced by alphaadrenergic stimulation which reduced the levels of camp concurrent with pafinduced secretion a reduction in camp C2 was observed no effect of cyclic gmp or cholinergic stimulation was found secretion was inhibited by colchicine and enhanced by cytochalasin b suggesting a role for microfilaments and MTs the effects of these three systems on pafinduced secretion indicate the basic uniformity of the secretory process in platelets and other cells whatever the stimulus the uniqueness of the reaction apparently lies in the stimulusreceptor interaction and the nature of the serine protease which is activated
1533,the transcortin we have used in this work is extremely pure this was shown by the polymerisation observed at ph this polymerisation is never observed with an impure form of CBG moreover since it is known that the presence of cortisol in the binding site is an essential condition to the activity of purified transcortin it appears that a correlation between the secondary structure and the biological activity of the transcortin exists the results we have obtained are summarized below the inhibition of the transcortin IB capacity essentially takes place between ph and a reorganisation of the structure of the protein moiety is observed between ph and a decrease of the helicity ratio is observed between ph and it appears therefore that in the limits of experimental accuracy of cd measurements to determine the amount of betastructure no appreciable change of IB activity is taking place after the appearance of a C1 percentage of betastructure between ph and on the other hand the sudden decrease of protein activity at low ph is likely to be correlated with the disappearance of a welldefined helical region other biochemical and physical experiments would be of course necessary in order to precise this first observation of a structurefunction relationship in CBG
1534,the characteristics of inorganic phosphate transport in isolated perfused PT tubules of the rb were examined using radioisotopic techniques when tubules were perfused with an ultrafiltrate of rabbit serum the mean lumentobath flux of phosphate in the convoluted segment was se pmolmmmin with a simultaneous backtolumen flux of in the straight portion of the PT tubule the lumentobath flux was significantly lower p less than at pmolminmin with a bathtolumen flux of the lumentobath flux was not affected by increases in the IL phosphate concentration from to mm or by the isohydric replacement of bicarbonate in the ambient fluids with chloride however phosphate absorption was CR inhibited by ouabain m in the bath these data indicate that phosphate absorption in these segments occurs by a mechanism other than independent diffusion and is saturated at phosphate concentrations characteristic of normal glomerular filtrate there is no evidence for significant phosphate transport from bath to lumen
1535,the activity of aspergillus orzae nuclease s on dna has been investigated under varying ph and metal ion conditions nuclease s was found to preferentially digest denatured dna with native dna as substrate the enzyme could only digest the dna when caffeine was added to the reaction mixture the enzyme was more AS in sodium acetate buffer ph than in either standard saline citrate ph or sodium phosphate buffer ph caffeine was also found to affect the thermal stability of dna resulting in a melting profile characterized by two transitions the first transition poorly defined was below the normal melting temperature of the dna while the next transition was at the normal melting temperature of the dna while the next transition was at the normal melting temperature of the dna the susceptibility of caffeinetreated dna to nuclease digestion seems to be a result of the local unwinding that caffeine causes in the regions of dna that melt in the first transition this selective destabilization presumably sensitizes the unwound regions to nuclease hydrolysis the hydrolysates of the dna digested by nuclease s were subjected first to ion exchange chromatography followed by paper chromatography the results from this partial characterization of the digestion products showed that they contain mononucleotides as well as oligonucleotides of varying lengths the base composition of the mononucleotide digests suggests that caffeine has greater preference for interacting with at basepairs in dna
1536,mice primed with a thymus t dependent form of type iii pneumococcal polysaccharide s ie s coupled to erythrocytes srbc produce sspecific igg antibody T3 secondary challenge with either s or srbc the production of igg antibody by mice challenged with s was shown to be t independent since secondary responses were enhanced when mice were treated with antilymphocyte serum als at the time of secondary challenge with s and tdepleted spleen cells responded as well as UF SP cells to s in an adoptive transfer system secondary sspecific igg responses in mice challenged with srbc were shown to be t dependent by the same criteria the results obtained by using s as the antigen indicate that iggproducing b cells b lambda cells can recognize and respond to antigen in the absence of helper t cells on the other hand t cells were required for the induction of sspecific SM b lambda cells since mice depleted of t cells by treatment with als at the time of priming with srbc failed to produce sspecific igg antibody after AA challenge with either sspecific igg antibody after secondary challnge with either s or srbc since rbcspecific SM cells were induced in tdeprived mice the results suggest that t cell regulation of igg antibody production may vary for different antigens
1537,a technique for isolating the SC from the subjacent layers of the epithelium was developed which permits studying the stratum corneum as an isolated membrane mounted between halfchambers the method basically consists of an osmotic shock induced by immersing a piece of skin in distilled water at degrees c for min when the membrane is bathed on each surface by naclringers solution its electrical resistance is omega cm n this value is about of the whole skin resistance in the presence of the same solution the hydraulic filtration coefficient lp measured by a hydrostatic pressure method with identical solutions on each side of the membrane is x x cm sec atm n in distilled water and x x cm sec atm n in naclringers solution these values are not statistically different and are within the range of to of the whole skin lp the SC shows an amphoteric character when studied by kcl diffusion potentials at different phs the membrane presents an isoelectric ph of n above the isoelectric ph the potassium transport number is higher than the chloride transport number below it the reverse situation is valid divalent cations ca or cu reduce membrane ionic discrimination when the membrane is negatively charged and are ineffective when the membrane fixed charges are protonated at low ph
1538,experiments were carried out on the isolated PTC muscle of the rb in order to further characterize the alphaadrenoceptors mediating the PIE for this purpose DR relations of seven sympathomimetic amines were compared under the influence of alpha andor betaadrenolytic drugs phentolamine m shifted the lower part of the DRCs for norfenephrine synephrine and epinine as for phenylephrine and adrenaline to the right while prindolol m affected only the upper part of the curves in the presence of both alpha and betaadrenoceptor blocking agents the entire doseresponse curves for sympathomimetic amines were shifted in a parallel manner noradrenaline affected preferentially betaadrenoceptors whereas its effect on alphaadrenoceptors was so weak that it could be detected only when the neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanism of amines were blocked by cocaine x m and corticosterone x m respectively the effect of dopamine was not affected either by phentolamine or by prindolol but was antagonized by the simultaneous application of both alpha and betaadrenoceptor blocking agents from the present results it appears that the following relationships are present between the structure of amines and the alphaadrenoceptor stimulating activity in the HR nmethylation increases the potency absence of the hydroxyl group either in or in position decreases the intrinsic and betaadrenoceptor stimulating activities but increases the alphaadrenoceptor stimulating activity
1539,a glucidlipid and protein compound nutriment trive was administered to patients during the first three postoperative days in varying doses ml per day to a first group ml per day to a second group the local tolerance was quite good however a few accidents of a general character were noted they were due to a great extent to a nonobservance of the rules of preservation a study of the glucides in sorbitol form showed a good assimilation of the substratum glycemia remaining within normal no glycosuria or ketonuria could be observed the assimilation of the proteins seemed on the whole satisfactory no important rise in the blood urea was noted nitrogen balances showed that thanks to this nutriment almost half of them were positive during the postaggressive period the more important the dose of trive the more positive the nitrogen balances were the administration of lipids did not reveal any significant NC in the total lipids triglycerides or cholesterol a study of the graphic record of lipid levels showed chylomicrons twice on the opposite lipoproteins were hardly modified apart from a significant in prebeta lipoproteins the quantitative analysis of aminoacids proved interesting a comparative T0 of aminoacids both in blood and urine before and after the administration of trive showed very little variations in connection with essential aminoacids if the proportions in the blood of nonessential aminoacids were comparatively but little modified before and after the treatment on the oppostie the urinary clearance rate of the same aminoacids after treatment was far more variable and often quite important as far as certain aminoacids were concerned
1540,the possibility of renal tubular adaptation to variations in dietary inorganic phosphate pi was investigated in IN and thyroparathyroidectomized tptx rats pairfed diets containing low normal and high amounts of pi for periods up to days clearances were measured before and during AS iv infusions with pi in conscious animals thus tubular reabsorption of phosphate trpi could be assessed over a wide range of plasma phosphate concentrations pip it was found that the renal tubule could adapt its capacity to transport pi according to the dietary pi trpi was always higher for a given pip in the animals fed low than in those fed higher pi diets this dietinduced modification also occurred in the absence of thyroparathyroid PG in the presence of the same calcemia and urinary ph and during marked extracellular volume expansion a timecourse study in rats tptx both before and during the administration of the exp diets showed that a difference in the tubular handling of pi was detectable as early as days T3 switching the animals from a normal to low or highpi diets these results indicate that factors other than parathyroid hormone are implicated in the tubular response to variations in the dietary intake of inorganic phosphate
1541,a method using pbenzoquinone for coupling antigens and antibodies to enzymes and erythrocytes is described the method involves the treatment of proteins or polysaccharides at ph or with an excess of pbenzoquinone after removal of the unreacted reagent by gel filtration the activated proteins were coupled at ph with enzymes or erythrocytes biological MICs of the proteins were not substantially modified by this treatment since of the antigen IB capacity was found to be preserved in pbenzoquinone treated antibodies or fab fragments antiig antibodies or fab were coupled by this procedure to peroxidase alkaline phosphatase lactoperoxidase glucose oxidase and betagalactosidase and the conjugates obtained were found to be highly ERP in detecting intracellular ig by immunohistochemical techniques erythrocytes coated with sheep antimouse ig antibody or fab were used to titrate by passive hemagglutination SS ig the same erythrocytes were employed to detect by plaque assay mouse ig secreting cells erythrocytes coated with peroxidase ALP phosphatase bovine serum albumin ribonuclease salmonella polysaccharide b and pneumoccocal polysaccharide siii were employed to titrate serum antibody by passive hemagglutination and hemolysis and to detect mouse antibody secreting cells by plaque CA all the antigens and antibodies coated erythrocytes prepared gave highly satisfactory and reproducible results
1542,the interactions of cytochrome c and cytochrome c from bovine cardiac mitochondria were investigated cytochrome c and cytochrome c formed a molecular complex in aqueous solutions of low ionic strength the complex was SD to sephadex g chromatography the formation and stability of the complex were independent of the oxidation state of the cytochrome components as far as those reactions studied were concerned the complex was dissociated in solutions of ionic strength higher than or ph exceeding and only partially dissociated in m urea no complexation occurred when cytochrome c was acetylated on of its lysine residues or photooxidized on its methionine residues complexes with molecular ratios of less than ie more cytochrome c were obtained when polymerized cytochrome c or cytochrome c with all lysine residues guanidinated or a heme peptide from cyanogen bromide cleavage of cytochrome c was used these results were interpreted to imply that the complex was predominantly maintained by ionic interactions probably involving some of the lysine residues of cytochrome c but with L1 stabilization dependent on the native conformations of both cytochromes the reduced complex was autooxidizable with biphasic kinetics with first order rate constants of x and x u s but did not react with carbon monoxide the complex reacted with cyanide and was reduced by ascorbate at about and respectively of the rates of reaction with cytochrome c alone the complex was less photoreducible than cytochrome c CT the complex exhibited remarkably different CD behavior from that of the summation of cytochrome c plus cytochrome c we concluded that when cytochromes c and c interacted they underwent dramatic conformational changes resulting in weakening of their heme crevices all results available would indicate that in the complex cytochrome c was bound at the entrance to the heme crevice of cytochrome c on the Met side of the heme crevice
1543,the efficacy of tolamolol a cardioselective beta adrenergic blocking agent was evaluated in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias in patients nineteen patients had supraventricular arrhythmias and eight had VAs evaluation was by doulbeblind randomized trial in patients tolamolol was ERP in reducing VVI rate in percent of patients with supraventricular arrhythmias and resulted in conversion to SR in of the the mean ventricular rate in patients decreased from to min minutes after initiation of administration of tolamolol and gradually decreased further to min after minutes reduction in VR was sustained for hours of monitoring undergone by all patients and for and hours monitoring in two subgroups among the eight patients with ventricular ectopic beats tolamolol reduced their frequency in four patients and had no effect in four six patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and experienced no adverse clinical effects on respiratory function in association with administration to tolamolol untoward effects occurred in patients including SH in of whom required vasopressor therapy other SE were sedation nausea dyspnea and warmth in the chest all of which were mild and transient requiring no treatment cardioselective beta adrenergic blockade with tolamolol was highly effective in controlling VVI rate in supraventricular arrhythmias and reduced the frequency of ventricular ectopic beats in half of the small group of patients with this arrhythmia it is particularly applicable in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease in whom cardiac beta adrenergic blockade is indicated SH is an important potential side effect
1544,the effect of APDs was tested on responses to microelectrophoretically applied dopamine acetylcholine and hydroxytryptamine in identified neurons of the marine gastropod aplysia californica fluphenazine was able to depress the response to da in concentration of mum with mum daresponses of many neurons were blocked completely thioridazine and mum and haloperidol mum were also effective in depressing daresponses while the nonantipsychotic phenothiazines mepazine and mum and promethazine mum had only a slight action on dareceptors ach and htresponses were slightly affected only by high concentrations after long lasting perfusion the investigated drugs had no persistent or only an insignificant effect on resting membrane potential and amplitude of action potentials of the SN with haloperidol depolarizing afterpotentials leading to double discharges were observed in some neurons in a few instances spontaneous epsps disappeared with the daresponse under the influence of antipsychotic drugs the results render a direct neurophysiological evidence for the blockade of dareceptors by antipsychotic drugs in correspondence to their clinical efficacy and agree with data from clinical observations and obtained in neurochemical behavioral and indirect neurophysiological experiments
1545,the effects of oral and intravenous administration of atenolol were studied in healthy volunteers the oral administration of a series of single doses of atenolol reduced an exercise tachycardia T3 a mg dose the effect on an exercise ART was maximal at hr and declined linearly with time at a rate of approximately per hr the peak plasma atenolol concentration occurred at hr and thereafter declined exponentially with time with an elimination halflife of hr of the dose was excreted in the urine within hr there was a correlation between the reduction in an exercise tachycardia and the logarithm of the corresponding plasma concentration the intravenous administration of atenolol reduced exercise tachycardia with a significant correlation between effect and plasma concentration after mg intravenously of the dose was recovered from the urine and the clearance was mlmin comparison of auc o leads to chi after oral and intravenous administration of mg showed the bioavailability to be after oral drug repeated oral administration of atenolol mg daily either as a single dose or in divided hourly doses for days maintained reduction of an exercise tachycardia of at least during the period of drug administration the plasma elimination halflife area under the plasma concentrationtime curve and peak plasma concentration T3 mg atenolol were not changed by chronic dosing for days
1546,influence of ph on absorbance and cdspectra of dna in pegcontaining watersalt solutions has been studied the changes in the spectra appeared due to disturbance of the dna secondary structure upon acidification of the medium proir to or after dna compactization if acidification preceeds dna compactization an intense negative band in the cd spectrum inherent to the compact particles is observed at ph values the intensity of the band decreases with an increase of the acidity the size of the compact particles as evaluated from the dependence of the apparent optical density on the wavelength value remains unchanged about a if the solution is strongly acidified ph and a considerable disturbance in the dna AA structure takes place a negative band in the cd spectrum completely disappears if one acidifies a solution containing preformed dna compact particles a decrease of the intensity of the cd negative band starts at lower ph values less than this process is accompanied by an increase of the size of the particles acidic denaturation of dna within the compact particles ph approximately is followed by a dissappearance of the cd negative band and a considerable increase of the particle size the data obtained indicate that the specific arrangement of dna strands manifested in a cd negative band depends on the defects in the dna secondary structure
1547,structural and functional changes in S1 of fast muscles during early postnatal development were studied to seek correlations with wellknown physiological changes in the contraction rate the findings were as follows it is known that fetal fast muscle myosin contains three kinds of light chains it was confirmed that their molecular weights were the same as those of AD fast muscle S1 but different from those of adult slow muscle myosin the amount of the smallest CS chain g was confirmed to increase markedly during the PN period the atpase ec activity of fetal fast muscle myosin day was found to be about of that of adult myosin the phactivity curve of fetal myosin atpase was confirmed to be similar to that of adult S1 the rate of formation of the reactive myosinphosphateadp complex madpp was found not to NC during postnatal OD it was found that the rate of decomposition of madpp in the presence of factin increased markedly during the PN period and that the rate of decomposition of the complex of fetal mysoin was only to of that of AD myosin the change in the actomyosin atpase activity was found to be closely correlated with the increase in the g content during development
1548,purified skeletal muscle myosin ec has been covalently bound to sepharose b by the cyanogen bromide procedure the resulting complex sepharosemyosin possesses adenosine triphosphatase activity and is relatively stable for long periods of time under optimal binding conditions approximately of the TPS atpase activity of the bound S1 is retained PAGE of polypeptides released from denatured sepharosemyosin indicates that of the myosin is attached to the agarose beads through the HCs and the remainder through the light chains in PA with predictions of IB and PR based upon either the lysine contents or molecular weights of themyosin subunits the adenosine triphosphatase of the immobilized S1 has been investigated under conditions of varying ph ionic strength and cation concentration the atpase profiles of immobilized myosin are quite similar to those for free myosin however subtle differences are found the sepharosemyosin atpase is not as sensitive as myosin to alterations in salt concentration and the apparent km is approximately twofold higher than that of myosin these differences are probably due to chemical modification in the region of the attachment sites to the agarose beads and hydration and diffusion limitations imposed by the polymeric agarose matrix
1549,the technique of thermal perturbation difference spectroscopy for examining chromophores in proteins has been set on a more acceptable theoretical and exp foundation i the origins of the thermal effect have been analysed to explain changes in spectral band width and wavelength for simple chromophores in various solvents comparison with theoretical curves shows that the effect of heating chromophore solutions is mainly spectral broadening coupled with an almost negligible blue shift the apparently anomalous behavior of tryptophan and IMT in aqueous solvents where the main effect is a red shift on heating is traced to hydrogen bonding with water a MM in which IMT acts simultaneously as hdonor type i and hacceptor type ii and the later is the more temperature sensitive is successful in explaining all available data for a variety of solute derivatives and solvents ii the contribution of chromophores in the protein interior has been assessed using PVA films of differing water content there models simulate the rigidity and low thermal expansivity of the protein interior and confirm that buried chromophores contribute negligibly if at all to thermal difference spectra iii curvefitting procedures have been used for matching protein difference spectra over a wavelength range to those for mixtures of models rather than relying as hitherto on data measured at extrema
1550,linolenic acid c is the main endogenous unsaturated fatty acid of thylakoid membrane lipids and seems in its free form to exert significant effects on the structure and function of photosynthetic membranes in this investigation the effect of linolenic acid was studied at various ph values on the electron flow rate in isolated spinach chloroplasts and related to deltaph the proton pump and the ph of the inner thylakoid space phi the deltaph and phi were estimated from the extent of the fluorescence quenching of aminoacridine linolenic acid caused a shift approximately one unit of the ph optimum for electron flow toward acidity in the following systems a photosystems ii i from ho to nadp or to dichlorophenolindophenol coupled or noncoupled b PS ii from ho to dichlorophenolindophenol in the presence of dibromothymoquinone in photosystem i conditions PMS the deltaph of the control increased as a function of external pho with a maximum around ph when linolenic acid was added the deltaph dropped but its optimum was shifted toward more acidic pho the same phenomena were also observed in photosytems ii i from ho to ferricyanide and in PS ii conditions from ho to ferricyanide in the presence of DBMIB however the deltaph was smaller and the sensitivity of the proton gradient toward linolenic acid was eventually higher than for photosystem i electron flow activity the proton pump which might be considered as a measure of the internal buffering capacity of thylakoids was optimum at pho in the controls an addition of linolenic acid diminished the proton pump and shifted its optimum toward higher pho as a consequence phi increased when pho was raised at the optimal pho to phi were to additions of increasing concentrations of linolenic acid displaced the curves toward higher phi a decrease of pho was therefore required to maintain the phi in the range of for maximum electron flow in conclusion the electron flow activity seems to be delicately controlled by the proton pump beta deltaph phi and pho fatty acids damage the membrane integrity in such a way that the subtile equilibrium between the AF is disturbed
1551,plasma angiotensin ii was measured in the umbilical cord arterial andor A-V blood of babies delivered vaginally and in delivered by elective lower segment cesarean section angiotensin ii was also measured in the peripheral venous blood of of the mothers mean angiotensin ii levels at delivery were higher in the cord venous blood of infants born to hypertensive than to normotensive mothers cord A-V angiotensin ii C2 were always higher than those of the mother and there was a strongly positive relationship between maternal and fetal angiotensin ii the duration of the second stage of labor was found significantly to affect fetal angiotensin ii levels prolonged labor being associated with high levels when this was taken into account there was a highly significant positive relationship between the body weight of the infants and cord venous angiotensin ii levels there was an inverse relationship between cord venous ph and angiotensin ii C2 babies delivered by lower segment cesarean section had much lower angiotensin ii C2 than those delivered vaginally the levels were however twice as high as those in the nonpregnant adult
1552,slices of submaxillary gland were incubated in vitro in an enriched krebsringerbicarbonate medium gassed with o co at degrees c and the release of k into the medium was monitored after stimulation with alpha and beta adrenergic secretagogues under a variety of exp conditions k was released by the slice system after addition of norepinephrine EN or phenylephrine but not after addition of isoproterenol the extent of k release T3 norepinephrine depends on the dose of secretagogue and is higher when glucose adenine and inosine or all three substrates are absent from the medium the effect of norepinephrine on k PR is reversed by phentolamine but not by propranolol phentolamine also causes a fold shift to the right in the doseresponse curve to norepinephrine addition of ouabain to the incubation medium results in a higher extent of k PR and prevents the reversal caused by phentolamine the response to norepinephrine fails to occur when ca is absent from the medium either by chelation with ethylene glycol bis betaaminoethyl ethernntetraacetic acid or by beta from the krebsringer solution and shows gradations depending on the ca content of the medium by itself however ca does not induce k release from the slice system the following conclusions are derived from these observations the release of k ions from the submaxillary gland is mediated by alpha adrenergic receptors the net amount of k released is the result of two opposing and almost simultaneous mechanisms a passive extrusion and an active reuptake the active reuptake of k depends on the availability of SE and is mediated through the ouabainsensitive nak activated adenosine triphosphatase the reaction is critically dependent on the presence of ca in the incubation medium and probably involves an influx of ca upon stimulation with alpha adrenergic secretagogues
1553,the properties of fructosedisphosphatase in supernatant of homogenate of liver kidneys and adductor muscles of cattle were tested edta was found to activate the enzyme up to concentrations of mmol the ph optimum was in the presence of edta even lower concentrations of magnesium ions caused activation of the enzyme but an activating effect was obtained as well from relatively high mg concentrations fructosediphosphatase could by G1 also by mmol mn or co ions or mmol zn ions inhibitive action was obtained from cu cd pb and hg ions microsomal fractions of cattle liver and kidney caused high activity of glucosephosphatase but only low action was obtained be using microsomal fractions of mesenteric mucous membrane or BB mg ions basically failed to trigger activation and higher concentrations even caused inhibition the relatively high activity of both fructosediphosphatase and glucosephosphatase in kidney of cattle appeared to suggest an involvement of those enzymes in gluconeogenesis
1554,biopsy specimens of human gastric mucosa maintained in SC for days in the absence of serum released a collagendegrading enzyme into the medium the yield of active enzyme reached a maximum after days and viable tissue capable of protein synthesis was essential for its production at degrees c the enzyme attacked undenatured collagen in solution resulting in a loss of specific viscosity and producing the two products tca and tcb characteristic of neutralcollagenase action electron microscopy of segmentlongspacing crystallites of these reaction products showed the exact cleavage locus of the collagen molecules to be between bands and i the larger tca and smaller tcb products were fragments representing and respectively of the length of the collagen molecule optimal CEA was observed over the ph range and a molwt of approx was derived from gelfiltration studies the enzyme was shown to be inhibited by the human SS proteins alphamacroglobulin and a smaller component of molwt approx alphaantitrypsin was not inhibitory edta phenanthroline cysteine and dithiothreitol all inhibited collagenase activity the gastric enzyme has properties similar to other well characterized collagenases but differences exist with respect to its molecular size and the site of attack on the collagen molecule
1555,to examine the regulation of OD of end organ innervation the SCG scg and two of its target organs the iris and pineal gland were studied using biochemical and histofluorescent approaches during postnatal ontogeny the activity of IMT hydroxylase toh which is localized to adrenergic neurons increased fold in iris and fold in pineal nerve terminals of the rat these increases paralleled the in vitro rise in iris hnorepinephrine hne uptake a measure of the presence of functional nerve terminal membrane these biochemical indices of end organ innervation correlated well with developmental increases in density of innervation adrenergic ground plexus ramification and nerve fiber FI as determined by fluorescence microscopy unilateral transection of the presynaptic cholinergic nerves innervating the scg in dayold rats prevented the normal development of end organ innervation toh activity hne uptake innervation density plexus ramification and fluorescence intensity failed to develop normally in irides innervated by decentralized ganglia it is concluded that transsynaptic factors regulate the maturation of adrenergic nerve terminals and the OD of end organ innervation by scg
1556,because of increasing evidence for the heterogeneity of polypeptide hormones studies of the molecular species of human placental lactogen hpl were initiated when extracts of freshly delivered human placentas were passed over sephadex g in m ammonium carbonate three immunoreactive peaks were detected in addition to a peak corresponding to native hpl kav and one in the void volume a consistent peak which eluted before hpl kav was present the latter represented of total hormonal activity and could be rerun without significant conversion to hpl in m urea the peak continued to behave as a C1 molecular weight form on both sephadex chromatography and on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis extraction procedures at both neutral and ALP ph produced similar quantities of the larger material iiodohpl was not converted to the larger form by the conditions of extraction or analysis these properties are consistent with a larger molecular weight nonaggregated form of hpl in comparison with the native hormone the idsplacement curves for the larger form were parallel in radioimmunoassay studies sera obtained from pregnant women during various stages of gestation also showed consistent evidence for a large molecular weight form of the hormone these observations provide direct evidence both in placental tissue and in serum for big hpl
1557,Bs p capable of producing extracellular maltase was isolated from soil maximum enzyme production was obtained on a medium containing methylalphadglucose phytone and yeast extract T3 the removal of cells extracellular maltase was precipitated by ammonium sulfate saturation the enzyme was purified by using the following procedures sephadex g column chromatography diethylaminoethylsephadex a ionexchange column chromatography and a second sephadex g column chromatography a highly purified maltase without amylase or proteinase MICs was obtained some properties of the extracellular maltase were determined optimum ph optimum temperature c when the incubation time was min ph stability within to heat stability stable up to c isoelectric point ph by gelisoelectric focusing molecular weight by gel filtration with sephadex g substrate specificity the relative rates of hydrolysis of maltose maltotriose isomaltose and maltotetraose were respectively and there was no activity toward alkyl or arylalphadglucosides amylose or other higher polymers transglucosylase activity was present gl and trishydroxymethylaminomethane were competitive inhibitors with ki values of and mm respectively cysteine was a MK-801 inhibitor michaelis constants were mm for maltose mm for maltoriose and mm for isomaltose a plot of pkm log km versus ph revealed two deflection points one each at and these probably corresponded to an imidazole group of a histidine residue in or near the AS center this assumption was supported by the strong inhibition of CEA by RB
1558,the classical kornbergerpricer procedure for purification of potato nucleotide pyrophosphatase ec has been modified to yield a preparation purified fold in addition to the known activity against pyrophosphate linkages in pyrophosphates located at the oh of nucleosides and phosphodiester linkages in aryl esters of nucleosidephosphates the enzyme has now been shown to catalyze the cleavage of a aryl esters of nucleosidephosphates and orthophosphates b nucleotide pyrophosphate linkages of the type pp and c pmg from mgpppgmterminated fragments of viral mrna MICs against aryl esters of nucleoside and phosphates and nad were shown to be due to the same protein by three criteria a constant ratio of activities during purification and gel PACE b identical chromatographic properties in various systems and c similarities in phdependence heat inactivation and the effects of cations and other substances since potato nucleotide pyrophosphatase does not exhibit exonuclease or phosphatase activities against natural substrates for the latter enzymes but does cleave synthetic aryl esters of nucleotide and phosphates and of orthophosphate it follows that these substrates are not suitable for detection of such activities in higher plants
1559,interferon preparations of a high degree of purity were obtained by a onestep procedure using affinity chromatography on specifically purified immunoadsorbent the procedure consisted of binding interferon harvested from serumfree medium and purified by znacetate precipitation and spsephadex chromatography to cnbractivated sepharose b column no in the next step antiinterferon AHG was purified by AC on column no with the bound interferon in this way antibodies against purified interferon which were free from nonantibody components were obtained the purified antibodies were then coupled to cnbractivated sepharose b forming column no the latter had a binding capacity of mouse interferon units per ml of gel this capacity was not altered during an month period of use the gel was capable to bind interferons obtained from fibroblasts and leukocytes and partially from serum the resulting purified products were similar ie they were not influenced by volume interferon activity or purity of the starting material the electrophoretic profiles of the products had a similar shape irrespective of the origin of the starting material
1560,the pathogenesis of shock lung as well as the success of therapy in this condition was studied in cases of extrathoracic trauma the water hemoglobin and dna contents of the lungs were measured in order to determine the extent of edema the rate of perfusion and proliferation the cases were divided into two groups according to whether they had or had not received medical therapy before death the data from these two groups were compared using statistical methods in which time of survival was especially taken into account the fluid balance po pco CVP ph of the SS TSP and serum creatinine were also studied in these cases results of the T0 are as follows three phases of the posttraumatic syndrome of shocklung could be distinguished phase i initial phase blood perfusion is increased edema is beginning to form and medical treatment has not yet begun phase ii early phase sydrome of early respiratory failure pulmonary edema is developing rapidly while perfusion is decreasing phase iii late phase syndrome of late respiratory failure proliferative changes predominante and the edema is still increasing the mean weight of the lungs was g s in phase i g s in phase ii and g s in phase iii the survival times correlated significantly and positively with the amount of water and dns in the lungs and significantly and negatively to the amount of hemoglobin in the lungs thus increasing pulmonary edema and increasing proliferative changes occurred with decreasing pulmonary perfusion this rho was even noted in groups of patients who had not received medical treatment and whose survival times were short in treated cases the fluid balance was significantly and negatively correlated to the total SS protein
1561,in order to detect minimal amounts of clostridium botulinum toxins in animal tissue or food specimens it is necessary to use an SE method which results in concentration of the botulinal toxins in the present examinations artificially contaminated canned beans were used to develop a suitable procedure for extraction and concentration of botulinal toxins ae the procedure consisted of steps canned beans were diluted with m PB ph the diluted material was homogenised with an ultraturrax homogeniser for sec the monogenised material was centrifuged at rpm for min ml of supernatant was concentrated using a millipore ultrafiltration chamber with a membrane capable of excluding all material with a molecular weight above a pressure of atmospheres was applied until the terminal volume was ml following SE and concentration the samples were assayed for botulinal toxin in mice using this CA the concentration of the five toxins were shown to be as follows type a toxin fold toxin concentration type b toxin fold toxin concentration type c toxin fold toxin concentration type d toxin fold toxin concentration type e toxin fold toxin concentration
1562,the effect of three different doses of cmethadone and mgkg on the biliary excretion of methadone metabolites was studied in the rat C2 of the and mgkg doses of cmethadone there was no difference in the percentage of po c excreted into bile with time however after the mgkg dose a significant increase was observed in the percentage of po c excreted into bile analysis of bile samples showed that this increase was due to increases in the biliary excretion of two of the major metabolites of methadone several mechanisms could be responsible for this disproportionate increase in biliary excretion of MTD metabolites after high doses of methadone it was found that the effect of high methadone dose on the biliary excretion of its metabolites was nearly eliminated when studied in phenobarbital pbpretreated rats pretreatment of rats with pb increases the biliary excretion of MTD metabolites primarily by increasing rates of methadone metabolism the lack of additivity of the effect of the high dose of MTD and pb i.c.v. on the biliary excretion of MTD metabolites suggests that a high dose of methadone also stimulates MTD metabolism which results in the observed increased percentage of the administered dose excreted into bile
1563,amoebic dysentery appears to be rare in the northeast of tanzania hepatic amoebiasis on the other hand is apparently widespread since at least cases are seen every year at the kilimanjaro christian medical centre this incidence of cases enabled us to carry out trials on the spot with a new imidazole derivative tinidazole formerly the difficult diagnosis based on clinical symptoms had to be buttressed by radiological evidence and possibly by the result of puncture indirect fluorescent antibody tests for the diagnosis of amoebiasis were performed elsewhere on all the patients using for this purpose microspecimens of dried blood in cases out of an agglutination test with sensitized latex particles was performed on the spot this latter test has the practical advantage of being easy to employ it cannot however be considered as a screening test since it is subject to downward and upward errors the IFA has been found to be constantly and highly positive certain antibody titres attaining this fully confirms the value of the method even under special working conditions seventeen of our patients women and men ranging in age from to years were treated with g of TNZ per day in a single dose for to consecutive days puncture to evacuate pus was also performed where abscesses had collected tolerance on the whole was good without a single sign of cardiovascular or urinary toxicity however paraesthesia of the hands was observed in one case transitory thrombocytopenia in one other patient and increased alkaline phosphatases minor disorders were also observed in our series of patients mild vertigo cases HA cases and dry mouth cases after months the therapeutic results were as follows complete cures out of improvements with final cure probable partial failures necessitating supplementary treatment with metronidazole g per day for days these preliminary trials appear to the encouraging and the study is being continued with series compared with cases treated with emetine or metronidazole
1564,it has previously been shown that rat rnapeptidyl complexes are found in close association with trna but can be separated from the bulk of the trna by benzoylated diethylaminoethylcellulose chromatography kull fj and soodak m biochim biophys acta l gadski ra and kull fj biochemistry these studies also showed that under aminoacylation conditions the complex fractions were able to act as acceptors for certain amino acids and that the formation of porcine thyroid tyrosylcomplex ii was particularly high because of this high acceptor CF and because of the importance of tyrosine to thyroid metabolism further studies were conducted comparing some of the properties of porcine thyroid tyrosylcomplex ii with those of porcine thyroid tyrosyltrna porcine thyroid tyrosyltrna synthetase was purified in excess of fold and characterized it was found that maximal aminoacylation was achieved at ph in the presence of mm kcl the km for IMT was determined to be x m the purified thyroid tyrosyltrna synthetase was used under aminoacylation conditions to prepare radioactively labeled porcine thyroid tyrosyltrna and tyrosylcomplex ii comparisons made using reversedphase column chromatography rpc showed distinct differences between the two aminoacylated species and revealed in addition a number of isoaccepting forms of tyrosine trna tyrosylcomplex ii was also found to differ from tyrosyltrna in that it is more SD to deacylation at ph and at ph and to Kd by ribonuclease a in addition tyrosylcomplex ii unlike tyrosyltrna is degraded by TR ribosomal binding studies showed that tyrosylcomplex ii did not respond to the codons for tyrosine upapu and upapc whereas tyrosyltrna responded to both it is suggested that thyroid tyrosine complex ii is representative of a group of related complexes that constitute the complex ii fraction and that although the complexes resemble trna in many respects they have distinctly different characteristics than conventional trna
1565,in energy transducing systems the direction of energy transfer is proposed to be maintained by the synchronized turnovers of the conformational change of one protein coupling up to affect another catalysis by those systems implies therefore that under new space restrictions the groups of the transducing enzyme increase and decrease reactivity between themselves with activatory andor inhibitory ligands h ho metals etc and with the electron shells of the reactant molecules the exergonic reactiondependent turnover of the forms of the enzyme within the transition complexes would be maintained therefore under asymmetric phase angles of conformationaldependent CR that would effectively restrict the microscopic reversibility of transducing systems some well known reactions such as hemoglobins bohr effect can be used to illustrate that microscopic molecular interactions subject to thermodynamic equilibria laws may similarly paricipate as driving forces in energy transducing sytems this would allow the thermodynamic description of the role of proton translocation as that of a modificatory force of the structural parameters of proteins similarly the relationship between the liganded states of hemoglobin and its change in conformation has been used to develop an illustrative model relating changes in oxidoreduction of electron carriers to inducedfit effects leading to a sequence of atpase forms in transition complexes which become stabilized as high energy intermediates under the constraints imposed by the membrane of SE transducing organelles
1566,gastric acid output bloodglucose serumgastrin and psychomotorperformance were measured in four healthy subjects one hour before and two hours after the intravenous injection of a ml saline b ukg bw insulin c mgkg bw bromazepam each subject underwent one experiment of each type the study was layed out as a latinsquare and analysed accordingly gastric acid secretion was measured by means of intragastric titration and a telemetering capsule bloodglucose and serumgastrin levels as well as psychomotor performance as a measure of vigilance were determined in minuteintervals in the saline series a none of the four parameters showed any systematic R2 in series b a bimodal response of acid output to insulin initial inhibition and subsequent stimulation was observed in all subjects serumgastrin C2 showed only a slight and transient increase in the first thirty minutes psychomotor performance decreased markedly with progressing hypoglycemia and increased when gl levels rose again in the bromazepan series c acid output and psychomotor performance decreased and T3 the first hour increased almost parallely while glucose and gastrin levels remained unchanged in series d an additive effect of insulin and bromazepam occurred acid output and psychomotor performance were lower than after insulin alone peak acid secretion maximal hypoglycemia and peak of serumgastrin were shifted to the right it is concluded that the lowered basal as well as insulinstimulated acid secretion after bromazepam is due to the CE effect of the drug and that this effect is mediated to the gastric glands directly via autonomic nervous pathways without involving a release of endogenous gastrin
1567,mycobacterial GIF mycoif found in supernatant fluids of mouse spleen cell cultures that have been stimulated in vitro with homologous antigen inhibited the intracellular multiplication of virulent tubercle bacilli within normal mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro antigenically stimulated hraimmunized mouse SP cells required h of incubation to produce supernatant fluids that would cause intracellular inhibition supernatant fluids from h mouse spleen cell cultures were not able to produce intracellular inhibition investigation of the SC conditions showed that at lease human serum was required in the TC medium for the production of mycoif by spleen cells from immunized mice mycoif activity was noted only in supernatant fluids from SP cell cultures incubated with antigen for h mycoif was nondialyzable and unaffected by freezing lyophilization or incubation at c for min however mycoif was inactivated after incubation at c for min mycoif was unaffected by low hydrogen ion concentrations ph to but SE to higher hydrogen ion concentrations ph ph significantly decrease mycoif activity and exposure to ph to abolished all activity supernatant fluids diluted were still able to produce significant intracellular inhibition of growth of virulent tubercle bacilli
1568,factors regulating the PR of alanine and glutamine in vivo were investigated in starved rats by removing the liver from the circulation and monitoring blood metabolite changes for min alanine and glutamine were the predominant amino acids released into the circulation in this preparation dichloroacetate an activator of pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibited net alanine release it also interfered with the metabolism of the branchedchain amino acids valine leucine and isoleucine lcycloserine an inhibitor of alanine aminotransferase decreased alanine accumulation by T3 functional hepatectomy whereas methionine sulphoximine an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase decreased glutamine accumulation by the same amount it was concluded that a the alanine aminotransferase and the glutamine synthetase pathways respectively were responsible for of the alanine and glutamine released into the circulation by the extrasplanchnic tissues and extrahepatic proteolysis could account for a maximum of b alanine formation by the peripheral tissues was dependent on availability of pyruvate and not of glu c glutamate availability could influence glutamine formation subject possibly to renal control
1569,a polyoxypropylenepolyoxyethylene block copolymer of about daltons poloxamer pluronic f used in a new protein fractionation procedure may be infused into patients receiving therapeutic plasma fractions we studied the disposition and pharmacokinetics of poloxamer in rats as an initial step towards understanding its SMB in man after iv administration in rats about of or mgkg doses of ethyleneclabeled polymer was excreted in the urine in days about of the label appeared in feces EA CM were not permeable to the CP and only the parent compound was demonstrable in urine twenty hours T3 dosing small residues were detectable only in the kidney CL small intestine and carcass the third phase of the plasma disappearance DP was evident only at the larger dose but plasma disappearance kinetics were independent of the dose in the range used here thus most of poloxamer was eliminated rapidly in rats by renal excretion and a smaller portion probably was removed by biliary excretion these results will be applied to continuing studies of poloxamer disposition in man
1570,an automated autoanalyzer method using dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid is described for determining whole blood glutathione reductase bgr activity and for measuring in vitro activation of bgr with FAD fad bgr activity is expressed as mumoles glutathione regenerated from oxidized glutathione per ml of whole blood wb or per g of hemoglobin the stimulatory effect of fad on bgr activity divided by the activity without fad determined the AC ac we found that nadph and oxidized glutathione assay concentrations of mmoleliter and mmoleliter respectively in moleliter phosphate buffer ph gave consistent results when wb before assay was diluted fold wb samples to be stored are initially diluted fold with distilled water and frozen prior to CA two aliquots of the sample are diluted fold one aliquot with distilled water and another with mumoleliter fad with sample and manifold dilutions the assay fad concentrations is mumoleliter assay concentrations greater than mumole fadliter were shown to be GABA we examined blood samples from children in the age range to months and determined the normal ac range to be between and six weaned rats days of age maintained on a riboflavindeficient diet showed a mean ac of and at and days of age respectively six control rats maintained an ac of sd during the same period
1571,a study was made of the quantitative content in the intestine of c perfringens strains in healthy persons who stayed in a hermetically sealed space for month and for year c perfingens strains were isolated from the fecal samples of each of the volunteers at various periods of the trial a total of strains of c perfringens of type a with anticellular sera obtained to the strains of various serological CG were studied serological properties of c perfringens strains of type a present in the intestinal contents of man were nonhomogeneous this pointed to the simultaneous presence in the intestine of strains belonging to several serological types a partial or complete replacement of one strain by another differing by serological properties occurred in the course of not over one month c perfringens strains of type a present in the intestine of each volunteer were subdivided into serological types individual for each of the persons under observation this pointed to the fact than no interexchange of strains of the mentioned bacteria occurred between different persons in the hermetically sealed space
1572,the effect of the concentration of red cell diphosphoglycerate dpg mumolesg cells on the buffering properties and on the slope of the relation between the extracellular and intracellular ph deltaphideltaphe of human blood was studied the results were evaluated in connection with previous findings concerning the effect of dpg on the donnan ratio rh hehi deltaphideltaphe decreases with rising red cell dpg content as well as with rising extracellular ph deltaphideltaphe and rh can be related to each other by the empirical equation deltaphideltaphe log rh phi phe the validity of this equation appears to be restricted to conditions where the donnan ratio rh is altered between and either by changes of the red cell concentration of buffering anions such as dpg or by changes of the extracellular ph as determined in suspensions of CRC with intact membranes the dpgand phinduced changes of deltaphideltaphe lead to proportional changes in the buffering SP of the nonbicarbonate buffers of erythrocytes due to this effect the beta of suspensions of cells containing times the normal concentration of the buffer dpg is lower than that of cells with normal dpg content at extracellular ph values above these findings demonstrate that the action of intracellular nonbicarbonate buffers in blood is effectively modulated by the physicochemical properties of the red cell membrane
1573,the thermostability and proteolytic inactivation of rat CL submitochondrial particle transhydrogenase was studied in the presence of pyridine dinucleotide substrates and a variety of divalent metal and nucleotide inhibitors relative to the unliganded enzyme the nadphenzyme complex was more thermostable and showed a twofold greater rate of tryptic inactivation while the nadpenzyme complex was more thermolabile and only slightly more susceptible to tryptic inactivation neither nad nor nadh significantly affected thermostability or proteolysis similar effects of these ligands were observed for the nonenergylinked and energylinked transhydrogenase reactions indicating that both activities are catalyzed by the same enzyme in thermal experiments acetylcoa amp and nmnh stabilized palmitoylcoalabilized and dephosphocoa coa nmn and amp had little effect on enzyme stability tryptic inactivation was inhibited by amp and nmn but was not influenced by the other nucleotide inhibitors divalent metal ion inhibitors mg ca mn ba and sr stabilized transhydrogenase against thermal inactivation and promoted tryptic inactivation
1574,the behaviour of gammaglutamyl transpeptidase was compared with other serum enzyme activities and PET parameters in a carefully selected and relatively extensive series of patients with liver disease including alcoholics in an investigation of the underlying pathogenesis and its clinical expression REF to the literature and to personal data showed that increased gammaglutamyl transpeptidase levels could be attributed to enzyme induction caused by drugs or alcohol liver damage in the broad sense and intra or extrahepatic cholestasis these causes were individually predominant or nearly so on occasions though their concomitance was more common high C2 however were not pathognomonic for a given disease in alcoholism they were highly indicative especially if accompanied by gld changes they were a virtually constant early and typical finding in intra and extrahepatic cholestasis and tended to persist for a time after the resolution of icterus lastly they were an aid in the early diagnosis of aggressive hepatitis and liver cancer
1575,lasparagine synthetase appears in serum approximately days after the sc implantation of x cells of leukemia yar resistant to lasparaginase and increases in activity as the neoplasm grows and metastasizes the principal source of the enzyme is the primary RT after intravranial inoculation of tumor the rate of leakage of the enzyme is more pronounced than when the subcutaneous intramuscular or intraperitoneal routes are used chloroethylcyclohexylnitrosourea nsc a nitrosourea effective in the palliation of lyar temporarily halts the influx of enzyme into the blood stream as does surgical excision of the sc tumor nodules treatment of mice with lasparaginase within hr of inoculation of the tumor markedly augments both RT growth and the rate of penetration of lasparagine synthetase into the circulation several other lasparagine synthetase into the circulation several other lasparaginaseresistant tumors also were found to spill lasparagine synthetase into the serum but the rho between this phenomenon and the specific activity of the enzyme in homogenates of the RT was imperfect
1576,the red azotyrzn complex of arnilazocarboxypeptidase previously used to demonstrate differences in conformation of the enzyme in crystals and in solution has now provided means to detect multiple conformations of the enzyme in solution by stoppedflow ph and temperature jump experiments these studies identify two distinct processes er h in equilibrium ey i is the extremely rapid kfast about sec ph dependent dissociation of the metal complex ey in equilibrium ey ii is much slower kslow about sec ph independent interconversion of two distinct populations of protein molecules ey and ey in which the yellow azotyr is different conformations these two conformations can be differentiated readily by stoppedflow phjump experiments since i is three to four orders of magnitude faster than ii mathematical expressions derived from this mechanism accurately predict all observations over the ph range from to in a previous stoppedflow phjump experiment lipcomb and coworkers quiocho f a mcmurray c h lipcomb w h proc nat acad sci usa recognized only a single process with a rate constant of about sec but not the major very rapid rate observed here the failure to detect this fast process led to the postulation of a number of explanations intended to account for the detection of only a single slow rate the present observations show that the premise for those conjectures is not valid the azoprobe reveals the existence of rapidly interconvertible substructures of CP a and the results support the view that in solution enzymes can adopt multiple readily interconvertible and related conformations which could then either facilitate or impede catalysis in crystals rearrangement of molecular structure could be severely impaired or restricted and crystallization might single out either active or inactive conformations in the latter case such crystals would have greatly reduced activities and markedly altered catalytic behavior as is observed for CP a in combination with detailed kinetic analysis of crystals conformational analysis in solution should be a valuable guide to discern enzyme mechanisms and select crystals for xray structure analysis
1577,the effect of ndesmethyldiazepam nordiazepam and mg and potassium clorazepate mg a precursor of ND on sleep was studied in six healthy AD males electroencephalography eeg was used for sleep measures and analogue scales were used for subjective assessments of wellbeing and sleep SQ effects on total sleep time were limited to the night of ingestion there were increases with nordiazepam and mg p and respectively and with clorazepate mg p sleep onset latencies were shortened particularly with nordiazepam and awakening to stage activity was reduced by both drugs the RL to stage was reduced by ND and mg p there were no effects of ND mg on the duration min of sleep stages nordiazepam mg and clorazepate mg reduced the duration of stage and stage and there were increases in stage reduced stage and increased stage sleep were observed during the recovery night no effects were observed with stage but there was evidence that stage activity was depressed on the recovery night only no effects were observed on rem sleep except that the appearnace of the first rem period was delayed with clorazepate mg p the effect of nordiazepam mg and clorazepate mg were comparable and each modified sleep for about h after ingestion with nordiazepam mg and clorazepate mg the subjects as a group reported improved sleep but subjective assessments of wellbeing were not altered correlations were calculated for sleep measures and subjective assessments
1578,fiftysix IDDM and their infants were studied prospectively from birth twentyone of idm had serum mg less than or equal to mgdl on at least one occasion during the first days SS mg in these hypomagnesemic infants did not demonstrate the normal increase with postnatal age that was present in normomagnesemic infants decreased neonatal serum mg was related to increased severity of maternal diabetes young mothers mothers for lower gravidity and prematurity decreased serum mg alone or with decreased ionized or total ca did not correlate with neuromuscular irritability in the infants decreased serum mg in idm was associated with decreased MS mg decreased neonatal ionized and total ca increased SS p and decreased parathyroid function serum mg was not related to dietary p intake or urinary ca or p excretion thus transitory neonatal hypomagnesemia occurs in idm it is speculated that factors causing hm might include maternal hm or neonatal hyperphosphatemia and that the hm is related to the hypocalcemia and functional hypoparathyroidism of idm
1579,hela cells contain a high mw form of dna ligase which can be completely converted to a low mw form Rs frictional ratio sedimentation coefficient molecular weight ph dependence and heat inactivation rate of the two forms have been studied the L1 properties of the two forms of dna ligase in hela cells in particular molecular weights and ph dependence resemble those of the dimer and monomer structures described in cultured human cells pedrali g spadari s ciarrocchi g pedrini m falaschi a eur j biochem in synchronized hela cells the dna ligase shows a two fold increase during s phase and parallels the increase in the dna synthesis rate dna ligase increases in parallel with viral dna synthesis after infection of hela cells with vaccinia and herpes virus but its cofactor requirements and PCS properties including the dimer leads to monomer conversion are unchanged suggesting that the newly formed ligase is not viruscoded
1580,the bohr effect of hemoglobin and that of the aquomet and cyanomet valency hybrids was measured in the presence and the absence of ihp inositol hexaphosphate and dpg diphosphoglycerate in the absence of these organic phosphates the four hybrids show similar but suppressed bohr effects as compared to hemoglobin addition of ihp and dpg results in all cases in an increase of the bohr effect the additional phosphate induced bohr effect of the hybrids with the alpha chain in the oxidized form is almost MZ to that of hemoglobin while this effect of the hybrids with oxidized beta chains is slighly lower than that of hemoglobin the results suggest a that the bohr effect is correlated to the ligation state of the hemoglobin molecule rather than to its quaternary structure b that the additional phosphate induced bohr effect is related to the change in quaternary structure of the tetramer and c that with respect to the bohr effect of the hybrids there is no difference between high and low spin species
1581,following the demonstration of peptidases in the rat hypothalamus which inactivate thyrotrophinreleasing hormone trh a CS and specific radioimmunoassay for the releasing hormone was used to investigate the presence of similar peptidases in the rabbit hypothalamus trh was found to be rapidly inactivated by supernatant and particulate hypothalamic fractions with higher peptidase activity in the supernatant than in the particulate fraction an optimum ph of within physiological limits was obtained for the enzymes in both the fractions examined the results obtained confirm that the rb hypothalamus contains enzymes capable of inactivating trh and since it has been found that such peptidases interfere with studies on trh biosynthesis it is possible that the peptidases may play a part in controlling the releasing hormones production the specificity of the antiserum used in the radioimmunoassay has also suggested that the peptidases may cleave the cterminalpronhnh or both from the trh molecule to cause inactivation
1582,the simple architecture of the amphibian lung makes it possible to study the movement of substances across a barrier with permeability and bioelectric properties that are dominated by the alveolar epithelium when mounted as a planar sheet between identical ringer solutions the excised lung of the bullfrog exhibited a transmural electrical potential difference of nearly mv pleural surface positive and a resistance of about omega cm unidirectional fluxes of cl br i and scn across the shortcircuited lung were asymmetrical the net cl flow from pleura to lumen matched the shortcircuit current T3 h of voltage clamping followed the kinetics of a saturable process and was reduced by inhibitors of oxidative metabolism these results suggest that halide and certain pseudohalide anions are secreted by the frog alveolar epithelium fluxes of na k ca hco tco so paminohippurate gluconate dinitrophenolate and water were compatible with passive DWI of the probe molecules across the barrier measurements of lung oxygen consumption ion fluxes and bioelectric properties have helped to pinpoint possible CS and modes of action of airborne agents such as heavy metals sulphates and nitrates that may damage the rat pulmonary barrier
1583,postmortem brain material from control and parkinsons disease patients was examined to elucidate further the neurochemistry of this disease and to determine the mechanism of action of ldopa as a therapeutic agent the MICs of laromatic amino acid decarboxylase dopa d tyrosine hydroxylase monoamine oxidase and catecholomethyl GOT were examined in addition the tissue levels of dopa omethyldopa dopamine da and homovanillic acid hva were determined in the nondopatreated PP the greatest decreases were detected for striatal da and dopa d with homovanillic acid and tyrosine hydroxylase levels showing a lesser change the activities of MAO-A and catecholomethyl GOT in the striatal nuclei were not different from the controls the putamen was consistently the most severely affected region dopa and omethyldopa were detectable in all brain areas only in those patients treated with ldopa shortly before death the mean concentrations of da in the striatum of these patients were to times higher than those in nondopatreated patients related to the time before death of the last dose of ldopa and greater in the striatum of patients clinically classified as good responders as compared to poor NR although ldopa therapy increased homovanillic acid levels in all brain areas a preferential increase was observed in the striatum it was concluded that ldopas principal therapeutic effects in parkinsons disease are consistent with its transformation to da in the striatum
1584,an autoregulatory system of insulin Kd in the liver in which the rate of insulin metabolism changes in response to fluctuation in its blood C2 was investigated in the plasma of rats and man in the absence of reduced glutathione gsh insulin degradation was not observed but when a sufficient amount of reduced glutathione was added the plasma did degrade insulin this gshdependent insulin degrading activity in plasma was quite similar to that in liver in its nature in rats this gshdependent insulin degrading activity in the liver and plasma was fluctuated in response to fluctuation in the blood insulin C2 and the gshdependent insulin degrading activity in plasma was well correlated with that in the liver similarly in man the gshdependent insulin degrading activity in plasma was changed in response to fluctuation in the blood insulin C2 in plasma under the physiologic conditions there is an insufficient amount of reduced glutathione to elicit the insulin degrading activity but in the liver there is a sufficient amount of reduced glutathione to manifest this activity this evidence further supports the concept that an autoregulatory system of insulin degradation in the CL exists in man
1585,the actual mechanism of tocolytic effect of betamimetics is not yet known while they are able to stop labour the effect in vitro on myometral filaments is very different in contrast to this the socalled ca antagonists have an excellent relaxing effect on myometrium in vitro but they are clinically ineffective to clear up the mechanism of tocolysis the uterine activity under tocolytic therapy was observed by external tocography whereas in normal pregnancy the portion of braxtonhickscontractions and phases of inactivityequivalent to the intervals of labour increases and the portion of alvarez waves decreases under tocolysis these changes are not to be found for a long time the portion of braxtonhickscontractions and phases of inactivity together is smaller than in normal pregnancy the proportion of braxtonhickscontractions to phases of inactivity corresponds well to NP the changes of uterine activity in normal pregnancy are explained as a process of increasing coordination the tocolytic effect is regarded as a disturbance of this process
1586,the respiratory properties of rainbowtrout blood were investigated in acidstressed fish in the G1 acid was introduced into the bloodstream and in the second the carbon dioxide content of the ambient water was increased initially the introduction of acid to the blood caused a decrease in blood ph and bicarbonate and increases in oxygen uptake and ventilation volume after h these values had returned to the control C2 trout subjected to high ambient co about mmhg showed a decrease in blood ph while pco and bicarbonate increased after h the trout began to show signs of compensation to the acidosis in each experiment the blood po was little changed but blood o content was decreased and tended not to resume the control value even after several hours the results are discussed in terms of the various acidbase mechanisms thought to be available to the fish these include branchial ion exchanges and the possible buffering roles of the extracellular and intracellular fluids
1587,an endogalactosaminidase has been purified fold from the CF of streptomyces griseus this enzyme cleaves galngaln linkages in oligogalactosaminoglycan a galactosaminerich oligosaccharide isolated from the culture filtrate of a neurospora mutant since some or all of the galngaln bonds in this molecule link positions and and are in the alphaconfiguration we are probably dealing with an endoalpha leads to galactosaminidase bu this characterization is only tentative because the few bonds cleaved by the enzyme could have a different structure the enzyme is inactive towards nacetyloligogalactosaminoglycan and chitosan the endogalactosaminidase preparations also cleave high molecular weight galactosaminoglycan obtained from neurospora into fragments greater than or equal to daltons in molecular weight and catalyze the release of neurospora sporelings from the glass surfaces to which they are anchored galactosaminoglycancleaving and sporelingreleasing MICs elute jointly from deaecellulose columns this observation provides further support for an earlier proposal that the sporelings are anchored to the glass by means of galactosaminoglycan molecules
1588,the final step in the biosynthesis of testosterone is the reduction of androstenedione which is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme ketosteroid reductase evidence is presented which suggests that there are two distinct ketosteroid reductases in rat testes one in interstitial tissue and one in ST the two enzymes have different ph optima for the one from interstitial tissue and for the one from ST at the optimum ph a fold difference in km values was observed mum for the interstitial tissue enzyme and mum for the enzyme from ST testosterone and metabolites of testosterone have very different effects of each of these enzyme MICs the interstitial tissue enzyme activity is inhibited by testosterone and several alphareduced metabolites of testosterone and by Es the most potent inhibitor of the steroids investigated was alphaandrostanealpha betadiol followed by betaestradiol approximately equal to dihydrotestosterone greater than testosterone greater than estrone greater than estriol alphaandrostanealpha betadiol and betaestradiol were shown to act by competitive inhibition with apparent ki values of and mum respectively in contrast it was demonstrated that among the above steroids only dihydrotestosterone inhibits the ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules and this inhibition was only observed at very high concentrations of inhibitor testosterone stimulated the ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules alphaandrostanealpha betadiol at low concentrations stimulated the enzyme activity from seminiferous tubules while it had no effect at high concentrations the remainder of the steroids tested had no effect on the ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules the difference in response of the two enzyme activities suggests a mechanism for local regulation of testosterone synthesis in each testicular compartment that does not involve directly pituitary gonadotropins
1589,some properties of cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase csd activity were studied in the pellet and supernatant of a x g centrifugation of isotonic sucrose rat brain homogenates about of the enzyme activity was found associated to the particulate fraction and of the activity remained particle bound after hypoosmotic shock of the x g pellet the activity of the x g supernatant showed a lower dependence on exogenous pyridoxal phosphate plp than the activity in the particulate fraction the csd activity of these fractions also differed in optimal ph and in apparent kinetic constants the enzyme associated to particles showed the highest vmax and the lowest km the activity and kinetic characteristics of csd were studied during brain PN development in the newborn brain only a small amount of the enzyme activity was found associated to the x g pellet csd in brain homogenates of immature rats was less dependent on free plp and showed a higher km and a lower vmax as compared with the enzyme in the adult brain between birth and adulthood the CEA increased more than fold in the particulate fraction and fold in the soluble fraction it is concluded that the differences observed in csd activity between P0 and adult brain are due to an increase of the particulate form of the enzyme during postnatal development
1590,the purpose of this study was to clarify the means by which lithium induced a disorder of urine acidification rats infused with hydrochloric acid meqkg developed acute metabolic acidosis blood ph bicarbonate meqliter with a urine ph of approximately the addition of lithium chloride meqkg ip caused an increase in the urine ph and a further decrease in blood bicarbonate meqliter during bicarbonate loading lithium caused the urine pco to fall significantly urine minus blood pco decreased from to mm hg these changes were not seen following equimolar ip administration of sodium chloride similarly lithium administration depressed bicarbonate reabsorption by from to mueqml of gfr during alkali infusion while saline caused only a decrease to mueqml of gfr the combination of an increase in urine pco in alkaline urine indicates that lithium produced a defect in distal nephron hydrogen ion secretion the fall in bicarbonate reabsorption following lithium administration oculd be due to a mild hydrogen ion sec defect located in the PT tubule or a severe defect in the distal nephron
1591,camodiaquin accumulation by washed erythrocyte S9 was characterized to permit comparisons with chloroquine accumulation erythrocytes INF with plasmodium berghei cs chloroquinesusceptible accumulate amodiaquin by a saturable process that has an apparent dissociation constant for amodiaquin of x m and is competitively inhibited by chloroquine quinine and quinacrine as is the process of chloroquine accumulation within experimental error the k of x m estimated for chloroquine is the same regardless of whether the drug being accumulated is camodiaquin or cchloroquine likewise the k for amodiaquin is the same regardless of which drug is being accumulated in addition glucose stimulates and hydrogen ion cold or interruption of glycolysis inhibits amodiaquin as well as chloroquine accumulation these findings are evidence that a single process serves to accumulate both drugs in the absence of substrate erythrocytes infected with p berghei cr chloroquineresistant accumulate twice as much amodiaquin as chloroquine and they accumulate more amodiaquin than do erythrocytes INF with p berghei cs these differences occur because p berghei cr infects polychromatophilic erythrocytes possessing a highaffinity substrateindependent process of accumulation to which amodiaquin has greater access than chloroquine in the presence of gl amodiaquin accumulation by erythrocytes INF with p berghei cr when plotted as a CF of amodiaquin concentration in the medium describes a sigmoid curve
1592,the effects of divalent salts and dichlorophenyldimethylurea dcmu upon nicotinamide adenine CpG phosphate nadp reduction and p in isolated chloroplasts are described and compared with the influence of dcmu on oxygen evolution and p in intact cells most experiments were carried out with a steadystate relaxation spectrometer a kinetic mechanism for the estimation of p fluxes is proposed and experimentally tested good PA between theory and experiment was found concurrent measurements of p and nadp reduction revealed two antagonisms addition of divalent cations caused an increase in the yield of nadp reduction and a decrease in the yield of p conversely in the presence of mg low concentrations of dcmu decreased the yield of nadp reduction and increased the yield of p aging of the chloroplasts at degrees c exerted a similar effect with farred actinic light mg stimulated the yield of nadp reduction without affecting the flux also in the absence of mg dcmu inhibited both reactions although p required a higher herbicide concentration for fractional inhibition than nadp reduction in the presence of mg chloroplasts resembled intact algae in which a high rate of oxygen evolution was accompanied by little p turnover titration with dcmu decreased the rate of photosynthesis and increased p flux on the whole the data suggest that p relaxing in msec is not directly involved in linear electron transport
1593,electrostatic interactions at charged lipid membranes make a significant contribution to the free energy of the system and can be varied within a wide range by alteration either of the CM surface charge density or of the concentration of electrolytes in the surrounding medium changes in the charged membranes structure such as the ordered in equilibrium fluid phase transition can thus be induced at constant temperature by variations in ph and salt concentration an adequate quantitative description of these phenomena is obtained from the gouychapman theory the good PA between theory and experiment confirms that the expression derived for the electrostatic free SE especially in respect of its positive sign is correct the classical expression derived for the electrostatic free energy especially in respect of its positive sign is correct the classical expression for the free SE of the double layer derived by verwey and overbeek which has a negative sign is not applicable to lipid membranes with ionizable polar CG
1594,anesthetized dogs which had been prepared with lumboadrenal vein cannulae were intravenously infused with monoamine axidase alphaeta tryptophan hydroxylase pcpa or tyrosine hydroxylase alphamt inhibitors min prior to exposure to oxygen at ground level these studies were designed to ascertain the role of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine in the adrenocortical response to hypoxia in normoxic animals alphaeta decreased basal cortisol secretion and increased SP whereas pcpa and alphamt were essentially without afffect on these parameters all inhibitors prevented the rise in cortisol secretion usually observed in hypoxic dogs alpha eta appeared to inhibit the adrenocortical response to hypoxia as a result of its potent pressore activity while pcpa and alphamt inhibited cortisol secretion by interfering with the synthesis of serotonin and norepinephrine respictively these data suggest that substances which alter the content andor turnover of brain monoamines abolish the hypoxic rise in cortisol secretion and thus would lower the resistance of the animal to this stressor
1595,the ph dependence of the nuclear quadrupole interaction between the excited kev state in cd bound to the active site in human carbonic anhydrase b and the nearest protein surroundings has been studied by means of the nuclear spectroscopic technique of perturbed angular correlation of gamma rays the enzyme has been studied in the ph region at and degrees c the results show that the cd enzyme changes from one form at low ph to another form at high ph both at and degrees c the pk of the transition is at degrees c and close to at degrees c parallel to this transformation the esterase activity of the cd enzyme for the hydration of pnitrophenyl acetate exhibits a ph dependency with a ph of the sulfonamide inhibitor acetazolamide CR inhibits this activity of the cd enzyme the quadrupole interaction parameters for the cd enzyme are not significantly different at degrees c from those obtained at degrees c a measurement at degrees c ph shows however a form different from those at degrees c ph and degrees c ph the change in the quadrupole interaction with ph is in a simple MM consistent with an ionization of a metalbound water molecule
1596,hypolimnas bolina is a nymphalid butterfly having a west to east CSD from madagascar to easter island and a north to south one from japan to australasia it is highly migratory in some areas in much of the western part of its range the female is both monomorphic and a mimic of euploea further east it is frequently polymorphic with the majority of the forms being nonmimetic the polymorphism is sexlimited to the female and controlled by two unlinked loci one with two allelomorphs e and e determining the extent of the dark pigmentation the other with three allelomorphs p pn and p determining the presence and distribution of orangebrown only butterflies of the genotypes eepp and to a lesser extent eepp are satisfactory batesian mimics of their euploea models the details of the mimetic pattern are under multifactorial control following those of their local model as is much of the variation within the nonmimetic forms particularly with regard to the CSD of WG and blue scaling
1597,reduced coenzyme qcytochrome c reductase from bovine heart mitochondria complex iii was incorporated into phospholipid LDV by the cholate dialysis procedure soybean phospholipids or mixtures of purified phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin could be used oxidation of reduced coenzyme q by the reconstituted vesicles with cytochrome c as oxidant showed the following energycoupling phenomena protons were translocated outward with a coupling ratio he of measurements with mitochondria under similar conditions showed an he ratio of proton translocation was not seen in the presence of uncoupling agents and was in addition to the net acidification of the medium from the overall oxidation reaction potassium ions were taken up by the reconstituted vesicles in the presence of valinomycin in a reaction coupled to electron transfer the coupling ratio for k uptake ke was in the vesicles and approximately in mitochondria the rate of oxidation of reduced coenzyme q by the reconstituted LDV was stimulated up to fold by uncouplers or by valinomycin plus nigericin and k ions addition of valinomycin CT in a k medium caused a transient stimulation of electron transfer the results indicate that SE coupling can be observed with isolated reduced coenzyme qcytochrome c reductase if the enzyme complex is properly incorporated into a phospholipid vesicle
1598,hapten dnplys conjugates of two putatively nonimmunogenic polymers hyalutonic acid and polygammadglutamic acid induce significant primary igm antidnp responses in ch mice preparations of various immunogenic type pneumococcal polysaccharide siii levan e coli lipopolysaccharide and nonimmunogenic hyaluronic acid and polyglutamic acid polymers were tested for their ability to act as polyclonal mitogens in vitro in serumcontaining spleen cell cultures only lipopolysaccharide stimulated substantial cell proliferation in SF medium and using high specific activity hthymidine lipopolysaccharide levan siii and to a lesser degree hyaluronic acid induced significant thymidine incorporation however under the latter conditions cell survival and proliferation were much less impressive there was no apparent correlation between the capacity of various polymers to induce LP and their potency as carriers for the generation of a primary igm antidnp response furthermore while low doses of lipopolysaccharide elicited polyclonal antibody formation in vivo high doses of siii levan and hyaluronic acid did not these results indicate that t cellindependent b cell triggering is dependent on the polymeric nature of the antigen and that polymers need not be immunogenic or mitogenic to act as carriers for the induction of primary igm antihapten antibody responses
1599,cyclic nucleotide metabolism was investigated in growing kidneys of rats during compensatory hypertrophy and during neonatal development T3 unilateral nephrectomy a mild and shortlasting decrease in cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp was observed in the hypertrophying kidney in contrast cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp showed a sharp decline to of control at min and a rapid rise to above baseline at hr the alterations in renal tissue levels of cgmp were associated with parallel changes in the soluble x g supernatant guanylate cyclase activity gtp pyrophosphatelyase cyclizing ec no change was observed in total cgmp phosphodiesterase cyclicnucleotide nucleotidohydrolase ec in the rapidly growing kidney of newborn rats camp C2 were and pmolg of kidney at and DAB and increased to adult levels pmolg at days whereas cgmp levels were and pmolg at and days and decreased to adult levels at days the results indicate that compensatory renal hypertrophy and neonatal kidney growth are associated with changes in camp and cgmp metabolism
1600,purified c perfringens type a enterotoxin fed orally in an amount of mg caused both vomiting and diarrhea in the monkey only when the gastric juice had been neutralized exposure of enterotoxin to ph or below rapidly destroyed the activity all three monkeys receiving sodium bicarbonate and x viable cells grown in ds medium developed diarrhea and only one of them vomited once the diarrhea lasted for and hr the symptoms were similar to those reported in human cases of c perfringens food poisoning these results have verified the general notion that c perfringens food poisoning should be categorized as a true intravital intoxication the reversed passive HA test detected enterotoxin directly in most fecal samples this method may be applicable for diagnosis of human cases of c perfringens food poisoning neither enterotoxin nor antienterotoxin was detected in serum samples taken from any monkey up to days after the challenge we are tempted to conclude therefore that no significant amount of c perfringens enterotoxin is absorbed from the intestine
1601,ph and bicarbonate affect many metabolic reactions but each may change independently to study bicarbonates effect onplasma potassium blood bicarbonate in normal hypokalemic or hyperkalemic rats was either maintained constant lowered by HCl or raised by sodium bicarbonate administraion blood ph was maintained constant by changing pco in normokalemia lowering bicarbonate increased plasma potassium meq above values obtained in the other groups to eliminate urinary potassium losses experiments were also performed in rats with BL ureteral ligation again plasma potassium concentration rose significantly more in the lowered bicarbonate group similarly in hypokalemia PK rose and meq in the lowered and unchanged groups but fell meqliter in the elevated group differences could not be ascribed to renal potassium losses as potassium excretion was essentially zero in each group in hyperkalemia plasma potassium concentration remained elevated for min in the lowered bicarbonate group but fell and meq in the unchanged and elevated groups respectively urinary potassium losses in the three groups were statistically identical in all experiments blood ph was maintained unchanged during the experiment the data show that bicarbonate independent of blood ph alters transcellular potassium distribution suggesting the usefulness of bicarbonate therapy in hyperkalemia even at a compensated blood ph
1602,enzyme preparations from oat seedlings showing the activity of myoinositol oxygenase ec have been described previously in contrast to Ins oxygenase preparations from other sources eg rat kidney or yeast the oat enzyme seemed to exhibit a somewhat less stringent activity acting on other inositols and inositol methyl ethers as well as on myoinositol by purification of the enzyme present in the extract from oat seedlings with the help of an affinity gel TPS for enzymes acting on myoinositol a homogeneous enzyme preparation was obtained which shows the same strict specificity as the myoinositol oxygenase from other sources it has a molecular weight of and tends to aggregate to oligomers up to tetramers under physiological phvalues in more alkaline media dissociation to monomers is observed the action on the other inositols and Ins methyl ethers is apparently due to one or more other enzymes which are also adsorbed on the affinity gel but can be separated from the myoinositol oxygenase by elution with increasing concentrations of Ins
1603,hemodynamic studies using ilabeled albumin risa were performed before and and weeks T3 the oral administration of pindolol av mgday oxprenolol av mgday propranolol av mgday or bufetolol hydrochloride av mgday in patients with essential hypertension responders to the antihypertensive actions of shortterm weeks pindolol or bufetolol showed a reduction in total peripheral resistance pindolol from av to dyneseccmm befetolol from av to p less than without significant changes in cardiac index while hypotensive actions of propranolol or oxprenolol appeared to be due mainly to a decrease in cardiac output propranolol from av to lminm oxprenolol from av to lminm although the decrease in cardiac output was not significant in longterm weeks oxprenolol therapy antihypertensive effects seemed to be related to reduced cardiac output and a readaptation of peripheral resistance to chronic reduction of cardiac output was not always observed circulation time was determined in patients with oxprenolol therapy and with pindolol therapy by the measurement of the arrival time in the cerebral hemisphere of the intravenously injected radioisotope the patients with oxprenolol therapy showed significant prolongation in circulation time shortterm administration av to sec longterm administration av to sec p less than while no prolongation was observed in pindolol therapy these results suggest that hemodynamic responses to betablocking agents are not uniform and that the antihypertensive actions of betablockers depend on the effects on both cardiac output and IP vascular resistance
1604,a hypothesis that preferential rejection of donor markers by the hex system of pneumococcus is due to lethal doublestrand breaks has been examined in terms of its implications for the extent of the excision required experiments reported here were directed at asking whether hexdependent marker efficiency depends on the length of the donor dsDNA dna in the absence of intracellular competition for hex function there was no detectable effect of dna size on hexdependent marker efficiency as donor dna was sheared from greater than x daltons to x daltons the latter dna was purified by two successive velocity fractionations to ensure that the activity seen was representative of dna of that size quantitative examination of the system shows that for the lethal event hypothesis to be true the excision step has to remove an average of to nucleotides this figure is so much greater than that seen in other excision processes that alternate hypotheses should be considered the presently known properties of the hex system can be accounted for by a model invoking the migratory features of type i restriction enzymes
1605,methyl PYR mp a TPS inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase reduced ethanol elimination by and completely removed the ethanolinduced inhibition of galactose beta in control subjects ethanol elimination was accelerated in alcoholics with adequate nutrition but the effect of mp was comparable to that in controls in other alcoholic subjects who reported poor nutritional NI intermediate rates of ethanol beta were observed and mp had almost no effect on ethanol or galactose beta these results suggest that alcohol abuse may result in an increased contribution to ethanol elimination by pathways other than that involving alcohol dehydrogenase adh and that the decreased contribution from adh possibly potentiated by inadequate nutrition may diminish the ethanolinduced shift in the nadcoupled redox state since CL damage produced by alcohol abuse is believed to be related to changes from the normal redox state caused by ethanol these results may explain why alcoholic liver damage is uncommon in alcoholics living on a marginal diet since mp effectively eliminates the ethanolinduced shift in the redox state a therapeutic trial with mp in alcoholics with a high risk for CL disease is indicated
1606,at degrees c incubation of nadhubiquinone reductase complex with trypsin caused selective inhibition of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase activity the reduction of kfecn by nadh or nadph was unaffected but a slow decrease in the rate of reduction of ubiquinone by nadh was observed the phdependence of TH activity differed in complex i and trypsintreated complex i the trypsinlabile activity had a ph optimum of approx whereas the trypsinresistant activity had a ph optimum of approx or less the trypsinlabile transhydrogenase activity was specifically inhibited by butanedione or phenylglyoxal and was identified with the enzyme catalysing energylinked transhydrogenase activity in submitochondrial particles polyacrylamidegel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS revealed that trypsin caused degradation of a polypeptide of molwt in parallel with the loss of transhydrogenase activity at degrees c and higher TR concentrations the rate of reduction of kfecn by nadh or nadph slowly decreased increased lability of nadhkfecn reductase activity to trypsin was observed when the endogenous phospholipid of complex i was depleted by detergent or phospholipase a treatment polyacrylamidegel electrophoresis indicated that removal of phospholipid allowed much more extensive degradation of constituent polypeptides by TR the subunits of the lowmolecularweight type ii dehydrogenase and molwt were however relatively resistant to trypsin even in phospholipiddepleted preparations
1607,the stimulation by CS of phosphate uptake into t cells results from a change in maximum velocity of the transport process with no change in the michaelis constant only arsenate among a series of inorganic structural analogs of phosphate inhibited phosphate uptake indicating a high specificity for the process the arsenate inhibition was competitive in nature papaverine theophylline and protaglandin e drugs known to maintain high intracellular levels of camp had little effect on serum stimulated phosphate uptake the phosphate uptake stimulating AF in SS could be distinguised from the t cell survival and migration AF by stability characteristics but this factors could not be completely separated from a UR uptake stimulation activity or growth promoting activity using a variety of serum fractionation procedures only partial stimulation of the uptake process was achieved with any one SS fraction indicating a multiplicity of SS components is probably involved in this process because of the rapidity of serum activation of phosphate uptake and its apparent independence of intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels it is suggested that SS factors may stimulate phosphate uptake by inducing structural changes in the phosphate carrier system
1608,the effects of temperature on mgitpase activity of heavy meromyosin and S1 subfragment were measured in m kc the initial burst of pi liberation was one mol per mol of heavy meromyosin or two mol of S1 subfragment ie one mol per two mol of S1 active CS at degrees c however it was almost zero mol below degrees c effects of kc concentration and ph on itpase activity of heavy meromyosin at degrees c were different from those below degrees c suggesting that the ratelimiting step in the mgitp hydrolysis of myosin depends on temperature the effect of temperature on the actin activation of heavy meromyosin mgitpase was analyzed by measuring the temperature dependence of doublereciprocal plots of itpase activity against actin concentration the extent of actin activation was larger at low temperture the results presented in this paper might be explained by assuming the existence of two kinds of active CS on a myosin molecule
1609,the extracellular and intracellular potassium k activities of isolated superfused rb atrial muscle were measured using ksensitive liquid ion exchanger microelectrodes when the ph of the bathing medium was decreased from to intracellular k activity fell and extracellular k activity rose from a mean control level of mm to a new steady state level of mm after hour when the ph was further decreased to extracellular aK increased to a mean of mm following the NC in ph the increase in extracellular k activity occurred over a period of minutes at which time a SD value was reached and maintained for the next hour on return to normal ph the extracellular k activity returned to control with a time constant of minutes or less measurements of intracellular k activity over hour showed a mean loss of mm at ph and a mean loss of mm at ph the loss was reversible within minutes of return to control ph the increase in extracellular k activity was accompanied by a decrease in resting membrane potential as well as decreases in maximum dvdt and overshoot of the action potential the action potential contour underwent complex changes consisting of decrease in the plateau and a prolongation of the time to full repolarization
1610,the technique of differential thermal and proteolytic inactivation has been employed as a conformational probe for the lysinesensitive aspartokinase ec of escherichia coli b lamino acid inhibitors of this enzyme each induce a characteristic enzyme conformation this is evidenced by rates of thermal and proteolytic inactivation and arrhenius activation energies for thermal inactivation which are characteristic of the CAA present phenylalanine and leucine IB are mutually exclusive as evidenced by competitive SMB in thermal inactivation experiments suggesting a hydrophobic amino acid binding site with broad specificity the phenylalaninedependent conformation and the leucinedependent conformation differ considerably in comparison with the native enzyme the former is more labile to proteolysis by trypsin whereas the latter is more SD firstorder rate constants for thermal inactivation of the phenylalanine and leucinedependent conformations are respectively about onehalf and onetenth that of the native enzyme items and taken together suggest that the conformations are ligand induced and do not arise via ligand stabilization of spontaneously arising conformers
1611,a density gradientpurified microsomal membrane preparation from rabbit fundic GM was used for a detailed study of the kstimulated atpase and associated intermediate reactions membranes incubated with gammapatp show the rapid incorporation of p into phosphoprotein phosphoprotein levels were markedly reduced when atp hydrolysis went to completion or upon addition of unlabeled atp thus suggesting the participation of a rapid turnover phosphorylated intermediate in the gastric microsomal atpase addition of k rb or tl greatly reduced the level of the intermediate while stimulating atpase activity the observed affinities of these cations were similar for the effects on both atpase and intermediate C2 with tl greater than k greater than rb neither atpase nor intermediate were stimulated by na and ouabain was without effect on the reactions thus differentiating this system from the na katpase addition of various inhibitors showed differential effects on the partial reactions of the gastric atpase system nethylmaleimide and zn showed characteristics of completely abolishing the kstimulated component of atpase as well as the effects of k in reducing the level of intermediate thus suggesting that these agents exert their inhibitory effect on a phosphoprotein phosphatase partial reaction f abolished the kstimulated atpase but its more complex effects on the intermediate suggested an additional reaction step within the domain of the EP results are consistent with a MM system for the gastric microsomal atpase involving a mgdependent protein kinase a phosphorylated intermediates and a kstimulated phosphoprotein phosphatase
1612,in the presence of ca atp phosphorylates the ca pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum at the same site and to the same extent regardless of whether mg is added or not to the incubation media the main effect of added mg being to increase the rate of phosphorylation when phosphoenzyme is made in mgcontaining media it dephosphorylates about times faster than when it is made in the absence of added mg addition of mg T3 phosphorylation is uneffective in accelerating the hydrolysis of EP even in solubilized enzyme suggesting that phosphorylation of the ca pump results in occlusion of the site at which mg combines to accelerate the release of phosphate occlusion of the site for mg can be partially reversed by transdiaminocyclohexonetetraacetic acid cdta use was made of this property to demonstrate that for the rapid release of phosphate to occur mg has to be bound to the enzyme results seem to indicate that mg combines with the ca pump prior to phosphorylation
1613,a protein has been studied which spontaneously precipitates from stored fractions of platelet soluble phase prepared by density gradient centrifugation it is rich in a ca atpase activity which displays an activityph profile resembling that of skeletal muscle myosin adjustment of freshly prepared soluble phase fractions to m with respect to kcl and dilution in results in the precipitations of a protein fraction with essentially the same enzymatic properties as the spontaneously precipitable protein these two similar proteins represent between and of the soluble phase total protein and each account for almost the whole of divalent cation activated atpase activity of the soluble phases from which they were derived the mg atpase activity is only about twice purified with respect to the soluble phase enzyme activity but the ca atpase shows a fold enrichment synthetic actomyosins can be prepared from the two proteins by addition of either PLT or skeletal muscle actin these show significant increases in mg atpase at the most favourable combination ratios the ratio between the yield of soluble phase protein obtained by dilution precipitation and the LDH of the soluble phase remains constant under a wide range of homogenization and sonication conditions applied to the original whole PLT suspensions this confirms our earlier view that the soluble phase is a valid intracellular compartment for a considerable proportion of the platelet contractile protein and that in the complex the myosinlike component predominates
1614,this T0 was designed to investigate the effects of viruses in the pathogenesis of LM the organisms used in this study were listeria monocytogenes type isolated from a local fatal case mouse adapted influenza apr honi streptococcus pneumoniae group b um med ctr and PV type mefgm balbc mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with one ld of listeria monocytogenes ten days later the survivors were challenged intransally with ld of influenza virus and observed for days another set of balbc mice was inoculated intranasally with one ld of influenza virus and the survivors challenged days later intraperitoneally with ld of listeria monocytogenes controls consisted of similar inoculation and challenge methods in mice using streptococcus pneumoniae and polio virus with LM and influenza virus cross protection was observed only between listeria monocytogenes and influenza virus cellular immunity may play a role in this interaction this findings seem to agree with reports from others who showed cross protection between listeria monocytogenes and other intracellular bacteria and parasites
1615,spinach chloroplasts suspended in a liquid medium containing ethyleneglycol showed reversible absorbance changes near and nm due to p and p in the region from to degrees c upon illumination the kinetics were the same at both wavelengths provided absorbance changes due to photosystem ii were suppressed at both wavelengths the decay was slowed down considerably not only by the system i electron acceptor MV but also by silicomolybdate the effect of the latter compound is probably not due to the oxidation of the reduced acceptor of photosystem i by silicomolybdate but to the enhanced accessibility of the acceptor to some other oxidant in the presence of both an electron donor and acceptor for system i a strong stimulation of the extent of the lightinduced absorbance increase at nm was observed the most ERP donor tested was reduced nmethylphenazonium methosulphate pms the lightinduced difference spectrum was similar to spectra obtained earlier at room temperature and indicated electrochromic band shifts of chlorophylls a and b and carotenoid due to a large potential over the thylakoid membrane caused by sustained electron transport it was estimated that steadystate potentials of up to nearly mv were obtained in this way the potentials reversed only slowly in the dark indicating a low conductance of the membrane this decay was accelerated by gramicidin d the absorbance changes were linearly proportional to the membrane potential
1616,gammaglutamyl transpeptidase was isolated from sheep kidney cortex as an apparently homogeneous highly active protein at optimal ph and in the absence of acceptors the enzyme catalyzes the PR of about mumol of pnitroaniline per mg protein per min from the model ATP lgammaglutamylpnitroanilide PAGE in a SDS buffer system showed the presence of a C1 mr approximately and a small mr approximately polypeptide chain dissociation into two polypeptide chains was also achieved in m urea amidination with dimethylsuberimidate produced a crosslinked protein of molecular weight approximately in the course of this work a convenient procedure was developed for the determination of gammaglutamyl transpeptidase activity using lglycinehglutathione as the substrate in this procedure the release of cysteinylhglycine from glutathione is followed after separation of the radioactive dipeptide from unreacted glutathione on a small dowex acetate column the reactions with gammaglutamylpnitroanilide and glutathione are both strongly activated by several metal ions ca mg na and k and by a number of amino acids and peptide acceptors the products of the reaction with glutathione were identified as cysteinylglycine gammaglutamylglutathione and glutamate the formation of these products is consistent with the function of gammaglutamyl transpeptidase in both the gammaglutamyl transfer reaction and in the hydrolysis of the gammaglutamyl bond the activating effect of metal ions in the reaction with glutathione was shown to be dependent on the acceleration of the transfer reaction the rate of hydrolysis of the gammaglutamyl bond remaining unchanged
1617,in rats treated with the hypolipidemic drug nafenopin np for days the biliary excretion of phenolphthalein glucuronide ppg was markedly decreased while in contrast that of chlorothiazide ctz was enhanced this suggests the existence of independent hepatic transport mechanisms for these two anions for both ppg and ctz blood disappearance curves showed an initial rapid phase followed by a second slow phase the rapid phase for both EDC is affected only slightly by pretreatment with np therefore it is inferred that suppression of biliary excretion was attributable mainly to impairment of the livertobile transport process the increased bile flow induced by np treatment was previously shown to be related to the biliary excretion of np and its metabolites inhibition of np choleresis by ppg may involve competition for biliary transport of these compounds the marked hepatomegaly and choleresis seen after np pretreatment was more evident in male rats than in females
1618,out of adolescents having had been treated by human chorionic GTH hcg before puberty because of undescended testes were reexamined to years later at an individual age of at least years in of them a semen specimen for sperm counts could be obtained in patients however no ejaculate could be collected because of their hypogonadism of these patients examined by sperm count had a sufficient testicular descensus after hcg treatment in adolescents hcg therapy failed therefore subsequent orchidopexy was performed a normal sperm count was seen in only per cent of the patients T3 unilateral testicular maldescensus T3 bilateral maldescensus of the patients had to be evaluated as prospectively infertile maier and spann reported sperm counts below ml in out of patients with bilateral maldescensus who had been treated by SA in the present T0 however only out of individuals treated for bilateral maldescensus by hcg alone showed sperm counts below ml plasma lh and fsh concentrations were determined in patients out of which showed hypergonadotrophic values of fsh and sperm counts below ml subsequently cases of klinefelters syndrome could be diagnosed among the total group of patients the etiology of testicular maldescensus is by no means uniform since anatomical endocrine andor chromosomal factors are involved
1619,the conformation of the gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh whose primary sequence is pgluhistrpsertyrglyleuargproglynh and of several of its structural analogues has been studied by circular dichroism optical rotatory dispersion and fluorescence spectroscopy the effects of ph DTG and temperature on fluorescence emission have also been examined titration data demonstrate that the histidine and tyrosine residues are free of any mutual interactions the similarity of emission spectra in water and in guanidine hydrochloride solutions precludes significant interactions between the fluorescent groups and other residues neither the temperature nor the ph profiles of the emission intensities of either tyrosine or tryptophan reveal any fixed secondary structure in gnrh both the extent of alkaline quenching and the distance of a calculated from fÃ¶rster SE transfer theory are in accord with a randomly coiled structure with only one residue between IMT and tryptophan furthermore the circular dichroism spectrum and optical rotatory dispersion do not exhibit any contributions from peptide bonds in an ordered structure although there is a perturbation of the peptide absorption region due to overlapping bands from sidechain chromophores gnrh therefore appears to behave as a random coil polypeptide in water devoid of any intrachain residue interactions this nonordered structure in gnrh and the lack of any significant differences in the physicalchemical properties of the hormone analogues indicate that a predetermined solution conformation is not required for biological activity in contrast to its behavior in water gnrh in trifluoroethanol exhibits a conformational transition with the formation of a beta structure differences in conformational changes exhibited by several analogues in trifluoroethanol may be relevant to their relative biological activities at the receptor site
1620,the frequency the treatment and the mortality of stress induced ulcers and erosions of the upper alimentary tract are surveyed the exp data concerning such ulcers and erosions are reported most important is the local mucosal ischaemia with a concomitant reabsorption of hions intravasal coagulation processes and a local diminution of the vitamin a content may be additional factors stress induced bleedings observed in patients of a surgical intensive care unit are analysed the mortality of the conservatively treated group was and higher than the mortality after operative treatment the high mortality was due to the associated states of shock hypoxaemia and sepsis a prospective T0 comporting patients of a medical intensive care unit shows the little importance of intravasal coagulation for gastrointestinal bleedings during septicaemia the possible influence of psychological factors for the induction of stress induced bleedings was analysed on tetraplegics and paraplegics all under the same conservative treatment comporting high doses of dexamethason the frequency of gastrointestinal bleedings was very high in complete traumatic tetraplegia smaller in complete traumatic paraplegia much lower in incomplete traumatic and CR nontraumatic lesions
1621,based on incorporation of radioactively labeled nethylmaleimide the readily reactive thiol groups of isolated myosin ec from fast slow and cardiac muscles could be classified into types all myosins contain thiol thiol and a variable number of thiol groups per molecule both thiol and thiol CG which are essential for SF-36 of the kstimulated atpase are located in the HCs in all myosin types the R2 in the incorporation pattern of nethylmaleimide over the thiol group classes under steadystate conditions of mg atp hydrolysis allowed different conformations of some reaction intermediates to be characterized in all types of myosin the hydrolytic cycle of mg atp was found to be controlled by the same step at degrees c in all three cases this ratelimiting step is changed in the same way by lowereing temperature using the chemically determined molecular weights for myosin light chains their stoichiometry was found on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis to be for CS chain light chainlight chain per molecule of fast S1 for light chainlight chain per molecule of slow S1 and for light chainlight chain per molecule of CM this qualitative difference in light subunit composition between the fast and the two types of slow myosin is not reflected in the small variations of the characteristics exhibited by the isolated myosins but rather seems to be connected with their respective myofibrillar atpase activities
1622,in order to determine the possible role of the ST in the regulation of prolactin secretion during sexual development male rats were rendered cryptorchid at days of age and thereafter different CG of animals were decapitated at day intervals between day and day cryptorchid rats showed destruction of the germinal epithelium accompanied by increased plasma fsh and to a much lesser extent increased plasma lh titers nevertheless plasma prolactin C2 were similar to those of intact controls throughout the entire period studied plasma prolactin titers in intact controls remained uniformly low from day to day contrasting with previous reports in which increasing prolactin levels have been observed during sexual development to determine the reason for this apparent discrepancy a longitudinal experiment was conducted in which intact and cryptorchid male rats were bled every days from day to day following a min period of exposure to ether fumes the prolactin response to this AS increased markedly with age a similar DP of prolactin was observed in a crosssectional study in which different groups of IN animals were bled following a min period of ether exposure at ages ranging from to daysmthe results indicate that unlike fsh secretion prolactin secretion is not controlled by the seminiferous tubules in addition they suggest that the DP of increasing plasma prolactin previously described in the developing male rat is at least in part caused by an agedependent increase in responsiveness of prolactin to stress
1623,the duration of the cardiac effects of single intravenous doses of the betaantagonists timolol and propranolol was compared in healthy male subjects timolol and propranolol were given in doses of mg and mg respectively and at specified times after their administration betablockade was assessed by the reduction of maximal exerciseinduced tachycardia and by the inhibition of the chronotropic and inotropic effects of isoproterenol inotropic effects were measured by changes in the preejection period of left ventricular systole obtained from systolic time intervals there was no statistically significant difference in the timolol and propranolol timecourses of betablockade the NC in exercisetachycardia was maximal min after betaantagonist infusion but dissipated rapidly so that no statistically significant change was observed hr later the chronotropic and inotropic effects of isoproterenol were almost completely antagonized for hr after betaantagonist infusion and significant betablockade could be demonstrated hr later there was no difference in the timecourse of the negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of either betaantagonist
1624,sodium paraaminosalicylate sodium salt of hydroxyaminobenzoic acid napas lowers the oxygen affinity of normal adult human placental heterozygous and homozygous sickle cell anemic whole blood at degrees c the reduction of P50 is related to the type of hemoglobin in the blood the mean p se at ph for normal placental heterozygoud and homozygous sickle cell anemic blood in and mm hg in the presence of mmol of napas per liter of blood the p values are increased to and mm hg respectively the bohr effect in normal and placental blood at this napas concentration is essentially unchanged in heterozygous and homozygous sickle cell anemic blood the bohr factor deta log pdeta ph is reduced from to and from to the hill constants n of normal and placental blood are not affected by napas in homozygous and heterozygous sickle blood high concentrations of napas mmoll decrease the hill constant from to and from to respectively napas is more firmly bound to red blood cells than to plasma the binding of napas is probably primarily ionic in nature since the drug can be almost CR removed from blood components by dialysis the changes in oxygen affinity caused by napas are consistent with conformational changes r leads to t which enhance the presence of deoxyhemoglobin
1625,the major protein in beta nerve growth factor S9 betangf is a dimer in which both peptide chains have coohterminal Arg residues digestion of betangf with CP b produced a dimer betangf in which both chains lack these terminal arginine residues exposure of mixtures of beta and betangf dimers to m urea to produce monomers followed by removal of urea to allow recombination resulted in the formation of the hybrid betangf comprising one argininecontaining and one arginineless chain as well as the parent dimers the amount of the three dimers formed was close to that expected from random association of monomers hybrid betangf was also formed from mixtures of beta and betangf where incubated at ph to the formation of betangf has a halftime of h at ph and degrees c its rate of formation decreased above ph becoming minimal between ph and ph and increased with increasing temperature the amount of betangf formed was determined by the lowest ph to which the parent mixture was exposed irrespective of its prior history these data suggest that the hybrid is formed by the same mechanism in the absence and presence of the urea step an approximate value for kd the equilibrium dissociation constant of the dimer equilibrium monomer equilibrium was derived its value was m at ph and degrees c the alphasubunit of s ngf decreased the rate of formation of betangf not only at phs where an alphabeta complex is SD but also at an acid ph where no complex formation is observed by sedimentation analysis suggesting that the present methodology offers a more CS probe of S1 interactions in contrast the gamma S1 and a number of indifferent proteins had little or no effect on the appearance of betangf at the phs studied
1626,comparative data on quaternary structure cooperativity bohr effect and regulation by organic phosphates are reviewed for vertebrate hemoglobins a phylogeny of hemoglobin function in the vertebrates is deduced it is proposed that from the monomeric hemoglobin of the common ancestor of vertebrates a deoxy dimer as seen in the lamprey could have originated with a single CAA substitution the deoxy dimer has a bohr effect cooperativity and a reduced oxygen affinity compared to the monomer one or two additional CAA substitutions could have resulted in the origin of a tetrameric deoxy hemoglobin which dissociated to dimers on oxygenation gene duplication giving incipient alpha and beta genes probably preceded the origin of a tetrameric oxyhemoglobin the origin of an organic phosphate IB site on the tetrameric hemoglobin of an early fish required only one or two amino acid substitutions atp was the first organic phosphate regulator of hemoglobin function the binding of atp by hemoglobin may have caused the original elevation in the concentration of atp in the red blood cells by relieving end product inhibition of atp synthesis the switch from regulation of hemoglobin CF by atp to regulation by dpg may have been a consequence of the curtailment of oxidative phosphorylation in the red blood cell the basic mechanisms by which atp and dpg concentrations can respond to strss on the oxygen transport system were present before the origin of an organic phosphate IB site on hemoglobin a switch from atp regulation to ip regulation occurred in the common ancestor of birds
1627,gammaglutamyltranspeptidase ggtp activity was studied in livers of rats submitted to an endtoside portacaval shunt pcs and in developing animals to correlate the evolution of the enzymatic activity measured in vitro histochemical techniques were used to localize enzyme activity in liver tissue the ggtp activity in the adult rats was low and amounted to mumolming during fetal development the CEA rose beginning on the th gestational day from to on the first postnatal day then the values declined and reached nearly adult values from the th postnatal day after pcs the ggtp activity exhibited a three to sixfold increase to as compared with unoperated AD controls the highest levels corresponded to those observed between the rd and th PN day in the developing rats the histochemistry of gttp in the fetal and P0 CL showed a regular distribution of the enzyme as a fine deposit in the hepatocytes throughout the whole tissue ten DAB the activity was low at the same level as in the adult rat in the period after pcs hepatocytes began to show signs of enzymatic activity at the periphery of the hepatic lobules which subsequently spread through the whole lobules the increase of ggtp activity after pcs equaled the activity found in fetal animals that correlated well in both groups with the reappearance of histologically demonstrable CEA in hepatocytes
1628,aminolaevulinate synthetase cataylses the condensation of glycine and succinylcoa to give 5-ALA at least two broad pathways may be considered for the initial cc bond forming step in the reaction in pathway a the SB of glycine and enzyme bound pyridoxal phosphate a undergoes decarboxylation to give the carbanion b which then condenses with succinylcoa with the retention of both the original c hydrogen atoms of glycine in pathway b loss of a c hydrogen atom gives another type of carbanion c that reacts with succinylcoa evidence has been presented to show that the initial cc bond forming event occurs via pathway b which involves the removal of the pro r hydrogen atom of glycine subsequent mechanistic and stereochemical events occurring at the carbon atom destined to become c of aminolaevulinate have also been delineatedcarticle several mechanistic alternatices for the formation of the two vinyl groups of haem from the propionate residues of the precursor coproporphyrinogen iii have been examined see article it is shown that during the biosynthesis both the hydrogen atoms resident at the alpha positions of the propionate side chains remain undisturbed thus eliminating mechanisms which predict the involvement of acrylic acid intermediates biosynthetic experiments performed with precursors containing stereospecific labels have shown that the two vinyl CG of haem are formed through the loss of pro s hydrogen atoms from the betapositions of the propionate side chains in the light of these results three related mechanisms for the conversion propionate leads to vinyl have been considered in order to T0 the mechanism of porphyrinogen carboxylyase reaction stereospecifically deuterated tritiatedsuccinate was incorporated into the acetate residues of uroporphyrinogen iii which on decarboxylation generated asymmetric methyl groups in coproporphyrinogen iii and then in haem Kd of the latter yielded chiral acetate deriving from c and d rings of haem configurational analysis of this derivate acetate shows that the carboxylyase reaction proceeds with a retention of configuration
1629,adult outbread male guinea pigs were autoimmunized without adjuvant homogenates were prepared with one of their own testes previously submitted in vivo and in vitro to thermal injury animals received a single or daily repeated intradermal injection without added adjuvant in one or different skin sites guinea pigs daily sensitized in the same site during days showed the presence of a dermal granuloma at the site of injection b several foci of typical allergic orchitis c delayed hypersensitivity detected by inhibition of macrophage migration d moderate titres of spermagglutinins and negligible levels of HA antibodies guinea pigs receiving a single dose in one site only developed delayed hypersensitivity animals daily sensitized with the same dose of altered antigen in different sites or with normal testis antigen either in one or different sites showed negative results the rho among testicular lesion dermal granuloma and cellular immunity is discussed it is concluded that testis autosensitization is obtained in the absence of added adjuvant provided that a thermally injured gonad used as antigen is repeatedly injected in the same site
1630,an increase in extracellular ca concentration causes the membrane of giant red cells of the salamander amphiuma means to undergo a marked transient hyperpolarization this hyperpolarization is caused by an increase in k permeability of the membrane as judged from the k sensitivity of the membrane potential and from the rate of k loss under influence of raised extracellular ca concentration at constant external ph the induction of hyperpolarization by increased extracellular ca has a relatively welldefined threshold concentration furthermore the phenomenon is of an all or none type with most of the cells having membrane potential values either in the normal range about mv or in the range to mv shortly after suspension in ringers with mm ca most if not all of the individual cells are hyperpolarized upon continued SE min to the higher ca concentration the membrane potential returns to the normal value in a fashion compatible with an all or none response the observed ca effect is sensitive to the ph of the suspending medium at ph the response is absent whereas the hyperpolarization is markedly stronger at ph than at ph it is argued that a reliable transport number for k under influence of ca cannot be estimated from the slope of membrane potential vs log extracellular k concentration this is probably related to the fact that the membrane potentials of the cells in the population do not stay constant in time the above phenomenon is compared with the cainduced PK in poisoned human red cells or red cell ghosts it is important to note that the cells employed in the present study are neither poisoned nor mechanically disrupted this study emphasizes that the role of ca in regulating CM permeability to k seems to be a general feature
1631,the metal ion catalysed decomposition of the nucleotide diphosphate sugars UDPG uriding diphosphate galactose uridine diphosphate nacetylglucosamine GDP mannose and GDP fucose udpglc udpgal udpglcnac gdpman and gdpfuc respectively has been studies as a CF of ph udpdlc and udpgal decompose readily to the acycle phosphate derivative of the sugar and uridine phosphoric acid ump in the presence of mn under all conditions tested udpgal decomposes two to three times more rapidly than does udpglc gdpfuc is slowly degraded to free fucose under similar conditions the other nucleotide diphosphate sugars are stable the rate of reaction increases with increasing hydroxide ion concentration from ph to and with metal ion concentration from to mm several metal ions are ERP catalysts at ph with mm udpgal and mm metal ion the following apparent firstorder rate constants min x were obtained eu mn co zn ca cu and mg it appears that mn concentrations that have been used in studies with nucleotide diphosphate sugars at neutral ph can catalyze significant decomposition leading to erroneous interpretation of kinetic and incorporation experiments
1632,through the use of an CA that measures cellular capacity for TPS enzyme synthesis mrna of alanine aminotransferase ec lalanineoxoglutarate aminotransferase was found to be degraded with a halflife of hr in cultured reuber h cells mrna of tyrosine aminotransferase ec ltyrosineoxoglutarate aminotransferase has a halflife of hr in the same cells rates of degradation of the mrnas are the same whether new mrna accumulation is blocked by removal of the steroid inducer or by inhibition of mrna synthesis actinomycin cycloheximide inhibits the normally rapid turnover of tyrosine aminotransferase mrna but agents such as puromycin and sodium fluoride which disrupt polysome structure do not alter the kcat of the IMT and alanine aminotransferase mrnas the IMT and alanine aminotransferase mrnas appear to be translated at equivalent rates the data suggest that the degradation rate of these two mrnas is determined by the polynucleotide structure of the mrna molecules at or near the site for ribosome IB and initiation
1633,edta at a concentration of mum produced a threshold effect in the activation of purified rabbit CL fructose diphosphatase ec in the presence of mm mg at ph without edta biphasic activation curves were produced by mg a doublereciprocal plot of the data gave the km values corresponding to the two linear regions they were and mm at ph and and mm at ph in the presence of mum edta a sigmoidal curve was obtained for mg activation in the range of noninhibitory mg concentrations at ph the apparent km value for mg was mm and the hill coefficient was at ph cooperativity among the mg CS disappeared and the apparent km value for mg was mm these km values at ph or corresponded to the smaller of the biphasic km values obtained without edta in the absence of edta no inhibition by mg was observed in the mg concentration range below mm in the presence of edta the enzyme was inhibited markedly by mg at concentrations above mm at ph and was more sensitive to inhibition at ph the effects of ph on the km value for mg activation and on the mg inhibition contributed to an apparent shift of the ph optimum for activity induced by edta cooperative interaction among fructose diphosphate sites was observed for the enzyme in the presence of edta the hill coefficient was approximatley and the apparent km value for the ATP was mum edta appears to make CL fructose diphosphatase very sensitive to various effectors it is suggested that mg serves as a regulator for the CEA
1634,tilorone hydrochloride biasdiethylaminoethoxyfluorenone dihydrochloride has been studied to determine its effect on the drugmetabolizing enzymes of the CL of male charles river cd strain rats single and multiple doses of tiloronehcl mgkgday po were used most experiments were performed hr after the last dose except for a study hr after dosing and those in which the duration of effects of tilorone hydrochloride were determined the hexobarbital sleeping time was prolonged after both single doses and four doses of tilorone hydrochloride the dose regimen prolonged the zoxazolamine paralysis time but the single dose did not a decrease in microsomal protein was observed after the single and dose regimens but not after daily doses of tiloronehcl cytochrome p content of microsomes was decreased by the single doses and mgkg po and by and doses of mgkgday po activities of aminopyrine demethylase and hexobarbital oxidase also were decreased by the above regimens but the activity of hexobarbital oxidase was affected more markedly electron micrographs of rat liver T3 treatment with tiloronehcl mgkgday for days revealed many membranous structures in the form of whorls
1635,a wellmarked hierarchy of centres can be recognized within the suboesophageal lobes and ganglia of the arms the inputs and outputs of each lobe are described there are sets of motoneurons and intermediate motor centres which can be activated either from the periphery or from above they mostly do not send fibres up to the optic or higher motor centres however there is a large set of fibres running from the magnocellular lobe to all the basal supraoesophageal lobes the centre for control of the four eyemuscle nerves in the anterior lateral pedal lobe receives many fibres direct from the statocyst and from the peduncle and basal lobes but none direct from the optic lobe the posterior lateral pedal is a backward continuation of the oculomotor centre containing large cells that may be concerned in initiating attacks by the tentacles an intermediate motor centre in the posterior pedal lobe probably controls steering it sends fibres to the funned and head retractors and by both direct and interrupted pathways to the fin lobe it receives MF from the crista nerve and basal lobes but none direct from the optic lobe the jet control centre of the ventral MC lobe receives MF from the statocyst and skin and also from the optic and basal lobes some of these last also give extensive branches throughout the palliovisceral lobes the branching patterns of the dendritic collaterals differ in the various lobes some estimates are given of the numbers of synaptic points the dendritic collaterals of the motoneurons spread through C1 volumes of neuropil and they overlap the incoming fibres spread widely and each presumably activates many MNs either together or serially many of the lobes contain numerous microneurons with short trunks restricted to the lobe but there are none of these cells in the chromatophore lobes or fin lobes the microneurons have only few dendritic collaterals in contrast to the numerous ones on the nearby motoneurons
1636,in the albino rat the evolvement of myocardial necrosis induced by a single injection of iso was accompanied by a fall in total ne pretreatment with propranolol and pargyline protected against isoinduced necrosis and MH but did not influence the isoinduced SD of ne stores the depletion of ne stores is not due to impairment in synthesis or increased intraneuronal metabolism of ne since in isotreated rats neither cardiac tyrosine hydroxylase activity nor mao activity was altered the decrease in endogenous ne is not due to a defect in the storage of ne the ability of myocardium to take up and store ne returned to normal within hours whereas endogenous levels returned to normal within days even in the presence of demonstrable CN thus there is lack of correlation between chemical and morphological changes since catecholamine depletion occurred in the absence of morphologically demonstrable tissue injury and the CF of the adrenergic neuron returns to normal in the presence of demonstrable necrosis
1637,"the effects of varying ph and of increasing intracellular hemoglobin hb concentration on red cell sickling and oxygen affinity were studied in whole blood from persons with sickle cell anemia ss and sickle cell trait sa small increases in ss blood ph inhibited sickling and small reductions in both ss and sa blood ph promoted sickling far more than accounted for by the bohr effect sickling SMB correlated with minimum gelling concentrations mgc of deoxygenated hemolysates without diphosphoglycerate mgc values fell sharply when ph was lowered from to for hbs and from to for sa hemolysates suggesting effects on TPS ionic interactions involved in hb gelation possible clinical counterparts are acute MA and alkalosis prior to NC in red cell 2,3-DPG where the bohr effect and oxygen affinityindependent effects of ph alterations on sickling would be additive osmotic shrinkage of hbscontaining red cells produced a large fall in oxygen affinity and a marked increase in sickling independent of that fall the oxygen affinity and sickling properties of sa cells whose mchc was raised to per cent resembled those of unaltered ss cells supporting a relationship between molecular aggregation of hb and low oxygen affinity sickling of aerated ss cells in hypertonic saline depended upon partial hb desaturation due to lowered oxygen affinity thus osmotic shrinkage of hbscontaining cells acts synergistically with partial deoxygenation to promote sickling these conditions are present in the renal medulla but may occur elsewhere in severe hyperosmolar states"
1638,calcium transport into sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments isolated from dog cardiac and mixed skeletal muscle quadriceps and from mixed fast tibialis pure fast caudofemoralis and pure slow soleus skeletal muscles from the cat was studied cyclic ampdependent protein kinase and phosphorylase b kinase stimulated the rate of calcium transport although some R2 was observed a specific protein kinase inhibitor prevented the effect of protein kinase but not of phosphorylase b kinase the addition of cyclic amp to the sarcoplasmic reticulum preparations in the absence of protein kinase had only a slight stimulatory effect despite the presence of endogenous protein kinase cyclic ampdependent protein kinase catalyzed the phosphorylation of several components present in the sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments a to dalton peak was phosphorylated with high TPS activity in sarcoplasmic reticulum preparations isolated from HR and from slow skeletal muscle but not from fast skeletal muscle phosphorylase b kinase phosphorylated a peak of molecular weight in all of the preparations cyclic ampdependent protein kinasestimulated phosphorylation was optimum at ph phosphorylase b kinase phosphorylation had a biphasic curve in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle with optima at ph and the addition of exogenous phosphorylase b kinase or protein kinase increased the endogenous level of phosphorylation all sarcoplasmic reticulum preparations contained varying amounts of adenylate cyclase phosphorylase b and a ba debrancher enzyme and glycogen mgmg protein as well as varying amounts of protein kinase and phosphorylase b kinase which were responsible for a significant endogenous phosphorylation thus the two phosphorylating enzymes stimulated calcium uptake in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of a variety of muscles possessing different physiologic characteristics and different responses to drugs in addition the phosphorylation catalyzed by these enzymes occurred at two different protein moieties which make physiologic interpretation of the role of phosphorylation difficult while the role phosphorylation in these mechanisms is complex the presence of a glycogenolytic enzyme system may be an important link in this phenomenon the sarcoplasmic reticulum represents a new substrate for phosphorylase b kinase
1639,the handling of UA by the pig kidney has been investigated during continuous urate infusion in unrestrained unanesthetized animals uratetoinulin clearance rates in excess of were found under all experimental conditions demonstrating only net secretion by the pig kidney the demonstration of a sec maximum was precluded owing to a progressive reduction in the gfr associated with high rates of urate infusion urate clearance was independent of urine flow rate up to mlmin the administration of probenecid inhibited urate secretion but uratetoinulin clearance ratios below unity were not observed pyrazinamide or pyrazinoic acid at doses which either inhibited secretion or promoted uricosuria in other species did not alter urate excretion in the pig PB together with pyrazinamide exerted the same inhibitory effect on urate secretion as probenecid CT pyrazinoic acid was reabsorbed at all infusion rates it is concluded that the pig kidney eliminates uric acid by filtration and secretion only
1640,the dark and light reduction of nitrate and nitrite by cellfree S9 of the bluegreen alga anacystis nidulans has been investigated the three following methods have been successfully applied to the preparation of active particulate fractions from the alga cells a shaking with glass beads b lysozyme treatment and lysis of the resulting protoplasts and c sonication the two enzymes of the nitratereducing systemnamely nitrate reductase and nitrite reductaseare firmly bound to the isolated pigmentcontaining particles and can be easily solubilized by prolonging the vibration or sonication time both enzymeswhether solubilized or bound to the particlesdepend on reduced ferredoxin as the immediate electron donor in its presence the alga particles catalyze the gradual photoreduction of nitrate to nitrite and ammonia a process that can thus be considered as one of the most simple and relevant examples of photosynthesis some of the properties of nitrate reductase have been studied nitrate reductase as well as nitrite reductase are adaptive enzymes repressed by ammonia
1641,the uptake metabolism and release of aldrin and dieldrin by the lungs were studied by use of isolated perfused rabbit lungs that were artificially ventilated and perfused through the pulmonary artery both recirculating and singlepass experiments were conducted using an artificial medium as perfusate aldrin accumulated in the lung from the perfusate through two distinct phases of uptake a rapid phase involving simple diffusion and nonspecific binding and a slower phase representing its metabolic turnover as dieldrin dieldrin was not metabolized but accumulated in the lungs by a saturable and a nonsaturable process singlepass experiments with aldrin indicated that the initial velocity of uptake could be fitted to one component and a constant representing the rate of metabolism uptake of dieldrin was biphasic one phase independent of the perfusate concentration and the other saturable with respect to the perfusate concentration by the application of MM kinetics the maximum amount of dieldrin accumulation attributable to the saturable component was calculated to be mumollung our results indicate that the accumulation of these chlorinated xenobiotics takes place through the processes of simple diffusion followed by nonspecific tissue binding there was no evidence for irreversible binding of aldrin or dieldrin its epoxide in the lung while the lung plays a role in metabolizing aldrin to dieldrin followed by a transient storage neither substrate has the potential for longterm storage in the lung
1642,in order to elucidate the general patterns of intermacromolecular surface interactions that may be involved in hemocompatibility phenomena monolayers of representative macromolecules on an octadecylsilylated glass surface were exposed to solutions of other macromolecules and the changes in interfacial composition were characterized by zeta potentialph titration curves as measured by AC flow streaming current analysis and in some cases by radiotracer labeling experiments with polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp a bloodcompatible linear polymer bovine SS albumin bsa a representative serum protein whole human serum hs a complex mixture of proteins and erythrocyte SU gp an extendedchain macromolecular amphiphile showed the following penetration of the original monolayer occurred within hr in of the possible cases it did not occur for bsa or hs monolayers exposed to pvp and probably not for pvp exposed to gp in all cases penetration was accompanied by no more than partial displacement of the original monolayer thereby generating a mixed monolayer each of the six possible binary mixed monolayers could be obtained by at least one of the two possible mixing sequences in the three binary systems containing bsa the formation of the mixed monolayer could be related to increased adsorption in the twocomponent system the two components of the mixed monolayers were not equally distributed across their thicknesses thus the outer surfaces of the pvpbsa and at neutral ph the pvphs mixed monolayers contained only pvp that of the bsahs mixtures only hs in the pvphs and probably the gpbsa and gphs mixed monolayers the composition of the outer surface appeared phdependent the resultant zeta potential versus ph profiles in the latter two cases resembled those of intact blood cells the results suggest that neither the compact monolayers of globular proteins nor the diffuse monolayers of randomly coiled watersoluble polymers can by their prior adsorption on a synthetic surface prevent the subsequent adsorption of other globular macromolecules it is possible that the randomly coiled polymers may impede the adhesion of platelets to the substrate since the results indicate that the adsorption of such polymers causes a displacement of the shear plane
1643,the action of various feedback modifiers on bacillus stearothermophilus glutamine synthetase has been investigated by initial velocity kinetics using the mnstimulated biosynthetic assay at degrees c the most potent inhibitors used singly are amp lglutamine and lalanine other modifiers of significance include glycine ctp lhistidine glucosamine phosphate and gdp marked synergism of action is observed for amp in the presence of lglutamine lhistidine adp or glucosamine phosphate glucosaminep and for ctp with adp or gdp inhibition by saturating levels of many modifiers is either less than or is not overcome by elevated substrate levels or both this argues for modifier binding sites separate from ATP CS notably in the cases of amp lglutamine glycine lalanine glucosaminep and ctp glycine and lalanine are vmax inhibitors whereas lglutamine glucosaminep gdp and ctp alter the binding of lglutamate adp and lhistidine apparently can compete directly with mnatp but amp alters mnatp binding from a separate site the action of several modifiers requires or is enhanced by bound substrates considerable antagonistic interaction is observed in experiments with modifier pairs but the most potent inhibitors show synergistic or cumulative independent interactions one may interpret antagonistic effects as due to a overlapping modifier domains or b separate but antagonistically interacting sites either interpretation leads to a scheme for modifiersubstrate and modifiermodifier site interactions in which the thermophilic enzyme must maintain and stabilize a great deal of complex functional information under extreme environmental conditions
1644,because of reports of fluroxene toxicity in man the effect of phenobarbital treatment on the toxicity and metabolism of fluroxene was studied in rhesus monkeys six monkeys that were exposed to a mean calculated AM fluroxene concentration of for hr periods up to a total of hr showed no evidence of toxicity two animals were sacrificed after a single hr exposure to obtain control measures of fluroxene metabolites in tissues four monkeys that had previously survived received exposures to fluroxene and monkeys that had no exposure to fluroxene died during fluroxene anesthesia after treatment with phenobarbital mean time hr toxicity was manifested by arterial hypotension pulmonary edema and arterial hypoxemia phenobarbital treatment enhanced production of fluroxene metabolites including the highly toxic trifluoroethanol concentrations of trifluoroethanol in mixedexpired gas blood and urine and of total nonvolatile fluorine in blood urine and tissues of animals treated with phenobarbital were to times as in control animals the results suggest that the rhesus monkey is a valuable model for the study of fluroxene pharmacology and that inclusion of an enzymeinducing challenge in the evaluation of potential toxicity of other anesthetics seems warranted
1645,the system involved in the reduction of dibromopropyl aminophenylazolbenzoic acid B6 an agent designed for treating primary CL cell cancer has been demonstrated to be localised mainly in the x g supernatant fraction of rat liver TH it is also present in other organs particularly in the SP dabazoreductase as shown previously is present almost entirely in the microsomal fraction and is found in high concentration only in liver the ph maximum for cbazoreductase implying the importance of the carboxyl group in determining substrate specificity the use of enzyme inhibitors and other additives showed that cb was not axanthine oxidase or DHF reductase its activity was not affected by carbon monoxide phenobarbitone pb or methylcholanthrene mc i.c.v. enhancement of the activity by ferrous ions and fad indicated that at least part of the reduction system could involve a flavoprotein with fad as the prosthetic group the activity of cbazoreductase and methylredazoreductase was reduced by menadione vitamin k cyanide and propylgallate a diaphorase preparation from pig heart reduced both B6 and methylred with both nadph and nadhgenerating systems
1646,serums from infected cattle cattle with persistent postvaccinal antibody and serologically positive noninfected cattle were fractionated into major immunoglobulin classes by diethylaminoethyl deaecellulose chromatography and by sucrose density gradient centrifugation each fraction was assayed for antibrucella activity by standard tubeagglutination test stt buffered tubeagglutination test btt and complementfixation test cf in the serums from experimentally INF cattle antibrucella antibody could be found by all tests in deae fractions and in slow fast and sediment regions of the density gradient serums from cattle with persistent postvaccinal titers had stt activity in all deae fractions btt activity in fractions and cf activity in only fraction the stt and btt MICs were found in the slow and the sediment regions of the gradient whereas the cf activity was found only in the slow region serums from a chronically INF animal had stt and btt MICs in deae fractions and cf activity in only the stt btt and cf activities were found in the slow and the sediment regions of the gradient the principal antibody in serums from noninfected cattle was immunoglobulin m which had all of the cf activity and most of the stt and btt activities low levels of stt and btt activities were found in other deae fractions only stt and btt activities were found in the fast and the sediment regions of the gradient
1647,bovine spleen cat b and collagenolytic cathepsin were separated by chromatography on amberlite irc and collagenolytic cathepsin was partially purified by chromatography on deaesephadex a collagenolytic cathepsin degraded insoluble tendon collagen maximally at ph and degrees c mainly alphachain components were released into solution at degrees c the telopeptides in soluble skin collagen were also cleaved to yield alphachain components collagenolytic cathepsin was thus similar to cathepsin b in its action against native collagen but mixtures of these two enzymes exhibited a synergistic effect the addition of thiolblocking compounds produced similar inhibition of collagenolytic cat and cathepsin b the enzyme responded similarly to all other compounds tested except to aminohexanoic acid when collagenolytic cathepsin was slightly activated and cat b was almost unaffected leupeptin which is a structural analogue of argininecontaining synthetic substrates inhibited collagenolytic cathepsin as effectively as cathepsin b collagenolytic cathepsin was shown to retain a low residual activity against alphanbenzoyldlarginine pnitroanilide during purification which was equivalent to of the activity of cathepsin b cathepsin b and collagenolytic cat could not be separated by affinity chromatography on organomercurialsepharose b the two enzymes could be resolved on deaesephadex a and by isoelectric focusing in an ampholine ph gradient the pi of the L1 cat b isoenzyme was and the pi of collagenolytic cat was from chromatography on sephadex g superfine grade the molecular weights were calculated to be for cathepsin b and for collagenolytic cathepsin the difference in molecular weight was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamidegel PACE
1648,this report concerns the feasibility of low volume priming extracorporeal circulation through this study the bubble oxygenator with zuhdis heat exchange was used moderate hypothermia with surface cooling and HD perfusion with per cent dw was evaluated in mongrel dogs and clinical open HR cases the results obtained here were as follow body temperature reduction by surface cooling before bypass provided more even cooling than did core cooling by LF partial bypass alone in regard to cardiac loading on returning the whole perfusate of the circuit to patient approximately mlkg of per cent dw was feasible as a priming solution to reduce the blood visicosity HD technique with per cent dw was superior and HD effect during postoperative periods was temporaly the excess lactate volume postulated by huckabee was a available index to evaluate metabolic acidosis during the extracorporeal circulation with aid of surface cooling the acidbase balance during perfusion was kept to lesser extent than that of core cooling only this T0 indicated that the low priming perfusion in conjunction with surface cooling HT was a reliable technique for the open heart operation and may be applied in more prolonged perfusion
1649,these experiments indicate that absorbance changes observed at the nm isosbestic point of the hb and hbco following laser photolysis of hbco provide a direct measure of the rates of quaternary conformational changes between rapidly reacting hb the immediate product of full photolysis and slowly reacting normal deoxyhemoglobin hb first observed by gibson gibson qh biochem j has been interpreted as deoxyhemoglobin remaining in the liganded quaternary conformation following rapid removal of ligand by a light pulse in borate buffers between ph and particularly simple phindependent results were obtained which allowed the use of a monod wyman and changeux MM monod j wyman j and changeux j j mol biol to fit the data in this case hb is taken to be r state deoxyhemoglobin partial photolysis experiments at nm show that the rate of the r t conformational change at degrees decreases by about a factor of for each additional bound ligand the rate of the ligandfree conformational change is found to be s s and respectively at degrees degrees and degrees the previously uninterpreted effects of flash length and partial photolysis on the co recombination kinetics can be explained in terms of the present model kinetic results obtained below ph are found to be inconsistent with a twostate model it appears that binding of Ins hexaphosphate produces a new rapidly reacting quaternary conformation of hbco
1650,to obtain high yields of extracellular enzymes and toxins for immunological analysis type culture collection strains of clostridium perfringens types a to d and fresh isolates of c perfringens type a from humans were grown in fermenters under controlled conditions in a prereduced proteose peptone medium the type culture collection strains all showed different characteristics with respect to growth rates and ph optima for growth production of phospholipase c alphatoxin Hly and lethal activity varied considerably between the different types growth and extracellular protein production in fermenters with ph control and static or stirred cultures were compared production of all extracellular proteins measured was markedly improved by cultivation in fermenters with ph control strain atcc produced five times more phospholipase c than any of freshly isolated strains of c perfringens type a grown under MZ conditions haemolytic and lethal MICs of the atcc strain were equal or superior to the activities of any of the freshly isolated strains there were no differences in the bacterial yields and in the production of extracellular toxins between type a strains isolated from clinical cases of gas gangrene and abdominal wounds and those isolated from faecal samples from healthy persons
1651,growth inhibitory effect of combined treatment of tetracycline tc and oleandomycin om at a ratio of on certain species of pathogenic bacteria including DR ones was examined by the crossed paper strip method synergistic effects were demonstrated against of the strains of staphylococcus aureus and all of the strains of escherichia coli studied antagonism was observed with none of the strains and with strains of streptococcus pyogenes and strains of streptococcus pneumoniae tested in the present experiments the mics determined by the agar dilution method also gave similar results although synergism was not conclusively demonstrated by this method with representative strains of s aureus synergism was evidenced by quantitative measurement of growth inhibition in some strains mug of one drug per ml of medium inhibited the induction of resistance to the second drug such a small dose of one drug also inhibited the development of a mutant resistant to the second drug these GABA actions were thought to be one of the important factors causing the synergistic effect of tc and om on drug resistant bacteria
1652,it was found that a human hepatomaassociated alp orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase ec shared electrophoretic mobility inactivation by urea inhibition by inorganic phosphate ethylenediaminetetraacetate and amino acids lphenylalanine lleucine and lhomoarginine heat stability sensitivity to neuraminidase ph optimum km value and antigen site with fast moving alp isozymes of fl cell CS derived from HAM however weekold fresh AM lacked this isozyme instead it had a placental type alp consisting of minor components the other alp isozyme of fl cells had properties common to hepatoma alp with regard to lphenylalanine sensitivity inhibition by ethylenediaminetetraacetate inactivation by urea and antigen site but differed from it in electrophoretic mobility sensitivity to lleucine and lhomoarginine and the presence of another antigen site it was more heat SD and more CS to inhibition by inorganic phosphate than hepatoma ap the possible regulatory mechanism between the hepatomatype alp and the placental type alp in the amnion cells is considered
1653,mice of different ages were evaluated with respect to their ability to give a plaqueforming cell pfc response to type iii pneumococcal polysaccharide sssiii as well as the degree of amplifier and suppressor thymusderivedt cell activity present although the magnitude of the pfc response to an optimally immunogenic dose of sssiii for and week old mice was only and respectively of that produced by AD week old mice values comparable to those of adult animals were attained by weeks of age no significant changes in the ability to respond to sssiii occurred thereafter amplifier t cell activity which was minimal at to weeks of age matured slowly and did not reach a maximum until to weeks of age by contrast Ts cell activity appeared to be fully developed at least as early as weeks of age here the inhibitory effects produced could by abrogated by depletion of t cells indicating that the unresponsiveneness induced by such cells does not result in the depletion ot irreversible inactivation of b cells capable of responding to sssiii these findings suggest that the GABA effects of suppressor TA are predominant in young mice and that such cells may play an important role in determining the ease with which unresponsiveness is induced in neonates and in the prevention of autoimmune disease also studies conducted with adultthymectomized mice showed that both amplifier and suppressor t cells once seeded to the periphery are SD and do not depend upon the presence of intact thymus for the expression or renewal of their activity
1654,the effect of feeding a relatively lowprotein diet containing dab for weeks on the activity of dabazoreductase nitroreductase pnitrobenzoic acid noxidase nndimethylaniline ndemethylase dab cytochrome p nadphcytochrome c reductase betaglucuronidase and arylsulphatase a were studied rapid decreases occurred in the activities of the first six enzymes reaching minimal values at between and weeks activities then increased in all cases to control or nearly control levels this rate of increase was least for cytochrome p at weeks azoreductase activity with the chemotherapeutic agent B6 i as substrate was significantly higher than in control rats early increases occurred in the activities of betaglucuronidase and arylsulphatase a and the activity of the latter never dropped below the control level an investigation was made of the differential effects of dye feeding on some of the enzyme activities in the two major liver lobes and differences were found the effect of phenobarbital pb pretreatment on the dabfed rats was studied at week intervals the MICs of dabazoreductase and of nitroreductase increased throughout the whole period while the activities of the lysosomal enzymes were decreased after FF dab for weeks the effect of pb and methylcholanthrene mc on the activities of dabazoreductase cbazoreductase and components of the azoreductasescytochrome p nadphcytochrome c reductase the cocbazoreductase was not induced by pb or mc and co did not inhibit its reduction its reduction depended only slightly on nadh co caused a greater relative decrease in the activity of dabazoreductase in dyefed animals and also in animals following pb and mc i.c.v. implying a greater role of cytochrome p in dyefed animals
1655,the intermediate phase of fluorescence relaxation lmsls joliot p joliot a bouges b and barbieri g photochem photobiol following a single saturating flash is shown to be controlled by a slow phase of the reoxidation of q by a AA acceptor and in vivo by the transmembrane electric field the kinetics of reoxidation of q are slowed by lowering the ph this slowing effect is interpreted in terms of the reversible formation at low ph of qh which is not oxidizable by the AA acceptor the electric field transforms photosystem ii centers into a nonquenching photochemically inactive state that cannot be attributed to an accumulation of q centers are unequally sensitive to the field a critical field strength can be defined for each center above which that center is blocked and below which the center is photochemically AS the transformation from the active to inactive state occurs over a narrow range of field strength sensitive centers are blocked by the field in less than ms and become active again in less than ms as the field strength falls two hypotheses are proposed for the mechanism of blockage of centers by the field a field induced conformational NC in the centers the formation or suppression of a dipole critical to the CF of a center the activity of the atp synthetase determining the rate of EC50 of the field was controlled by a lightdark treatment or by a chemical method using pbenzoquinone
1656,chronic administration of gl or nicotinamide in drinking water inhibits the activity of rat liver TP and subsequent withdrawal causes an enhancement the CEA is also inhibited by administration in drinking water of sucrose but not fructose which is capable of preventing the glucose effect the inhibition by glucose or nictinamide is not due to a defective apoenzyme synthesis nor a decreased cofactor availability the inhibition by nicotinamide is reversed by regeneration of liver nad and nadp in vivo by administration of fructose pyruvate or PMS inhibition by glucose is also reversed by the above agents and by nhcl reversal of inhibition by glucose or nicotinamide is also achieved in vitro by addition of nad or nadp glucose or nicotinamide increases liver nadph nadp is also increased by nicotinamide nadph is also increased by SU but not by fructose which prevents the glucose effect phenazine methosulphate prevents the increase in nadph caused by both glucose and nicotinamide it is suggested that the inhibition of tryptophan pyrrolase activity by glucose or nicotinamide is mediated by both nadph and nadh
1657,the metal content of carboxypeptidase y was analyzed by the atomic absorption method after exhaustive dialysis against an edta solution the enzyme showed no loss of activity nor any significant content of metals zhmgcacumnnife and co the activity was however rather sensitive to preincubation with various metals the reactivity of a serine residue of the enzyme was also reevaluated DFP dfp and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride pmsf stoichiometrically and irreversively inhibited the enzyme the rate of inactivation with dfp was much faster than that for typsin ec and chymotrypsin ec while the rate with pmsf was onefifteenth of that for chymotrypsin the phdependence of the inactivation by dfp was similar to that of the enzymatic hydrolysis of acetylphenylalanine ethyl ester the present results indicate that carboxypeptidase y is free of metals and has a serine residue with a vital role in the catalytic process though the PET role of this sh group remains to be clarified
1658,metachromatic leukodystrophy and maroteauxlamy syndrome can be diagnosed by assay of leukocyte or FB arylsulfatase a and b activity with the fluorogenic ATP methylumbelliferyl sulfate the arylsulfatases are extracted into a x g supernatant by sonication in sodium chloride and then separated with cm on columns or in test tubes in m sodium acetate ph arylsulfatase a is not absorbed while arylsulfatase b is retained by the resin the arylsulfatase b is then eluted from the resin with m sodium chloride the arylsulfatase a activity obtained from normal leukocytes and fibroblasts is linear for the initial minutes of the reaction is stimulated fold by mm lead acetate and inhibited by mm silver nitrate after separation with cm the arylsulfatase b activity is stimulated fold by triton x arylsulfatase a but not ASB is destroyed by heat degrees both leukocyte and FB arylsulfatase a activity was reduced to of control values in metachromatic leukodystrophy essentially no arylsulfatase b activity was detected in cells from patients with maroteauxlamy syndrome metachromatic leukodystrophy heterozygotes but not maroteauxlamy syndrome heterozygotes can also be distinguished by this method a heat inactivation technique utilizing the differential thermal stabilities of the two enzymes for diagnosis of patients with marotezuxlamy syndrome is also described the advantages of these methylumbelliferyl sulfate CA procedures over the pnitrocatechol sulfate method of assay are greater sensitivity selectivity for the desired enzyme and potential for use in large scale testing
1659,pediococcus cerevisiaeamr resistant to amethopterin possesses a higher DHF reductase tetrahydrofolate nadp oxidoreductase ec activity than the parent a folatepermeable and thus amethopterinsusceptible strain and than the wildtype the properties of DHF reductase from the three strains have been compared temperature ph optima heat stability as well amethopterin IB did not reveal significant differences between the enzymes from the susceptible and resistant strains the enzyme from the wildtype was times more sensitive to inhibition by amethopterin and more susceptible to heat denaturation the apparent km values for dihydrofolate in enzymes from the three strains were in the range of mum and for nadph mum the amethopterinresistant CS exhibited crossresistance to trimethoprim and was about fold more resistant to the latter than the sensitive parent and the wildtype the resistance to TMP appears to be a direct result of the increased dihydrofolate reductase activity inhibition of DHF reductase activity by this drug was similar in the three strains nmol caused inhibition of enzyme unit TMP was about times less ERP inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase than amethopterin the cell extract of the amr strain possessed a folate reductase activity three times higher than that of the sensitive CS the MICs of other folaterelated enzymes like TS and formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase formate tetrahydrofolate ligase adpforming ec were similar in the three strains studied
1660,immunological responses are divided into those mediated by humoral antibody bcells and those by cells tcells both depend upon the activity of small lymphocytes which become thymus or bursa analogue dependent during embryonic development primary immundeficiencies are therefor defects of lymphocytes attributed in most cases to gene defects early diagnosis is the necessary prerequisit for possible treatment tests for assessing the cellular immune status are skin testes and in vitro tests clinical syndroms are lymphocytopenia hypoplasia deficiency of lymphocytes in lymphatic tissues normal cortical GCs recurrent infections with viruses candida or pneumocystis carinii are common tests for assesing the humoral immune status are measurement of immunglobulin levels in SS isohaemagglutinins tests for antibody formation following active immunization in vitro tests clinical syndroms are no germinal centres in lymphnodes no plasma cells recurrent bacterial infections treatment of bcell deficiencies immunglobulin replacement therapy treatment of tcell deficiencies by grafting of thymus transplants combined immune deficiencies are treated with bone marrow transplants from matched donors for bone marrow transplantation GF state seems to be the ideal situation to protect the patient against infection before the therapeutic maneuver and for prevention of graft versus host reaction in the posttransplantation period
1661,the terminal phosphate of gammapatp is rapidly incorporated into cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes mumolg protein in the presence of calcium and magnesium cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes catalize an atpadp phosphate exchange in the presence of calcium and magnesium halfmaximum activation of the phosphoprotein formation and atpadp phosphate exchange is reached at an ionized calcium concentration of about mum the hill coefficients are transphosphorylation and atpadp phosphate exchange require magnesium and are maximally G1 at magnesium concentrations close to or equal to the atp concentration the phosphoprotein level is reduced to about at an adpatp ratio of the rate of calciumdependent atp splitting declines whilst the rate of the calciumdependent atpadp phosphate exchange increases when the adpatp ratio is varied from to the sum of both the rate of atp splitting and the rate of adpatp phosphate exchange remains constant phosphoprotein formation and atpadp phosphate exchange are not affected by azide dinitrophenol dicyclohexyl carbodiimide and oubain whilst both activities are reduced by blockade of sh CG localized on the outside of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane the isolated phosphoprotein is acid stable the trichloroacetic acid denatured plabelled membrane complex is dephosphorylated by hydroxylamine which might indicate that the phosphorylated protein is an acylphosphate polyacrylamide gel elctrophoresis performed with phenolacetic acidwater of phosphorylated sarcoplasmic reticulum fractions demonstrates that the pincorporation occurs into a protein of about molecular weight it is suggested that the phosphoprotein represents a EP of the calciumdependent atpase which formation occurs as an early step in the reaction sequence of calcium translocation by cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum similar as in skeletal muscle
1662,drinking water supplies of rural communities in georgetown county south carolina were randomly selected for sample collection the analysis showed that most of the waters were slightly acidic low but acceptable concentrations of chloride copper fluoride sodium cadmium nitrate and phosphate were found a few water samples showed higher then recommended levels of arsenic mercury zinc and lead although only of the samples exceeded the mandatory limit of ppm for As exceeded the recommended level of ppm the mandatory limit for manganese was exceeded in of the waters while exceeded the limit for iron the high iron content was generally responsible for the high turbidity found in of the samples the well depth and the consumer income had some bearing on water SQ statistical evidence suggested that septic tank seepage was partially responsible for nitrate phosphate iron and arsenic contamination of shallow water supplies lead concentrations appear to vary according to the plumbing used and the ph of the waters
1663,addition of ubiquinone to e coli ml membrane vesicles dramatically increases coupling between nadh oxidation and active transport such that initial rates and steadystate levels of lactose and aminoacid accumulation are comparable to those observed during dlactate oxidation similar but less dramatic effects are observed with the quinone and succinate or llactate in the presence of nadh and ubiquinone the vesicles also generate a membrane potential interior negative that is similar in magnitude to that observed in the presence of dlactate stimulation of nadhdependent transport by ubiquinone cannot be accounted for by increased rates of oxidation of nadh and the effect of the quinone on nadhdependent lactose transport is not observed in vesicles depleted of ND activity thus it is apparent that ubiquinone shunts electrons from nadh dehydrogenase nadhacceptoroxidoreductase ec to the portion of the respiratory chain containing the energycoupling site the findings demonstrate unequivocally that inefficient coupling of nadh oxidation to active transport cannot be due to the presence of inverted LDV in addition they provide further support for TPS localization of the energycoupling site
1664,twelve male lister hooded rats were conditioned to discriminate an khz tone db re dyne cm and were subsequently injected subcutaneously with kanamycin mg kg day for days during this time and for five weeks after dosage was stopped the nature and extent of the resultant hearing deficits were studied the animals preyer reflex thresholds were determined at intervals during the study only one rat was unaffected by the kanamycin dosage the onset of hearing impairment reduced discrimination performance which was gradual in some rats and sudden in others generally occurred during the fourth week of kanamycin dosage although the earliest onset was towards the end of the second week in most animals the hearing impairment progressed after kanamycin was stopped and in one rat there was a latency between the end of drug dosage and ON of hearing impairment hearing impairment was irreversible in five rats one rat whose impairment was slight recovered normal hearing some rats showed a reduced discrimination performance at a time when their preyer reflex threshold showed no elevation suggesting that kanamycin at least initially caused a threshold elevation rather than reduced sensitivity to intense sounds
1665,heterogeneities of the two ovalbumin glycopeptides manglcnacasn and manglcnacasn were revealed by borate paper PACE of oligosaccharide alcohols obtained from the glycopeptides by endobetanacetylglucosaminidase h digestion and nabh reduction the structures of the major components of the oligosaccharides were determined by the combination of methylation analysis acetolysis and alphamannosidase digestion based on the results the whole structures of the major components of manglcnacasn and manglcnacasn were elucidated as manalpha leads to manalpha leads to manalpha leads to manalpha leads to manbeta leads to glcnacbeta leads to glcnac leads to asn and manalpha leads to manalpha leads to manalpha leads to manalpha leads to manalpha leads to manbeta leads to glcnacbeta leads to glcnac leads to asn respectively since endobetanacetylglucosamini dase d hydrolyzes manglcnacasn but not manglcnacasn the presence of the unsubstituted alphamannosyl residue linked at the c position of the terminal mannose of manbeta leads to glcnacbeta leads to glcnacasn core must be essential for the action of the enzyme
1666,f nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to study the effects of salts and denaturants on the structure and aggregation properties of several trifluoroacetyl derivatives of insulin this technique has been shown to be a powerful tool in the T0 of specific sites on the protein molecule CD and sedimentation velocity studies were also carried out to aid in the interpretation of the magnetic resonance data at ph zn had no effect on the f magnetic resonance spectrum however citrate and acetate ions significantly sharpened the signal from the trifluoroacetyl probe at the nterminal end glycine a of the insulin a chain no alterations were observed in the sw value of circular dichroic spectra suggesting that the probe had gained a considerable degree of motional freedom without changes in aggregation or conformational properties in the absence of perturbants the trifluoroacetyl group on glycine a showed considerably more motional freedom than on phenylalanine b guanidine hydrochloride and sodium dodecyl sulfate were used to study the unfolding of several trifluoroacetylinsulin derivatives the results suggested differential alterations in the environments of the probes located at glycine a phenylalanine b and lysine b in the insulin molecule as the concentration of perturbant was increased
1667,s mutans strain mt from an AS carious lesion in the tooth of a child had type e specificity and showed a crossreaction with the lancefield group e cell wall streptococcal SPA heatkilled cells mt adhered to a glass surface in the presence of cgt mt and SU pretreatment of the cells with antimt whole cell serums inhibited adherecne the removal of glycerol teichoic acid antibody and group e antibody from the mt serum did not result in a loss of GABA activity antiserum with or without adsorption significantly inhibited glucan synthesis by cgt from sucrose antibodies TPS for the polyglycerol phosphate of teichoic acid did not inhibit adherence antigroup e serum and serums specific for other types of s mutans did not show adherence LIA except for an occasional type c TPS AS antibody TPS for the type e antigen produced significant inhibition of the IB of cgt to the mt cell wall and adherence of these cells did not occur antibody to cgt inhibited glucan synthesis treatment of the cells with dextranase dextran antibody or trypsin caused a significant reduction in adherence the results suggest that the type antigen and dextran on the surface of the s mutans type e cell are PET in adherence and that these polymers are associated with cell wall protein
1668,a lysosomal fraction was separated by densitygradient centrifugation from a HP human polymorphonuclear leucocyte suspension some different lysosomal enzymes were assayed for activity in the presence of various concentrations of glycosaminoglycans the acid hydrolases assayed were strongly inhibited to different degrees by low mmoll concentrations of glycosaminoglycans in a phdependent manner thus inhibitions were stronger below ph with activity returning to control values at about ph on a molar basis the LIA for the several glycosaminoglycans studied was heparin greater than chondroitin sulphate greater than hyaluronic acid once the glycosaminoglycanacid hydrolase complex was formed it was partially dissociated by slight elevations in the ph of the incubation medium by increasing the ionic strength of the incubation medium or by adding several cationic proteins eg histone protamine as leucocytic lysosomes contain large amounts of chondroitin sulphate and have a strongly acid intragranular ph we suggest that glycosaminoglycans may modify lysosomal CF through the formation of complexes with lysosomal enzymes by inhibiting the digestive activity of the acid hydrolases when the intralysosomal ph is below their pi
1669,when HP myelin from rat sciatic nerve was incubated with gammapatp protein components of the membrane were phosphorylated indicating the presence of both the ATP receptor protein and an endogenous kinase in the membrane PAGE of the phosphorylated membrane proteins followed by scintillation counting of gel slices and ARG showed that the polypeptides of molecular weights and were phosphorylated and p from gammapatp having been incorporated into serine residues of the substrate proteins phosphorylation of purified myelin was mgdependent was optimal at ph and was not stimulated by adenosine monophosphate we found that proteins other than those in myelin such as phosvitin casein protamine and histones can also act as a substrate for the membrane associated kinase muscle protein kinase inhibitor had no effect on the endogenous phosphorylation of myelin proteins or on the phosphorylation of phosvitin by IP nerve myelin protein kinase however the phosphorylation of histone by peripheral nerve myelin protein kinase was inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor after washing the membrane with mm kcl the protein kinase that utilizes histone as ATP was found in the supernatant in contrast the endogenous phosphorylation of membrane proteins or the phosphorylation of phosvitin by the membrane associated kinase was not affected by washing from these findings we conclude that at least two protein kinase systems exist in purified PN myelin one system is not inhibited by muscle kinase inhibitor is tightly bound to the membrane and utilizes as its receptor proteins either exogenous phosvitin or endogenous membrane proteins the second system is inhibited by muscle kinase inhibitor is removable from the membrane and utilizes histones as its receptor proteins
1670,nonenzymatic formation of dipicolinic acid dpa from diketopimelic acid and ammonia was clearly demonstrated using a new method for dpa analysis the reaction rates of dpa formation were almost the same under aerobic and anaerobic conditions nearly equimolecular quantities of dpa and tetrahydrodipicolinic acid were detected in spontaneous reaction mixture the spontaneous reaction seemed to be due to dismutation of dihydrodipicolinic acid resulting in dpa and tetrahydrodipicolinic acid the apparent optimum ph of the spontaneous reaction was and the maximal rate of dpa formation was observed with a molar ratio of diketopimelic acid to ammonia the rate of the spontaneous reaction was stimulated by ferrous sulfate fmn and riboflavin dihydrodipicolinate reductase catalyzes the reduction of dihydrodipicolinate prepared from pyruvate and aspartic betasemialdehyde with nadph as reductant the reductase was isolated from Bs and found to stimulate dpa formation from diketopimelic acid and ammonia the enzymatic dpa formation was absolutely dependent on oxygen and optimum ph was the catalytic action of the enzyme was similar to that of the oxidase possible mechanisms of dpa formation from diketopimelic acid and ammonia are proposed
1671,hemin allows maximal protein synthesis in intact rabbit reticulocytes and their cellfree lysate S9 by retarding the formation of a translational repressor hcr found in the postribosomal supernate in order to evaluate the role of hcr in the pathogenesis of hypochromic anemias hcr was isolated and partially purified from intact rb reticulocytes incubated in vitro with either mm alphaalphadipyridyl an ironchelating agent or m ethanol both of these agents inhibit reticulocyte protein synthesis hemin mum protects against the inhibition by both agents a ferrous irontransferrin mixture however protects only against alphaalphadipyridyl both alphaalphadipyridyl and ethanol inhibit heme synthesis before the time that protein synthesis is affected while neither lowers either atp or gsh levels these results indicate that while both agents inhibit heme synthesis alphaalphadipyridyl does so by inducing ID while ethanol works at a nonironrequiring step when hcr was isolated from intact cells and assayed in the reticulocyte cellfree systems plus and minus hemin premature appearance of hcr was found in cells incubated in vitro with alphaalphadipyridyl or ethanol when hemin was present in the intact cell incubation the appearance of hcr was retarded the hcr from alphaalphadipyridyl ethanoltreated cells was partially purified and eluted at the same location on a sephadex g column molecular weight approximately x as that from postribosomal supernates incubated minus hemin in addition rabbits with phenylhydrazineinduced hemolytic anemia were given intravenous ethanol in vivo at a dose of mlkg this concentration of alcohol resulted in an inhibition of the rate of heme synthesis and protein synthesis as well as an acceleration of hcr formation in reticulocytes the hcr from these in vivo treated rabbits was isolated partially purified and assayed in an identical fashion as the in vitro experiments these in vivo experiments further support the physiological and pathophysiological role of hcr in reticulocytes on the basis of these results a model for a role of hcr in some of the hypochromic anemias is proposed in iron deficiency or chronic disease where iron is not available to the erythroblast for heme synthesis hcr appears prematurely and inhibits protein synthesis when heme synthesis is inhibited by ethanol but there is sufficient intracellular iron hcr appears prematurely and inhibits protein synthesis iron accumulates in the erythroblast and the end result is sideroblastic anemia
1672,the in vivo administration of the radiolabeled lung toxin alphanaphthylthiourea antu to rats leads to the CB of radioactivity to the macromolecules of the lung and liver in contrast very little radioactivity is bound in these organs when an equal amount of the clabeled oxygen analog of antu calphanaphthylurea anu is administered in addition anu is essentially nontoxic to rats antu is metabolized in vitro by lung and liver microsomes to an intermediate which covalently binds to the macromolecules of the microsomes this CB which requires nadph leads to a decrease in mixedfunction oxidase activity and to a decrease in the level of cytochrome p detectable as its carbon monoxide complex incubation of microsomes with antu in the absence of nadph or with anu in the presence of nadph has no effect on these parameters i.c.v. of rats with small nonlethal doses of antu daily for days brings about a decrease in the activity of the mixedfunction oxidase enzyme system in the lung which metabolizes parathion in addition this pretreatment decreases the toxicity of antu and leads to a decrease in the amount of radioactivity bound to the macromolecules of the lung when the animals are given a lethal dose of santu these data suggest that the lung toxicity of antu is brought about by its metabolic activation and CB to lung macromolecules
1673,the reaction of mucor miehei protease with concanavalin a was followed by a turbidimetric CA in the ph range at ph no turbidity developed but binding of the enzyme to concanavalin a could be demonstrated by gel filtration two fractions of apparent molecular weight and were isolated the molecular weight species apparently representing a protomer of concanavalin a bound to the enzyme an analysis of the circular dichroism spectrum of this complex suggested that protomer binding results in a conformational change in the enzyme which is associated with a increase in proteolytic activity at ph the enzyme was strongly bound to columns of concanavalin a sepharose but could be removed by including alphamethyl dglucoside and nac in the elution buffer some column degradation occurred at room temperature but was not detectable at degrees c where rapid elution of the enzyme resulted in a greater than yield of highly AS protein periodateoxidized mucor miehei protease and mucor renin did not react with concanavalin a and were not bound to the affinity column
1674,the effect of cyclicampdependent phosphorylation on the activity of isolated pig liver pyruvate kinase was studied it was found that the major kinetic effect of the phosphorylation was to reduce the affinity for the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate k for this ATP increasing from to mm upon phosphorylation the cooperative effect with phosphoenolpyruvate was enhanced the hill constant nh increasing concomitantly from to v was unaltered the NC in activity occurred in parallel with the phosphate incorporation except during the initial part of the reaction when inactivation was correspondingly slower the affinity for the second substrate adp was unchanged with an apparent km of mm at saturating concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate likewise the requirement for potassium was unaffected whereas the phosphoenzyme required a higher concentration of magnesium ions for maximal activity compared with the control enzyme the GABA effect of the phosphorylation was counteracted by positive effectors fructose biphosphate in micromolar concentrations CR activated the phosphoenzyme resulting in an enzyme with properties similar to the fructose biphosphateactivated unphosphorylated enzyme with k for phosphoenolpyruvate about mm and with a hill constant of hydrogen ions were also effective in activating the phosphoenzyme thus when ph was lowered from to the inhibition due to phosphorylation was abolished the phosphoenzyme was CS to further inhibition by negative effectors such as atp and alanine mm atp increased k for phosphoenolpyruvate to mm and nh to the corresponding values with alanine were mm and phosphorylation is thought to be an additional mechanism of inhibition of the enzyme under gluconeogenetic conditions
1675,phloretin IB to red blood cell components has been characterized at ph where binding and inhibitory potency are maximal IB to IN red cells and to purified hemoglobin are nonsaturated processes approximately equal in magnitude which strongly suggests that most of the red cell IB may be ascribed to hemoglobin this conclusion is supported by the fact that homoglobinfree red cell ghosts can bind only as much phloretin as an equivalent number of red cells the permeability of the red cell membrane to phloretin has been determined by a direct measurement at the timecourse of the phloretin uptake at a hematocrit the half time for phloretin uptake is s corresponding to a permeability coefficient of x cms the concentration dependence of the binding to ghosts reveals two saturable components phloretin binds with high affinity k diss mum to about x CS per cell it also binds with lower affinity kdiss mum to a second x per cell set of sites in sonicated total lipid extracts of red cell ghosts phloretin binding consists of a single saturable component its affinity and total number of CS are not significantly different from those of the LA binding process in ghosts no high affinity binding of phloretin is exhibited by the red cell lipid extracts therefore the high affinity phloretin IB CS are related to membrane proteins and the LA CS result from phloretin IB to lipid the identification of these two types of binding CS allows phloretin effects on proteinmediated transport processes to be distinguished from effects on the lipid region of the membrane
1676,dextranases produced by p lilacinum nrrl and nrrl and by p funiculosum nrrl were studied for their possible incorporation into a dental plaque elimination system the following properties of the enzymes were compared effect of the ph level on the activity and the stability of the enzymes on the acid side of the ph range molecular weight affinity to sephadex g which served as a model for insoluble dextran in plaques and the extent of hydrolytic action on dextrans containing alpha alpha and alpha bonds in various proportions the enzyme of p funiculosum nrrl certainly has its limitations as a plaquedegrading enzyme for example diminished activity at a high ph level and lack of activity on alpha bonds however from our studies and from a survey of the relevant literature with respect to the aforementioned properties in other dextranases the enzyme of p funiculosum nrrl emerges as a suitable choice for incorporation as dextranase possibly together with other enzymes into an enzymatic dental PI beta system
1677,a neurogenic betaadrenergic vasodilatation in skeletal muscle has been indicated by some recent investigations the present study describes the extent to which this neurogenic betadilator mechanism contributes to the integrated vascular response in consecutive sections of the muscle vascular bed during sympathetic nerve activation this was done by studying the V1 reactions to graded sympathetic stimulation hz before and after betaadrenoceptor blockade betablockade did not influence significantly the sympathetically induced changes of total muscle vascular resistance or capacitance vascular tone in the microvessels during stimulation was however clearly more pronounced in the betablocked than in the nonblocked region as revealed by segmental resistance analysis and by determination of precapillary sphincter tone cfc in addition betablockade markedly reduced the net transcapillary absorption of extravascular fluid evoked by nerve activation this effect could be ascribed to the mentioned influence on the precapillary sphincters leading to a decrease of the number of capillaries available for transcapillary exchange and to a limitation of the nerve induced fall of capillary HP the described effects of alphablockade were observed at all rates of sympathetic stimulationthe conclusion was reached that the betaadrenergic dilator component of the sympathetic V1 response in skeletal muscle significantly modifies the alphaadrenergic constriction in the microvessels it is suggested that in the IN organism this neurogenic betadilator mechanism is primarily aimed at improving the transcapillary exchange
1678,a ribonuclease purified fold from human CL was found to be inactive against synthetic homopolynucleotides whereas synthetic copolymers containing adenylic acid were rapidly degraded the specificity of the rnase is unique in that only purine residues in a ratio of guanylic to adenylic acid are found at the termini of the degradation products of yeast rna no specificity was observed at the termini of the fragments when analyzed by deaecellulose chromatography approximately of the oligonucletoides were to residues in length the hydrolysis of rna by the liver enzyme when examined in low ionic strength buffer could be increased severalfold over control C2 by the addition of polyamines the enzyme was found to exist as two distinct species on sucrose gradients with molecular weights of and however the addition of spermidine to the gradients resulted in the REC of all the enzyme activity as the smaller species the PAs were also shown to reverse the inhibition of the enzyme by the ordered polynucleotides polyguanylic acid and polyadenylic acid inhibition of CEA by the polyadenylic acid segment of various mammalian mrnas was also demonstrated
1679,aflatoxicol r was isolated from mt shasta strain rainbow trout salmo gairdneri and liver homogenates were incubated with aflatoxin b its identity was confirmed by mass infrared and ultraviolet spectrometry the structure was identical to one of the diastereomers prepared by chemical reduction of aflatoxin b AFL was apparently formed by a reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphatedependent soluble enzyme of the x g supernatant from rainbow trout AFL was not lethal in phosphate buffer to bacillus subtilis gsy metb hisa uvr nor were aflatoxins b q and b in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine CpG phosphate and trout liver microsomes aflatoxicol reduced the viability of b subtilis aflatoxin b which lacks the vinyl ether present in the other EDC could not be activated the product of aflatoxin b activation by trout liver microsomes was sought after incubation of clabeled aflatoxin b the radioactivity was found in unaltered aflatoxin b and in three extremely polar metabolites the quantity of the new metabolites and the level of microbial lethality was reduced by addition of cytosine and cysteine to the incubation medium the vinyl ether configuration was a structural requirement for activation and this finding and the nature of the enzymatic reaction were consistent with the hypothesis that the compounds were metabolized to highly reactive and unstable electrophilic products which bound to nucleophiles such as cytosine and were lethal to b subtilis the formation of AFL as the L1 product of trout CL metabolism is of great significance considering that it could be G1 to a lethal compound and that rainbow trout are one of the most sensitive species to aflatoxin binduced carcinoma
1680,histological and histochemical methods were used to study the ovaries of greenland seal pagophoca groenlandica from birthtime up to years of age and mature females of phoca vitulina and erignathus barbatus the ovary of the newborn greenland seal has fetal medullary substance which is a provisory endocrinous gland producing not only sex hormones but also corticosteron in other species of seals the intestinal cells of the medullary substance are the equivalent of this gland within weeks T3 birth the reduction of the fetal medullary substance is completed it is substituted by the connective tissue and the ovary acquires its typical structure the rest of the fetal medullary substance is in the depth of the SC and near the infundibulum of the ovary as lipofuscincontaining cells when the maturation period approaches the process of the follicle atresia regularly changes the epithelium dies quicker and the multiplication of intestinal cells increases the ovaries of seals are rich in interstitial cells their amount cyclically changes the cells producing steroid hormones always well hydrolize as naphthylphosphates the reaction with glycerophosphate is more variable the connective tissue is poor in acid mucopolysaccharides its amorphous substance in the ovary cortex is rich in protein senile changes of the ovary are noticed in the seal beginning from years of age
1681,the escherichia coli b GS has been purified to apparent homogeneity with the use of a aminobutylsepharose column two fractions of the enzyme were obtained glycogen synthase i with a specific activity of mumol mg and devoid of branching enzyme activity and GS ii having a specific activity of mumol mg and containing branching CEA which was of the activity observed for the glycogen synthase only one protein band was found in disc gel electrophoresis for each glycogen synthase fraction and they were coincident with GS activity one major protein band and one very faint protein band which hardly moved into the gel were observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the glycogen synthase fractions the S1 molecular weight of the major protein band in sodium dodecyl sulfate gel PACE of both glycogen synthase fractions was determined to be the molecular weights of the native enzymes were determined by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation glycogen synthase i had a molecular weight of while GS ii had a molecular weight of on standing at degrees c or at degrees c both enzymes transform into species having molecular weights of and thus AS forms of the e coli b glycogen synthase can exist as dimers trimers and tetramers of the S1 the enzyme was shown to catalyze transfer of gl from adpglucose to maltose and to higher oligosaccharides of the maltodextrin series but not to glucose gluconolactone was shown to be a potent inhibitor of the GS reaction the glycogen synthase reaction was shown to be reversible formation of labeled adpglucose occurred from either cadp or cglycogen the ratio of adp to adpglucose at equilibrium at degrees c was determined and was found to vary threefold in the ph range of from these data the ratio of adp to adpglucose at equilibrium was determined to be assuming that deltaf degrees of the hydrolysis of the alphaglucosidic linkage is kcal the deltaf degrees of hydrolysis of the glucosidic linkage in adpglucose is kcal
1682,physicochemical properties of mixtures of spectrin and actin extracted from human erythrocyte ghosts have been correlated with ultrastructural changes observed in freezefractured erythrocyte CM extracted mixtures of spectrin and actin have a very low solubility less than mugml near their isoelectric point ph these mixtures are also precipitated by low concentrations of ca mg polylysine or basic proteins all conditions which precipitate extracts of spectrin and actin also induce aggregation of the intramembrane particles in spectrindepleted erythrocyte ghosts precipitation of the residual Sp molecules into small patches on the cytoplasmic surface of the ghost membrane is thought to be the cause of particle aggregations implying an association between the spectrin molecules and the IMPs when fresh ghosts are exposed to conditions which precipitate extracts of spectrin and actin only limited particle aggregation occurs instead the contraction of the intact Sp meshwork induced by the precipitation conditions compresses the lipid bilayer of the membrane causing it to bleb off particlefree proteinfree vesicles the absence of protein in these lipid vesicles implies that all the proteins of the EA membrane are immobilized by association with either the spectrin meshwork or the intramembrane particles
1683,nucleotides have at least two functions in eukaryotic cilia and flagella atp originating in the cells is utilized for motility by energytransducing proteins called dynein and the IB of guanine nucleotides to tubulin and probably certain transformations of the bound nucleotides are prerequisites for the assembly of microtubules besides dynein which can be solubulized from chlamydomonas flagella as a heterogeneous mg or caactivated atpase we have purified and characterized five other flagellar enzymes involved in nucleotide transformations a homogeneous low molecular weight caspecific adenosine triphosphatase was isolated which was inhibited by mg and was not specific for atp this enzyme was not formed by treating purified dynein with proteases it was absent from extracts of tetrahymena cilia its function might be an auxiliary SE transducer or in steering or tactic responses two species of adenylate kinase were isolated one of which was much elevated in regenerating flagella the latter was also present in cell HB a large part of flagellar nucleoside diphosphokinase activity could not be solubilized two soluble enzyme species were identified one of which was also present in cell bodies since these enzymes are of interest because they might function in microtubule assembly we studied the extent to which brain nucleoside diphosphokinase copolymerizes with tubulin purified by repeated cycles of polymerization arginine kinase was not detected in chlamydomonas flagellar extracts
1684,the metabolism of parathion has been examined by use of a reconstituted mixedfunction oxidase enzyme system isolated from the livers of phenobarbitalpretreated rabbits the cytochrome p used in these studies was apparently homogeneous as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate PAGE and by CA of the preparation for contaminating microsomal enzymes and enzyme activity these studies revealed that the apparently homogeneous preparation of cytochrome p in the presence of the appropriate cofactors can catalyze the conversions of parathion to both paraoxon and diethyl phosphorothioic acid the present studies have also shown that parathion is metabolized by the reconstituted mixedfunction oxidase enzyme system to diethyl phosphoric acid a product which in previous studies with IN liver microsomes had been thought to arise exclusively from the hydrolysis of paraoxon by a microsomal esterases the available data suggest that all three of the products of the metabolism of parathion by the reconstituted mixedfunction oxidase enzyme system namely paraoxon diethyl phosphorothioic acid and diethyl phosphoric acid are formed nonenzymatically by breakdown by different pathways of a common enzymatically formed intermediate this common intermediate is thought to be the sulfine derivative of parathion formed in the mixedfunction oxidasecatalyzed addition of an oxygen atom to one of the unshared electron pairs of the thionosulfur atom
1685,methioninase of pseudomonas putida was purified to homogeneity as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a specific activity fold higher than that of the CE the purified enzyme had an sw of a molecular weight of and an isoelectric point of a break in the arrhenius plot was observed at degrees and the E(a) below and above this temperature were and kcal per mole respectively in addition to lmethionine various ssubstituted derivatives of homocysteine and cysteine could serve as substrates dmethionine oxomethylthiobutanoate and related non sulfurcontaining amino acids were inert equimolar formation of alphaketobutyrate and chsh was observed with methionine as a ATP in addition to the protein peak at nm two absorption maxima were observed at and nm at ph hydroxylamine removed the enzymebound pyridoxal phosphate resulting in almost complete resolution with the concomitant disappearance of both peaks reconstruction of the treated enzyme could be achieved by addition of the cofactor the km value was calculated to be mum the reported purified enzyme should be designated as lmethionine methanethiollyase deaminating
1686,phosphoglycerate mutase and bisphosphoglycerate synthase mutase can both be phosphorylated by either glyceratep or glyceratep to form phosphohistidine enzymes the present T0 uses a rapid quench procedure to determine if for each enzyme the formation of the phosphorylated enzyme and phosphate transfer from the enzyme can occur at rates consistent with the overall reactions with bisphosphoglycerate synthase from horse red blood cells glyceratep leads to glyceratep at ph degrees phosphorylation of the enzyme appears ratelimiting k s compared with kcat s for the overall synthase rate phosphoryl transfer from the enzyme to phosphoglycerate occurs at s at degrees and was too fast to measure at degrees with chicken muscle phosphoglycerate mutase the halftimes were too short to measure under optimal conditions the rate of enzyme phosphorylation by glyceratep at ph degrees could account for the overall reaction rate of s the rate of phosphoryl transfer from the enzyme to glyceratep was too rapid to measure under the same conditions it is concluded that the phosphorylated enzymes have kinetic properties consistent with their participation as intermediates in the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes
1687,reserpine was the most potent rescinnamine the next and syrosingopine the weakest in the depleting effects on brain amines of rauwolfia alkaloids after syrosingopine BB dopamine da was decreased to a smaller degree and with a shorter duration as compared with norepinephrine ne and serotonin ht whereas reserpine elicited a marked and long lasting reduction in these amines accordingly syrosingopine induced a depletion of brain ne and ht without alteration in BB da content days T3 administration repeated administrations of syrosingopine mgkg daily for or days resulted in similar alterations in brain amine levels this selective depleting effect of syrosingopine on brain amines was potentiated by combined treatment with disulfiram or fusaric acid a dopamine betahydroxylase inhibitor under the condition of selective depletion of BB amines induced by repeated administrations of syrosingopine mgkg daily for days the analgesic action of morphine was not affected whereas reserpine and tetrabenazine antagonized morphine analgesia concomitant with inducing a depletion of all brain amines the results suggest that brain da may be more important than brain ne or ht with regard to the mechanisms by which morpine produces analgesia
1688,an experimental MM is presented demonstrating that penetrating corneal grafts in the rabbit may be rejected by passive transfer into the AC of specifically sensitized lymphoid cells destruction of histoincompatible corneal endothelium is always marked by the formation of focal pocklike areas of damage in this system rather than by the typical moving L1 of rejecting EC usually seen in spontaneous graft rejection where the transferred lymphoid cells are compatible with the tissues of the graft recipient the picture is one of a severely affected graft on a field of uninvolved recipient corneal endothelium where the lymphoid cells are compatible with the graft and not with the tissues of the recipient one sees a clear corneal VG surviving on a field of EC destruction on the recipient bed the specificity of these reactions is illustrated in terms of the histocompatibility relationships between corneal donor VG recipient and the donor of the sensitized lymphoid cells
1689,a twostage process of submerged citric acid fermentation with replacement of growth medium by fermentation medium has been worked out the optimum composition of mineral nutrients and ph of the fermentation medium of the second stage of the process were determined an addition of gl of nhno as nitrogen source and gl of mgsoho as magnesium source ensured effective conversion of sucrose to citric acid an addition to khpo on the other hand was definitely unfavourable as it considerably reduced the product yield the medium for the second stage of fermentation should be acidified to about ph while the water used for washing the mycelium from the remains of the GM should have a ph of under these conditions with an initial sucrose concentration of gl T3 hr fermentation at degrees up to gl of citric acid was obtained which corresponds to a productivity of over gl day the highest activity for citric acid formation was found in three or fourdayold mycelium
1690,bovine brain purinenucleoside phosphorylase purinenucleosideorthophosphate ribosyltransferase ec was purified to homogeneity at a TPS activity of mumol min mg of protein a molecular weight of was calculated for the native enzyme by fel filtration on sephadex gel PACE in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated subunits of molecular weight of chemical and kinetic studies strongly implicated histidine and cysteine as catalytic groups at the AS site of the enzyme the pkas determined for ionizable groups at the AS site of the free enzyme were and enzyme completely inactivated by pchloromercuribenzoate was partially reactivated enzyme a strong susceptibility to photooxidation in presence of methylene blue was observed photoinactivation was ph dependent implicating histidine as the susceptible group at the active site a rapid loss of catalytic activity upon incubation at degrees c suggested heat lability an activation energy of kcalmol was calculated the nature of the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme was investigated and initial velocity studies showed linear converging patterns of doublereciprocal plots of the data consistent with a sequential catalytic mechanism the product inhibition pattern was at variance with both the ordered bibi and random mechanisms the observed competition between purine and nucleoside and between inorganic orthophosphate and ribose phosphate for this ordered mechanism suggest a theorellchance mechanism michaelis constants determined for substrates of the enzyme were x m for guanosine x m for guanine and x m for inorganic orthophosphate
1691,an enzyme that transfers Gal from udpgal to ganglioside gm taysachs ganglioside was concentrated times in golgi apparatus from rat liver relative to total homogenates this enzyme required detergents or phospholipids as dispersing agents of the numerous detergents tested sodium taurocholate and triton cf were most effective in stimulating the reaction cardiolipin alone was more effective than any of the detergents tested in stimulating enzyme activity the ph optimum for the reaction varied with the nature of the dispersing agent with sodium taurocholate triton cf and cardiolipin the ph optima were and respectively the enzyme had a nearly absolute requirement for mn with maximum activity being attained at a concentration of mm mn other divalent or trivalent cations were either less effective than mn or inhibited the transferase reaction the km values calculated for udpgal and gm were x m and x m respectively the enzyme could not be dissociated from golgi apparatus fractions by treatment with ultrasound indicating that it is tightly associated with the membrane and not part of the luminal contents the newly synthesized gm the product of the reaction was incorporated into or became tightly associated with the membranes of the GA
1692,several models for the action of alpha amylase have been proposed to account for the nonrandom distribution of OS in the amylase digests of PSs the preferredattack MM attempts to account for the nonrandom distribution by assuming that the probability for bond cleavage depends upon the position of the bond in the chain the repetitive or multipleattack model suggests that the nonrandom distribution of OS arises because an amylase can form a cagelike complex with a ATP and attack it several times during a single encounter the multipleenzyme or dualsite model suggests that the nonrandom yield of oligosaccharides arises from the combined action of exo and endoenzymes the effects of ph inhibitors and substrate chainlength on enzyme action have been studied in several laboratories to determine which of the three actionpatterns best describes the action of alpha amylase the influence of these variables on product distributions or enzyme actionpatterns are mathematically modeled in the appendix the exp data on porcinepancreatic alpha amylase are discussed in the CS of the derivations
1693,a mass fragmentographic method of high accuracy for determination of serum urea is described a fixed amount of nurea is added to a fixed amount of SS then the urea is converted into diallyl barbituric acid by coupling with diallyl malonic acid diethyl ester the barbiturate is then transferred from an ALP water phase into an organic phase containing methyl iodine by ionpair SE using tetrabutyl ammonium as the positive counterion the amount of urea is determined from the ratio between the recordings at me and me obtained after analysis with a combined gas chromatographmass spectrometer equipped with an midunit multipleion detector the two ions used correspond to the molecular peak in the mass spectrum of the methyl derivative of unlabeled and labeled diallyl barbituric acid respectively the relative standard deviation of the method was a comparison between the mass fragmentographic method and a routine method for determination of serum urea based on the ureaseberthelot reaction gave a high correlation r and a regression coefficient of
1694,a gaschromatographic method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of NAL alphanaltrexol and betanaltrexol as trimethylsiyl derivatives analysis of urine from rb monkey and rat demonstrated that like man these species reduce naltrexone primarily to betanaltrexol in naltrexone maintenance patients receiving mg po three times per week an average of of the dose was recovered in hr urine as free NAL conjugated NAL free betanaltrexol and conjugated betanaltrexol thirtyfour percent of the dose appeared in hr and during hr the ratio of betanaltrexol to NAL rose from at hr to hr monkeys receiving a daily dose of mgkg po chronically excreted very little free betanaltrexol and exhibited an apparent sexrelated difference in excretion patterns with females excreting more than twice as much total base as males rabbits given a dose of mgkg ip for days excreted conjugated naltrexone as the predominant urinary metabolite accounting for of total base recovered in hr in rats receiving mgkg po less than of the administered dose could be accounted for in the hr urine indicating that although the betanaltrexol is produced as a urinary metabolite other means of disposition of the drug must exist thus in man and the monkey betanaltrexol is the predominant and persistent urinary metabolite urinary excretion profiles of NAL differ greatly between species commonly examined for chronic toxicity studies
1695,galactosegrown cells of streptococcus lactis ml acculated alphaaminoisobutyric acid aib by using SE derived from glycolysis and Arg catabolism the transport system displayed lowaffinity michaelismenten saturation kinetics using galactose or Arg as energy sources similar v max and k m values for aib entry were obtained but on prolonged incubation the intracellular steadystate concentration of aib in cells metabolizing Arg was only to that attained by glycolyzing cells efflux of aib from preloaded cells was temperature dependent and exhibited the characteristics of a firstorder reaction the rate of aib exit was accelerated two to threefold in the presence of metabolizable energy sources metabolic inhibitors including pchloromercuribenzoate dinitrophenol azide arsentate and n ndicyclohexylcarbodiimide either prevented or greatly reduced aib uptake fluoride iodoacetate and nethylmaleimide abolished galactosedependent but not arginineenergized aib uptake k and rb reduced the steadystate intracellular aib concentration by approximately and these cations also induced rapid efflux of solute from actively transporting cells equivalent concentrations mm of na li or nh were much less inhibitory the protonconducting ionophores tetrachlorosalicylanilide and carbonylcyanide mchlorophenlyhydrazone abolished uptake and induced aib efflux even though glycolysis and arginine catabolism continued at and respectively of control rates a proton motive force is most likely involved in the AS transport of aib whereas data from efflux studies suggest that SE is coupled to aib exit in cells of s lactis ml
1696,the purpose of this work was in investigate the capability of cell extracts of escherichia coli and e coli treated with colicin k to catalyze the following energydependent reverse transhydrogenase reaction nadp nadh atp in equilibrium nadph nad adp pi under anaerobic conditions this reaction requires the presence of a specific portion of the ETC a functional energy coupling system including an adenosine triphosphatase enzyme and atp as energy source the atplinked reaction was partially inhibited in french press extracts of e coli k c cells that had been pretreated with colicin k but not in extracts from similarly treated cells of a colicintolerant mutant UC of extracts yielded particulate fractions competent in catalyzing the reaction this reaction is substantially inhibited in fractions from colicintreated cells the extent of inhibition increased with increasing concentration of colicin supernatants also supported atplinked formation of nadph but this reaction was insensitive to the colicin effect a comparison between the requirement of the reaction in supernatant and particulate fractions suggests that the reaction in the supernatant is different from the one inhibited by colicin the atphydrolyzing ability of particulate fractions from the control or treated bacteria was identical likewise the electron transport chain was not affected by colicin treatment as evidenced from lack of effect on NOX SDH and nadphnad transhydrogenase it is concluded that colicin k interferes with the coupling of atp the utilization of the intermediate for the atplinked transdehydrogenase reaction
1697,the effects of ritodrine hydrochloride were evaluated in toxemic patients in active labor utilizing continuous electronic monitoring of fetal and maternal cardiovascular systems and uterine activity fetal scalp blood and free flowing maternal antecubital A-V blood was obtained for ph po pco base deficit and blood gl determinations prior to and immediately following the T0 period the initial ritodrine dose was mugmin for T2 the dose was increased by mugmin each minutes until there was a clinically apparent reduction in uterine activity once this was accomplished the infusion was maintained for minutes there was a consistent increase in the maternal HR rate mhr and a significant rise in fetal heart rate fhr late in the infusion and in the postinfusion period there was a widening of the maternal pulse pressure mainly due to a reduction in diastolic pressure with little change in the mean blood pressure maternal and fetal ph decreased and base deficit increased during the T0 although the po and pco remained unchanged maternal and fetal blood glucose rose significantly following ritodrine infusion
1698,in respiratory alkalosis the fall in csf bicarbonate is in part due to increased csf lactate the rest of csf hco fall may be actively regulated or as more recent evidence suggests is dependent on plasma hco fall therefore the relationship between plasma and csf hco changes was studied during hours of respiratory alkalosis paco mm hg in anesthetized dogs when plasma hco fell normally kept normal by nahco infusion increased by infusing more nahco and reduced by infusing hcl in respiratory alkalosis plasma and csf hco fell and meql respectively in hypocapnia and NP hco csf hco fell meql and lactate increased meql in hypocapnia and metabolic alkalosis plasma hco increased meql and csf hco remained unchanged and lactate increased meql in combined hypocapnia and MA plasma hco fall meql but csf hco fell meql and csf ph returned to normal at hours therefore csf hco fall in hypocapnia is primarily and critically dependent on the simultaneous fall in plasma hco content with a minimal contribution from cns lactate increase when csf ph has returned to normal however csf hco fall is stopped despite further falls in plasma hco
1699,survival of salmonellae in artificially contaminated beefpork mixtures approximately salmonellaeg was studied in pepperoni prepared by either a natural flora or lactic starter culture fermentation or in nonfermented sausages the pepperoni did not become salmonellae free during the usual commercial to day drying period salmonella dublin was present in all products fermented or unfermented after to days of drying at a lower level of contamination g s dublin could not be recovered from starter culturefermented pepperoni after days of drying but persisted in the natural florafermented sausage s typhimurium initial count g was absent after days of drying when starter culture was used to ferment the pepperoni but was still present in the NK florafermented and unfermented products s dublin host adapted to cattle or s choleraesuis host adapted to swine had similar survival patterns in beef pork or beefpork pepperoni heating salmonellae contaminated beefpork pepperoni after fermantation but before drying to an internal temperature of c trichinae inactivating eliminated the foodborne pathogen from the sausage product
1700,in pseudomonas am conversion of hydroxybutyrate to acetylcoa is mediated by an inducible HBD an acetoacetate succinate coenzyme a GOT specific for succinylcoa and an inducible betaketothiolase ethanol is oxidized to acetate by the same enzymes as are involved in methanol oxidation to formate an inducible acetylcoa synthetase has been partially purified and characterized it is essential for growth only on ethanol malonate and acetate plus glyoxylate as shown by the growth characteristics of a mutant ict lacking this enzyme free acetate is not involved in the assimilation of acetylcoa and hydroxypyruvate reductase is not involved in the oxidation of acetylcoa to glyoxylate during growth on hydroxybutyrate a mutant ict lacking malate synthase activity has been isolated and its characteristics indicate that this activity is normally essential for growth of pseudomonas am on ethanol malonate and hydroxybutyrate but not for growth on other substrates such as pyruvate succinate and c EDC the growth properties of a revertant ictr and of a mutant lacking malylcoa lyase pct indicate that an alternative route must exist for assimilation of compounds metabolized exclusively by way of acetylcoa
1701,lysyl oxidase the enzyme which oxidately deaminates lysine residues in collagen and elastin was purified from embryonic chick cartialge by employing an affinity column of lathyritic rat skin collagen coupled to sepharose followed by separation on deaecellulose an enzyme preparation was obtained which was pure as shown by PAGE the specific activity was fold higher than that of the original extract the pure enzyme utilized both collagen and elastin substrate furthermore the ratios of enzyme activity with elastin substrate versus that with collagen substrate were the same at all stages of purity only one protein band was found after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the pure lysyl oxidase in sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol the molecular weight was estimated to be it was found that the enzyme contained a large number of cysteine and tyrosine residues evidence was obtained for molecular heterogeneity of lysyl oxidase the enzyme eluted from deaecellulsoe in at least four distinct regions when the peaks were rechromatographed separately they eluted at salt concentrations similar to those of the original chromatogram however the substrate specificity and the electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gel were the same for all enzyme fractions
1702,magnetic and spectroscopic properties of muoxobishemins from natural and structurally related porphyrins were investigated as probes for ascertaining the presence or absence of feiiiofeiii linkages between hemin moieties of hemeproteins magnetic susceptibilities of solids from to degrees k were investigated the data fit the temperature variations expected for a pair of antiferromagnetically coupled s iron iii porphyrins with j values of and degrees k for deuterohemins with hydrogen vinyl ethoxycarbonylcyclopropyl acetyl propionyl and ethyl substituents respectively this magnetic character is reflected in pmr spectra that exhibit resonances with far less broadening and paramagnetic shift than is the case for monomeric highspin hemins only impurities are seen in epr spectra which serve effectively in monitoring the magnetic purity of preparations an infrared active asymmetric stretching frequency characteristic of the feofe linkage can be identified by substitution of by electronic spectra are highly characteristic with poorly resolved absorption bands the substituents on the porphyrin ring exert significant but usually not C1 electronic and steric effects on these properties solvent effects were relatively small and no firm evidence for IB of ligands trans to bridging oxygen was found the uniqueness of these PCS properties and their low sensitivity to changes in porphyrin structure or medium facilitates the identification of muoxo linkage in hemins or Ox hemeproteins
1703,two thiolactivated endopeptidases with ph optima near ph were isolated from the supernatant fraction of rabbit BB homogenates by deaecellulose chromatography gel filtration and isoelectrofocusing peptide bond hydrolysis was measured quantitatively by ionexchange chromatography with an amino acid analyzer brain kininase a hydrolyzes the pheser peptide bond in bradykinin bk argproproglypheserprophearg it is isoelectric near ph and has a molecular weight of approximately the enzyme also hydrolyzes the pheser peptide bond in lysbk metlysbk desargbk lysbk proglypheserprophearg and glypropheserprophearg but does not hydrolyze this bond in despheargbk brain kininase b hydrolyzes the prophe peptide bond in bk it is isoelectric at ph and has a molecular weight of approximately brain kininase b also hydrolyzes the prophe bond in lysbk metlysbk lysbk serprophearg and pheserproarg pretreatment of denatured kininogen with brain kininase a or b did not reduce the amount of trypsinreleasable bk from this precursor protein indicating that the bk sequence when part of a large protein is not a substrate for either enzyme however kininase a and b hydrolyze the octadecapeptide glyleumetlysargproproglypheserpropheargservalginval the data show that a C1 part of the cterminal portion of BK is important for the brain kininase a activity and for both enzymes the size of the peptide and presumably the residues adjacent to the scissle bond are important in determining the rate of peptide bond hydrolysis by these endopeptidases
1704,the interaction between phenylalanyltrna synthetase from yeast and escherichia coli and trnaphe yeast trnaser yeast trnaval e coli has been investigated by ultracentrifugation analysis fluorescence titrations and fast kinetic techniques the fluorescence of the ybase of trnaphe and the intrinsic fluorescence of the synthetases have been used as optical indicators TPS complexes between phenylalanyltrna synthetase and trnaphe from yeast are formed in a twostep mechanism a nearly diffusioncontrolled recombination is followed by a fast conformational transition binding constants rate constants and changes in the quantum yield of the ybase fluorescence upon binding are given under a variety of conditions with respect to ph added salt concentration of mg ions and temperature heterologous complexes between phenylalanyltrna synthetase e coli and trnaphe yeast are formed in a similar twostep mechanism as the specific complexes the conformational transition however is slower by a factor formation of nonspecific complexes between phenylalanyltrna synthetase yeast and trnatyr e coli proceeds in a onestep mechanism phenylalanyltrna synthetase yeast binds either two molecules of trnaphe yeast or only one molecule of trnatyr e coli trnaval e coli or trnaser yeast are also bound in a stoichiometry binding constants for complexes of phenylalanyltrna synthetase yeast and trnatyr e coli are determined under a variety of conditions in contrast to specific complex formation nonspecific binding is disfavoured by the presence of mg ions and is not affected by ph and the presence of pyrophosphate the difference in the stabilities of specific and nonspecific complexes can be varied by a factor of depending on the ionic conditions discrimination of cognate and noncognate trna by phenylalanyltrna synthetase yeast is discussed in terms of the binding mechanism the topology of the IB sites the nature of interacting forces and the relation between specificity and ionic conditions
1705,the reduction of metmyoglobin by the ironii complex of transdiaminocyclohexanennnntetraacetate fecdta has been investigated the equilibrium constant measured spectrophotometrically is with a resulting reduction potential of v for mb the rate constant for the reduction is m sec with a deltah of kcal m and deltas of eu both cn and oh inhibit the reduction because of the relatively low CR of cyanometmyoglobin mbcn and ionized metmyglobin mboh the rate constant for the reduction of mbcn by fecdta is x m sec and that for reduction of mboh is m sec the nitric oxide complex of metmyoglobin is reduced with a rate constant of m sec the kinetics of oxidation of oxymyoglobin by fecdta were studied the data are consistent with a mechanism where oxidation takes place entirely through the deoxy form a rate constant of x m sec was calculated for the oxidation of deoxymyoglobin by fecdta in equilibrium constant and rate constant for reduction the above data are discussed in terms of a simple outersphere reduction reaction
1706,the binding of ca to monolayers and bilayers of phosphatidylserine has been investigated as a CF of ph ionic strength nacl concentration and ca concentration using surface and colloid chemical techniques the molar ratio of lipid to bound calcium decreases to as the ca concentration is increased to about mm at ca greater than mm a complex is formed the apparent binding constant ka ranges from about approximately lmol depending on the ca concentration after allowing for electrostatic effects and neighbour group interactions the intrinsic IB constant ki of the phosphorylserine polar group at ph i m where it carries a net negative charge of one is approximately lmol consistent values for ki were obtained using several independent approaches ka for ca binding decreases with increasing nacl concentration because the monovalent cations compete with ca for the same binding site na and k are equally effective in displacing ca adsorbed to monolayers of phosphatidylserine both with respect to the kinetics and the equilibrium of the displacement ka for the reaction between phosphatidylserine and monovalent cations is about fold smaller than that of ca an investigation of the binding of mn to phosphatidylserine by both surface chemical and nuclear magnetic resonance methods shows that this cation has a similar binding constant to that of ca the cabinding capabilities of monolayers containing only carboxyl groups ie arachidic acid and phosphodiester groups ie dicetyl phosphate have also been determined the apparent pk for the cooh group in monolayers is larger than or equal to and that for the phosphodiester group is less than since these groups do not retain the same pk values when they are in close proximity in the phosphorylserine group the relative contributions of the two CG to the binding of ca to phosphatidylserine is not obvious
1707,the rete mirabile of hippopodius cl hydrozoa o siphonophora is a sheet of giant endoderm cells penetrated by branches of the ventral radial canal the cells appear to be highly polyploid the rough er is very richly developed and expanded er cisternae containing amorphous material presumably synthesized protein are observed near the outer cell surface the cells are electrically coupled and are connected by gap junctions the rete is electrically excitable and cell to cell conduction of action potentials at cms is observed the action potentials are allornone positivegoing events showing amplitudes of about mv and arising from a mv resting potential slowly developing and decaying AA depolarizations capable of summing to the mv level are also observed T3 passage of a train of impulses the rete cells swell and secretion drops appear at the surface these changes becoming apparent within a few seconds in mm mn the response fails to occur and secondary depolarizations secretion potentials are not seen spike propagation is not affected in nafree solutions the spikes are reduced and propagation eventually fails it is suggested that the spikes are sodiumdependent events which trigger a calciumdependent secretory process the composition and biological activity of the secretion are uncertain but indirect evidence suggests a possible defensive or repellant role for the response
1708,studies were made of the enzymic synthesis and hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters in rat testes weanling rats were fed for weeks diets containing by wt of hydrogenated coconut oil hco a concentrate of ethyl elaidate and linolelaidate trans devoid of essential fatty acids efa or safflower oil saff cholesterol esterifying activity was localized in the soluble fraction and cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity was distributed in both particulate and soluble fractions obtained from tissue homogenates the optimum ph was for esterification and for hydrolysis neither esterifying nor hydrolytic activity was affected by freezing and thawing but both reactions were inhibited by heat or sonication the animals of both the hco and trans groups had developed an efa deficiency before they were sacrificed the efa deficiency produced upon feeding the hco diet had no apparent effect on the synthesis and hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters in rat testes the trans diet influenced the OD of the testes as judged by their size and cholesterol esterifying and cholesteryl ester hydrolyzing activities were suppressed in the testes of the animals of this group a major difference in the effects of the hco and trans diets on the lipids of the tests was the relatively minor amount of eicosatrienoic acid and the elevated level of docosapentaenoic acid in the cholesteryl esters of the testicular lipids of the trans group
1709,aphids transmitted polylornithine plotreated tobacco mosaic virus tmv when given acquistion and inoculation access periods as brief as s and min respectively the ability to transmit was lost within min aphids without claws were able to transmit the virus transmission thus seems similar to that of nonpersistent viruses the ratio of virus to polyamino acid as well as the kcl concentration markedly affected transmission transmission was best from mixtures which contained mugml tmv mugml plo mol wt and mkcl a similar mixture favoured transmission when PL mol wt was substituted for plo but with PL mol wt it was necessary to decrease the kcl to m to obtain transmission less kcl to m also favoured aphid transmission of plotreated potato virus x and tobacco rattle virus plotreated tmv ultracentrifuged in the presence of and resuspended in mkcl remained aphid transmissible while plotreated virus in mdcl which favours greater dissociation of the virusplo complex was transmissible neither before nor after sedimentation by ultracentrifuging and resuspension in mkcl these results show that transmissibility is not due to a permanent alteration of the virus by plo and indicate that the formation of a tmvplo complex is required for transmission sequential acquisition experiments suggest that plo may act by binding tmv to receptor sites in aphids however the possibility that plo affects the infection process was not ruled out
1710,electrical and mechanical activities of the longtitudinal muscle of the dog antrum were recorded with the double sucrosegap technique the muscle exhibited spontaneous action potentials which consisted of a spikelike potential which after a brief and partial repolarization was followed by a negativegoing plateautype potential in of the preparations no tension changes were produced by spontaneous action potentials tetrodotoxin atropine alpha and betaadrenoceptor antagonists and h and h receptor blocking agents had no effect on the action potential it was concluded that the action potential was myogenic in origin the mean frequency of the action potential at degrees c was min se of mean n and the mean duration sec se of mean n steady depolarizing current increased whereas hyperpolarizing current decreased the frequency of the action potential lengthtension relations were studied in twelve strips the average resting passive tension at lo was mg the active force of isometric contraction produced by acetylcholine increased with strip length up to a maximum then decreased wtih further increased in length there were no mechanical responses to pentagastrin pentagastrin had two CS of action on smooth muscle it increased the frequency of the action potential in a dose dependent fashion threshold concentraions ranged from x to m the ed was xm the maximum response min was reached at m pentagastrin also released acetylcholine from intramural cholinergic nerves PG reduced the amplitude and duration of the action potential
1711,a study has been carried out on the parameters of the graph of the fetal HR rate the basal rate and dips in cases of acute fetal distress with a ph lower than in the blood and in normal deliveries the statistical analysis confirms that there is a significant rise in the number of heart rate abnormalities such as persistent bradycardia or persistent tachycardia and with dips during deliveries with fetal acidosis the frequency of these abnormalities increases with the degree of acidosis sometimes the abnormalities in the fetal HR rate precede the appearance of the acidosis all the same the discovery of these abnormalities does not by itself make a precise diagnosis of FD because we do find these CA in a certain number of cases even in normal deliveries only measuring fetal ph at a definite time can establish the diagnosis of fetal distress and the severity of the condition
1712,a factor isolated from human serum nonsuppressible insulinlike activity nsila stimulates multiplication of serumstarved chick embryo fibroblasts and stimulates activity of ornithine decarboxylase odc physiological doses of nsila muuml and pharmacological doses of insulin muml stimulate odc fold fetal calf SS about fold combined addition of nsila and insulin does not result in higher activities suggesting a common mechanism of action the increase in cell number obtained with nsila insulin or serum parallels the degree of odc stimulation treatment of cells with pronase also stimulates odc activity a sharp increase in odc activity occurs between and hours after addition of the growth AF with a peak at hours activation period as cells leave g phase odc activity decreases rapidly to achieve Vmax of odc the growth factors have to be present during the entire activation period the potential to reactivate odc decreases as cells pass through s phase results obtained using cycloheximide suggest that odc is translated only in the second half of the activation period data on effects of dbcamp and dbcgmp on odc activation by serum are discussed
1713,mice from inbred strains were surveyed for R2 of kidney and liver arylsulfatase C2 kidney variation was due to differences in the activity of arylsulfatase b twofold higher activities of arylsulfatase b in swrj kidney compared to ahej kidney were determined by an autosomal gene which may be MZ to the structural gene for arylsulfatase b since the swrj enzyme was more HS than the ahej enzyme cblj mice possessed twofold higher liver arylsulfatase levels than did ahej mice the major portion of this variation could be attributed to differences in arylsulfatase b and appeared to be inherited in autosomal fashion although some evidence supports the existence of a major locus influencing liver arylsulfatase activity this must be substantiated by further studies whatever the nature of the genetic factors involved they do not appear to involve structural genes since no differences were discernible between the enzymes of the two strains relevant to km heat stability electrophoretic mobility ph optimum activation SE or response to several inhibitors furthermore the rank ordering of strains on the basis of kidney arylsulfatase activity differed markedly from that which pertained to liver activity kidney arylsulfatase levels but not BB or liver arylsulfatase activities appear subject to androgenic influences
1714,the proportion of higher plant chloroplast cytochrome b oxidizable during illumination by low intensity nm light increases as the ph is decreased below at ph total oxidation is seen and subsequent red light can cause reduction of up to of the Ox cytochrome the oxidation by far red CS at ph is inhibited by mum dibromomethylisopropylrhobenzoquinone whereas the red lightinduced reduction is inhibited by dichlorophenyldimethylurea in this ph range ferricyanideoxidized cytochrome b exists in a form not reducible by ferrocyanide an increase in the amplitude of farred induced oxidation also occurs at higher ph up to ph T3 pretreatment of chloroplasts with substantially higher levels of CS approx ergscms the degree of CS activation is ph dependent being more pronounced at lower ph after light activation cytochrome b can be completely oxidized by farred light in a manner reversible by RL up to ph values of and the curve describing the amplitude of farred oxidation as a function of ph is shifted by ph unit toward higher ph farred oxidation and red light reduction are again inhibited by DBMIB and dichlorophenyldimethylurea respectively light activation at ph is also manifested in a small decrease in the amplitude of subsequent dark ferrocyanide reduction and this decrease is inhibited by dichlorophenyldimethylurea mum the effect of intramembranal pH on the effective redox potential of cytochrome b and its CF is discussed
1715,GE of five liquid meals which differ in their physicochemical properties have been measured in control dogs and dogs that have received a heineckemikulicz pyloroplasty alone proximal gastric vagotomy without drainage selective gastric vagotomy and pyloroplasty and TV and pyloroplasty the first two phases of emptying have been computed by the method of least squares to obtain a logarithmiclinear DP and are expressed as relative rates the initial postingestion process is characterized by beta or the average relative rate of emptying in the first ten T2 the basic or exponential rate as beta and the NC in rate from the initial to basic pattern as deltabeta each measure of GE was statistically analyzed to determine specific differences in rates between the operations studied we confirmed the earlier claims that pyloroplasty CT does not NC the emptying rate of liquid meals each measure or phase of emptying varies consistently across the operations from meal to meal tested initial emptying T3 all three vagotomies is significantly faster than control with progressive rate increases as proximal gastric vagotomy is compared with selective gastric vagotomy with pyloroplasty and with truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty probably indicative of gastric fundal loss of accommodation to volume distention after denervation the basic exponential pattern of emptying is not lost T3 any of the operations studied the basic rate after proximal gastric vagotomy and selective gastric vagotomy with pyloroplasty is nearly identical slightly delayed from the control rate and significantly slower than the more rapid rate after TV with pyloroplasty possible explanations for these are discussed and imply a particular importance of the hepatic and celiac vagal fibers sectioned only with TV in the regulation of gastric emptying of liquids
1716,various complexes of myoglobin mb with thiolate were studied by use of magnetic circular dichroism mcd spectroscopy metmbethyl npropyl and isopropylmercaptan complexes offered mcd spectra similar to that of cytochrome p p with respect to shape and intensity ratio of soret mcd to q mcd the mcd spectra did not show any ph dependence the complexes reduced by sodium dithionite exhibited the mcd spectrum of deoxymb indicative of PR of thiolate anion from the heme iron cysteine and cysteine methyl ester coordinated to the heme iron at ph but not at ph and the complex formed at ph gave an mcd spectrum similar to that of p and an mcd spectrum of deoxy mb on reduction with sodium dithionite the mercaptoethanol complex exhibited three a terms associated with the q and soret transitions at ph similar to those of feii cytochrome c which indicates that mb was reduced by this reagent at ph at ph mercaptoethanol gave an mcd spectrum similar to that of alkyl mercaptan just T3 the addition with the time changed into deoxy mb through some intermediate of reduced mbthiolate complex at ph mercaptoethanol formed complex which exhibited an mcd spectrum similar to those of other alkylmercaptans sodium sulfide gave an mcd spectrum which resembled that of the normal thiol mb complex just after addition at ph the complex was gradually reduced to give nm trough in addition to the mcd of deoxy mb the mbsulfur complex formed at ph was gradually reduced to give an mcd spectrum which was fairly different from that of deoxy mb a similar mcd spectrum was observed at ph just after the addition of nas these results were considered to suggest the saturation of one of the conjugated double bonds of the porphyrin by sulfur
1717,serum levels of testosterone androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone were measured before and after days of treatment with hcg iud in prepubertal boys with cryptorchidism and with hypospadias in order to determine whether a defect in androgen synthesis could be a common cause for these disorders baseline and stimulated levels of testosterone androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone were similar in patients with unilateral cryptorchidism monorchism and hypospadias baseline and stimulated levels of testosterone were lower in boys with bilateral cryptorchidism testosterone levels did not correlate with either the anatomical location of the testis in patients with unilateral cryptorchidism or with the site of the urethra in boys with hypospadias seven of patients with cryptorchidism had a positive family history of a similar disorder testosterone C2 were similar in patients with and without a family PH it is concluded in all patients studied the gonadotropin dependent phase of testosterone production is present hcg stimulation cannot detect unilateral leydig cell dysfunction and in familial cases of cryptorchidism some factor other than an abnormality in androgen synthesis may be responsible for the hereditary tendency
1718,this study examines the effects of histamine on mucosal permeability to acid by isolated stomach of rabbits histamine x m decreased antral luminal acid loss which could not be accounted for by AS h secretion or appearance of organic acid histamine also increased antral ER and decreased the unidirectional luminal to serosal flux jls of cerythritol histamine theophylline and nodibutyryl adenosine monophosphate did not significantly alter secretion by fundus in the presence of salicylate x m however after removal of salicylate these agents stimulated acid secretion histamine decreased luminal acid loss by both antrum and fundus treated with salicylate increased the electrical resistance of these tissues and decreased jls erythritol of fundic mucosa burimamide x m inhibited the permeability effects of histamine on antrum and fundus the data indicate that histamine decreases spontaneous antral mucosal permeability as well as salicylateinduced increase in mucosal permeability of both antrum and fundus the effects of burimamide suggest that antrum contains h receptor CS urelated to acid secretion and that fundus contains h receptor sites which also govern permeability but are independent of those related to acid secretion
1719,crude synaptosomal fractions p derived from guineapig cerebral SC were incubated in the presence of mm kcl in a krebsglucose medium torpedo marmorata electric organs were stimulated electrically in vivo at pulsessec for min by electrodes placed on the electric lobe SVs were isolated from each source and the phospholipid compositions analysed and compared with vesicles from unstimulated controls lysophosphatidylcholine was the only lysophosphoglyceride demonstrable in the synaptic vesicles from either source and its low levels did not increase as a result of chemical or electircal stimulation in each case there was a close similarity of the phospholipid distributions in the vesicles taken from control and stimulated samples control experiments indicated extensive decreases in the acetylcholine content of the vesicles from the stimulated EO and smaller decreases in the acetylcholine content of the synaptic vesicles from stimulated P2 fractions these fractions were found to respire linearly in the presence of mm glucose and the vesicle fractions were shown to have low levels of contaiminating membranes as judged by marker enzyme analyses crude synaptosomal fractions from guineapig CBF cortex were incubated in a krebsglucose medium with labelled fatty acids and hglucose in the presence or absence of mm kcl subsynaptosomal fractionation was carried out and specific radioactivities of phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol were determined in fractions d SVs e microsomes and h disrupted synaptosomes the release of neurotransmitter did not significantly enhance the labelling of phospholipids in any of the fractions studied as compared with phospholipids from unstimulated fractions this was found T3 two incubation times and using coleate carachidonate hpalmitate and hglucose
1720,staphylococcus aureus produces a phospholipase c specific for sphingomyelin betahemolysin erythrocytes with approximately sphingomyelin in their membranes eg from sheep have been shown to have up to of this phospholipid hydrolyzed by this enzyme at c in isotonic buffered saline without hemolysis cooling of sphingomyelinase ctreated erythrocytes to c causes complete lysis of the cells a phenomenon known as hotcold hemolysis the addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta to sheep erythrocytes preincubated with sphingomyelinase c was found to induce rapid hemolysis at c the treated cells became susceptible to chelatorinduced hemolysis and to hotcold hemolysis simultaneously and the degree of lysis of both mechanisms increased equally with prolonged preincubation with sphingomyelinase c erythrocytes of species not readily susceptible to hotcold hemolysis were equally insusceptible to chelatorinduced lysis chelators of the edta series were the most effective whereas chelators more specific for ca zn fe cu and mg were without effect the rate of chelatorinduced lysis was dependent on the preincubation period with betahemolysin and on the concentration of chelator added the optimal concentration of edta was found to equal the amount of exogenously added mg a cation necessary for sphingomyelinase c activity hypotonicity increased the rate of chelatorinduced hemolysis whereas increasing the osmotic pressure to twice isotonic CR inhibited chelatorinduced lysis the data suggest that exogenously added andor membranebound divalent cations are important for the stability of sphingomyelindepleted membranes the phenomenon of hotcold hemolysis may be a consequence of the temperature dependence of divalent ion stabilization
1721,a virus surveillance project was established and maintained during along major river drainages in six states mosquitoes biting flies and blood specimens from sentinel equines were collected during field trip visits to arthropod collecting CS and sentinel locations from april into december there were mosquitoes tested and arboviruses isolated from of species from biting flies tested arbovirus isolations were obtained in of species there was no isolation of venezuelan equine encephalitis vee virus western equine encephalitis wee virus isolates were the most numerous and were followed by turlock st SLE hart park california encephalitis and bunyamwera bun group viruses the first isolation of wee from the mosquito cullex mel erraticus is reported as is the extension of the ranges for buttonwillow virus from california to new mexico and texas also a single isolation of the bun group from culicoides variipennis extends the range of this virusvector relationship from california to texas new distribution records for mosquito species previously unreported for arizona louisana new mexico and oklahoma are reported the sentinel burros detected wee serologic conversions at two sites in new mexico and at one in texas the surveillance project provided state and federal officials with current information on the status of arbovirus activity including the absence of vee activity during and it demonstrated the existence of the potential for wee epizootics and epidemics throughout a wide geographic area of the western united states
1722,the hydrogendeuterium exchange data of human immunoglobulin g igg are interpreted by assuming fast fluctuations of the protein conformation through which the peptide CG become exposed to the solvent the probability of solvent exposure of peptide hydrogens reflects a rather loose conformation for native igg in comparison with other globular proteins the probability of solvent SE is greater than for half of the peptide groups which shows that the conformational transitions by which these groups are exposed to the solvent are accompanied by changes in standard free energy less than kjmol kcalmol in the range of ph at degrees c no gross conformational changes are reflected in the hydrogendeuterium exchange behaviour of the native the reducednonalkylatedreassociated and the reducedsalkylatedreassociated igg no difference could be detected in the conformational stability of the native and reoxidised reassociated igg proteins the lack of intersubunit disulphide bridges in salkylatedreassociated molecules results in an increased conformational motility this destabilization of protein conformation affects about of the peptide groups covered by the measurements and corresponds to changes in standard free energy of kjmol on the average
1723,the purified respiratory chain nadh dehydrogenase of escherichia coli oxidizes nadh with either dichlorophenolindophenol dcip ferricyanide or menadione as electron acceptors with values for nadh are similar with the three electron acceptors approximately mum the purified enzyme contains no flavin and has an absolute requirement for fad with km values around mum the ph optimum of the enzyme appears to be between and the optimum is difficult to establish because of nonenzymatic reduction of dcip at the lower ph values potassium cyanide stimulates the dcip reductase activity about fold but has no effect on ferricyanide reductase the enzyme exhibits hyperbolic kinetics with respect to nadh concentration in both the ferricyanide and dcip reductase assays but cooperatively is seen in the menadione reductase reaction nad is an effective competitive inhibitor of the reaction ki congruent to mum in the presence of nad the nadh saturation curve becomes cooperative even in the dcip reductase assay many adenine containing nucleotides are competitive inhibitors of the enzyme the apparent ki values for these nucleotides as inhibitors of the purified enzyme the membranebound ND and the nadh oxidase are equivalent an examination of inhibitory effects of a series of adenine nucleotides suggests that the inhibitors act as analogues of nad which is the true physiological inhibitor the results suggest that the enzyme in situ is always partially inhibited by the C2 of nad in the e coli cell and thus behaves in a cooperative fashion to changes in the nadnadh ratio an antibody has been elicited against the purified nadh dehydrogenase ID and crossed immunoelectrophoresis show that the antibody is directed principally against the nadh dehydrogenase with some activity against minor contaminants in the purified preparation the antibody inhibits nadh dehydrogenase activity at saturating levels when this antibody preparation is used to examine solubilized membrane preparations two major immunoprecipitates are found a parallel inhibition of the MB nadh dehydrogenase and nadh oxidase activities is seen supporting the hypothesis that the purified enzyme is indeed a component of the respiratory chaindependent nadh oxidase pathway
1724,mechanisms involved in the action of the pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase from pseudomonas aeruginosa ec have been investigated by means of kinetic studies and fluorescence titration our results as well as those from previous investigations suggest that the allosteric mwc model monod j wyman j and changeux j p j mol biol may be used as a first step for the explanation of the properties of the transhydrogenase the basic reaction of the enzyme is the oxidation of reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide tpnh by diphosphopyridine nucleotide dpn in terms of the model the PET r state is favored by tpnh whereas the product triphosphopyridine nucleotide tpn behaves as an allosteric inhibitor and is therefore assumed to favor the nonfunctional t state to a slight extent the t state is also favored by inorganic phosphate on the other hand adenosine monophosphate and several other phosphate nucleotides function as activators and hence are presumed to shift the allosteric equilibrium toward the r state the studies in this paper suggest a TPS regulatory site for the transhydrogenase
1725,modified stereotaxic techniques were applied to fetal lambs during the latter third of gestation electrical stimulation in the region of the hypothalamus in acute experiments was associated with three patterns of arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes a pressortachycardia response a pure tachycardia response abolished by propranolol and a pure bradycardia response abolished by atropine the pressortachycardia response was examined in detail in chronic preparations days of gestation at operation the systolic arterial blood pressure increase was never greater than mm hg and was probably blunted by the C1 noninnervated placental circulation this pressure increase was abolished by phentolamine and was thus mediated by stimulation of alphaadrenergic receptors the initial tachycardia was prevented by propranolol and was due to betaadrenergic stimulation the tachycardia was followed in a few seconds by a bradycardia abolished by atropine and possibly a vagal baroreflex the pressortachycardia response was accentuated in two lambs who were delivered spontaneously and were studied after birth these studies indicate that a suprabulbar neural framework exists in the fetal lamb for influencing the cardiovascular system from as early as days of gestation
1726,repeated oral treatment of male rats with piperazinesubstituted phenothiazine drugs in doses of mgkg or more daily led to an accumulation of metabolites containing an ethylenediamine group instead of the piperazine ring these products of ring degradation with and without removal of the nalkyl group were found together with the parent drugs and their ndealkylated metabolites in CL lung kidney and spleen as well as in brain when high doses were administered after termination of treatment the ethylenediamine derivatives were eliminated more slowly than were their congeners containing the IN piperazine ring parallel observations were made in dogs given fluphenazine in daily doses of up to mgkg quantitative differences were observed in the relative amounts of mono and disubstituted ethylenediamine metabolites accumulated in rat tissues during treatment with the various drugs the proportion of the monosubstituted product formed by ndealkylation and ring cleavage declined in the following order perazine prochlorperazine trifluoperazine fluphenazine perphenazine condensation products of the ethylenediamine derivatives with formaldehyde were split in the extraction procedure used
1727,the synthesis and purification of the azidoadenine analogs of nad azidonad and fad azidofad from azidoadenosine phosphate and nmn or fmn respectively is described the coenzyme analogs are characterized by absorption nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism spectra the two latter methods indicate a folded structure of azidonad and azidofad upon irradiation at mn in aqueous solution a change of the ultraviolet absorption spectra of the coenzyme analogs indicates photolysis of the azido group the coenzyme properties of azidonad are demonstrated with lactate glutamate and alcohol dehydrogenase yielding and respectively of the v observed with nad concomitantly the km values of the coenzyme analogs are and fold higher than those of nad azidofad is shown to be coenzyme of apoglucose oxidase the REC of activity however is much slower in the presence of azidofad than with fad a final value of of the activity with fad is obtained with apodamino acid oxidase azidofad is completely inactive although it is specifically bound to the enzyme
1728,significant differences in amylase betaglucosidase and phosphatase activities were observed among four phytophthora cinnamomi isolates grown in nutrientamended sterilized soil for days amylase ph optima for the four isolates were within a relatively narrow range at ph each isolate was within of its peak activity isolates sb and c each exhibited maximal betaglucosidase activity at ph and maximal phosphatase activity at ph maximal activity for these two enzymes of isolate a occurred at ph in timed experiments isolates and a exhibited greater amylase MICs than did the other two isolates for betaglucosidase greatest activity was observed for sb activity of was intermediate and least activity was observed for isolates a and c isolates sb and exhibited greatest phosphatase MICs isolate c was intermediate in activity and a was least active results indicate that significant differences exist among the isolates tested and that these differences can be quantitatively measured by the methods described
1729,gammaglutamyl transpeptidase transfers the gammaglutamyl moiety of glutathione to a variety of acceptor amino acids through the operation of the gammaglutamylcyclotransferase cycle this enzyme has been implicated in the transport of amino acids into cells especially the cells of the PT tubules of kidney it has been reported to be present in rabbit erythrocytes however using white CF preparations we have not been able to demonstrate the presence of gammaglutamyl transpeptidase in human or rabbit erythrocytes either by measuring the utilization of gsh or by following the formation of the product clmethionine was used as acceptor amino acid and the formation of gammaglutamylclmethionine was followed using similar conditions we have been able to demonstrate the presence of gammaglutamyl transpeptidase in human and rabbit WBCs and in human kidney in contrast to a previous report we were unable to find the accumulation of oxoproline an intermediate of the gammaglutamylcyclotransferase pathway in human red cells incubated in krebsringer solution immunologic studies demonstrated that human red cell membranes contained no protein antigenically similar to kidney gammaglutamyl transpeptidase thus our studies indicated that in human and rb erythrocytes the gammaglutamyl transpeptidasecyclotransferase pathway was not operative
1730,a technique for the selective SE of omethyldopamine normetanephrine and metanephrine from a single urine sample has been investigated after hydrolysis of the conjugates the diluted mixture is passed through a dowex wx column and the methoxylated amines are eluted by means of concentrated ammonia the eluate containing metanephrine normetanephrine and omethyldopamine is evaporated and a solution of the residue in borate buffer is fractionated under strictly controlled conditions on an amberlite cg column the three amines so separated are estimated by specific fluorimetric methods the SE recovery is for pure solutions and for omethyldopamine added to urine the fluorimetric procedure carried out under welldefined conditions allows the estimation of ng of omethethyldopamine the spectral characteristics of the FL derivative are similar to those obtained with dopamine so that it can be assumed that iodine oxidation of omethyldopamine demethylates this compound and oxidises the resulting dopamine to the dopamine fluorophore DHI of the EDC that might interfere in the fluorimetric procedure dopamine dopa and alphamethyldopa are destroyed by the ammoniacal elution from the dowex column and omethyldopa is eliminated in the effluent from the amberlite column the elimination of interfering compounds and the improved separation on amberlite ensure high specificity for this procedure we have applied the method to normal urine and to pathological urines from patients with adrenergic tumours or untreated and treated parkinsonian subjects vital information has been obtained on the prognosis of adrenergic tumours the presence of large amounts of dopamine normetanephrine andor metanephrine does not affect the CA for omethyldopamine the method is also applicable to rat and dog urine and can be applied to tissue extracts with little modification
1731,a comparative study was done of the basal and postlhrh stimulation levels of lh fsh and testosterone t in healthy male volunteers aged years and in normogonadotropic oligospermic men aged years in whom other endocrine urologic andor vascular diseases had been rules out seventeen of the latter group underwent bilateral testicular biopsy each subject received rapid iv injection of mug synthetic lhrh at am SS C2 of lh fsh and t were determined by radioimmunoassay on samples obtained immediately before and and minutes T3 injection as compared to normals oligospermic men had a lower average lh response although the basal values did not differ significantly from normal fsh C2 did not differ significantly between groups although some individual patients showed higher and some lower than normal values the possibility of stimulating t secretion with lhrh was confirmed average SS t C2 rose more slowly and reached lower levels in the oligospermic men than in normal men there was no correlation between lh and fsh rises it is postulated that some patients with normogonadotropic oligospermia may have latent insufficiency of pituitary gonadotropic functional reserve for one or both hormones andor of the leydig cell CF the need for individual analysis of results and their rho with testicular biopsy findings is commented
1732,the method of pulse radiolysis was used to generate reagents in situ in times ns to mus short compared with the rates of the observed PSA processes this instant mixing technique is compared with rapid stopped flow measurements limited in rates and concentrations and tjump measurements limited to relaxation in the neighborhood of equilibrium for the ferroferricytochrome c ciiciiiferroferricyanide fcniifcniii system the reagents generated in situ were cii or fcniii kinetically indistinguishable binding CS exist on cii and ciii for hexacyanide anions reductive electron transfer to the protein proceeds within the fcniiciii complex with a rate of s the IB of fcnii on cii slows down the oxidation of cii by fcniii the sites of interaction on cii or ciii with fcniii show ERP charges of approximately the association constant per binding site derived from the kinetics of electron transfer is greater than or equal to m for fcniicii and less than or equal to m for fcniiiciii specific clusters of amino acids in the model of cytochrome c are suggested as binding sites the oxidationreduction reactions of fcn appear to involve electron equivalent transfer to and from such somewhat remote binding sites on the protein anions such as phosphate or sulphate also bind to these less strongly than hexacyanides in the presence of perchlorate the kinetics show the resolution of the pk of ciii into two parts a optical changes at nm due to ligand interchange on the hemeiron unaffected by perchlorate and b a kinetic change leading to biphasic oxidation of cii with pk this is attributed to the effect of perchlorate on water structure in the close environment of the binding sites the high rate of oxidation of relaxed cii by fcniii x m s at mu is not in agreement with an outer sphere marcus mechanism nonrelaxed cii having a structure closer to ciii transfers electron to fcniii even faster k x m s at mu
1733,percutaneous radial artery catheterization for blood gas monitoring and continuous arterial pressure recording has become a common place procedure in the management of critically ill patients five patients with severe ischemia after cannulation have been encountered in the past months four of whom lost segments of one or more digits review of the events preceding and during radial artery cannulation allowed elucidation of the following principles radial artery catheterization should be preceded always by a negative allen test the catheter should be removed after to hours especially if the patient is critically ill is hypercoagulable or has impaired tissue perfusion the superficial TA is safer to use and permits longterm cannulation to days without ill effect and agressive approach to assessing flow and arterial reconstruction is essential if severe ischemic symptoms occur during or after radial artery catheterization ancillary measures including cervicodorsal sympathetic block intravenous low molecular weight dextran and heparin and intraarterial reserpine and fibrinolysin may improve palmar circulation but should not be substituted for both noninvasive and angiographic T0 of arterial flow followed by surgical restoration of flow when indicated
1734,the mutagenic effects of vinyl chloride vc on salmonella typhimurium strain ta are enhanced by mouse or rat CL extracts the extracts prepared from mice pretreated either with vinyl chloride or the microsomal enzyme inducer aroclor did not produce any greater stimulation of vcdependent mutagenesis than extracts from untreated animals these same extracts however differed markedly in their capacity to stimulate the mutagenicity of dimethylnitrosamine dmn a compound which is converted to a mutagen by an nadph dependent microsomal mixed function oxidase the order of activity of the extracts with dmn was aroclor pretreated is greater than UT is greater than vc pretreated furthermore the stimulatory effect of the CL extracts on vc mediated mutagenesis did not require nadph and was still evident in CL extracts in which the microsomal MFO had been heat inactivated the mutagenic activity of vc also was found to be stimulated by riboflavin in the presence of light suggesting that free radicals may be involved in vc dependent mutagenesis
1735,the exposed carboxyl CG of alphachymotrypsin were modified with glycine ethyl ester at low ph using barbodiimide reagent the specificity of the modified enzyme chy was studied over the ph range of to with both nacylated and nonnacylated amino acid esters the modified enzyme had lower reactivity toward nacylated esters than nonnacylated esters compared to the native enzyme typical substances such as acetyl and benzoylltyrosine ethyl esters retained and activity whereas phenylalanine ethyl ester was slightly more reactive with the modified than with the native enzyme the phrate profiles of acetyllphenylalanine ethyl ester and tryptophan ethyl and benzyl esters were investigated in detail analysis of these profiles revealed three pka values of approximately and related to a functional carboxyl imidazoyl and an amino group respectively since similar pka values occur for the native enzyme modification did not block the carboxyl corresponding to pka a mechanism is proposed for catalysis which includes both the protonated and unprotonated form of the imidazoyl his and utilizes water rather than a carboxyl asp as the proton sink
1736,the behavior of lipase produced by pseudomans mephitica var lipopytica toward hydrophobic residues coupled to spacer gels that were prepared by coupling a primary amine to cnbractivated agarose was studied the lipase adsorbed on the ligand of a long unbranched aliphatic chain a BZ ring or deoxycholic acid was only slightly or not all eluted at ph or ph by buffers containing m ncc the lipase was eluted by liquid containing a surfactant or an organic solvent miscible with water indicating greater involvement of hydrophobic forces the adsorption of propane cyclopentane cyclohexane cycloheptane or chrysene appears to be achieved through electrostatic forces inasmuch as desorption was caused by buffer containing m nac at ph the amount of lipase adsorbed on these hydrophobic ligands was about the same as that adsorbed on the ligands belonging to the first group since little lipase wad adsorbed on cyclopropane cycloctane pyridine methane npentane or branched aliphatic chains these ligands appear to impose steric hindrance on the adsorption of lipase or they may be too small to fit into the hydrophobic sites of lipase
1737,determinations were made of how the corrosionresistant properties of the passive film on l SS are influenced by the materials mechanical and surface states and the variable ph and po conditions of the interstitial fluid coldrolled and annealed specimens were surfaceprepared commercially and in the laboratory respectively as if for orthopedic implantation passive film behavior was studied by the anodic polarization and pulsepotentiostatic capacitance methods the ph and po of the ringers test solution were varied to include interstitial fluid values occurring postoperatively and onto REC the anodic polarization behavior of all specimens was found to be ph and poindependent breakdown potentials of annealed specimens were mv sce in contrast to previously reported values of approximately mv this substantial increase is related to the influence of surface preparation and in particular to the optimization of electropolishing time which acts to produce a microscopically smooth surface free of debris and disarrayed material capacitance behavior of annealed material for potentials greater than mv was consistent with a model involving the entry of chloride and metal ions mostly fe into the passive film this entry is related to the onset of pitting
1738,experiments were performed with preparations obtained by medial transection of the rat VD eight sympathomimetic drugs noradrenaline alphamethylnoradrenaline phenylephrine dopamine tyramine amphetamine cocaine and isoprenaline were applied to preparations which were fieldstimulated at sec intervals on the testicular half of the tissue all except isoprenaline enhanced twitches andor caused contractions these effects were blocked by alphaadrenoreceptor antagonists on the urethral preparation all except phenylephrine which often enhanced twitches inhibited responses to FS these effects were not blocked by alphaadrenoreceptor antagonists or by propranolol though the latter blocked inhibitory effects of isoprenaline on both segments GABA responses to tyramine persisted in urethral segments treated with cocaine and in urethral segments taken from reserpinetreated rats and thus tyramine may have some direct action no regional variation was observed in response to acetylcholine or carbachol KCl concentrations were equally ERP in contracting both segments but the time courses of contractions differed these experiments confirm a density gradient of excitatory alphaadrenoreceptors along the length of the RVD
1739,resonance raman spectra were measured for various ctype cytochromes mammalian cytochrome c bacterial cytochrome c algal photosynthetic cytochrome f and alkylated cytochrome c and a btype cytochrome cytochrome b in their reduced and oxidized states for ferrous alkylated cytochrome c a raman line sensitive to the replacement of an axial ligand of the heme iron uas found around cm this ligandsensitive raman line indicated the transition from acidic cm to alkaline cm forms with pk the ph dependence of the raman spectrum corresponded well to that of the optical absorption spectra for ferrous cytochrome f the ligandsensitive raman line was found at the same frequency as cytochrome c cm accordingly two axial ligands are likely to be histidine and Met as in cytochrome c for ferrous cytochrome c the frequency of the ligandsensitive raman line was between those of cytochrome c and cytochrome b since two axial ligands of the heme iron in cytochrome c might be histidines however a combination of histidine and methionine as a possible set of two axial ligands was not completely excluded for one or two of the four hemes in ferrous cytochrome b two weak raman lines appeared at and cm instead of the strongest band at cm of ctype ferrous cytochromes this suggests the practical use of these bands for the identification of types of cytochromes the difference in frequency and intensity between b and ctypes of hemes implies that the low effective symmetry of the heme in ferrous cytochrome c is due to vibrational coupling of ring modes with peripheral substituents rather than geometrical disortion of heme
1740,sedimentation equilibrium results obtained with bovine zincfree insulin with and without a component of proinsulin at ph i o degrees c and up to a total concentration of gl are shown to be consistent with three different polymerization patterns all involving an isodesmic indefinite selfassociation of specified oligomeric species the analysis procedure based on closed solutions formed by summing infinite series yields for each DP a set of equilibrium constants it is shown that a distinction between the possible patterns can be made by analyzing sedimentation equilibrium results obtained in a higher total concentration range up to g with insulin freed of zinc and proinsulin account being taken of the composition dependence of activity coefficients the favored pattern which differs from that previously reported in the literature involves the dimerization of monomeric insulin mol wt governed by a dimerization constant of x m and the isodesmic indefinite selfassociation of the dimer described by an association constant of x m this polymerization pattern is also shown to be consistent with the reaction boundary observed in sedimentation velocity experiments
1741,noradrenaline stimulated the incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids of guineapig brain synaptic membranes incubated in sodium phosphate buffer in the presence of mmnaf noradrenaline stimulated the incorporation of oleate into the choline glycerophospholipids phosphatidylinositol EGP phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid of synaptic membranes incubated in mmtrishcl buffer in trischl containing mmnaf stimulation of incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids by noradrenaline was enhanced by atp cacl mgcl and coa plus dithiothreitol the optimum concentration of cacl for stimulation by mumnoradrenaline was mum in the presence of cacl the optimum concentration of atpmgcl was in the range mm acetylcholine carbamoylcholine hydroxytryptamine dopamine histamine and gammaaminobutyric acid also stimulated the incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids of synaptic membranes sigmoidal DRCs were obtained similar to those obtained previously for stimulation by the same agonists of the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase a gullis rowe a the initial rate of transfer of oleate from oleoylcoa to choline glycerophospholipid was similar to the initial rate of transfer from oleatealbumin stimulated by noradrenaline transfer of oleate from oleoylcoa was not appreciably stimulated by noradrenaline but was stimulated by atp and mgcl
1742,membranes of the bacterial form and the stable and unstable lforms of proteus mirabilis contain ld and ddcarboxypeptidase the ddcarboxypeptidase is inhibited noncompetitively by penicillin g the enzyme of the bacterial form is highly penicillinsensitive ki x m penicillin g inhibition is only partly reversible by treatment with penicillinase or by dialysis against buffer in contrast the ddcarboxypeptidase of the unstable lform grown in the presence of penicillin is fold less penicillinsensitive ki x m penicillin g inhibition is completely reversed by penicillinase or dialysis after inhibition by penicillin and subsequent reactivation the penicillin sensitivity of the bacterial ddcarboxtpeptidase is similar to the sensitivity of the enzyme of the unstable lform the hypothesis is proposed that p mirabilis contains two ddcarboxypeptidases of different penicillin sensitivity and with different mechanisms of penicillin binding PGN synthesis in the cell walls of the unstable lform is probably carried out with the help of only one ddcarboxypeptidase viz the completely reactivatable enzyme with the lower penicillin sensitivity
1743,a simple procedure for the purification of mgstimulated atpase of escherichia coli by fractionation with polyethylene glycols and gel filtration is described the enzyme restores atpaselinked reactions to membrane preparations lacking these activities five different polypeptides alpha beta gamma delta epsilon are observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis freezing in salt solutions splits the enzyme complex into subunits which do not possess any catalytic activity the presence of different subunits is confirmed by electrophoretic and immunological methods the AS enzyme complex can be reconstituted by decreasing the ionic strength in the dissociated sample temperature ph protein concentration and the presence of substrate are each important determinants of the rate and extent of reconstitution the dissociated enzyme has been separated by IEC into two major fragments fragment ia has a molecular weight of about and contains the alpha gamma and epsilon polypeptides the minor fragment ib has about the same molecular weight but contains besides alpha gamma and epsilon the delta polypeptide fragment ii with a molecular weight of about appears to be MZ with the beta polypeptide atpase activity can be reconstituted from fragments ia and ii whereas the capacity of the atpase to drive energydependent processes in depleted membrane LDV is only restored after incubation of these two fractions with fraction ib which contains the delta subunit
1744,does intrauterine acidosis induce increased steroid secretion the concentration of free steroids cs increases in both fetal and maternal plasma during labor and delivery fetal levels are higher T3 vaginal than after cesarean section these differences may indicate an important role of the fetal adrenal gland in the induction of labor or they may reflect merely the fetal response to the stress of delivery during incrased intrauterine stress steroid secretion is increased as shown here we examined mothers and their infants during pathological labor pathology was assessed from fetal acidosis andor a clinically obstetric disease of the mother or fetus the cases included cesarean sections forceps deliveries spontaneous deliveries of which were premature at the time of delivery the ph and cs level were determined in maternal and umbilical vessels in all cases during spontaneous labor blood samples were also taken during the different stages of labour a competetive protein binding assay with transcortin without fractionation of the steroids was used progesteron was determined by the same assay the level of this hormone however remains unchanged and hence any changes reflect changes in cs the C2 of cs were correlated with the ph values and compared to previously obtained normal values during pathological deliveries cs levels in both mother and fetus are normal as long as there is no acidosis fig if acidosis is present the cs level in the umbilical artery is usually higher than normal in out of vaginal deliveries the cs level was above normal in the other at the upper limit of normal fig and at the same time the av difference becomes smaller and sometimes even negative no changes were noted in maternal and umbilical venous blood tab i and ii similar dependence on the ph was found for cesarean sections tab iii in premature deliveries without acidosis in the umbilical i.a. the cs C2 were lower in both mother and fetus tab i these results indicate that the fetal adrenal gland reacts to acidosis ie intrauterine stress with increased corticosteroid secretion this rise depends on the ph of fetal blood and not on the type of delivery fig
1745,previous studies on the effects on heart rate and blood pressure in normals and hypertensive patients during dynamic exercise ergometer bicycling or treadmill walking and isometric exercise sustained handgrip are reviewed in one study utilising submaximal bicycle exercise in hypertensives there was a increase in HR rate for a increase in systolic pressure and fall in Pd betaadrenoreceptor blockade decreased the HR rate level by to for a decrease of systolic blood pressure level by to whereas the diastolic pressure level was unaffected a protocol is described utilising a blind indirect blood pressure recording machine automanometer with which cuff inflation and deflation are automatic and constant and blood pressure values stored at suitable korotkov sound phases the machine also records heart rate by this method ISO exercise at of maximal voluntary contraction SHG has been studied in normals and hypertensives off and on different treatments both in normals and established hypertensives there was about a increase in systolic blood pressure during ISO exercise for about a increase in diastolic blood pressure and increase in heart rate normotensive women had the lowest rise in blood pressure and the highest rise in heart rate betaadrenoreceptor blocking agents lowered heart rate during ISO exercise by to but did not affect the blood pressure level since resting blood pressure C2 were decreased the percentage rise in pressure was enhanced following betablockers a combination of a betablocker clonidine andor a vasodilator produced a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure as well as in heart rate during ISO exercise
1746,ring dichroism spectra rd of histidine decarboxylase hdc from micrococcus sp n at the regions of peptide bonds nm and aromatic amino acids nm absorption are studied the treatment of rd spectra according to methods of greenfieldfasman saksenavetlaufer and mayer permits to conclude that at the ph range within the content of ordered structures of alphahelix type comprises that of betastructure type while the rest are represented with polypeptide chain in a disordered globular state when ph is varied from to the content of alphahelices decreases from to there are two distinct dichroic bands in the spectrum of aromatic chromophores absorption at and nm the former containing tirosine tryptophane and phenylalanine residues and the latter being induced with triptophane residues the study of hdc rd spectra at the regions of peptide bonds and aromatic acids absorption at different temperatures has shown that a part of triptophane IMT and phenylalanine residues is in an ordered structure of the alphahelix type the hdc undergoes irreversible changes under heating to degrees and in m urea m guanidine chloride eliminates the ordered hdc structure while sodium dodecylsulphate at concentrations up to does not affect the enzyme structure
1747,MW irradiation of kw at mhz for msec was sufficient to completely inactivate mouse brain cholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase T3 this method of sacrifice the acetylcholine contents of mouse brain regions given in nanomoles per gram were found to be striatum medullapons diencephalonmidbrain hippocampus cerebral cortex and cerebellum SP caused a dosedependent increase in whole BB acetylcholine a maximal increase of in whole brain was seen at T2 with mgkg of sodium pentobarbital the increase in acetylcholine after sodium pentobarbital treatment was not caused by anoxia from respiratory depression or by HT all BB regions except the cerebellum exhibited an increase in acetylcholine T3 pentobarbital treatment fifteen T2 after treatment cerebellar acetylcholine was significantly decreased however at the time when half of the animals had regained the righting reflex the unconscious mice showed an increase in cerebellar acetylcholine which was statistically significant as compared to control the relative accumulation rate of acetylcholine calculated for CBF cortex and hippocampus was higher than that for striatum although the absolute rate of accumulation of ach was higher in the striatum thus after sodium pentobarbital treatment the cerebral cortex and hippocampus exhibit a greater cholinergic response than the striatum
1748,the T0 of P0 of birthweight less than or equal to g characterized by a common point the presence of placenta praevia in the mother enabled us to come to grips with the severe respiratory distress that these newborn can have from the clinical standpoint there is always early respiratory distress from the radiological standpoint by far the most dominant pathology was interstitial edema giving rise to a wet lung from the biochemical standpoint the blood gases were characterized in a certain number of cases by hypoxemia which was refractory to the usual forms of treatment from the mechanical standpoint measurements carried out in patients confirmed the extraordinary fall in these patients compliance the clinical radiological blood gas and mechanical analysis enabled one to differenciate main types of indications for artificial ventilation acute hypoxemia the idea of an increased need for oxygen in these types of indications for artificial ventilation it was apparent that the treatment of choice is constant positive pressure which may or may not be combined with intermittent positive pressure with this treatment technique none of the patients progressed to massive atelectasis it can be said that with the advent of techniques of ventilation by OHP combining ipp with cpp one has definitively eliminated from this pathological picture the principal cause of death anoxia due to massive alveolar collapse
1749,folic acid is one of the younger vitamins yet it has attracted intensive T0 in the thirty years since the identification of pteroylglutamic acid and its polyglutamyl conjugates the absorption and malabsorption of folates natural purified and synthetic in disease has been studied more than any other vitamin and indeed folate absorption has become one clinical test of intestinal function we know little about the release of folate from protein complexes but we have learned with the help of synthetic radiolabelled pteroylpolyglutamates that polyglutamyl folates are hydrolysed at or near the luminal border of the intestine and the released folate is efficiently absorbed the rate limiting stage of folate absorption appears to be the transport of the monoglutamyl folate in disease and with drugs folate malabsorption occurs primarily when monoglutamyl transport is depressed the specific components of the folate transport system listed in table are receiving increased attention the mechanism of uptake is still a topic of controversy but a dual system including both a saturable and a diffusion component would explain most of the data reduction and methyl or formyl addition occur in the intestine but such metabolism is not obligatory for transport the nature of folate binding within the cell and the CF of specific folate IB proteins requires further T0 at present we have little or no information about the mechanism of folate release from the epithelial cell to the circulation but this step also could influence the rate and specificity of overall process the tools are now at hand to complete our understanding of the steps in folate absorption and metabolism such an understanding should facilitate the management of folate deficiency whenever it complicates gastrointestinal disease or drug therapy
1750,the treatment of spinach chloroplasts with pnitrothiophenol in the light at acidic and neutral phs caused TPS inhibition of the photosystem ii activity whereas the same treatment in the dark did not affect the activity at all the photosystem i activity was not inhibited by pnitrothiophenol both in the light and in the dark the inhibition was accompanied by changes of fluorescence from chloroplasts as observed at room temperature the nm band was lowered by the pnitrothiophenol treatment in the light and at liquid nitrogen temperature the relative height of the nm band to the nm band increased and the nm band shifted to longer wavelengths the action spectra for these effects of pnitrothiophenol on the activity and fluorescence showed a peak at nm with a red drop at longer wavelengths it was concluded that the CS absorbed by photosystem ii is responsible for the chemical modification of chloroplasts with pnitrothiopehnol to causing the specific inhibition of PS ii
1751,the binding of triiodothyronine by rana catesbeiana tadpole tail fin tail muscle kidney and liver cytosol was studied using dextrancoated charcoal to separate bound and free hormone a metal ion dependency was suggested by the fact that edta decreased the binding of triiodothyronine to in tail fin and tail muscle cytosol inhibition of binding in kidney or liver was less to this inhibition could be restored by adding an excess of divalent cations with an order of potency of mn greater than ca congruent to co greater than sr greater than ba greater than mg other chelators eg ophenanthroline hydroxyquinoline and DDE glycol bisbetaaminoethylethernntetraacetate also decreased the IB of triiodothyronine whereas citrate oxalate imidazole and glycine had no effect the triiodothyronine IB capacity of tail fin cytosol was reduced by edta treatment and dialysis against buffer ca in the to mm range and mn at mm could restore the binding to normal levels higher mn increased IB above normal or to carestored levels the triiodothyronine cytosol CBA was nondialyzable heatlabile phdependent pronasedigestible but unaffected by incubation with trypsin rnase and dnase suggesting that the cytosol binding sites are acidic proteins scatchard analysis of triiodothyronine IB by the cytosol of different tissues revealed kassoc of x m x m x m and x m for tail fin tail muscle kidney and liver cytosol respectively the corresponding maximal Bmax in picomoles per mg of crude cytosol protein in these four tissues were and respectively
1752,the aim of this study was to investigate malignant lymphomas of donor origin induced in f mice undergoing a chronic graftversushost reaction gvhr after injection of parental strain spleen cells a total of x or x B6 spleen cells were po to weekold h incompatible cbl x htgf hybrids either as single or fractionated ip injections recipients were killed at intervals ranging from month to year after the first injection and their lymphoid cells typed for hostderived and donorderived histocompatibility antigens in of the gvh f mice cells failed to be killed by a hyperimmune SS against htg hg but reacted normally with antisera to cbl hb and in the cases tested to thetach the conclusion that the lymphoid cells of these mice were derived from donor cells was supported by the finding that these animals lacked immunoglobulins bearing hostderived iga allotype in their SS fortythree percent of the gvh f mice developed reticulum cell sarcomas rcs revealed hyperplastic lymphoreticular tissue and showed no grossly abnormal changes mice with donortype NALT were found in all three groups of the rcs detected were donortype neoplasms the induction of donortype rcs during the gvhr strengthens the concept of lymphomagenesis through persistent stimulation with antigens
1753,it is generally believed that the reduction in plasma hco characteristic of chronic hypocapnia results from renal homeostatic mechanisms designed to minimize the alkalemia produced bythe hypocapneic state to test this hypothesis we have induced chronic hypocapnia in dogs in which plasma hco had previously been markedly reduced from to meqliter by the prolonged FF of hcl the paco of chronically acidfed animals was reduced from to mm hg by placing the animials in a C1 environmental chamber containing oxygen in response to this reduction in paco mean plasma hco fell by meqliter reaching a new steadystate level of meqliter this decrement in plasma hco is almost identical to the meqliter decrement previously observed in normal nonacidfed animals in which the same degree of chronic hypocapnia had been induced thus in both normal and hclfed animals the renal response to chronic hypocapnia causes plasma hco to fall by approximately meqliter for each millimeter of hg reduction in co tension by contrast the response of plasma h in the two groups was markedly different instead of the fall in h which is seen during chronic hypocapnia in normal animals h in hclfed animals rose significantly from to neqliter ph this seemingly paradoxical response is of course an expression of the constraints imposed by the henderson equation and reflects the fact that the percent fall in hco in the hclfed animals was greater than the percent fall in paco these findings clearly indicate that in chronic hypocapnia the kidney cannot be regarded as the effector limb in a homeostatic feedback system geared to the defense of systemic pH
1754,the influence of mepiprazole emd a new pyrazolylalkylpiperazine derivative on the uptake of hnorepinephrine ne hdopamine da and hserotonin ht into rat brain synaptosomes from cerebral SC CS and hypothalamus was investigated in comparison with several psychotropic drugs including oxypertine damphetamine imipramine desipramine chlorimipramine amitriptyline and chlorpromazine in vitro mepiprazole was a relatively weak inhibitor of monoamine uptake and exhibited its strongest action on the hypothalamic ht uptake being almost equipotent with desipramine ic mum furthermore the influence of the drugs on the PR of hamines previously taken up by whole rat brain synaptosomes was studied unlike the tricyclic antidepressants mepiprazole as well as oxypertine and damphetamine markedly increased the efflux of radioactivity during a min incubation at degrees c at low concentrations to m whereas at m all drugs greatly enhanced the efflux the ability of mepiprazole to increase ht concentration at the receptor level by a combination of neuronal uptake inhibition and release is discussed in relationship to the central actions of the drug
1755,the relation between sperm antibodies agglutinins and ifantibodies in SS and seminal plasma was studied in three selected groups of male partners in infertile couples with respect to specificity concentrations and immunoglobulin classes agglutinins were found in seminal plasma only when they were also present in serum but there was no strict correlation between the titres in SP and serum although serum titres were always the higher ones however in cases with tailtotail agglutinins a difference of more than fourfold steps between the titres was never found spontaneous agglutination in the ejaculate generally occurred when the SP titre was or more and in patients with high seminal plasma titres iga was detected in the midpiece region of ejaculated spermatozoa in contrast headtohead agglutinins were found in seminal plasma in only one of patients with these agglutinins in serum and only in a low titre absorption of igg of igg with proteinaproducing staphylococcus aureus showed that tailtotail agglutinins in SS were EA whereas they could be characterized as nonigain SP suggesting a local production of these antibodies ifantibodies were rarely found in seminal plasma and seemed to be of little significance in relation to infertility in men
1756,data on the pharmacology of a new antianginal drugnonachlasineare presented nonachlasine was found to increase the blood flow intensively and for long periods of time increasing the oxygen reserve of the myocardium thus increasing the cardiac SO and the contractile function of the heart the prevailing action of nonachlasine on the blood supply and the function of the myocardium seems to be the result of several mechanisms decreasing resistance of the coronaries due to the activation of the betaadrenergic structures influence upon the extravascular factors of the regulation of the coronary circulation changes in the metabolism and cardiac activity due to the excitation of the betaadrenergic structures the mechanism of the positive effect of nonachlasine upon the blood supply and function of the heart is connected with its action on the adrenergic processes the drug accumulates noradrenaline in the myocardium and increases the activity of phosphorilasea this coincides in time with the increased blood supply and contractile capacity of the HR the betaadrenoblocking agents prevent these effects it was postulated that the effect of nonachlasine in the blood supply and the activity of the HR is connected with its ability to utilize the SE reserve of the myocardium by way of switching over to the anaerobic way
1757,gammaglutamyl transpeptidase is associated with the CM of a number of epithelial and lymphoid cells when the enzyme is isolated from rat kidney by a method involving detergent extraction and AC an aggregate of molecular weight greater than heavy form is obtained treatment of the heavy form with bromelain yields a light form of the enzyme molecular weight of approximately which is separable by isoelectric focusing into enzymatically active isozymes which are very similar with respect to catalytic behavior content of amino acids hexoses and aminohexoses but which differ significantly in sialic acid content treatment with neuraminidase converts the acidic isozymes to more basic forms each isozyme dissociates in sodium dodecyl sulfate into two nonidentical glycopeptides molecular weights of and which can be crosslinked with DMS to yield a species with an apparent molecular weight of which indicates that the isozymes are dimers physical and immunological studies indicate that the heavy form of the enzyme contains the dimeric CS form as well as other membrane proteins
1758,the effect of temperature on the binding of thyroxine and triiodothyronine to TBG has been studied by ED inclusion of ovalbumin in the dialysis mixture stabilized TBG against losses in IB activity which had been found to occur during ED ovalbumin by itself bound the thyroid hormones very weakly and its IB could be neglected when analyzing the experimental results at ph and degrees in m potassium phosphate mm edta buffer thyroxine was bound to thyroxinebinding AHG at a single binding site with apparent association constants at degrees k x m at degrees k x m and at degrees k x m scatchard plots of the binding data for triiodothyronine indicated that the binding of this compound to TBG was more complex than that found for thyroxine the data for triiodothyronine binding could be fitted by asuming the existence of two different classes of IB sites at degrees and ph nonlinear regression analysis of the data yielded the values n k x m and n k x m at degrees the values for the binding constants were n k x m and n k x m at degrees where less curvature was observed the estimated binding constants were n k x m and nk x m when n was fixed at the resulting values obtained for the other three IB constants were at degrees k x m n k x m and at degrees k x m n and k x m the thermodynamic values for thyroxine binding to TBG at degrees and ph were deltag kcalmole deltah kcalmole and deltas cal degree mole for triiodothyronine at degrees the thermodynamic values for binding at the primary binding site were deltag kcalmole deltah kcalmole and deltas cal degree mole measurement of the ph dependence of binding indicated that both thyroxine and triiodothyronine were bound maximally in the region of physiological ph ph to
1759,histology of certified and possible cases of nonspecific aortoarteriitis takayasus disease is described the lesions are not specific they consist of diffuse or focal chronic inflammatory infiltrates in media and adventita granulomas with or without CE coagulation CN may occur media and adventitia show a marked fibrous hyperplasia the elastic fibers are destroyed the intima is thickened by a fibrous proliferation secondary arteriosclerosis is frequently observed perforated or dissecting aneurysms due to the chronic inflammation of the aortic wall may occur the abdominal aorta is most frequently affected but any section of the aortic wall may be involved takayasus disease is not rare in our area contrary to most of the tropical countries females do not predominate among our patients and aged persons may be affected too etiology is unknown the affection probably belongs to the autoimmune diseases the histologic differentiation from other inflammatory V1 diseases and even from a resorptive inflammation due to a perforated or dissected aneurysm may be extremely difficult
1760,changes in cell volume and ion content of a halobacterium species are described in terms of the nacl concentration m and ph of the suspending medium cell volume per unit content of protein of bacteria in stationary phase cultures rose as the nacl of the GM was increased logarithmicphase bacteria shrank as the ph fell from to these changes are characteristic of bacteria with a moderate or rapid rate of o consumption starving ie nonmetabolizing bacteria on the other hand did not change in size within the above ranges of nacl and ph at lower values however such bacteria swelled and eventually lysed effects of low ph on cell ions are compared in metabolizing and starving bacteria and it is shown that changes in the state of the cell k are correlated with movements of cell na it appears that the cell k is used to maintain cell na below the nacl concentration of the medium the results are explained in terms of a MM involving interactions between polyelectrolytes salts and water in the concentrated cytoplasm of these halophilic organisms
1761,the antihypertensive efficacy and side effects of the combined therapy with propranolol phenoxybenzamine and hydrochlorothiazide were examined in patients with moderate and moderately severe hypertension following a control period two to three weeks duration propranolol was started in nine patients as the sole antihypertensive agent and together with phenoxybenzamine in eight by titrating the dosage against pulse rate and blood pressure response propranolol was given in divided doses from to mg and phenoxybenzamine from to mg per day when propranolol was given alone in nine patients for four to weeks normal blood pressure was not attained in any patients during three to ten weeks of combined propranolol and phenoxybenzamine therapy in patients normal blood pressure mm hg or less or nearnormal pressure or less was attained in patients in the recumbent position and in patients in the upright position while orthostatic SH was not observed except for a reduction of ejaculation in three out of six male patients no other side effects were encountered the addition of hydrochlorothiazide diuretic in all of the above patients at a dose of mg per day with a concomitant decrease in the dose of phenoxybenzamine produced a further reduction in blood pressure and normal or nearnormal blood pressure was attained in all subjects symptomatic OH observed in two patients was treated by a further readjustment of the dose of phenoxybenzamine while inhibition of ejaculation was persistent in only one patient it is concluded that the combined administration of propranolol phenoxybenzamine and hydrochlorothiazide in individualized doses is very effective in lowering the blood pressure with minimal side effects
1762,strains of diplococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were tested for susceptibility to numerous antibiotics by a twofold agar dilution method using an inocula replicator undiluted fully grown broth cultures were used as inocula for both species and cultures of pneumococci diluted were also tested the antibiotics included most of those in common use in the united states as well as some chemical modifications recently approved and others that are under investigation the most striking aspect of the results was the marked susceptibility of the pneumococci to all the antibiotics tested except the polymyxins and most of the aminoglycoside antibiotics although some new AGs were AS in quite low concentrations some of the strains of pneumococci were of decreased susceptibility to penicillin g minimal inhibitory concentrations to mugml but none were tetracycline resistant although such strains had been reported previously from this laboratory the strains of h influenzae which were all serologically nontypable exhibited different patterns of susceptibility to the groups of antibiotics and to the individual chemically related ones none of these strains isolated early in were ampicillin resistant the most active agents against h influenzae were carbenicillin and ampicillin analogues related to each of them RFP chloramphenicol and the polymyxins however the tetracycline analogues other than tetracycline some aminoglycosides notably tobramycin kanamycin gentamicin and verdamicin erythromycin and some new LCM analogues were also AS in low concentrations trimethoprim alone was highly AS and in combination with sulfamethoxazole it was even more active and synergistic against strains of both d pneumoniae and h influenzae
1763,a doubleblind study including three different cardioselective betablockers practolol h and MET was performed in MI and CP shortly after ON of symptoms transmural infarctions were found in patients while patients had nontransmural infarctions chest pain and the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure were significantly reduced in the betablocker CG whereas no changes were seen after saline all patients with nontransmural infarctions and out of with transmural infarctions got PR lasting for at least min none of the patients developed signs of left ventricular backward failure shock or bradycardia a decrease in st segment elevation was observed in all the transmural infarctions T3 betablockade no changes in st segment elevation were found after analgesics when given after saline but in some cases an increase was seen in this parameter when analgesics were given due to insufficient pain relief T3 betablockers or due to return of CP it is suggested that pain relief by betablockers indicates decrease of myocardial ischemia
1764,the mechanism of guanosine triphosphate gtp hydrolysis catalyzed by elongation factor g and the ribosome in the absence of other participants in protein synthesis was examined by steadystate kinetic analysis optimal hydrolytic conditions were determined to be approximately ph mm mg and mm nh kinetic analyses were performed under these conditions at constant elongation factor g concentrations and VL ribosome and gtp concentrations the resulting doublereciprocal plots in conjunction with the inhibition patterns obtained with gdp indicated that the reaction occurs by an ordered mechanism in which gtp is the leading obligatory substrate dissociation constants for gtp and guanosine diphosphate gdp as well as limiting michaelis constants for gtp and ribosomes were calculated from the doublereciprocal plots these values are ksgtp mum ksgdp mukmgtp mum kmr mum inhibition was also observed at high ribosomal concentrations and suggests that inhibition was due both to the decreased breakdown of the tertiary elongation factor ggdpribosome posthydrolytic complex and to the formation of a nonproductive elongation factor gribosome complex a sequential mechanism with a deadend elongation factor gribosome complex has been constructed to describe the hydrolysis of gtp catalyzed by elongation factor g and the ribosome
1765,while vs plots of phospholipase a show a Tm kinetic behaviour of phospholipase a acting in the same concentration range is hyperbolic however T3 phospholipase a has been solubilized from the PMs by m nacl the vs curve shows a Tm membranebound phospholipase a shows a narrow optimum ph at while phospholipase a activity presents only small variations between ph and towards exogenous phospholipids at the optimum ph of phospholipase a the TPS activity of the latter is fold higher than phospholipase a TPS activity on the contrary towards endogenous phospholipids phospolipase a activity is higher than phospholipase a activity moreover labeled endogenous pe hydrolysis by phospholipase a is decreased by addition of non labeled exogenous pe into the incubation medium all these data suggest that the active site of phospholipase a is turned to the outside and acts only on exogenous substrates for phospholipase a it would be inside and exogenous phospholipids could be hydrolyzed only T3 penetrating the membrane
1766,phenacetin paracetamol and acetanilide can be determined in a plasma or urine sample by the use of deuterium labelled analogues these are produced by reaction of hexadeuterioacetic anhydride with the appropriate aromatic amine the nhcocd group is stable to hydrogen exchange below ph the internal standard is added to the plasma or urine T3 enzymatic hydrolysis of the paracetamol conjugates and an EA extract at ph is evaporated under nitrogen and the residue derivatized with nobistrimethylsilylacetamide an aliquot of this solution is injected into a gcms system and one ion characteristic of the material under study and the ion from the deuterium analogue mass units greater are monitored using a voltage switching technique in the case of phenacetin for example ions at and are monitored calibration curves relating different weight ratios of the hydrogen and deuterium compounds to their respective signals from the gas chromatography mass spectrometer are used to calculate the amount of a compound in a particular sample these methods have been developed to study the oxidation of acetanilide to paracetamol and the deethylation of phenacetin to paracetamol preliminary results from experiments with phenacetin will be discussed
1767,intact cells and extracts from spirillum lipoferum rapidly oxidized malate succinate lactate and pyruvate gl galactose fructose acetate and citrate did not increase the rate of o uptake by cells above the endogenous rate cells grown on nh Ox the various substrates at about the same rate as did cells grown on n added oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide generally enhanced o uptake by extracts supplied organic acids whereas Ox nicotinamide adenine CpG phosphate had little effect nitrogenase synthesis repressed by growth of cells in the presence of nh was derepressed by methionine sulfoximine or methionine sulfone the total glutamine synthetase activity from ngrown cells was about eight times that from nhgrown s lipoferum the response of glutamate dehydrogenase was the opposite the total glutamate synthetase activity from ngrown s lipoferum was to times that from nhgrown cells the levels of polybetahydroxybutyrate and betahydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase were elevated in cells grown on n as compared with those grown on nh cellfree extracts capable of reducing ch have been prepared both mg and mn are required for good activity
1768,various minor tranquilizers benzodiazepines barbiturates and meprobamate induced an increase in the food intake of rats or mice drugs were injected ip min before testing and the amount of food consumed during min was recorded the enhanced food consumption occurred when the animals were in a novel situation in a situation which they had previously experienced or in their home cage in which they were used to eating in the daytime within min studies with two benzodiazepines showed this effect to be maximal between to min after i.t. and to disappear hrs after i.t. moreover minor tranquilizers reduce the RL before eating of rats and mice tested in a new situation these results and the observation of antianxiety drugsinduced hyperphagia in satiated animals suggest that the enhanced food consumption of a non familiar food in a novel situation induced by the minor tranquilizers could hardly be related only to their antianxiety action the existence of some inhibitory controls endogenous satiety in daytime or satiety T3 recent absorption is not essential for the action of the minor tranquilizers an increased motivation and a disruption in the food related behavior could possibly be an explanation for all the observed effects
1769,a purification procedure for creatine kinase ec from muscle of the monke muequiv hmg protein per min at degrees c and a yield of approx gkg muscle assuming equilibrium kinetics synergistic binding of substrates at one catalytic site is found for both the forward and back reactions kinetic constants for the binding of each ATP to the free enzyme and the enzymesecond substrate complex are determined and are compared with those for the enzyme from other species inhibition by small anions is determined in the presence of different combinations of substrates and products so inhibits by simple competitive inhibition and probably binds at the site of the transferrable phosphoryl group inhibition by no no scn and cl is more complex and these ions are suggested to mimic the transferrable phosphoryl group in a planar transitionstate complex these anions stabilize the deadend complex enzymecreatinemgadp which lacks the transferable phosphoryl group the effects of these anions on the dissociation constants of the ES complexes is reported and is in accord with the above hypothesis the deadend complex in the absence of anion does not protect the essential thiol group against inhibition by iodoacetamide addition of no or cl to the deadend complex or a ATP equilibrium mixture without anion confers protection the essential thiol group is inhibited by iodoacetamide at a rate which is essentially independent of ph over the normal stability range of the enzyme contrary to our previous report this ph independence is not altered by the presence of deadend complex creatine plus mgadp in the presence or absence of anion or in the presence of a substrate equilibrium mixture it is inferred that the essential thiol group of the monkey enzyme has essentially the same properties as that of the rabbit enzyme in consequence the inferences made about the role of this group based on our previous work on the monkey enzyme are no longer valid the present findings are compatible with the essential thiol group playing a conformational role in the catalytic process
1770,the absorption of c carbenoxolone from everted rat ileum in vitro and from rat stomach and ileum in situ has been examined the rate of its mucosal to serosal transfer in vitro increases as ph increases from to whereas the amount bound to ileum tissue decreases with increased ph absorption closely parallels the drugs solubility the uptake of carbenoxolone in situ is biexponential and the rate constants for the two processes have been calculated absorption in situ and biliary excretion of the drug increases with increasing ph from to tissue binding to the ileum in situ is not dependent on ph except below ph when extensive tissue accumulation of carbenoxolone occurs because of its low solubility tissue IB to the stomach increases markedly with decrease of ph from to and at ph is times greater than binding to the intestine the rate of absorption from the stomach at ph was much less than that from the intestine in situ when allowance is made for the binding of carbenoxolone to the stomach contrary to the phpartition hypothesis correlation is apparent between its absorption and the amount present in the ionized form
1771,studied was the effect of some physical AF temperature ph of various values and some chemical ones urea sodium citrate sarcolysin methylene blue acridine orange pyronin CV potassium permanganate fuchsin tetracycline and tetraolean on phages specifically lysing pasteurella multocida strains having the following signature and c all investigated phages showed signs of inactivation at degrees c with a further linear dependence and at degrees c up to per cent of them were inactivated with phages of group iii inactivation discontinued between and degrees c at degrees c it being equal to that observed with i and ii group phages it was found that a broth medium of ph was the optimum one for p multocida phages with altered ph values lowest percentage of survived phage particles showed i group phages while those of ii and iii group proved more stable so far as the chemical factors were concerned it was established that with the exception of pyronin and potassium permanganate which inactivated the p multocida phages from to per cent all other agents produced full inactivation per cent however urea did not inactivate i group phages both it and sodium citrate inactivated partially ii and iii group phages the variations established with the phages in terms of their physical and chemical behaviour may serve as subsidiary signs bearing upon their classification
1772,the PSA properties of the electrically excitable sodium channels in the electroplaque of electrophorus electricus were investigated using tritiated tetrodotoxin ttx as a specific membrane probe membrane fragments from the electroplaque were isolated essentially by differential centrifugation and characterized with respect to the plasma membrane markers acetylcholine receptors acetylcholinesterase na katpase and httx IB equilibrium IB studies showed that httx bound to a single population of noninteracting receptor sites with an apparent KB of x m the toxinmembrane complex dissociated with a firstorder rate constant of sec studies on the ph dependence of complex formation demonstrated the requirement for an ionizable functional group with a pk of and this group has been shown to be a carboxyl treatment of the CM with trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate a carboxyl group modifying reagent resulted in an irreversible loss in the IB of httx which could be prevented by low concentrations of ttx or saxitoxin this decrease was due to a reduction in the total number of binding sites and not to a decrease in toxin IB affinities the relative IB affinities of various monovalent alkali metal and polyatomic cations for the ttxreceptor site showed that this site displayed cation discrimination properties which were similar to those reported previously for the electrically excitable sodium channel in IN nerve fibers a possible role for this site in the ion selectivity of the sodium channel is proposed
1773,an endobetagalactosidase acting on blood group a and b substances was found in the SC fluid of diplococcus pneumoniae the enzyme was purified fold and its properties were studied in detail the enzyme preparation thus obtained was practically free from various exoglycosidases endobetanacetylglucosaminidase and proteases the enzyme releases trisaccharides from blood group a and b active mucins purified from ovarian cyst fluid the structures of the trisaccharides liberated from a and b active mucins were elucidated to be galnacalpha leads to fucalpha leads to gal and galalpha leads to fucalpha leads to gal respectively the enzyme also hydrolyzes blood group a and b active oligosaccharides composed of type chains yielding the same products as in the case of ovarian cyst blood group substances an h active mucin from ovarian cyst fluid h active oligosaccharides and a and b AS oligosaccharides with type chains were not hydrolyzed by the enzyme consequently the enzyme catalyzes the following reaction resulting in the degradation of blood type a and b determinants see article
1774,the bicarbonate concentration in rat parotid saliva increases with increasing flow rates and approximates plasma values at highest salivation at lowest flow rates the bicarbonate concentration in the secretory fluid markedly exceeds the plasma C2 intravenous administration of acetazolamide has no influence on the bicarbonate excretion of the parotid gland following retrograde application of acetazolamide into the gland duct the concentrations of both bicarbonate and sodium are elevated the potassium concentrations in final saliva exceed meql at flow rates below mulmin g gland weight with increasing flow rates a precipitous decrease in potassium concentration below meql occurs with further increase in flow rate the potassium concentration remains unchanged the sodium concentrations increased with augmented salivation rate at lowest flow rates the sodium concentrations showed an increase of modest degree our findings can best be explained by the existence of two independent ductular mechanism a bicarbonate reabsorption probably in the striated ducts of the PG b secretion of potassium with concomitand secretion of bicarbonate in the main excretory duct
1775,npyrenemaleimide is nonfluorescent in AQ solution but forms strongly fluorescent adducts with sulfhydryl groups of organic compounds or proteins the conjugation reactions of npyrenemaleimide are relatively fast and can be monitored by the increase in fluorescence intensity of the Py chromophore in cases where primary amino CG are also present in the system we have observed a red shift of the emission spectra of the fluorescent adducts subsequent to the initial conjugation as characterized by the disappearance of three emission peaks at and nm and the appearance of two new peaks at and nm model studies with npyrenemaleimide adducts of lcysteine and cysteamine indicate that the spectral shift is the result of an intramolecular aminolysis of the succinimido ring in the adducts evidence from both chemical analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance studies of the addition products supports this reaction scheme npyrenemaleimide adducts of nacetyllcysteine and betamercaptoethanol which have no free amino group do not exhibit a spectral shift among several protein conjugates only the npyrenemaleimide adduct of bovine serum albumin pmbsa shows the spectral shift resembling that of pmcysteine npyrenemaleimide reacts with the sulfhydryl group of the single cysteine residue at position in bsa the finding that the alphaamino group of the nterminus in pmbsa is blocked after the spectral shift is completed strongly suggests that npyrenemaleimide crosslinks the nterminus and the cysteine residue in bsa the relative proximity of the sulfhydryl and amino groups is very critical in the crosslinking as demonstrated by the observation that the spectral shift observed with pmbsa can be prevented by addition of denaturing reagents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate immediately T3 labeling and by the failure of pmglutathione to undergo the intramolecular aminolysis since the intramolecular rearrangement of pm adducts is associated with characteristic fluorescence changes npyrenemaleimide can serve as a fluorescent crosslinking reagent which provides information about the spatial proximity of sulfhydryl and amino groups in proteins
1776,the alga ankistrodesmus braunii was grown with nnitrate under optimized conditions of a largescale mass cultivation of the dried algae were isolated as a mixture of amino acids the nlabelled amino acids n content up to were separated by ion exchange chromatography using pyridine acetate gradients the n cotent of the analytically pure amino acid was determined by combined gasliquid chromatographymass spectrometry of the trifluoroacetylated methylesters and by emission spectroscopy in the n analysator using pulse fourier transform c nuclear magnetic resonance the ph dependence of the cn coupling constants of asp pro ser glu gly ala val ile and leu was determined in AQ solutions increasing coupling constants were found with ph and decreasing electron density respectively the relation of binsch et al binsch g lambert jb roberts bw and roberts jd jam chem soc between the coupling constant and the product of the spart of the c and n hybridization sc sn j cx fits best in acidic medium the magnitude of coupling constants correlates well with the electron densities calculated by del re et al del re g pullman b and yonezawa t biochim biophys acta the recording of c nuclear magnetic resonance spectra over the entire ph range revealed no change in the sign of the cn coupling constants of the amino acids
1777,the transmission of mansonella ozzardi was studied in two rubber collecting villages on the river purus state of amazonas brazil haematophagous insects were collected from human and bovine baits during the day and night mansonia amazonensis and culicoides sp indet were free from infection with m ozzardi the former species is probably not a vector but the low numbers of culicoides dissected preclude any determination of its vector status thirtyfive of simulium amazonicum dissected were found naturally INF with larvae of m ozzardi two hundred and ninetynine m amazonensis and s amazonicum were experimentally infected with m ozzardi by feeding on volunteers microfilariae were detected in the blood meals of both species but no developing larvae were found in the thoracic muscles of m amazonensis confirming its nonvector status of the s amazonicum dissected had filarial larvae in the thorax there was a statistically significant difference between this rate and the NK rate of infection in this region verifying that penetration of the thoraric muscles by m ozzardi had occurred in the experimental infection the data confirm the observation of cerqueira that s amazonicum transmits m ozzardi in brazil
1778,cyclic amp in strongylocentrotus purpuratus sperm was elevated approximately fold by theophylline or methylisobutylxanthine factors released from sea urchin eggs fre elevated sperm cyclic amp by about fold within min and the combination of fre with theophylline increased sperm cyclic amp up to fold within min cyclic gmp in sea urchin sperm was slightly elevated by theophylline but was lowered by fre cyclic gmp in sperm treated with fre plus theophylline was not higher than in sperm treated with theophylline alone the ability of frecontaining sea water to increase sperm cAMP in the presence of theophylline was altered only slightly if at all by boiling but it was decreased by about by dialysis and destroyed by ashing filtration of fre on sephadex g columns yielded two peaks of cyclic ampelevating activity one peak peak i was eluted at the column void volume and the other peak ii was retained by the column the cyclic gmplowering activity was located in fractions approximately corresponding to peak i of cyclic ampelevating activity dialysis of frecontaining sea water before its application to the g column virtually eliminated peak ii of the cyclic ampelevating activity when the cyclic ampelevating activity in peak i was filtered on bio gel am columns it also migrated at or near the column Vo fractions corresponding to peak i contained material that inhibited both guanylate and adenylate cyclase MICs in broken cell preparations of sperm and guanylate cyclase from rat lung the inhibitory material was SD to boiling nondialyzable and destroyed by ashing under a variety of conditions frecontaining sea water or cyclic ampelevating peaks i or ii did not stimulate sperm adenylate cyclase activity in broken cell preparations
1779,the rate of coronary blood flow was varied in isolated working rat heart preparations to determine its influence on the rate of glocose utilization tissue highenergy phosphates and intracellular ph a reduction in coronary blood flow resulted in a reduction in oxygen consumption an accelerated rate of glusoe utilization lower tissue levels of highenergy phosphate and higher tissue levels of lactate and h ventricular performance deteriorated as reflected by a decrease in heart rate and PSP further reductions in coronary blood flow resulted in inhibition of glycolysis a greater decrease in tissue C2 of highenergy phosphates and higher tissue levels of both lactate and h these changes in glycolytic flux tissue metabolites and VVI performance were proportional to the degree of restriction in coronary blood flow the importance of coronary blood flow and washout of the interstitial space in the maintenance of accelerated glycolytic flux in oxygendeficient hearts is emphasized it is concluded that acceleration of atp production from glycolysis can occur only in the marginally ischemic tissue in the peripheral area of tissue supplied by an occluded artery the central area of tissue which receives a low rate of coronary blood flow will have a reduced rate of atp production due to both a lack of oxygen and an inhibition of glycolysis
1780,blood pressure HR rate oxygen uptake and blood values of po pco and ph were studied in unanesthetized rats for hours T3 a cardiotoxic dose of mgkg isoprenaline sc blood pressure fell from to mm hg heart rate accelerated from to beatsminute and cardiac work diminished by about metabolic rate increased by about blood values of po rose and those of pco fell somewhat whereas blood ph dropped from to indicating metabolic acidosis propranolol mgkg ip and verapamil mgkg ip both of which almost CR prevented isoprenalineinduced cardiac necroses inhibited the chronotropic and calorigenic actions of isoprenaline by about while propranolol inhibited the depressor effect of isoprenaline completely verapamil enhanced it blood pressure fell to mm hg isoprenalineinduced fall of blood ph was not prevented by either propranolol or verapamil decrease of blood ph and cardionecrotisation were enhanced when isoprenaline was given together with gkg ethanol po in conclusion hemodynamic actions of isoprenaline especially hypotension seem to be nonessential for the production of cardiac necroses strong acidification can aggravate the cardiotoxicity of isoprenaline
1781,the PSA properties of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases in a nonmetastasizing and a spontaneously metastasizing rat mammary carcinoma were compared the phosphooiesterases in both tumors had a ph optimum of around and preferentially hydrolysed cyclic purine nucleotides the rate of hydrolysis of purine nucleotides in the nonmetastasizing tumor was two times higher than in the metastasizing RT but the rate of pyrimidine nucleotide hydrolysis was equal in both tumors theophylline caffeine and dlbutoxymethoxybenzylimidazolidinone ro inhibited the enzyme activity in both tumors the percent inhibition was the same by each inhibitor the cyclic nucleotie phosphodiesterase activity in either RT was stimulated by mg mn and co and suppressed by ca zn and ni edta inhibited the activity below the basal level activity in the absence of added cation an this inhibition could be recovered up to the basal level by an equimolar quantity of either mn or mg further stimulation of the CEA with increasing concentrations of divalent cations was observed only with mn similar effects were observe with EG bisbetaaminoethyl ethertnntetraacetic acid the stimulatory cations affected both the low and high michaelis constant tkm enzymes in these tumors by increasing the maximum velocity in the low km enzyme the km was also slightly increased neither cGMP nor cAMP had any effect on the hydrolysis of the other at physiologic levels
1782,histamine diphosphate was shown to selectively attract human eosinophils from mixed granulocyte populations when over eosinophils were used in a modified boyden chamber chemotactic CA system this effect of histamine is abolished by incubation with diamine oxidase histaminase and was generated by decarboxylation of lhistidine a linear dose dependent increase in eosinophil migration was observed between x m and x m while higher concentrations of histamine inhibited the migration of eosinophils the attractant activity of histamine was not inhibited by h or h receptor antagonists however the inhibition of migration observed at higher histamine concentrations was reversed by metiamine an h receptor antagonist the effects of histamine upon eosinophil migration were demonstrable using three different assays a counting cells that had traversed mum pore mum thick polycarbonate filters b counting cells that had migrated various distances into a mum pore mum cellulose nitrate filters or c measuring the number of cells that had traversed an upper polycarbonate filter and migrated into a lower cellulose nitrate filter using crlabeled cells the ability of histamine to enhance eosinophil migration was shown to be dependent upon the presence of a concentration gradient histamine did not cause a dosedependent increase in random motility furthermore preincubation of the eosinophils with histamine deactivate the cells to further stimulation by histamine or by ca it is concluded that in low doses histamine is a chemoattractant for human eosinophils while in higher doses histamine inhibits eosinophil migration these observations may relate to the influx and localization of eosinophils in immediate hypersensitivity reactions
1783,for virus REC from sewage a mixture of talc and celite was tested as a possible inexpensive substitute for polyelectrolyte pe after adjustment of ph to and the addition of PI forming units pfuml of poliovirus type i sabin to the sewage sample under test ml of it was passed through either a pe mg or a talc mgcelite mg layer the layeradsorbed virus was eluted with ml of fetal calf SS fcs in saline ph in these experiments pe layers recovered mean of the input virus in comparison virus recoveries with the talccelite layers were mean passage of litres of raw sewage containing to x pfu ml of the poliovirus through the talc gcelite g layers and virus elution with ml of fcs in saline gave virus recoveries of mean except for ph adjustment and prefiltration through two layers of gauze to remove large solids no other sample pretreatment was found to be necessary application of this technique to REC of indigenous viruses from field samples of raw sewage and effluents has been highly satisfactory
1784,the L1 portion of glutamine synthetase activity in root nodules of soyabean plants is associated with the cytosol rather than with rhizobium japonicum bacteroids glutamine synthetase accounts for about of the total soluble protein in nodule cytosol glutamine synthetase from nodule cytosol has been purified by a procedure involving fractionation with protamine sulphate ammonium sulphate and PP glycol chromatography on deaebiogel a and biogel am and affinity chromatography on glutamateagarose columns the purified preparation appeared to be homogeneous in the analytical ultracentrifuge from sedimentationequilibrium experiments a mol wt of about was determined for the native enzyme and for the enzyme in guanidinium chloride from these data and measurements of electron micrographs we have concluded that glutamine synthetase from nodule cytosol consists of eight subunits arranged in two sets of planar tetramers which form a cubical configuration with dimensions of about nm a across each side glutamine synthetase from nodule cytosol has a higher glycine and proline content and a lower content of phenylalanine than the glutamine synthetase that has been prepared from pea seed the cytosol enzyme contains four halfcystine molecules per subunit which is in contrast with two reported for the enzyme from pea seed enzyme activity is striking influenced by the relative proportion of mg and mn in the assay medium activity is inhibited by feedback inhibitors and is influenced by energy charge
1785,rmi rmi and rmi are newly synthetized nrdibenzobfoxepinylnmethylpiperazinemaleates which show interesting psychopharmacologic effects this work contains the results of a study performed with these three EDC in order to demonstrate their neuropsycholeptic activity in comparison with chloropromazine cpz and chlordiazepoxide cpd the inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that the compounds reduce the normal spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone the centraldepressant activity is evidenced by increased barbiturateinduced sleep and a remarkable eyelid ptosis can also be observed our EDC do not show any activity on electroshock just as do cpz and cpd as to the antipsychotic outline our compounds show strong reduction of lethality due to amphetamine in grouped mice and a strong antiapomorphine activity they show also an antiaggressive effect and an GABA activity on avoidance behaviour much stronger than cpz we have also found extrapyramidal effects as catalepsy common to many tranquillizers of the kind of the standards used by us as for vegetative phenomena the compounds show hypotensive dose related action ranging from moderate to strong probably due to an areceptor inhibition adrenolytic activity against MLD of adrenaline antiserotonin and antihistaminic effects as well as other actions hypothermia analgesia etc confirm that rmi rmi and rmi are endowed with pharmacologic properties similar and more potent than those of cpz studies on the metabolism of brain CAs show that they are similar to cpz although with less effect on dopamine level
1786,several experiments conducted by our group over a period of years have shown that nutritional AS especially protein andor calorie deprivation leads to many often dramatic changes in the immune responses of mice rats and guinea pigs chronic protein ED cpd has been shown to create an enhancing effect on the cellmediated immune responses of these animals humoral responses under cpd conditions were most often found to be depressed but sometimes were unaffected depending on the nature of the antigen employed chronic protein ED consistent with the pattern just mentioned improved RT immunity by depressing production of bcell blocking factors and in at least one instance resistance to development of mammary adenocarcinoma in ch mice was associated with evidence of increased numbers of Ts profound nutritional deficits less than protein per total daily FI depressed both cellular and humoral immunity early though temporary protein ED caused a LT depression of both cellular and humoral immunity also with the humoral component being the first to recover manipulation of protein and calories was found to have a profound effect on certain autoimmune conditions diets high in fat and low in protein favored reproduction but shortened the life of nzb mice whereas diets high in protein and low in fat inhibited OD of autoimmunity and prolonged life chronic moderate PR permitted nzb mice to maintain their normally waning immunologic functions much longer than mice fed a normal protein intake further the lowprotein diet was associated with a delay in development of manifestations of autoimmunity decreasing dietary calories by a reduction of fats carbohydrates and proteins more than doubled the average life span of nzb x nzwf mice a CS prone to early death from autoimmune disease histopathologic studies using immunofluorescent microscopy revealed that the development of the renal lesions caused by the deposition of antigenantibody complexes which is so characteristic of these mice was markedly delayed
1787,catalase from green leaves of lens culinaris lentils was investigated with respect to isoenzyme patterns in contrast to other plants which have been reported to contain multiple forms of catalase only one form of this enzyme was revealed when crude extracts were subjected to SGE or to polyacrylamide discgel electrophoresis furthermore catalases from leaves stems and cotyledons were electrophoretically identical the leaf enzyme has been purified by conventional methods to apparent homogeneity it has a molecular weight of ultracentrifuge and is composed of four MZ subunits of molecular weight sodium dodecylsulphate gel PACE the ratio aa of the pure enzyme was found to be the isoelectric point is at ph the enzyme very labile at phvalues below is stable in tris chloride and potassium phosphate buffers between ph and it is slowly inactivated by mm dithiothreitol and is rapidly inactivated by mm mercaptoethanol the catalase was shown to be the major protein component of the peroxisomal matrix it could not be detected at the membranes of the leaf peroxisomes
1788,reduction of the active center disulfide bond in the flavoprotein pig heart lipoamide dehydrogenase generates two sulfur moieties which are chemically inequivalent in the electron reduced form of the enzyme thus cysteine residue is at least fold more reactive than its partner toward iodoacetamide at ph this selectivity was demonstrated by reaction of the electron reduced enzyme with a low concentration of iodocacetamide under anaerobic conditions the formation of a monolabeled derivative is accompanied by the reappearance of a spectrum of oxidized bound flavin clearly different from that of the native enzyme alkylation of the remaining cysteine residues with iodocacetamide enabled the isolation of a tryptic version of the active center disulfide peptide a single chymotryptic cleavage between the alkylated cysteine residues generated a cationic and an anionic fragment containing and of the radioactivity of the purified tryptic peptide respectively the monolabeled derivative is catalytically inactive toward reduced or Ox lipoamide but is approximately fold better as a transhydrogenase than the native protein using nadh and acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide as substrates anaerobic titration with nadh leads to reduction of the flavin with concomitant formation of long wavelength absorption of low intensity no intermediate reduced states were detected in this titration analogous to the red electron form observed with the native enzyme similarly intermediates during reduction of the enzyme by eq of dithionite have not been detected
1789,within km of a zinc zn smelter in palmerton PA near the lehigh water gap up to zn by weight has been measured in the o horizon of the soil and up to zn in the a horizon the total numbers of bacteria actinomycetes and fungi measured by dilution plate counts were greatly reduced in the most severely zncontaminated soils compared with control soils the reduction of microbial populations may be a partial cause of the decreased rate of litter decomposition at lehigh gap growth of most bacteria from control sites was reduced by to mum zn most actinomycetes by mum zn and most fungi by to mum zn in thinpablum extract agar tpab all the tested actinomycetes and nonsporeforming bacteria isolated from zncontaminated lehigh gap soils were zntolerant growing normally in media containing mum zn most fungi regardless of source were capable of at least of normal growth at mum zn zinctolerant bacteria actinomycetes and fungi were readily isolated from lowzn soils suggesting that selection for zn tolerance may proceed rapidly acidophilic mortierella species have been selectively eliminated near the smelter apparently because of elevated soil ph peryronellaea glomerata corda goidanich and coniothyrium spp were found only in the highzn soils
1790,as measured by electromagnetic blood flow transducers direct infusion of epinephrine norepinephrine and dopamine into the portal vein pv produced a decrease in HA ha blood flow isoproterenol increased ha flow by about no changes in pv flow or pressure were observed direct ha infusion of the vasoconstrictors decreased ha flow by amounts comparable to those occurring after pv infusion however ha infusion of isoproterenol increased ha flow only suggesting a difference in betareceptor population in the two vessels when infused directly into the SMA artery sma EN and norepinephrine reduced sma flow by about and pv flow by ha flow increased infusion of isoproterenol and dopamine into sma increased sma flow by and and pv flow by and respectively whereas ha flow decreased by and PVP increased less than mmhg alpha and betareceptor blockade of the liver did not change significantly the alterations in hepatic arterial blood flow that were secondary to changes in portal venous blood flow it is likely that regulation of hepatic arterial flow resides in mechanisms located within the CL sinusoids
1791,as described previously a host capsule depolymerase activity is associated with the particles of escherichia coli capsule bacteriophage this is a C1 virus with a long contractile tail terminating in a base plate with spikes in the present work isolated virions were exposed to a variety of dissociative reagents and conditions they were then tested for residual infectivity and depolymerase activity as well as inspected under an EM very mild acid treatment to min at ph and c was found to cause a TPS detachment of some phage spikes together with a moderate drop in both infectivity and depolymerase activity large batches of viruses were fragmented in this manner and the detached spikes were isolated the host capsule depolymerase activity was found to be associated with these organelles in negatively stained S9 the spikes exhibited a length of approximately nm and a thickness of about nm by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis they were found to contain polypeptides with molecular weights of and
1792,the isolation and partial characterization of the acid proteases a and a ec from aspergillus oryzae grown on solid bran culture are described the purified preparations were essentially homogeneous by several criteria including sedimentation analysis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the physiochemical properties of the proteases a and a were as follows in the order a a molecular weight sedimentation coefficient s w and s diffusion constant d w and cms partial specific volume v mlg for both nitrogen content and e cm at nm and the two enzymes had the same ph optima in the acid ph range and both activated bovine pancreatic trypsinogen the enzymes were essentially of the same amino acid composition and immunologically crossreacted with each other the protease a contained little or no carbohydrate whereas the protease a was glycoprotein containing carbohydrate comprising gl mannose and galactose these results suggest that the protein portion of acid protease a is the same as that of acid protease a
1793,naminoethylpyridyl disulphidenitrobenzooxadiazole compound i was synthesized and evaluated as a fluorescent labelling reagent for thiol CG the design of compound i as one example of a general type of reporter group delivery reagent pyridylssx where x contains an environmentally sensitive spectroscopic probe is discussed the electronic absorption spectrum of compound i was determined over a wide range of ph and the spectral changes that accompany its reaction with lowmolecularweight thiols eg lcysteine and with papain ec and bovine SS Al are discussed a new value of epsilon for thiopyridone pysh was determined as x x mcm spectral analysis of the reactions of compound i with lcysteine and with papain in the ph range showed that even under equimolar conditions the reaction thioldisulphide interchange to release pysh is essentially stoicheimoetric and probably proceeds by TPS attack at the sulphur atom distal from the pyridyl ring of compound i the fluorescenceemission spectra of compound i and of the products of its reaction with papain and with ficin ec were determined compound i is highly FL in aqueous solution excitation within the intense visible absorption band lambda max nm epsilon max x mcm provides green fluorescence with an emission maximum at nm both papain and ficin labelled by reaction with compound i are characterized by fluorescenceemission maxima nm and nm respectively of even higher intensity the fluorescence emission of the product of the reaction of papain with compound i was shown to be times more intense than that of the product of the reaction of papain with chloronitrobenzooxadiazole nbd chloride the secondorder rate constants k for the reactions of compound i and of nbd chloride with gsh papain albumin ficin benzimidazolylmethanethiol and benzimidazolylethanethiol were determined at degrees c and various ph values at ph the values of kcompound iknbd chloride are gsh Al papain x ficin x the phk profiles for the reactions of compound i and of nbd chloride with the two benzimidazolylalkanethiols were determined of the four profiles only that for the reaction of compound i with benzimidazolylmethanethiol is characterized by a striking rate maximum in acidic media
1794,uptake of hydroxytryptamine ht by AD and fetal rabbits ileum was studied the adult myenteric plexus accumulated 3H when incubated with tritiated ht however in addition to labeled ht tritiated hydroxyindole acetic acid and when monoamine oxidase mao was inhibited htoglucuronide were found in the tissue two uptake processes differing in affinity could be defined only the high affinity process was saturable fetal ileum took up tritiated ht but glucuronidation did not occur when mao was inhibited the uptake of 3H ht by the fetal ileum was due to a single saturable temperature CS q at degress c process inhibited by ouabain it was identical to the high affinity uptake found in adult tissue this specific high affinity uptake could be found as early as the th day of gestation days before uptake of norepinephrine ne begins light and electron microscope radioautography revealed that the uptake of ht was primarily into axons and a characteristic structure called the expanded process both in the myenteric plexus both contained DCVs axons were not labeled by 3H ne until T3 days and the expanded process was never labeled by tritiated ne this study shows that uptake of ht is a property of distinct system of axons in the mammalian myenteric plexus which develops prior to adrenergic axons during ontogeny
1795,the effects of isoproterenol glucose and ph on the responses of isolated rat cardiac muscle to hypoxia n co were examined while the muscles were contracting isometrically times a minute at degrees c in the presence of mm gl m isoproterenol and alkaline ph improved the performance of cardiac muscle during early hypoxia this was followed by a premature decline in developed tension and contracture appeared recovery of function following reoxygenation with o and co after a min period of hypoxia was poor acid ph resulted in an early decline of mechanical activity during hypoxia but contracture did not appear and full recovery of developed tension was seen upon reoxygenation after min of hypoxia when mm glucose was used as substrate the early responses to hypoxia were not altered but late performance was improved contracture did not appear and full REC after min of hypoxia was seen if additional glucose was added to the bath after min of hypoxia concentration mm little effect on DT was evident but contracture diminished and recovery T3 min of hypoxia was improved addition of mm glucose allowed isoproterenol to exert its inotropic effect in the absence of late deleterious changes the data support the concept that AF tending to increase the utilization of limited stores of anaerobic substrate during hypoxia facilitate deterioration by increasing exogenous gl the support of inotropic activity without late adverse effects appears possible and recovery is improved upon reoxygenation
1796,an unusual accumulation of sadenosyllmethionine in chromatium d was associated with a marked growth inhibition by lmethionine the inhibition was overcome by lisoleucine lleucine lphyenylalanine lthreonine lvaline and putrescien based on their effects these EDC are classified into types lisoleucine lleucine lphyenylalanine and lvaline type i inhibited the lmethionine uptake and consequently prevented the bacterium from the unusual accumulation of sadenosyllmethionine even in the presence of lmethionine in the medium putrescine type ii stimulated the consumption of sadenosyllmethionine but did not influence the lmethionine uptake hence the effect of putrescine would be explained by the action to diminish the intracellular level of sadenosyllmethionine lthreonine type iii neither inhibited the lmethionine uptake nor affected the content of sadenoxyllmethionine due to the addition of lmethionine the specific activity of homoserine kinase ec was greatly lowered by the addition of lmethionine under conditions in which chromatium d unusually accumulates sadenoxyllmethionine homoserine dehydrogenase ec activity was inhbitied by sadenosyllmethionine inhibition index mm these facts strongly suggest that the growth inhibition by lmethionine is associated with the lthreonine deficiency caused by the unusual accumulation of sadenosyllmethionine
1797,we examined fetal plasma corticoids and flow rate electrolyte composition and surfactant content of tracheal fluid in chronic experiments with eight fetal lambs from to days of gestation the rate of fluid production was mlkg per h and there was no NC in mean fluid sodium meq chloride meq calcium mg ml and ph tracheal fluid potassium increased from meq at days to meq at term while plasma sodium chloride calcium ph and potassium were constant at meq meq mg ml and meq respectively plasma corticoids were less than mug ml total mug ml free until days when they increased rapidly to total free at days surfactant was first detected in tracheal fluid between and days and its secretion increased rapidly after days to a value of mugkg per h at days a sudden increase in fetal plasma corticoids does not seem to be the stimulus for appearance of SF in the lamb although these hormones may induce the rapid accumulation of surfactant prior to delivery
1798,oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase was purified from sheep liver and gave one band on polyacrylamidegel PACE the enzyme was CR dependent for its activity on the presence of tris or one of a number of related amines all of general structure see article when more than one r group was hydrogen no enzyme activity was observed only one of these amines is known to exist in living tissues and large concentrations of all amines were required for maximum activity laminopropanol was the most effective amine on the basis of substrate km and vmax values and the amine km values the enzyme was activated by phosphate which lowered the km values for methylglyoxal amine and nad the ph optimum of the enzyme was and there was no activity at ph values below a search for activators that might produce activity at ph proved unsuccessful the enzyme was inhibited by rather large concentrations of barbiturates mm and nitroalcohol analogues of the activating amines mm
1799,the CAA sequence of the v variable region of the heavy h chain of rb antibody bs raised against type iii pneumococcal vaccine is reported together with the sequence data of the v region of the light l chain previously determined jaton a biochem j the present work completes the analysis of the v domain of the homogeneous antibody bs the v domains vl vh regions of this antibody are compared with those of two other antitype iii pneumococcal antibodies bs and k jaton biochem j except for the second hypervariable section of the l chains these antibodies have very different sequences in the hypervariable segments of the v domains within the third hypervariable region of the h chain each antibody has a different length bs is three amino acids shorter than k and two amino acids shorter than bs when the sequences in that section are aligned for maximal homology only two residues glycine and leucine are common to the three antibodies on the basis of the amino acid sequences of these three antipneumococcal antibodies the results do not support the concept of a simple correlation between primary structure in the hypervariable sections known to determine the shape of the combining site and antigenbinding specificity
1800,histamine was infused intraarterially mugmin into isolated blood perfused canine kidneys while PET and hemodynamic parameters were monitored when perfusion pressure pp was kept constant during the infusion of histamine RBF rbf increased from to mlmin p less than a greater increase in rbf occurred to the inner renal cortex than the outer renal SC as measured by radioactive microspheres the fractional outerinner cortical blood flow changed from before histamine to during its infusion p less than histamine did not alter creatinine clearance ccr urine volume v sodium excretion unav or the fractional excretion of sodium fena or water feh under these conditions when renal blood flow was held constant during the infusion of histamine pp decreased from to mm hg p less than this resulted in a reduction of absolute outer cortical outerinner changed from before histamine to during its infusion p less than in contrast to the effects of histamine at constant pp ccr v unav fena and feh were decreased when histamine infusion reduced the pp administration of the h receptor antagonist diphenhydramine blocked the hemodynamic effects of histamine whereas the administration of an h receptor antagonist metiamide did not alter the histamine response similar vasodilatory responses to histamine were observed in isolated blood perfused dog and cat kidneys in contrast vasoconstrictor responses to histamine occurred in isolated dog and cat kidneys perfused with krebs solution and in isolated rabbit kidneys whether perfused with blood or krebs solution
1801,stripped duodenal mucosa of rabbits was mounted in ussing chambers containing a ringer solution gassed with o the disappearance of acid or alkali from the mucosal solution of shortcircuited tissue was measured with a ph stat while the serosal ph was kept at the duodenum rapidly disposed of both acid and alkali neither property was altered by gassing with n while IAA was in the perfusing solutions prevention of PR of co from the mucosal chamber obliterated the early rapid phase of acid disposal by the mucosa while a similar maneuver in the serosal chamber increased the appearance of serosal acid without altering the rate of acid disposal gut sacs of rabbit duodenum in vitro and in vivo showed a positive correlation between acid disposal and the rate of luminal co production while acid disposal progressively decreased with time for the in vitro gut sacs the in vivo gut sac showed no fatigue in this respect luminal acidification in the ussing chamber was associated with a profound reduction in shortcircuit current isc partially reversible by elevation of the mucosal ph but not by luminal glucose our data suggest that acid disposal occurs in part by intraluminal neutralization and in part by diffusion into the mucosa
1802,the hydrolysis of pnitrophenyl phosphate by wheat germ acid phosphatase orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase ec has been investigated in mixtures of AQ buffers with AC dioxane and acetonitrile the enzyme was either in free solution or immobilized on a pellicular support which consisted of a porous carbonaceous layer on solid glass beads the highest enzyme activity was obtained in AC and acetonitrile mixed with citrate buffer over a wide range of organic solvent concentration in vv acetone both v and km of the immobilized enzyme were about half of the values in the neat AQ buffer but the ki for inorganic phosphate was unchanged in vv mixtures of various solvents and citrate buffers of different ph the enzymic activity was found to depend on the ph of the AQ buffer component rather than the ph of the hydroorganic mixture as measured with the glasscalomel electrode the relatively high rates of pnitrophenol liberation in the presence of glucose even at high organic solvent concentrations suggest that transphosphorylation is facilitated at low water activity
1803,antihistamines are a diverse group of drugs which possess the ability to inhibit various histaminic actions by and large they bear a certain structural resemblance to histamine and act principally to prevent histaminereceptor interaction through competition with histamine for histamine receptors consequently they are helpful therapeutically in preventing rather than reversing histaminic actions individual antihistaminic drugs act to inhibit histaminic action at one or another histamine receptor h or hreceptor but not at both receptors the C1 number of antihistaminics which have been available for many years and employed chiefly as antiallergic drugs are classified as hreceptor inhibitors they are most effective therapeutically in inhibiting manifestations of histamineinduced wheal and erythema formation and pruritus hreceptor inhibitors agents which are able to inhibit histamineinduced GAS have been developed more recently antihistaminics in GA and hreceptor inhibitors in particular exert a wide variety of pharmacological activities their use is frequently accompanied by undesirable sideeffects notably cns depression dryness of mucous membranes and gastrointestinal effects used judiciously and in proper dosage antihistaminic drugs are helpful in the control of allergic disorders AR and urticaria in particular newly developed hreceptor inhibitors show therapeutic promise in the treatment of peptic ulceration
1804,cytochrome c has been chemically modified by methylene blue mediated photooxidation it is established that the Met residues of the protein have been specifically converted to methionine sulfoxide residues no oxidation of any other amino acid residues or the cysteine thioether bridges of the molecule occurs during the photooxidation reaction the absorbance spectrum of methionine sulfoxide ferricytochrome c at neutrality is similar to that of the unmodified protein except for an increase in the extinction coefficient of the soret absorbance band and for the CR loss of the ligand sensitive nm absorbance band in the spectrum of the derivative the protein remains in the low spin configuration which implies the PR of two strong field ligands spin state sensitive spectral titrations and MM studies of heme MMP indicate that the sixth ligand is definitely not provided by a lysine residue but may be methionine sulfoxide coordinated via its sulfur atom circular dichroism spectra indicate that the heme crevice of methionine sulfoxide ferri and ferrocytochrome c is weakened relative to native cytochrome c the redox potential of Met sulfoxide cytochrome c is mv which is markedly diminished from the mv redox potential of native cytochrome c the modified protein is equivalent to native cytochrome c as a ATP for cytochrome oxidase and is not autoxidizable at neutral ph but is virtually inactive with succinatecytochrome c reductase these results indicate that the major role of the methionine in cytochrome c is to preserve a closed hydrophobic heme crevice which is essential for the maintainance of the necessary redox potential
1805,the ph and carbon dioxide tension were measured in consecutive parapneumonic effusions along with the leukocyte count leukocytic differential count and C2 of glucose and protein three categories of parapneumonic effusions were characterized empyemas benign nonloculated effusions and loculated effusions a ph greater than was present in all ten benign effusions and spontaneous resolution occurred in each case all ten empyemas and the four loculated effusions had a ph less than all four loculated effusions required drainage with a chest tube for resolution the ph of the PF alone separated the empyemas and loculated effusions from benign effusions the early separation of parapneumonic effusions on the basis of the PF appears useful if the ph is greater than a benign effusion is present and spontaneous resolution is likely if the ph is less than loculation of the pleural space may occur regardless of whether the effusion fulfills the criteria for empyema
1806,preparations of purified pig kidney aminoacylase nacylaminoacid amidohydrolase ec were obtained by sephadex and deaecellulose chromatography in homogeneous form as judged by PAGE and immunoelectrophoresis the apparent molecular weight of the enzyme determined by gel filtration was about after treatment with mercaptoethanol performic acid or SDS a band with an apparent molecular weight of approximately was observed in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulphate thus pig kidney aminoacylase seems to be composed of two subunits the CAA composition of the enzyme was determined aminoacylase contains amino acids which corresponds to a molecular weight of tryptophan and halfcystine residues were found each subunit of the enzyme contains two sh groups of different CR and two disulfide bonds one of which is easily cleaved by sh compounds the second only by performic acid oxidation chemical modification of two sh groups abolishes the catalytic activity of aminoacylase cleavage of two disulfide bonds also inactivates the enzyme it is suggested that the enzyme has two AS CS each containing an essential sh group and disulfide bond one active site is assumed to be part of each subunit
1807,the recent literature on pain states shows pain thresholds are relatively constant for an individual but pain tolerance is influenced by psychological state the expression of pain is a CF partly of ethnic membership and degree of extroversion pain complaints are determined as well by cultural and extroversive factors and also degree of neuroticism studies of pain patients reveals that those with acute pain tend to show normal personality profiles but the degree of pain experienced is related to the degree of anxiety present most CPPs like those with psychogenic pain show somatic preoccupations and reactive depression the treatment andor rehabilitation of pain patients has developed in three Az in cases of peripheral neuropathy and some spinal cord lesions electrical stimulation with neural pacemakers can often close the gate to pain signals and provide significant reduction or abolition of pain psychotropic medications particularly the TCAs sometimes in combination with phenothiazines and antihistamines are effective in many instances of central pain and help increase the pain tolerance and decrease the need for narcotics in other pain states operant conditioning including the use of biofeedback extinguishes pain SMB and increases painincompatible behaviors with good LT results
1808,desmosine and isodesmosine were separated by ionexchange and paper chromatography after acid hydrolysis of purified elastin from beef ligamentum nuchae the fractions obtained by ionexchange chromatography were clearly mixtures of related compounds the desmosine fraction could be resolved into seven compounds and the isodesmosine into four by paper chromatography desmosine was maximally degraded by irradiation at nm and isodesmosine at nm these wavelengths did not correspond to the absorption maxima of the cross links but to shoulders of the main absorption peaks when irradiated at their optimum wavelengths but at various ph both desmosine and isodesmosine seemed quite stable at ph greater than between ph and the photolytic rate was maximum and decreased slightly at more acidic ph below ph one of the products of photolysis was free lysine in analogy to the mechanism of the photolytic Kd of nmethyl pyridinium chloride it appears that the isodesmosines were degraded via the formation of an open amino aldehyde which was hydrolysed at acid ph to give free lysine and a substituted glutaconic aldehyde
1809,for the transport of injured and sick patients the helicopter even the monoturbine type offers greater advantages when compared to land vehicles more comfort less vibrations accelerations and decelerations a greater speed that is to say a p gain of time upon the distance and a gain from up to p upon the total amount of time taken up by each transport this gain in time enables valuable specialised medical teams to be more available more precise timetables than by land which namely makes it easier to receive the patients the drawbacks are linked with the risks which are not nonexistent but rather less serious than by land the drawbacks also depend upon the weatherconditions although this factor does not matter much in our area upon nuisances such as the noise which is more important but far more transitory than by ambulance and chiefly upon the cost of airtransport in fact the mean cost of a medical land transport amounts roughly to one thousand francs a quarter of which only does represent the actual cost of medical aid for a similar transport the helicopter comes to a mns flight there are several ways of making good use of a helicopter practical problems have been solved the samu experience goes back to and includes over transports by helicopter essentially with the help of the teams and the helicopters belonging to the paris base civil protection and the firebrigade for flights over urban Az it is to be desired in the future that only twinturbine helicopters should be used
1810,the etioplasts of darkgrown bean leaves showed atpase adenosine triphosphatase activity which had a ph optimum of was stimulated by dithiothreitol and unaffected by lighttriggering bean chloroplasts showed a low activity of darkinduced atpase with a ph optimum of and a substantial amount of lighttriggered activity with a ph optimum of the lighttriggered activity depended on dithiothreitol and mg and was promoted by phenazine methosulphate lighttriggered atpase activity was completely inhibited by mumdicyclohexylcarbodiimide etioplasts developed lighttriggered atpase activity in response to min illumination of the etiolated leaves during the h of lightinduced greening of darkgrown leaves there was a increase of the cp atpase activity found T3 lighttriggering and a fall in the darkinduced activity both expressed on a per leaf basis as the larger part of these changes occurred during the first min of illumination it is concluded that most or all of the chloroplast atpase was present in the etioplast a conclusion identical with that of lockshin et al for maize during h of greening there was a tenfold increase in the amount of thylakoid membrane in the leaf together with an fall in the atpase activity per m of thylakoid membrane measured after lighttriggering
1811,we compared the effects of continuous positivepressure ventilation cppv using cmho positive endexpiratory pressure peep with intermittent positivepressure ventilation ippv on pulmonary extravascular water volume pewv and lung CF in dogs with pulmonary edema caused by elevated left atrial pressure and decreased colloid osmotic pressure the pewv was measured by gravimetric and doubleisotope indicator dilution methods animals with high mmhg moderately elevated mmhg and normal mmhg left atrial pressures pla were studied the pewv by both methods was significantly increased in the high and moderate pla groups the former greater than the latter p less than there was no difference in the pewv between animals receiving cppv and those receiving ippv in both the high and moderately elevated pla CG however in animals with high pla the pao was significantly better maintained and the inflation pressure required to deliver a tidal volume of mlkg was significantly less with the use of cppv than with ippv we conclude that in pulmonary edema associated with high pla peep does not reduce pewv but does improve pulmonary function
1812,an attempt was made to characterize the hemolymph of biomphalaria glabrata with reference to normal intraspecific variation ie both inter and intrastrain differences total protein concentration per cent hemoglobin ph and osmolarity were studied seven geographic strains of b glabrata were examined in addition observations were made on the hemolymph of biomphalaria straminea several strains of helisoma caribaeum and on b glabrata subjected to infection with schistosoma mansoni or to periods of starvation intrastrain differences in total protein concentration and total hemoglobin concentration in b glabrata appeared to be more closely related with snail size than with absolute age interstrain R2 in b glabrata was also noted but the differences were of the same magnitude as those from intrastrain samples significant differences in total protein concentration were observed however between the means of similar size b glabrata b straminea and h caribaeum the osmolatity of the hemolymph from different size b glabrata was similar as were the osmolalities of the hemolymph from similar size snails of different strains however all b glabrata strains exhibited hemolymph osmolalities lower than observed in strains of h caribaeum infection with s mansoni reduced the protein concentration of b glabrata hemolymph differences were noted as early as hr postinfection with significant alterations occurring at about days postinfection to a lesser extent starvation also depleted the protein content of the hemolymph
1813,the effects of crude extracts of bovine rat and human pineal PG on prolactin prl PR were studied using an in vitro system in addition the effects of a known pineal constituent arginine vasotocin avt and crude bovine pineal extract bpe on prl secretion were studied in vivo normal male rat hemipituitaries hp incubated with bpe mg tissuehpreleased and more prl into the medium than did their corresponding untreated control halves incubated in either medium CT HE or cerebral cortical extract respectively hp incubated with either rat mg of tissuehp or human mg of tissuehp pineal extract released and more prl respectively than did their corresponding untreated control halves hp exposed to mg tissue eq of either bovine pineal fraction a or bovine pineal fraction a released and respectively less prl than did their corresponding untreated control halves incubated in krebsringer bicarbonate krb medium quantitites of melatonin thyrotropinreleasing hormone trh or estrogen comparable to those found in the pineal had no significant effect on prl secretion in vitro the iv injection of either bpe mg tissuerat or avt mugrat into estrogen and progesteronetreated male rats resulted in a and increase respectively in plasma prl titers min T3 injection over preinjection control levels the per cent of increase in plasma prl levels in these animals was significantly greater than that observed in control rats receiving either saline or cortical extract the results suggest that crude extracts of pineal PG of three different species contain PRF prf activity which is probably not due to any endogenous melatonin trh or estrogen that may be present conversely two bovine pineal fractions a and a appeared to exhibit prolactininhibiting factor pif activity we have concluded that the pineal gland may serve as an alternate or supplemental source of prf andor pif
1814,twentyeight patients were anesthetized with etoxadrol as primary agent the anesthesia produced was characterized by profound analgesia and amnesia while pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes as well as swallowing and lid reflexes remained active systolic diastolic and PP pressure were slightly increased with associated tachycardia and tachypnea a dose of mgkg produced anesthesia for an average of to minutes alternating nystagmus was present for several hours and associated with dreams andor visions that were pleasing to most patients six patients however had unpleasant dreams for up to hours one patient given an excessive dose mgkg was cataleptic amnesic and analgesic for days the occurrence of unpleasant dreams and aberrations in over of the patients suggests that the drug probably has little usefulness in anesthesia however the extreme safety of the drug an ld equal to some to times the ed and the prolonged analgesia justified clinical testing there was no evidence of metabolic or systemic organ system NC from any of the clinical laboratory studies
1815,CM from thyrotoxic animals myosint exhibits elevated ca atpase activity which is resistant to further stimulation by sulfhydryl modification in the present study we have compared the enzymatic properties of myosint with those of myosin from euthyroid rabbits myosinn and the derivatives of myosint and myosinn formed by blocking the most rapidly reacting class of thiols sh with nethylmaleimide nem vmax for ca atpase of myosint was about greater than myosinn and was nearly the same as nemmodified myosinn values for the apparent km of myosint and nemmodified myosinn were greater than the value for unmodified myosinn vmax and km for k edtaatpase activity of nemmodified myosint and myosinn were identical the ca saturation ph and saltdependency curves for the atpase activity of myosint were parallel to the curves for myosinn and differed from those for the nemmodified myosins myosint exhibited an increased rate of hydrolysis of atp ctp and utp in both low m and high m kcl medium nemmodified myosinn showed increased hydrolysis of atp and ctp in low kcl medium and increased hydrolysis of atp ctp and utp in high kcl medium these results support the hypothesis that the enzymatic behavior of myosint may be caused by an alteration in the active site near the sh thiols the unique enzymatic properties of myosint did not seem to be the result of a L1 change in structure the electrophoretic DP of light chains from myosint and myosinn was the same in polyacrylamide gels containing either m urea at ph or sodium dodecyl sulfate also myosint had a normal amino acid composition and lacked methylhistidine and hot acidstable phosphate
1816,watersoluble substances have been extracted from two strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis var hominis the native hydrosoluble part polysaccharide and peptidoglycan a substance in which the polysaccharide moiety is less abundant than in the latter the acetylated PGN and finally a tetrasaccharideheptapeptide all four types of substances when they were injected together with freunds incomplete adjuvant exerted an adjuvant effect on the production of delayedtype hypersensitivity to ovalbumin in the guinea pig and on the production of antiinfluenza virus antibodies in the rabbit injected intravenously in the mouse they increased the number of antibodyproducing cells in the spleen and enhanced the VG versus host reaction no effect was seen on the phagocytic activity of the reticuloendothelial system by contrast with wax d the watersoluble substances were devoid of arthritisinducing activity in the rat altogether these watersoluble substances seem to be endowed with at least some of the adjuvant activities of freunds complete adjuvant and some of the immunostimulant activities of a live mycobacterium like bcg
1817,the quarternary ammonium compound um dimethyl isopropylaminophenylphenoxypropanol chloride was evaluated for its antiarrhythmic and hemodynamic effects um converted ouabaininduced ventricular ART in the anesthetized dog when administered in an average dose of mgkg iv pretreatment of anesthetized dogs with um mgkg provided complete protection against the development of premature beats and ventricular fibrillation when the LAD i.a. was occluded for minutes and then released um was effective in reversing ventricular arrhythmias in conscious animals which had been subjected to a twostage ligation of the anterior descending PD the mean ectopic rate in a group of five dogs was sem beatsmin hours after coronary ligation normal sinus rhythm was restored with a mean dose of mgkg of um and was maintained for a period in excess of minutes the ventricular fibrillation threshold was increased from a control value of to ma p less than minutes after pretreatment with um mgkg inotropic and chronotropic doseresponse studies to isoproterenol in the anesthetized dog demonstrated that the quarternary compound lacked beta adrenergic receptor blocking properties um mgkg did not produce any persistent changes in spontaneous HR rate cardiac contractile force left VVI dpct mean arterial blood pressure cardiac SO and mean pulmonary arterial pressure
1818,the IB of mg to the wall teichoic acid of lactobacillus buchneri ncib was measured by equilibrium dialysis at controlled ionic concentration and ph in an aqueous solution containing mmnacl at ph one mg ion was bound for every two phosphate groups of the teichoic acid with an apparent association constant kassoc x m on lowering the ph below the pka of the phosphate groups the amount of bound mg decreased concomitantly with decreasing ionization of the phosphate groups both the amount of mg bound to the teichoic acid and the apparent association constants were similar in the presence of mm concentrations of nacl or kcl but decreased markedly in the presence of mmcacl because of competition between ca and mg for the IB sites a similar effect was found when the concentration of nacl was increased from to mm the results are discussed in relation to the function of teichoic acid in the walls of grampositive bacteria
1819,hepatic microsomes from rats fed a crude or a purified diet were compared by measureing their contents of protein cytochrome p and cytochrome b their rates of activity of nadph and nadhcytochrome c reductases or nadph oxidase LPO ethylmorphine ndemethylase aniline hydroxylase benzpyrene hydroxylase and their substratebinding spectra ethylmorphine HB aniline and ethyl isoyanide with the exception of lipid peroxidase activity which was much higher in microsomes from animals fed the crude diet little or no consistent dietrelated differences in these measurements were observed over a week experimental period nor were results significantly less variable with one or the other diet no consistent significant differences were observed with two strains of rats the lower LPO activity seen with the purified diet appeared to be due to the high vitamin e intake when that diet was employed rats fed the crude diet and an oral supplement of alphatocopherol yielded microsomes with low LPO MICs similar to those seen in microsomes from rats fed the purified diet a gradual temporal increase in benzpyrene hydroxylase activity was observed with both diets this was interpreted to be due to environment inducing agents other than those present in the diet
1820,a syndrome similar to gvhr is described in mice of cb strain during the whtht skin allografts rejection period in all the cases the described thymus involution was associated with the hypertrophy of lymph nodes their volume increase is due to the high number of blastic pyroninophilic and plasma cells concomitant with small lymphocytes depletion in the cortical area and with a very pronounced hypertrophy of medullary cords by presence of a high number of plasmocytes and blastic cells these changes have been noticed only in some animals sacrified during the first days T3 grafting and never later one in agreement with the scarce data of the literature we think that the immunocompetent passenger lymphocyte comprised in the skin grafts constitute an immunologic organ able to induce a gvhr at the beginning of the period of graft survival on the host this gvhr generally mild and without clinical and microscopic signs becomes obvious only in animals which for unknown reasons present a low immunologic defense capacity in these animals the described process seems to be reversible
1821,the initial enzymic step in mercapturic acid formation is catalyzed by glutathione stransferase several species of this enzyme designated as transferases alpha beta gamma delta and epsilon on the basis of increasing isoelectric points were isolated from human CL evidence is presented that each of the purified species is homogeneous with respect to sodium dodecylsulfategel electrophoresis transferases alpha beta and epsilon each appear as a single band on gel electrofocusing transferases gamma and delta are present as two and three bands respectively with each band catalytically AS amino acid analysis indicated the five transferases to be either very closely related or MZ in this respect all enzyme species have a molecular weight of about and consist of two apparently identical subunits the spectrum of substrates is the same for each although the enzymes differ slightly in specific activity as is the case for the rat CL enzymes each of the human transferases binds bilirubin although this compound is not a substrate
1822,two isoenzymes of an nadp dependent cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase and an nad dependent aliphatic alcohol dehydrogenase were extracted from cell suspension cultures of soybean glycine max l var mandarin which form lignin during growth these enzymes could be separated from each other by chromatography on deaecellulose and hydroxyapatite the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzymes were partially purified by nhso fractionation and column chromatography on deaecellulose sephadex g and hydroxyapatite the molecular weight of the enzymes were estimated by the elution volumes from a sephadex g column and were found to be about isoenzyme and isoenzyme maximum rates of reaction were observed in the case of coniferyl alcohol oxidation at ph isoenzyme and ph isoenzyme in the reverse reaction ph was optimal for isoenzyme whereas isoenzyme is specific for coniferyl alcohol isoenzyme can also oxidize cinnamyl alcohol and a number of substituted cinnamyl alcohols km values for substituted cinnamaldehydes are times lower than for the corresponding alcohols neither isoenzyme reacted with BA anisic alcohol or ethanol ATP inhibition for the forward and reverse reaction was found with isoenzyme but not with isoenzyme the equilibrium constant was determined to be about in favour of coniferaldehyde reduction the possible role of the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase in lignin biosynthesis is discussed
1823,the accumulation of amethopterin in a pediococcus cerevisiae CS resistant to this analogue was about of that in p cerevisiaepteglu the sensitive parent the uptake in the resistant CS was strictly gl dependent whereas in the sensitive parent about accumulation occurred in absence of glucose the transport in both strains was inhibited by iodoacetate and kf amethopterin uptake exhibited saturation kinetics with an apparent km of mum in p cerevisiaeamr and mum in p cerevisiaepteglu the apparent v was nmol per min per mg cells dry weight the same for both strains the optimum ph for the uptake of amethopterin by p cerevisiaeamr and p cerevisiaepteglu was ph folate and methyltetrahydrofolate competitivity inhibited amethopterin uptake with apparent ki values of and mum respectively the uptake of folate exhibited a slightly increased km value as compared to that of the sensitive strain whereas the uptake activity velocity was in the same range methyltetrahydrofolate accumulated up to about fold higher intracellular concentration than that of the medium which is a markedly lower accumulation from that in the sensitive CS the uptake was glucose dependent and inhibited by IAA and kf the ph optimum for methyltetrahydrofolate uptake in the resistant strain was the same as that in the sensitive parent ph in contrast to the increase in the apparent km value for amethopterin in the resistant strain the affinity of the carrier for methyltetrahydrofolate was apparently unchanged whereas the v value was about times lower than that in the sensitive strain the ki for amethopterin when added to increasing concentrations of methyltetrahydrofolate was mum a value about the same as that of the km
1824,an enzyme is designed to bind most tightly to a ATP when it is in the transition state of the reaction which the enzyme catalyses the consequent reduction of the activation energy of the reaction constitutes the catalytic mechanism the energetic contributions of different features of the interaction can only be crudely assessed but they are dominated by entropically driven effects the binding site of trypsin orients the substrate so that the reacting groups are correctly placed for reaction to occur apart from two side chains which take part in chemical steps of the reaction the enzyme behaves almost as a rigid body the full binding interactions are only developed when the substrate is in an intermediate stage of the reaction the tightly bound complexes of trypsin with protein trypsin inhibitors have proved amenable to structural analysis enzyme inhibitor interactions which account for almost kj mol of interaction SE are known fairly accurately the similarity of the two known TR inhibitor structures close to the primary binding site indicates a high specificity even for this simple interaction in cases where no C1 conformational changes occur the specificity of an enzyme should be predictable from accurate knowledge of its tertiary structure
1825,previous investigators have reported finding a high molecular weight hmw renin in various species which is activated by acidification two laboratories have reported that a decrease in molecular weight of the renin accompanies the acidification step this report describes the partial purification of an hmw renin from hog kidney extracts which had previously been acidified to ph the hmw renin with a molecular weight of constitutes only a small relatively constant fraction of the total renin isolated omission of the acidification step or initial acidification to ph does not NC the amount of hmw renin significantly the hmw renin attacks the protein ATP to produce angiotensin at about onefourth the rate expected based upon the rate at which it cleaves the tetradecapeptide substrate or a model nonapeptide substrate it is inactivated by antiserum to hog kidney renin prepared in dogs it is less stable than hog renin when stored at degrees c the hmw renin has a ph optimum between and it is not activated by acidification to ph nor by tryptic or peptic digestion we have been unable to activate hmw renin or to NC its molecular weight by procedures reported by other investigators and therefore conclude that the hmw renin differs from material previously reported and may be an isoenzyme of renin
1826,angiotensin iconverting enzyme ec was rapidly and highly purified from a particulate fraction of hog kidney cortex with yield the procedure which was rapid included fractionation on deaecellulose and calcium phosphate gel chromatographies on deaesephadex a and hydroxylapatite columns and GF on a sephadex g column the purified enzyme preparation gave two protein bands on standard disc gel electrophoresis but showed a single protein component on the gel after treatment with neuraminidase ec the data strongly suggest that the purified enzyme preparation was a mixture of sialo and asialoenzyme sialic acid residues apparently do not contribute to the catalytic activity of the enzyme the enzyme was activated more by chloride ions than by other halide ions tested using bzglyglygly as a ATP the dissociation constant for chloride ions was determined to be mm chloride did not protect the enzyme against heat or low ph the enzyme was resistant to inactivation by trypsin ec and chymotrypsin ec
1827,the electric properties of the bilayer lecithin CM have been studied in the presence of the antibiotic nigericin when the antibiotic concentration is about ohm cm the potassium ion concentration gradient gives rise to a transmembrane potential of the order of mv per fold concentration gradient with the side of the higher potassium concentration negative the transmembrane potential produced by the hydrogen ion concentration gradient is a CF of the potassium ion concentration which is equal on both sides of the membrane for low potassium ion concentrations the hydrogen potential has the expected polarity with the solution having higher concentration of protons negative for potassium ion concentrations exceeding m the hydrogen potential has the reverse polarity this unexpected result cannot be accounted for in terms of the available simple hypotheses about the charge transport mechanism for nigericin in blm in order to account for the experimental results obtained a theoretical approach has been developed based on the assumption that charge is transported across the membrane by nigericin dimers the theoretical predicitons are in satisfactory PA with the exp results the model also yields some predictions which may be verified in future experiments
1828,the hepta hexa and pentacarboxylic porphyrins found in the faeces of rats poisoned with hexachlorobenzene have been separated by highpressure liquid chromatography and characterized largely by spectroscopie methods their structures were confirmed by total synthesis as part of a programme in which eleven of the fourteen hepta hexa and pentacarboxylic porphyrins derived from uroporphyrin iii have now been synthesized as their methyl esters the four isomeric heptacarboxylic and three of the pentacarboxylic porphyrinogens have been incubated with haemolysates of chicken erythrocytes and they are all converted into PP ix but at different rates on the basis of this and other evidence we conclude that the decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen iii to coproporphyrinogen iii is a stepwise process taking place by a preferred pathway both in normal and abnormal metabolism the acetic acid groups are decarboxylated in a sequential CW fashion starting with that on the d ring and followed by those on the a b and c rings in the poisoned rats the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme or group of enzymes is probably partially inhibited and the pentacarboxylic porphyrinogen with an acetic acid group on ring c accumulates the latter is then transformed by a side pathway into dehydroisocoproporphyrinogen and thence into dehydroisocoproporphyrin and its congeners
1829,a previously described mendelian mutant of chlamydomonas reinhardi ac i exhibiting altered ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase activity and unable to grow on minimal medium is examined for changes in ribulosebisphosphate oxygenase activity the ribulosebisphosphate oxygenase activity of the enzyme purified from both wild type and ac i is compared over a ph range from to both enzymes exhibit maximum activity at ph however the ac i enzyme is twice as AS as the wild type enzyme at a physiological ph of the studies in vivo of the products of co fixation of ac i and wild type cells in the presence of high and low o concentration shows that due to a lower level of carboxylation the ac i cells fix co at half the rate of wild type cells in ac i of the photosynthetically fixed c is channelled into the watersoluble fraction as opposed to in wild type thinlayer chromatography of the watersoluble fraction showed extensive accumulation of components of the glycolate pathway in ac i as compared to wild type this indicates that the oxygenase activity of the enzyme prevails in ac i in vivo since a high concentration of glycolate is toxic to cells of c reinhardi the high oxygenase activity of ac i provides an explanation for the inability of ac i to grow phototrophically even though its rate of co fixation is half that of wild type this toxicity to glycolate is overcome by growth under amber illumination or low o concentration
1830,it has been previously demonstrated that iontophoresis of beta adrenergic agents will alter the size of immediate hypersensitivity skin tests it was unclear whether this alteration was due to an effect on the dermal mast cell inhibition of histamine release or on the cutaneous vasculature inhibition of capillary permeability for this reason isoproterenol propranolol diphenhydramine as a positive control and saline as a negative control were iontophoresed onto the forearm of atopic and nonatopic adult subjects in order to bypass HR from mast cells the patients were then challenged directly with histamine by the prick technique the size of the resultant wheals was noted the data obtained allowed the following conclusions the atopic group responded to histamine with greater wheal size than the nonatopic group iontophoresis of diphyenhydramine effectively reduced the magnitude of the histamine wheal in both groups isoproterenol decreased the wheal size in both groups propranolol increased the wheal size in only the nonatopic group the successful modulation of the histamineinduced wheal and flare indicated that these drugs regardless of their effect on the dermal mast cell exert a measurable effect on the target organ vasculature
1831,in strong illumination dichlorophenyldimethylurea dcmupoisoned chloroplasts exhibit a high yield of chlorophyll fluorescence while p turnover proton uptake and phosphorylation are inhibited and a ph gradient is undectectable when mum nmethylphenazonium methosulfate pms is included the fluorescence yield in CS is substantially reduced and when mum ascorbate is also included the yield is diminished approximately to the level in darkness only very slight increases in p turnover and proton uptake but no detectable ph gradient accompany the fluorescence yield decline when mum pms and mm ascorbate are added to poisoned chloroplasts the oxygen concentration being greatly reduced p turnover proton uptake the ph gradient and phosphorylation all reach high levels in this case the yield of chlorophyll fluorescence is low and is the same in both light and dark further addition of an uncoupler eliminates proton uptake the ph gradient and phosphorylation but does not significantly elevate the fluorescence yield from these observations we suggest that in dcmupoisoned chloroplasts the fluorescence quenching with pms occurrs by a mechanism unrelated to the generation of a phosphyorylation potential with chloroplasts unpoisoned by dcmu pms quenches fluorescence and considerably stimulates proton uptake the ph gradient and phosphorylation however in this case pms serves to restore net electron transport
1832,the wide mosaic of congruent clinical and experimental observations led to the postulation that the cause of the pharmacological abnormality of the asthmatic patient ie the immensely increased reactivity of the bronchial smooth muscles is to be sought in an insufficiency of the betaadrenergic receptor system it is to be assumed that the socalled asthma diatheses is based inter alia on a genetically determined defect of the cya system the role of previous infections of the respiratory tract in asthmagenesis should liefollowing this working theorynot in a sensitization in the sense of an allergic reaction of the immediate type but in the formation of a defective betaadrenergic substance or in a blockade of the betareceptor a genetically determined innate defect of the betaadrenergic receptors or a defect acquired through infections of the respiratory tract is hence likely to be the cause of the pathologically potentiated CR of the bronchia it is likely that the infective stimuliquite apart from this preparatory roleare later capable of triggering asthmatic paroxysms when the vegetative homeostasis is impaired we know from the experiments of many authors that a blockade of the betareceptors produced by chemical blocker substances or by pertussis vaccine or various bacterial substances results in a significant increase in bronchial CR towards histamine serotonin acetylcholine and other stimuli we have shown in our experiments that heatinactivated adeno viruses and influenza viruses also increase the AS reactivity and the histamine reactivity of the organism on the basis of this working hypothesis the pathomechanism of the asthmatic process is as follows in individual asthma forms in the purely allergic asthma form the antigenantibody reaction that occurs T3 sensitization ie formation of skinsensitizing allergic antibodies of the class ige results in reformation and PR of slowreactingsubstances
1833,fold purified protease preparation is isolated from cultural medium of torula thermophila uzpt by means of AS precipitation and gel chromatography through sephadex g disc polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two portease components one of them possessing proteolytic activity ph interval for protease activity was found to be the Vmax was observed at ph the highest enzyme resistanceat ph the enzyme almost completely preserved its activity for hour in DW at degrees c the temperature maximum of the enzyme activity was degrees at ph the enzyme may be referred to proteases of serine nature because it is completely inactivated with diisopropylphosphofluoridate but it retains the activity in the presence of chelating agents edta ophenantroline ditizone and inhibitors of shgroups sodium pchloromercuriumbenzoate iodoacetic acid the enzyme was not inactivated with phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride and the trypsin inhibitor from soybean the protease studied most efficiently hydrolyzed caseine and hemoglobin in a less degreehuman serum albumin and fibrinogen and almost did not attack egg albumin the enzyme undergoes associationdissociation under ph change during gel filtration through sephadex
1834,resistant hypertension can be defined in terms of lack of blood pressure response to hypotensive agents but there may be a big difference between standing and lying blood pressure C2 in general lung damage and papilloedema improve if the standing blood pressure is controlled however progression can occasionally be documented when only the supine blood pressure remains uncontrolled resistant hypertension was a frequent phenomenon when ganglion blocking agents and hydrallazine were the only effective hypotensive agents with the advent of the thiazides ERP control of the blood pressure became the exception rather than the rule however it was not until the advent of adrenergic blocking agents that reduction of supine blood pressures was regularly achieved the addition of hydrallazine or prazosin to a combination of a thiazide and betaadrenoreceptor blocking agent produces a further significant fall in the blood pressure lying and standing this combination will control the blood pressure in most patients but a few remain refractory to maximum doses and will require treatment with oral diazoxide or minoxidil both these powerful vasodilators are very effective in resistant hypertension oral diazoxide permits excellent control and allows a fold reduction in the doses of other agents minoxidil usually needs to be combined with moderate doses of betablocking agents to reduce the marked reflex tachycardia only a reduction in other hypotensive agents was achieved in patients treated with minoxidil and two patients proved resistant to minoxidil but subsequently responded to oral DZ
1835,the betaadrenergic blocking agent timolol appears to be bound to stereospecific as well as nonspecific sites in the particulate fraction g pellet of the heart lungs and BB whereas the disomer of timolol was bound to nonspecific sites only timolol disappeared from the particulate fraction at a slower rate than did its optical isomer at hr after a mgkg dose the concentration of the lform in the lung was times that of the disomer and at and hr the difference was at least fold the concentration of ctimolol in the particulate fraction of rat tissues was inhibited by iv administered timolol and by the lisomer of propanolol but not by their corresponding dforms competition for IB sites was dose dependent pretreatment with timolol at and mgkg reduced the IB of ctimolol dose mgkg to lung tissue by and respectively in the heart and lung tissue of rats racemic timolol propranolol bunolol and bunitrolol were approximately equally effective in competing for the binding CS of ctimolol practolol and sotalol and the beta selective agent butoxamine did not significantly inhibit the binding of ctimolol similar competition was also observed in the whole brain of rats this report suggests that the stereospecific binding of timolol may be related to the betaadrenoreceptor process
1836,cytochrome p from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria exists in three forms of molecular weight protein of onehalf protein and of onequarter of this value protein the forms of the enzyme are named according to the number of subunits and all appear to be AS in converting cholesterol to betahydroxypregnenone side chain cleavage shikita m and hall pf j biol chem to determine whether all three forms are AS at their characteristic molecular weights the three cytochromes were each layered onto separate sucrose density gradients and centrifuged at rpm for min the gradients contained all the AF necessary for side chain cleavage including one of the following substrates cholesterol shydroxycholesterol and srdihydroxycholesterol regardless of the form of p layered onto the gradient and regardless of the substrate enzyme activity side chain cleavage was observed only in fractions corresponding to a sedimentation coefficient of to s which is that for protein no activity was observed at s values corresponding to either protein or protein these findings indicate that the active form of cytochrome p from HPA mitochondria is that containing subunits ie the form in which the cytochrome is normally isolated from adrenal mitochondria forms consisting of eight and four subunits which can be prepared from protein become active only by forming protein at least in an aqueous medium in vitro
1837,the effect of ph on the buoyant density of the complexes of ag with dna has been studied using hlabeled human dna and several bacterial dnas to determine the conditions necessary for the maximum resolution of compositional heterogeneity in neutral csso density gradients ag complexes with g crich components are always denser than those with a trich components since g crich dnas have a larger affinity for ag than a trich dnas and their complexes are denser than a trich complexes in ALP ph greater than csso gradients the buoyant density of the ag dna complex is not a simple CF of base composition the ag affinity of a trich dna is larger than that of g crich dna but the density of a g crich complex is larger thus the ordering of the buoyant density changes depends on the amount of added ag the problem of resolving the density heterogeneity within a tracer dna and minor components of dna is explored and useful fractionation techniques are developed
1838,echinococcus granulosus protoscolex is the actual larval stage of the cestode causing echinococcosis both in man and animals in the present report certain properties of PGI from the ovine liver e granulosus protoscolices have been studied and compared with those of the hydatid cyst fluid and the healthy ovine CL enzymes the protoscolices enzyme prepared in a manner similar to the hydatid cyst fluid and the ovine CL enzymes exhibited the following properties ph optimum of km value of mm the enzyme was inhibited in the presence of high concentrations of alphadglucose phosphate no detectable inhibition of the enzyme was observed in the presence of phosphate ion up to mm the protoscolices enzyme was less thermostable as compared to the hydatid cyst fluid and the ovine liver enzymes the protoscolices enzyme had a lower ki value mm as compared to either the HCF mm or the ovine CL enzymes mm when phosphogluconic acid was used as a competitive inhibitor
1839,at neutral ph zn is a potent and specific inhibitor of rat CL fructose bisphosphatase ec dfructosebisphosphate phosphohydrolase inhibition by zn is uncompetitive with respect to the activating cations mg and mn and the kinetic data suggest that the enzyme possesses a distinct highaffinity IB site for zn with ki of approximately mum at higher concentrations about m zn and to a lesser extent co function as activating cations binding studies show that the enzyme binds two equivalents of zn per S1 one equivalent is partially displaced by mg and is presumably bound to the site for activating cations a second equivalent binds to the highaffinity site presumably identical to the inhibitory site the results suggest that zn functions as an allosteric regulator and that the commonly observed activation of fructose bisphosphatase at neutral ph by edta histidine and other chelators is due to removal of endogenous zn by these agents
1840,the etiologic and pathophysiologic findings described in the first part of this paper have important consequences the recognition of the specific etiology of diarrhea requires new laboratory methods most of these however are technically easy to perform and do not require a large laboratory a longranging consequence of this changed concept is a wellfounded modification of therapy the most important discovery was that in a well balanced glucose electrolyte solution sodium and glucose enhance their absorption mutually and increase the absorption of water by solvent drag since in most acute diarrheas the mechanisms of absorption of glucose and electrolytes are retained this mechanism can be utilized for fast oral rehydration and reinstitution of normal intestinal homeostasis prompt institution of a diet consisting of the previously mentioned glucoseelectrolyte solution usually prevents severe dehydration and the need for stationary treatment the elimination of lactose and long chain fatty acids from the diet prevents continuation of the pathologic osmotic and chemical conditions in the intestine antibiotics are not indicated in AD with the exception of diarrhea caused by enteroinvasive e coli or shigella in the case of salmonellagastroenteritis even contraindicated further research concentrates on the OD of drugs for neutralisation of e coli enterotoxin and the prevention of diarrheas by development of ERP vaccines
1841,the sc administration of mgkg of morphinehcl produced a decrease in the SLA slma of rats the decrease in slma was significantly antagonized by pchlorophenylalanine pcpa when rats pretreated with pcpa were given hydroxytryptophan before morphine injection the marked sedative response to morphine was restored suggesting that the morphineinduced decrease in slma of rats may depend on the release of hydroxytryptamine by morphine by contrast the sc administration of mgkg of morphinehcl produced a significant increase in slma of rats the magnitude of the increase was reduced by atropine scopolamine or alphamethylptyrosine it appears that both adrenergic and cholinergic mechanisms participate in the increase in slma of rats induced by morphine both the increase in slma produced by mgkg of morphine and the decrease in slma induced by mgkg of morphine were completely antagonized by the sc administration of naloxonehcl and mgkg respectively thus it appears that the receptor with which morphine interacts to produce stimulation is chemically identical with or very similar to the receptor with which morphine combines to induce depression the former receptors however are likely to be located on different neurons from the latter
1842,Arg and Met transport by aspergillus nidulans mycelium was investigated a single uptake system is responsible for the transport of arginine lysine and Orn transport is energydependent and specific for these basic amino acids the km value for arginine is x m and vmax is nmolmg dry wtmin km for lysine is x m kt for lysine as inhibitor of arginine uptake is mum and ki for ornithine is mm on minimal medium methionine is transported with a km of i mm and vmax about i nmolmg dry wtmin transport is inhibited by azide neutral amnio acids such as serine phenylalanine and leucine are probably transported by the same system as indicated by their inhibition of methionine uptake and the existence of a mutant specifically impaired in their transport the recessive mutant nap unable to transport neutral amino acids was isolated as resistant to selenomethionine and pfluorophenylanine this mutant has unchanged transport of methionine by general and TPS sulphurregulated permeases
1843,the intraluminal fate of orally administered radioactive vitamin b has been studied in control subjects with normal vitamin b absorption and those with vitamin b malabsorption due to tropical sprue in control subjects to of the dose was bound to sedimentable material and to was bound to immunoreactive IF in subjects with vitamin b malabsorption due to tropical sprue the results were MZ with the control subjects bacteriological studies showed a statistically significant correlation between both the number of flora in the jejunum and the number of bacteroides in both the jejunum and ileum and vitamin b malabsorption in patients with tropical sprue who have normal intrinsic factor secretion the vitamin b absorptive defect is not due to IB of the vitamin to bacteria or to alteration to the intrinsic factor vitamin b complex in the intestinal lumen the lesion appears to be one of the mucosal cell receptors or of the cells themselves possibly caused by bacterial toxins
1844,during the and state high school wrestling championships urine samples were obtained from wrestlers prior to the weighin immediately before they wrestled and immediately T3 the subjects had completed their match specific gravity osmolarity ph sodium and potassium determinations as well as qualitative tests for protein and ketones indicated that the wrestlers were in a dehydrated state at the time of weighin after the five hour interim between the weighin and the first match all but the ph measure remained essentially unchanged this absence of significant changes in the urinary profile suggests that the wrestlers were unable to rehydrate during the five hour time period between the weighin and the first match and that they were competing in a dehydrated state urine samples collected T3 competition were significantly lower in specific gravity osmolarity and potassium concentration than samples obtained before the match the urinary potassium C2 were of interest because at the three conditions weighin before the first match after competition they were higher than values reported for high school students who were nonwrestlers
1845,guineapigs kept on a diet deficient in vitamin c showed after weeks a marked decrease of ascorbic acid in brain and blood leucocytes as well as of the activity of alkaline phosphatase in blood plasma pairfed animals did not exhibit these changes the alphamethylptyrosine alpha mptinduced diminution of noradrenaline in the hypothalamus and the rest of the brain was attenuated in pairfed animals but restored in guineapigs deficient in ascorbic acid the CBF noradrenaline content without administration of alpha mpt showed a decrease in both pairfed and ascorbic acid deficient animals the noradrenaline of the heart exhibited a similar tendency the alpha mptinduced dopamine decrease in the striatum of ascorbic acid deficient animals was attenuated and the dopamine content without alpha mpt administration decreased pairfed animals showed a similar tendency the striatal concentration of homovanillic acid hva was diminished in both pairfed and ascorbic acid deficient guineapigs the cerebral content of hydroxyindoleacetic acid showed a decrease in pairfed as well as in ascorbic acid deficient animals it is concluded that ascorbic acid deficiency enhances the turnover of brain noradrenaline whereas undernutrition without ascorbic acid deficiency pairfeeding diminishes the turnover of cerebral noradrenaline hydroxytryptamine and striatal dopamine
1846,in a continuing T0 of the biosynthetic pathway and RII mechanisms governing indoleacetic acid auxin formation we report the isolation and initial characterization of three distinct indoleacetaldehyde reductases from cucumber seedlings these enzymes catalyze the reduction of indoleacetaldehyde to indoleethanol with the concomitant oxidation of nadph to nadp two of the reductases are specific for nadph as second substrate while the third is TPS for nadh the enzymes show a strong specificity for indoleacetaldehyde with apparent km values of mum mum and mum being calculated for the two nadphspecific reductases and the nadhspecific reductase respectively under no conditions of ATP concentration incubation time or assay method could the reverse reaction be observed chromatography on a calibrated sephadex gel column led to estimated molecualr weights of and for the nadphspecific reductases while a value of was obtained for the nadhspecific reductase both nadphspecific reductases showed a ph optimum of with a secondary optimum at and both enzymes were activated by increasing ionic strength the nadhspecific reductase showed a ph optimum of with a AA optimum at and was slightly inhibited by increasing ionic strength
1847,following injection of uc threonine into the haemolymph of AD female glossina morsitans during late pregnancy radioactivity was detected in the postparturient female and in its F1 in threonine lipids and a range of nonessential amino acids the level of radioactivity recovered from the larva was higher than that remaining in the injected adult and the radioactivity recovered was considerably higher in the amino acid than in the lipid fraction administration of labelled threonine into maternal haemolymph on each of the first days of the day long pregnancy cycle was followed h later by measurement of radioactivity in the developing oÃ¶cyte and in the intrauterine progeny the patterns of nutrient uptake are discussed in relation to vitellogenesis in the oÃ¶cyte and to growth of the larva analysis of the expired carbon dioxide and excreta was carried out h after maternal i.t. of labelled threonine on the first or eighth day of pregnancy carbon dioxide and excreta from females in early pregnancy showed significantly higher radioactivity than those from females in late pregnancy in both cases radioactivity in the amino acid fraction from the excreta was extremely small and about of the total activity was in uric acid these results are discussed in terms of the utilization of threonine in relation to the metabolic demands for various nutriments by the Pr female
1848,ultraviolet uv irradiation erg x mm decreased membrane potential and input resistance of amoeba proteus and induced formation of pinocytotic channels submaximal pinocytosis induced by uv light was additive to pinocytosis induced by k or na and stimulated in the presence of egta it was not inhibited by the presence of la or by pretreatment with dibucaine in these respects and with respect to optimum ph and pca uv induced pinocytosis accumulation of k in the amoeba membrane after a dose of radiation may explain the similarity between pinocytosis induced by uv light and potassium salts ca present during the period of irradiation inhibited the effect of uv light instead ca applied after irradiation mm increased channel formation this effect was stimulated the presence of local anesthetic drugs it is suggested that high doses of uv light may induce channel formation by releasing ca from the cell membrane into the cell uv induced pinocytosis ca may be released at the moment of absorption of uv CS in the membrane as well as during the period of depolarization which follows irradiation low doses of uv light may permit extracellular ca to enter the cell and stimulate channel formation calcium induced pinocytosis dithiotreitol mm applied after irradiation depressed both uv and calcium induced pinocytosis so these may be the result of the same structural NC which involves the formation of disulphide bonds in the membrane
1849,the plantar cushion reflex in cats was examined as a model system in a mammal for the T0 of the effects of repeated stimulation on neural transmission effects of various frequencies and intensities of stimulation were similar to those seen in other reflex systems for instance for a fixed number of stimuli habituation of the plantar cushion reflex was more marked at hz than at hz and with x threshold stimulation than with x threshold stimulation sensitization occurred at intermediate intensities and frequencies of stimulation dorsal root potentials were studied changes in dorsal root potentials during iterated stimulation did not correlate with the changes in the plantar cushion reflex these changes in the plantar cushion reflex were also unrelated to variations in afferent transmission peripheral to the spinal cord sensitization and habituation in the plantar cushion reflex occurred during iterated stimulation were produced centrally and were unrelated to mechanisms of presynaptic inhibition
1850,the authors compared the activity of acetylcoasynthetase and of the enzymes belonging to the group of asparaginic acid in levomycetin sensitive and resistant strains of y pestis and e coli there were revealed marked differences in the activity of aspartase fumarase synthetase and desamidase of lasparagin and also of the enzyme G1 by acetate in the e coli strains with plasmide resistance transmission of rfactor to the pestis was accompanied by decomposition of lasparadein formation of accoa at the same time transformation of lasparaginic acid catalyzed by aspartase remained on the same low level in the CS pestis cultures and their variants with the rfactor when the resistance was controlled by chromosomal resistance markers the activity of the enzymes providing formation of lasparagic acid its NH and lmalic acid showed no significant change in chromosomal type of resistance in the mutants of pestis and e coli the acetylcoasynthetase reaction was as a rule somewhat increased
1851,the effect of morphine on the histamine content of the mouse brain has been investigated the changes in the brain histamine level have been related to morphineinduced analgesia and morphineinduced changes in locomotor activity with doses of morphine between and mgkg there was a significant increase in histamine levels the time required to produce a maximal rise in the brain histamine level with mgkg of morphine was min there was a significant decrease in brain histamine C2 with doses of morphine between and mgkg the time at which the greatest decrease was produced with mgkg was min the time couse of the alteration of brain histamine by morphine did not correlate with its antinociceptive activity both the and mgkg doses of morphine produced analgesia in mice whereas BB histamine levels were increased and decreased respectively pretreating mice with compounds which modify histaminergic function did not modify the antinociceptive action of morphine morphine produced a biphasic effect on locomotor activity when the dose was increased from through to mgkg doses up to mgkg caused a reduction of activity and doses above this produced significant increases there appears to be an inverse relationship between the morphineinduced changes of brain histamine and the morphineinduced changes in locomotor activity
1852,the experiments were done on single nodes of ranvier of rana esculenta the effects of tetrodotoxin and h ions were determined either by the reduction of the maximum rate of rise va of action potentials evoked with threshold stimuli or in the Vc clamp by the decrease of the peak na permeability pna with the tetrodotoxin sample used throughout the investigation the equilibrium dissociation constant kt of the toxinreceptor reaction at neutral ph was determined to be nm between and nm tetrodotoxin the normalized value a of va was found to be related to the normalized toxin concentration ct ttx nm by the empirical equation log aa log ct on increasing the ph up to the effect of tetrodotoxin diminished as revealed by an increase in a the apparent reduction of ct as calculated from a suggests that the toxin is active only in its cationic forms weakly acid tetrodotoxin solutions less than ph less than or equal to reduced a to a lesser degree than did neutral toxin solutions in spite of the inherent depressing effect of acid ph on a a at about ph in more acid toxin solutions a decreased again and at ph it was about equal to the value in toxinfree solution when after equilibrium in an acid toxin solution the perfusate was suddenly changed to neutral ringer solution a jumped to a higher value a as measured sec T3 the switch since the blocking effect of hydrogen ions subsided within a fraction of a second while the time constant of the toxin washout is of the order of min a reflects the number of na channels blocked by tetrodotoxin at acid ph in acid toxinfree solution the peak pna as obtained in Vc clamp experiments was reduced by a voltagedependent factor ch with ch hkhe and khe mum exp efrt adding tetrodotoxin resulted in another reduction by a constant factor pt experiments employing various combinations of toxin concentration nm and ph values confirm the decreased toxin effect at low ph moreover pt was smaller the additional toxin effect larger when the membrane had been kept depolarized and thus ch reduced during equilibration this suggests that tetrodotoxin cations and h ions compete for the same blocking site a quantitative fit however requires additional assumptions
1853,this paper described a behavior modification training program emphasizing selfcontrol for staff working with drug addicts the program which is primarily geared toward the training of paraprofessionals takes place in ten hour sessions and includes an overview of behavior modification as well as instruction in techniques of EC50 desensitization selfimage improvement SMB analysis behavior control assertive training rational thinking and how to set up and run similar behavior modification training programs for staff and patients since this training began at the NJ neuropsychiatric institute in november a total of staff members mostly paraprofessionals working with addicts alcoholics mentally ill patients and inmates including from our own institution persons from other facilities in NJ and from facilities in other states have been trained while patients have been trained in similar programs most of this training has been accomplished by paraprofessionals preliminary evaluation data have been promising and the response of participants enthusiastic
1854,a comparative study was performed for isoelectric and electrophoretic spectra blood serum Al of parental breeds of chickens and their heterosis hybrids broiler cocks the method of isoelectric focusing within the surcrose density gradient and ph created by the gradient of sucrose mannitol and boronborate buffer ph concentrations was applied the electrophoretic spectrum of the SS albumin fraction homogeneous in the agar gel was obtained by PACE in polyacrylamide gel the isoelectric spectrum of heterosis hybrid Al is established to be more heterogeneous and during isoelectric focusing it is divided within a range of ph into seven fractions against fourfive components of the parent breed albumin among them it is possible to distinguish the fraction involving more than of the total protein the great component and some small components with different protein content and belonging wither to a more acid or more basic region as compared to pi of the great component the pi value of the great component for hybrid albumin is shifted towards the acid region against and in Al of the parent breeds small component of hybrid albumin are characterized by an increase in their amount but pi of the fraction is within the range of values peculiar to albumin of the maternal and paternal lines the albumin preparations of all the studied chicken breeds isolated from BS by electrophoresis in the agar gel manifest multiplicity of the protein bands in a polyacrylamide gel the electric spectra of hybrid albumin and parent breeds albumin differ in the distribution pattern of the components and their quantitative composition a REM of the intensively stained dense band which represents the main electrophoretic component is increased in hydrid albumin with the respect to albumin of the maternal line but is identical to the PWS line
1855,when a ngno solution was kept at degrees c in glass or polypropylene containers and of original radioactivity was adsorbed to the containers walls after and days respectively however no loss in radioactivity was observed if the solution was supplemented with hgcl as carrier mug hgml and stored in either container for days when hg was dissolved in glucose basal salt BB with added carrier levels of hg in solution kept in glass decreased to and of original after and days and decreased even more if stored in PP and of original activity T3 and days respectively in the absence of carrier decreases of hg activities in media stored in either container were more pronounced due to chemisorption but not DWI the following factors affecting the removal of mercurials from aqueous solution stored in glass were examined type and concentration of adsorbent fiber glass and rubber powder ph i.c.v. of the rubber and the form of mercury used rubber was equally effective in the adsorption of organic and inorganic mercury the ph of the AQ hg solution was not a critical factor in the rate of adsorption of mercury by the rubber in addition the effect of soaking the rubber in water for hr did not show any statistical difference when compared with nontreated rubber it can be concluded that rubber is a very ERP adsorbent of mercury and thus can be used as a simple method for control of mercury pollution
1856,the optimal reaction conditions and kinetic properties of eleven leukocyte acid hydrolases determined with the use of fluorigenic derivatives of methylumbelliferone are described the enzymes studied were acid phosphatase aryl sulfatase alpha and betaglucosidase alpha and betagalactosidase alphamannosidase nacetylbetaglucosaminidase nacetylbetagalactosaminidase betaglucuronidase and alphafucosidase more than of the activity of each enzyme was released into a x g supernatant by a double sonication procedure employing sodium chloride and triton x the km values obtained were similar to those previously reported for chromogenic subtrates a single km value could not be derived for betagalactosidase because its double reciprocal plot was not linear all enzymes could be measured with less than mug of protein within min activators and inhibitors studied included the chloride salts of na k zn ca mg hg and fe as well as pchloromercuriphenysulfonate glutathione bal edta egta triton x and sodium taurocholate the reaction conditions described in this report can be used for the diagnosis of various lysosomal storage diseases and should facilitate the development of automated procedures for the analysis of these eleven enzyme MICs with small quantities of blood
1857,the effects of lowering the liver pyridoxal phosphate plp concentration by vitamin b deficiency on the stability of several rat CL enzymes were examined three plpdependent enzymes serine dehydratase ornithinedeltaaminotransferase and TAT and two nonplpdependent enzymes glucosephosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase were induced in vitamin b deficient and control rats by feeding them highprotein diets or by injecting them with glucagon or dexamethasone the decline of each activity was followed after withdrawal of the inducer serine dehydratase activity declined more rapidly in vitamin b deficient than in control liver however OAT and tyrosine aminotransferase MICs were equally stable in deficient and control CL ornithine aminotransferase was predominantly in holoenzyme form in both control and deficient rats whereas TAT was predominantly in apoenzyme form in both groups the proportion of SDH in apoenzyme was less stable than the holoenzyme activity changes of glucosephosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in control and vitamin b deficient rats were similar the results suggest that differences in the stability of plpdependent enzymes in vitamin b deficient rats depend upon differences in the proportions of these enzymes existing as holo and apoenzyme
1858,the intracellular ph phi of giant barnacle muscle fibers was measured with glass microelectrodes and also calculated from the CSD of dimethyloxazolidinedione dmo and methylamine ma simultaneously applying any two of these methods to muscle fibers of the same barnacle we found the ph measured with an intracellular electrode phelec to be about higher than the dmoderived ph phdmo and phdmo to be about higher than the maderived ph pma in studies on the phi of squid giant axons we found that phelec and phdmo were not significantly different in the barnacle experiments dmo required about min to reach a steadystate distribution while ma required more than h the deviations of phdmo and phma from phelec for the barnacle can be explained by a an error in the assumed intracellular pka of dmo or ma b membrane permeability to the ionic form of dmo or ma or c intracellular compartmentalization included is a detailed study of the apparent dissociation constant of dmo as affected by temperature and ionic strength and composition
1859,placement of two cm copper cu coils around the midregion of each oviduct in a group of five female rabbits with proven fertility days before mating virtually prevented fetal implantation in these animals the oviducts remained patent during a day implantation period and following removal of the cu coils does that were remated became Pr in two of these does an implantation rate living fetusescorpora lutea of was observed and one postcu implanted doe had a litter of two among four does bearing a single cu coil on their left oviduct for days prior to mating there was implantation of the left side and on the UT right side suggesting a local action by the metal the results indicate that cu is an effective antifertility agent when implanted around the oviducts and as a corollary it is apparent that the metal is not restricted to placement in the uterus in order to prevent pregnancy in rabbits nonoccluding cu containing devices may offer a new approach to reversible fertility control in the female that merits further investigation
1860,compared with human material glial fibrillary Pa isolated from bovine rat and mouse brain was remarkably homogeneous and migrated as a single band at mol wt on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis the protein was extremely susceptible to proteolysis and lower molecular weight components were invariably isolated together with the L1 species when the brain was not rapidly frozen further Kd of the mol wt polypeptide in bovine tissues incubated at degrees c resulted in preparations essentially identical to those previously isolated from human autopsy material and separating into a series of immunologically AS polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from to approximately the gel band pattern obtained T3 progressively longer periods of autolysis suggested that small fragments were cleaved from the original polypeptide in successive steps of degradation as in human brain the lower molecular weight products in the range were more resistant to proteolysis and still present after prolonged periods of tissue autolysis the effect of the ph and of proteinase inhibitors on degradation was studied in homogenates of bovine BS incubated at degrees c at ph proteolysis of the glial fibrillary acidic protein followed essentially the same pattern as in tissue cleavage of the major species was not prevented by the addition of proteinase inhibitors at ph and a different type of Kd was observed with rapid breakdown of the protein and loss of immunological activity increased solubility in buffer solutions was another effect of autolysis compared with cerebral cortex and brain stem where most of the protein was water soluble only a small fraction was extracted with buffer from bovine WG matter however the solubility markedly increased following incubation and comparable amounts were extracted in buffer and in m urea
1861,a number of parameters affecting the adsorption of rrna and polyacontaining rna to millipore filters were investigated separately binding of both types of rna to the filter was dependent on the concentration of rna ph and mg concentration of the reaction mixture both types of rna bound to the filter optimally at slightly acid ph values the IB of polyacontaining rna to the filter exhibited a broad phdependence compared with that of rrna the ratio of polyarich rnarrna retained by the filter was maximal between ph and the presence of mmedta or a high concentration of nacl over m decreased the affinity of rna for the filter the amount of polyacontaining rna in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of a plasmacytoma cell L1 mpc labelled with ppi was determined by the milliporefilter technique under conditions that minimized contamination by rrna these data were compared with the estimations made by oligodtcellulose chromatography the results obtained by these two methods were in good agreement for rna labelled for short periods up to h in long labelling and pulsechase experiments however contamination of the filter by rrna of increasing specific radioactivity in the cytoplasm gave an erroneous value for polyacontaining rna by the milliporefilter technique determinations made on the nuclear fraction by these two methods did not show significant R2 in short and LT labelling experiments
1862,an intravenous infusion of isoprenaline mugkgmn during h elicited a rise in serum free fatty acids ffa and glucose in anaesthetised cats the effect reached a peak in h and was then maintained at a plateau level for the remainder of the infusion AC and practolol mgkg po were more potent in reducing the concentration of free fatty acids ffa than in lowering gl propranolol was roughly equipotent on ffa and gl in fasted human volunteers an intravenous infusion of isoprenaline mugkgmn during min stimulated a rise in serum ffa peak values were attained rapidly and ffa levels began to fall soon after the end of the infusion blood gl concentration was not changed a placebo given after the first infusion of isoprenaline did not significantly affect the response to further infusions at and h later an oral dose of acebutolol mg largely suppressed the lipolytic effect of the nd and rd isoprenaline infusions the degrees of inhibition being pcent and pcent respectively the same dose of practolol was considerably less effective in inhibiting lipolysis pcent and pcent inhibition
1863,an acid protease produced by the thermophilic fungus penicillium duponti k has been purified by consecutive ionexchange and gel permeation chromatography and crystallized from AQ acetone solution the purified endopeptidase gave a symmetrical schlieren peak by sedimentation velocity and was found to be homogeneous upon disc gel PACE at ph the enzyme was most active at ph against milk casein and showed high thermostability an isoelectric point of was found by isoelectric focusing a minimum molecular weight of was calculated from the amino acid composition adopting an arginine content of one residue per mole of enzyme this minimum molecular weight is in good agreement with the value of previously found by gel permeation hashimoto h iwaasa t and yokotsuka t appl microbiol besides the thermostability the purified p duponti protease differs from other wellcharacterized acid proteases in that it contains carbohydrate expressed as gl the enzyme was not affected by pbromophenacyl bromide but was CR inactivated by alphadiazopbromoacetophenone diazoacetyldlnorleucine methyl ester and diazoacetylglycine ethyl ester in the presence of cu the complete inactivation of the protease by diazoacetyldlnorleucine methyl ester resulted in the TPS incorporation of mol of norleucinemol of enzyme on the basis of similar SMB of other acid proteases toward this inactivator the results suggest the presence at the active site of an unusually reactive carboxyl group involved in the catalytic function the naturally occurring pepsin inhibitor of streptomyces naniwaensis murao s and satoi s agric biol chem inhibited also the protease at a threefold molar excess with respect to the enzyme
1864,a total of day old chickens were fed a cholesterol diet for a period of to days and compared with an equal number of controls aortas were analyzed for various indexes of reactivity of connective tissue cholesterol content and SEM microscopy sem characteristics of the EC lining cholesterol feeding for a period up to weeks resulted in doubling the level of serum cholesterol it was however without effect on the activity of prolyl hydroxylase lysyl oxidase collagenase and collagen content in the aortic wall as early as weeks of feeding significant changes occurred in total and esterified cholesterol content at the same time endothelial cells were characteristically contracted with several long cytoplasmic elongations and protrusions a significant decrease of activity of the above enzymes was found in aortic tissue with increased age of the chicken collagen content in aortas increased with age of chickens it is concluded that cholesterol as an atherogenic agent induces marked changes in EC cells and lipids of chicken aorta at earlier periods prior to the activation of connective tissue
1865,a detailed study of cytochrome c oxidase activity with keilinhartree particles and purified beef HR enzyme at low ionic strength and low cytochrome c concentrations showed biphasic kinetics with apparent km x m and apparent km to x m direct binding studies with purified oxidase phospholipidcontaining as well as phospholiptaining aiddepleted demonstrated two sites of interaction of cytochrome c with the enzyme with kd less than or equal to m and kd m the maximal velocities as low ionic strength increased with ph and were highest above ph the presence and properties of the low apparent km phase of the kinetics were strongly dependent on the nature and concentration of the anions in the medium the multivalent anions phosphate adp and atp greatly decreased the proportion of this phase and similarly decreased the amount of high affinity cytochrome ccytochrome oxidase complex formed the order of effectiveness was atp greater than adp greater than p and since phosphate binds to cytochrome c more strongly than the nucleotides it is concluded that the inhibition resulted from anion interaction with the oxidase mat low concentrations bakers yeast iso bakers yeast iso horse and euglena cytochromes c at high concentrations all attained the same maximal velocity the different proportions of low apparent km phase in the kinetic patterns of these cytochromes c correlated with the amounts of high affinity complex formed with purified cytochrome c oxidase the apparent km for cytochrome c activity in the succinatecytochrome c reductase system of keilinhartree particles was MZ with that obtained with the oxidase x m suggesting the same site serves both reactions it is concluded that the observed kinetics result from two catalytically active sites on the cytochrome c oxidase protein of different affinities for cytochrome c the high affinity IB of cytochrome c to the mitochondrial membrane is provided by the oxidase and at this site cytochrome c can be reduced by cytochrome c physiological concentrations of atp decrease the affinity of this binding to the point that interaction of cytochrome c with numerous mitochondrial pholpholipid sites can competitively remove cytochrome c from the oxidase it is suggested that this effect of atp represents a possible mechanism for the control of electron flow to the oxidase
1866,a finding was made that a species of ribonuclease is released into mycelial culture media when a wildtype strain of neurospora crassa was grown on limiting amounts of phosphate the ribonuclease activity in the fully derepressed state extends to about to fold of that in the repressed state the synthesis of the ribonuclease was inhibited by the addition of rifampicin cycloheximide or orthophosphate three molecular species of the ribonuclease were found two enzyme fractions showing larger molecular weights were suspected to be aggregates containing the enzyme showing the smallest molecular weight molecular weight of all three fractions showed ph optima of around preferential hydrolysis of polyguanylic acid and poor hydrolysis of cGMP these characteristics were the same as those of ribonuclease n and it was suggested that ribonuclease n is a repressible extracellular enzyme mutations in the genes nuc and nuc caused loss of ability to derepress this enzyme but heterokaryon between them partially restored the ability the nuc mutation was epistatic to the nuc alleles which are partly constitutive in the ribonuclease production
1867,after intraperitoneal i.t. of labeled ccl chcl and halothane in mice c is preferentially bound to liver endoplasmic protein and lipid a considerable activity is also associated with mitochondrial constituents maximal protein IB nmolmg ccl hrs chcl hrs halothane hrs lipid binding ccl min chcl hrs halothane hrs the form of the binding curves in microsomal and mitochondrial protein and lipid differed with the individual haloalkanes the irreversible CB of c from labeled haloalkanes in anaerobic suspensions of isolated rabbit liver microsomes and nadph after min was for protein lipid nmolmg ccl chcl halothane trichlorofluoromethane anerobic incubation favored dehalogenation but chcl metabolism and irreversible IB requires oxygen the greatest differences in the in vitro covalent IB rates were observed with chcl in rat mouse and rabbit altered microsomal cytochrome p concentrations in P0 animals or produced by pretreatment of rats with phenobarbital methylcholanthrene mc or cocl effected similar but not proportional changes in the rates of irreversible protein and lipid IB upon addition of ccl the difference of light absorption of reduced liver microsomes from mcpretreated rats containing cytochrome p appeared at nm the irreversible binding rate in these microsomes was also increased the small accleration in irreversible binding in liver microsomes from rats pretreated with IPA is not proportional to the high increase of ccl toxicity practically no binding to added soluble albumin or rna was observed in microsomal incubates however c is bound to the nicotineadenine dinucleotides of the nadph system all haloalkanes produced a similar increase of nadph oxidation in incubates of rabbit CL microsomes and nadph
1868,the effects of local i.v. of drugs into terminal Az of the mesolimbic dopamine system were investigated bilateral administration of dopamine but not of noradrenaline and serotonin into the nucleus accumbens of nonpretreated rats resulted in stimulation of locomotor activity no clear or only minor effects were seen T3 injections of the dopamine metabolites methoxytyramine dopac and hva and after injections of media with different ph and osmolality damphetamine proved more effective than dopamine in producing locomotor stimulation whereas both stimulant and depressant effects were observed following injection of apomorphine into the nucleus accumbens et and the noradrenaline agonists clonidine phenylephrine and isoprenaline did not enhance locomotor activity but theophylline was ERP pretreatment with haloperidol but not with clozapine significantly reduced the effects of dopamine and theophylline locomotor stimulation was also found following BL administration of dopamine damphetamine and apomorphine into the tuberculum olfactorium whereas noradrenaline serotonin and et produced no or rather depressant effects these results provide further evidence for an important role of the mesolimbic dopamine system with respect to locomotor activity
1869,two classes of sulfhydryl groups in histidine decarboxylase from lactobacillus a can be differentiated by their reaction with dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid dtnb five cysteinyl residues class i of the native enzyme are titrated by dtnb as the ph of the reaction medium is increased from to the phrate profile for their reaction is described by a pka of an additional five thiol CG class ii are titrated only when denaturing agents are added above neutral ph histidine decarboxylase is completely inactivated by dtnb in a kinetically secondorder process kapp m min at ph and degrees c which occurs coincident with and at the same rate as modification of the five classi sh groups of the enzyme ie one thiol group per pyruvoyl prosthetic group the competitive inhibitors histamine and imidazole markedly enhanced the CR of these cysteinyl residues toward dtnb this enhancement is accompanied by a concomitant increase in the rate of inactivation a single sh group in each of the five catalytic units of histidine decarboxylase is thus implicated as being critical for the expression of enzymatic activity
1870,fiftyseven chronic agoraphobic outpatients were treated by hours of exposure in vivo on four days over two weeks to check the effects of oral diazepam versus placebo during group exposure group versus individual exposure and high versus medium anxiety arousal during individual SE the controlled parallel design allowed comparative DUE of each treatment condition to six months followup assessment was blind with respect to drug and psychological treatment patients in all treatment conditions improved significantly in phobias and in related life areas outcome to group exposure on phobias and other measures was similar in all three drug conditions placebo waning diazepam peak diazepam with no significant differences between them diazepam patients had significantly less discomfort than PL patients during group exposure treatment group SE patients improved slightly but significantly more than individual exposure patients on nonphobic measures though group exposure was accompanied by more panics during treatment yet was easier to run by the therapist individual exposure under high anxiety arousal was no more therapeutic than with lower anxiety diazepam is a mild palliative during group exposure but does not facilitate outcome to treatment group SE in vivo is mildly facilitatory for outcome compared with individual exposure anxiety evocation during treatment was not therapeutically helpful
1871,the hydrolysis of the phospholipids of intact human serum HD lipoprotein hdl by pure alphaphospholipase a from crotalus adamanteus was studied by phstat titration the enzyme quantitatively hydrolyzed phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine and left sphinogomyelin intact yielding a stable and watersoluble modified hdl lysophospholipids and free fatty acids the products of hydrolysis remained in the lipoprotein when mol of defatted bovine SS albuminmol of substrate phospholipids was added to the reaction mixture up to of the fatty acids and of the lysophospholipids were removed from the modified lipoprotein the immunological reactivity of the hydrolyzed hdl remained unaltered in both the presence and absence of albumin the changes in the physical properties of the lipoprotein during hydrolysis were rather small the most notable being an increase in the hydrated density and in the electrophoretic mobility in alkaline buffers the hydrolysis followed an apparent first order time course with product inhibition ki and yielded values of kcatkm x ms and ki congruent to x m addition of albumin to the reaction mixture relieved the product inhibition without any alteration of the kinetic parameters high concentrations of albumin protected some of the substrate phospholipids from hydrolysis presumably through complexation to the lipoprotein the arrhenius plot for the experimental first order rate constant in the absence of albumin kexp kcat kikm was linear between degrees and degrees indicating the absence of any phospholipid phase transitions and yielding an activation SE of kcalmol from the accessibility of the hdl phospholipids to phospholipase a one concludes that the phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine are located at or are in rapid equilibrium with the surface of this lipoprotein it also appears that these phospholipids are not essential for maintaining the supramolecular properties of the lipoprotein in vitro thsu the study of the modified hdl should provide valuable information concenring the structure and function of this lipoprotein particularly with regard to the role played by shiingomyelin
1872,out of tracheotomized patients survived and of them developed a tracheal stenosis syndrome p including supraostial stenosis ostial and supraostial stenosis ostial stenosis intermediate stenosis and distal stenosis in two cases the stenosis was found out during the removal of the cannula and in the other cases from days to months T3 the decannulation the deffered treatment consisted in an antiinflammatory medical treatment treatment one case in a permanent dilation with an albouker tube two cases and in a resection of the stenosed tracheal part plus an anastomosis good results were obtained in cases including the recovery of a satisfactory tracheal diameter because of a recurrence of the stenosis after resection and anastomosis it was necessary in two cases to resort to another resection and upon another occasion to place a permanent cannulation finally in one case rethi operations were necessary to get a subnormal tracheal diameter from these facts it emerges that tracheal stenosis are less important if during the tracheotomy a partial resection of the tracheal wall is effected rather than an inverted u flap folded back at the bottom together with the putting in of a cannula equipped with an elongated cylindrical cuff requiring a less important filingup pressure although just as efficient as far as tightness is concerned
1873,auxotrophic mutants of escherichia coli w or k blocked before shikimic acid in the aromatic biosynthetic pathway grew poorly on shikimic acid as sole aromatic supplement this poor growth response was correlated with a relatively poor ability to transport shikimic acid if citrate was present in the GM as it is in some commonly used basal media the growth of some of the e coli k mutants on shikimate was further reduced mutants were derived from preshikimate auxotrophs which grew rapidly on media containing shikimic acid these derivatives all had an increased ability to transport shikimic acid thus it is proposed that the growth on shikimate observed in the parent cells is restricted by their relatively poor uptake of shikimate from the medium and that this restriction may be removed by a mutation which enhances shikimate transport transduction analysis of the mutations which enhanced utilization and transport of shikimic acid by e coli k strains indicated at least two classes class was about cotransduced with the histidine region of the e coli k chromosome and appeared to be coincident with a known shikimate transport locus shia class was not cotransduced with his the locus or loci of this class is unknown kinetic measurements suggested that both classes had shikimate uptake systems derived from the wildtype system two class mutants had increased C2 of otherwise unaltered wildtype transport while one class mutant had an altered michaelis constant km for shikimate transport
1874,a multiple behavioral schedule with food reinforcement was designed to measure the druginduced performance enhancement and noneffective activity in rats the schedule min in duration had crf components in the trials and extinction components in the intertrial periods during each trial food reinforcement was present in the limited period sec each which was preceded by a discriminative stimulus sec either a light or a footshock the rats generated a high rate of lever pressing during the limited period and a low rate of lever pressing during the intertrial period the drugs studied were damphetamine methylphenidate pipradrol and phenindamine at low dosages these drugs increased further the high rate of lever pressing this was considered to be the performance enhancement effect at higher doses the drugs increased the low rate of lever pressing decreased the high rate of lever pressing and decreased responding of the rats to the discriminative stimulus this latter pattern was considered to be the noneffective activity caused by the drugs as expected damphetamine was the most potent minor differences in drug effects were seen between the group of rats having CS and that group having footshock as discriminative CS-
1875,the solubility of rabbit skeletal and lobster abdominal muscle myosin has been studied in monovalent salt solutions as a function of ph over the range to and ionic strength mm rb skeletal muscle S1 was found to precipitate over a narrower ph range than the lobster abdominal muscle S1 but at equivalent ph values and ionic strengths the former exhibited greater solubility comparison of the solubility of rabbit S1 per se with that of light meromyosin and lobster myosin with its equivalent proteolytically produced fragment fraction b showed that both rod fragments were more soluble than their parent molecules under conditions of low solubility low ionic strength and ph the quantitiy of protein in solution remained essentially constant with increasing total protein thus suggesting that the aggregation phenomenon is of a phase transition type examination of the aggregates by electron microscopy revealed that rabbit myosin formed classical elongate spindleshaped filaments similar to those previously observed by others in contrast lobster myosin only formed short dumbbellshaped filaments mum long consideration of the ph ranges over which aggregation occurred suggests that protonation of histidine residues may be involved in rabbit S1 filament formation while for lobster myosin aggregation may involve protonation of epsilonamino or guanidino groups the possible relationship between the distribution of these groups along the rod portion of the myosin molecule and the formation of elongate filaments has been explored
1876,a method for assessing the IB of hlabeled prostaglandin e hpge to cell membranes has been developed and used to T0 the interaction of hpge with membranes from cultured mammalian cells receptor CS were identified by rho of the potency of a series of compounds to compete for hpge binding sites and to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity by rho of rates of binding and NC in enzyme activity and by the correspondence of hpgebinding activity with the presence or absence of pgesensitive adenylate cyclase in several clones in clone b a murine lcell hpge binds with an activation SE of kcalmol to a class of sites with an affinity of x m and a capacity of fmolmg of protein concentration dependence of adenylate cyclase activation by pge kd nm and kinetic analysis of hpge binding k x litersmolmin k min verify this affinity concentration dependence and specificity of IB and activation of adenylate cyclases in neuroblastoma clone ntg and ntg substantiate the method in several clones that lack pgeresponsive adenylate cyclase no TPS hpge binding is detectable
1877,in rat lung slices hdisodium cromoglycate hdscg mm was taken up rapidly and hdscg tissue spaces which equilibrated by minutes remained constant over a hour incubation period in contrast sphenol red mm accumulated in lung slices to a much greater extent than did dscg and the measured tissue spaces continued to increase over a hour incubation period in the presence of either phenol red mm or the metabolic inhibitors iodoacetic acid m and dinitrophenol m hdscg uptake was significantly decreased accumulation of hdscg in lung slices and IB to tissue homogenates ph was also decreased when ca and mg ions were omitted from the bathing solution although dscg and PR mutually inhibited the accumulation of one another over time in lung slices and hdscg mm IB to lung homogenates was decreased in the presence of mm phenol red sphenol red efflux was not altered by the addition of mm dscg during the washout thus it appears that in rat lung dscg and PH red share a common binding CS for uptake possible on the transport carrier also there appear to be additional pulmonary binding sites for phenol red these sites are not occupied by dscg and their presence could account for the differences observed in the extent of accumulation of the two compounds in lung slices
1878,the in vivo effects of cholera toxin on lymphoid organ structure and function in mice were investigated it was found that within a day following intravenous i.t. of mug of toxin thymus as well as SP weight decreased but the animals remained healthy histological studies suggested that the involution of lymphoid organs was due to cell death injection of cholera toxin into adrenalectomized mice was lethal within h in these animals no decrease in lymphoid organ weight was noted thymus cells from toxintreated mice were found to be much VPI to thymocytes of UT animals in their in vitro response to concanavalin a whereas the response of SP cells from toxintreated animals to mitogens was slightly increased mug of cholera toxin increased primary antibody formation when given to mice together with antigen sheep erythrocytes and decreased primary antibody formation when given before or after the antigen the toxin also increased secondary antibody formation when injected simultaneously with or after the booster antigen dose and decreased the antibody formation when given a few days before the booster injection treatment of mice with toxin was found to increase the capacity of SP cells from these animals to induce the parental effect on antibody formation and to induce graftversushost reactions the mechanisms behind the observed effects are discussed it is suggested that cholera toxin affects different types of cells involved in immune responses primarily by a direct inhibitory action on cellular proliferation but also indirectly by causing release of adrenal gland hormones
1879,inhibition kinetics of succinatean acceptor of oxidoreductase activity of soluble succinate dehydrogenase by nethylmaleimide is studied the alkylation reaction is described by the kinetic equation of the first order its stechiometric coefficient being the binding of enzyme sulphhydride groups by pchloromercuriumbenzoate blocks the enzyme alkylation and its inhibition by oxaloacetate succinate protects succinate dehydrogenase from the inhibitory effect of nethylmaleimide the reaction of the enzyme with an alkylating agent in the presence of different substrate concentrations corresponds kinetically to the model according to which a sulphhydride group acts in the active site of the enzyme pka of this group is at degreesc the dependency of the maximal substrate oxidation reaction rate and that of the enzyme alkylation rate on ph coinside at the ph range the presence of anions in the alkylation medium decreases the reaction ability of the AS site with respect to nethylmaleimide a mechanism of the initial stage of succinate oxidation with the cooperation of the sulphhydride group of the enzyme active site is postulated
1880,two membrane fractions prepared from the ehrlich ascitestumor cell show nonidentical stimulatory responses to certain amino acids in their mg dependent activity to cleave atp despite the presence of ouabain and the absence of na or k the first of these previously described shows little na katpase activity and is characteristicallly stimulated by the presence of certain diamino acids with low pk and at ph values suggesting that the cationic forms of these amino acids are ERP the evidence indicates that these effects are not obtained through occupation of the kinetically discernible receptor site serving characteristically for the uphill transport of these amino acids into the ehrlich cell the second membrane preparation was purified with the goal of concentrating the na katpase activity it also is stimulated by the MM diamino acid aminomethylpiperidinecarboxylic acid and several ordinary amino acids the diamino acids were most effective at ph values where the neutral zwitterionic forms might be responsible among the optically active amino acids tested the effects of ornithine and leucine were substantially stronger for the l than for the d isomers the list of stimulatory amino acids again corresponds poorly to any single transport system although the possibility was not excluded that stimulation might occur for both preparations by occupation of a membrane site which ordinarily is kinetically silent in the transport sequence the high sensitivity to deoxycholate and to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide of the hydrolytic activity produced by the presence of lornithine and aminomethylpiperidinecarboxylic acid suggests that the stimulatory effect is not merely a general intensification of the BG mg dependent hydrolytic activity
1881,the tyrosinesensitive deoxydarabinoheptulosonate phosphate synthase phosphoketodeoxydarabinoheptonate derythrosephosphate lyase pyruvatephosphorylating ec was purified to homogeneity from extracts of escherichia coli k a spectrophotometric CA of the CEA based on the absorption difference of substrates and products at nm was developed the enzyme has a molecular weight of as judged by gel filtration on sephadex g and a subunit molecular weight of as determined by PAGE in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate this suggests either a rapid monomerdimer equilibrium or a very asymmetric shape for the native enzyme the enzyme shows a narrow ph optimum around ph the enzyme is stable for several months when stored at degrees in phosphate buffer containing phosphoenolpyruvate intersecting lines in double reciprocal plots of initial velocity data at substrate concentrations in the micromolar range suggest a sequential mechanism withcatalyzed RP inhibition studies specify an ordered sequential bibi mechanism with a deadend ep complex the feedback inhibitor IMT at concentrations above mum exhibits MK-801 inhibition with respect to erythrosep and competitive inhibition with respect to the other ATP penolpyruvate in addition tyrosine at concentrations of at least mum causes an alteration of one or more than one kinetic parameter of the enzyme
1882,sweetness is an important taste sensation to humans the absence of suitable sweeteners as alternatives to cyclamates and saccharin has led to a renewed interest in sweeteners form NK sources a brief review of the history of sweetener usage provides a basis for understanding our present heavy consumption of sweet substances the structure of naturallyoccurring compounds possessing a sweet taste range from simple sugars to complex intensely sweet proteins the structural types include monoterpenes diterpenes triterpenes flavonoids steroid saponins dipeptides and proteins some of these substances are not strictlyspeaking natural but are derived from NK sources by relatively minor chemical modification the properties of two nonsweet substances miraculin and gymnemic acid are included because of their close relationship to the subject of sweeteners miraculin causes sour substances to taste sweet and gymnemic acid selectively blocks sweet taste perception the second part of the paper presents some of the work on monellin the intensely sweet protein from serendipity berries dioscoreophyllum cumminsii the physicochemical studies of monellin provide convincing evidence that it is indeed a protein structural studies using denaturants and TPS chemical modifications have provided a beginning of our understanding of the molecular basis of the sweet taste of monellin
1883,beef kidney hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase has been purified to homogeneity it is a single subunit protein of mr with a frictional coefficient ff of about the enzyme readily aggregates to form apparently inactive higher molecular weight oligomers the very rapid loss of CEA during the assay was analyzed extensively it was found to be due to inactivation of the enzyme by the substrate hydroxyanthranilate and unrelated to enzyme turnover or oxidation of bound iron the loss of activity was shown to be a first order decay process and methods are given for obtaining accurate initial reaction rates under all conditions evidence was presented that the enzyme assumes a catalytically inactive conformation at ph which only relatively slowly rearranges to an active form at ph the rearrangement can be blocked by the presence of substrate we have found that fe which is required for enzymatic activity can equilibrate freely albeit slowly with the enzyme during the course of the enzyme reaction even in the presence of saturating hydroxanthranilate under assay conditons the fe has an apparent KB of mm the kinetic properties of the enzyme were found to be dramatically different in betabetadimethylglutarate buffer and collidine buffer both the rate of loss of activity during the assay and the substrate km and vmax were affected
1884,the location of td phageinduced DHF reductase dfr has been determined in IN and incomplete phage particles it has been found that phage mutants inducing a temperaturesensitive dfr dfrts procude heatlabile phage particles the structural dfr produced by these ts mutants was shown to assume different configurations depending on the temperature at which the phage is assembled morphogenesis of incomplete phage particles lacking the gene protein on their baseplates was found to be inhibited by reagents IB to dfr such as antibodies to dfr further cofactor molecules for dfr such as reduced nicotinamide adenine CpG phosphate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide also inhibited the step in morphogenesis involving the addition of gene product on the other hand inhibitors of dfr such as adenosine dephosphoribose stimulated the addition of the gene protein it has been concluded that the phageinduced dfr is a baseplate component which is partially covered by the gene protein the properties of phage particles produced after infection of the nonpermissive host with the one known td mutant containing a nonsense mutation in its dfr gene suggested that these progeny particles contained a partial polypeptide which was C1 enough to serve as a structural element
1885,HP enzymes from alcaligenes eutrophus h were used for kinetic studies chorismate mutase was feedback inhibited by phenylalanine in the absence of the inhibitor the doublereciprocal plot was linear yielding a km for chorismate of mm when phenylalanine was present a pronounced deviation from the michaelismenten hyperbola occurred the hill coefficient n was and hill plots of velocity versus inhibitor concentrations resulted in a value of n indicating positive cooperativity chorismate mutase was also inhibited by prephenate which caused downward doublereciprocal plots and a hill coefficient of n evidence for negative cooperativity the ph optimum of CM ranged from to its temperature optimum was c prephenate dehydratase was competitively inhibited by phenylalanine and activated by tyrosine tyrosine stimulated its activity up to fold and decreased the km for prephenate which was mm without effectors tryptophan inhibited the enzyme competitively its inhibition constant ki mum was almost fold higher than that determined for phenylalanine ki mum the ph optimum of prephenate dehydratase was ph the temperature optimum was c prephenate dehydrogenase was feedback inhibited by tyrosine inhibition was competitive with prephenate ki mm and noncompetitive with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide the enzyme was further subject to product inhibition by phydroxyphenylpyruvate ki mm its km for prephenate was mm and that for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide was mm the ph optimum ranged between and the temperature optimum was c it is shown how the sensitive regulation of the entire enzyme system leads to a wellbalanced amino acid production
1886,phosphorylation of naitreated bovine brain SC microsomes by inorganic phosphate in the presence of mg and ouabain has been studied at degrees c ph and degrees c ph nearly maximal and halfmaximal phosphorylation are achieved at degrees c within min with and mum pi respectively and at degrees c within s with and mum pi respectively maximal phosphorylation yields pmol p mg protein without ouabain degrees c ph less than of the incorporation observed in the presence of ouabain is reached preincubation of the native microsomes with mg and k in order to decompose possibly present highenergy phosphorylbonds prior to ouabain treatment does not affect the maximal phosphate incorporation this indicates that the inorganic phosphate incorporation is not due to an exchange with highenergy phosphorylbonds which might have been preserved in the microsomal preparations phosphorylation of the native microsomes by atp in the presence of mg and na reaches and maximal C2 within s at degrees c and ph at concentrations of gammapatp of and mum respectively the maximal phosphorylation level is pmol pmg protein equal to that of ouabaintreated microsomes phosphorylated by inorganic phosphate both inorganic phosphate and atp phosphorylate on site per active enzyme subunit of molecular weight from the equilibrium constants for the phosphorylation of ouabaintreated microsomes by inorganic phosphate at degrees c and degrees c standard freeenergy changes of and kcalmol respectively are calculated these values yield a standard enthalpy NC of kcalmol and an entropy change of calmol degree k this characterizes the reaction as a process driven by an entropy change the intermediate formed by phosphorylation with pi has maximal stability at acidic ph as is the case for the intermediate formed with atp CMS in sodium dodecyl sulfate stabilizes the phosphorylbond in the ph range of the nonsolubilized preparation has optimal stability at ph the level of which is equal to that of detergentsolubilized intermediate sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the microsomes at ph following incorporation of pi yields protein bands only one of which mol wt carries the radioactive label this protein has the same molecular weight as the protein which is phosphorylated by atp in the presence of mg and na
1887,ecologic studies of venezuelan encephalitis ve virus at a marsh habitat near the epicenter of the outbreak in guatemala revealed that the virus was enzootic there ve virus was isolated yearly during from sentinel hamsters exposed during the rainy seasons and from mosquitoes collected during july and august hamsters yielded strains of ve virus and virus was detected within km of the edge of the marsh in its interior and at its western extreme km from the CE T0 site at la avellana one strain of virus came from a hamster that died in the dry season of january culex mosquitoes yielded strains of ve virus and mansonia and aedes one each culex melanoconion and aedes taeniorhynchus were most prevalent near the marsh hemagglutinationinhitibion hi and neutralization antibody tests of sera showed that wild terrestrial mammals opossums and rodents humans and dogs but not wild birds were frequently INF seven of susceptible residents of villages at the edge of the marsh developed antibodies without PS during an month period between september and february only of sentinel rabbits and none of sentinel chickens developed ve hi antibody during augustseptember a period when virus activity was readily detected by the use of sentinel hamsters five strains of group c arbovirus one identified as nepuyo were recovered from sentinel hamsters during to and one strain of nepuyo virus was isolated from the blood of a person with a febrile illness during two strains of patois group arboviruses were isolated from culex mosquitoes during
1888,the isolated skin of rana pipiens was found to be a suitable model for the quantitative T0 of chromatophore beta adrenergic receptors uninfluenced by prejunctional phenomena cumulative concentrationresponse curves for adrenergic agonists were obtained in S9 in which ERP alpha adrenergic blockade had been produced with phenoxybenzamine the beta adrenergic agonists darkened the preparation as did melanocytestimulating hormone but the maximum effects differed the maximum of the lisoproterenol cumulative CR curve was approximately less than that of melanocytestimulating hormone while the maxima for lepinephrine and lnorepinephrine were significantly less than that for isoproterenol microscopic examination revealed a qualitative difference while maximal darkening produced by melanocytestimulating hormone was associated with maximal changes in both interspot melanophores and iridophores maximal adrenergicinduced darkening was associated with maximal iridophore granule concentration only no qualitative differences could be observed in the darkening caused by the three adrenergic agonists the beta adrenergic potencies of lnorepinephrine and lisoproterenol relative to lepinephrine were determined by fourpoint bioassay isoproterenol was found to be times as potent as EN while norepinephrine was times as potent similarly antagonism of isoproterenolinduced darkening of phenoxybenzaminepretreated skin samples by the beta adrenergic blocking agents dlpropranolol dlsotalol dlpractolol lbutoxamine and dbutoxamine was studied and their kb and pa values respectively were found to be dlpropranolol x m dlsotalol x m lbutoxamine x m dlpractolol x m dbutoxamine no activity comparison of the potency ratios and pa values cited above with similar parameters obtained by other investigators in several mammalian tissues suggests that there is wide variation among beta adrenergic receptors
1889,bacillus circulans wl when grown in a mineral medium with yeast cell walls or yeast glucan as the soli carbon source produced five betaglucanases two beta leads to glucanases i and ii which are lytic to yeast cell walls were isolated from the culture liquid by batch adsorption on yeast glucan and separated by chromatography on hydroxylapatite lytic beta leads to glucanase i was further purified by carboxymethylcellulose chromatography the TPS activity of lytic beta leads to glucanase i on laminarin was u per mg of protein the enzyme moved as a single protein with a molecular weight of during sodium dodecylsulfate electrophoresis in slab gels it was specific for the beta leads to glucosidic bond but the enzyme did not hydrolyze laminaribiose hydrolysis of laminarin went through a series of oligosaccharides and laminaribiose and gl accumulated till the end of the reaction a small amount of gentibiose was also produced from laminarin products from yeast cell walls and yeast glucan included laminaripentaose laminaritriose laminaribiose glucose and gentiobiose but no laminaritetraose was detected this glucanase has an optimum ph of
1890,the cephalopod retina contains two kinds of photopigments rhodopsin and retinochrome for many years retinochrome has been thought to be localized in the inner segments of the visual cells whereas rhodopsin is in the outer segments however it is now clear that retinochrome can be extracted also from fragments of outer segments in the darkadapted retina of loligo pealei retinochrome is distributed halfandhalf in the inner and outer segments todarodes pacificus contains much more retinochrome than loligo and it is more abundant in the outer than in the inner segments the outer segments of loligo contain retinochrome and metarhodopsin in addition to rhodopsin whether squids are kept in the dark or in the CS but there is extremely little metarhodopsin about of rhodopsin even in lightadapted eyes the inner segments contain only retinochrome and much less in the light than in the dark on the other hand retinochrome in the outer segments increases markedly during light adaptation these facts suggest the possibility that some retinochrome moves forward from the inner to the outer segments during CS adaptation and there reacts with metarhodopsin to promote regeneration of rhodopsin
1891,effects of kinds of parasympatholytic drugs timepidiumbromide hyoscinenbutylbromide and prifiniumbromide and PL PSS on the gastrointestinal tract were evaluated roentgenographically by double blind technique in a total of male human subjects the results may briefly be summarized as follows there were significant differences on hypotonic rate being one of the indexes of the gastric tonus between timepidiumbromide and placebo the effects of experimental drugs were significantly high as compared with that of PL on peristaltic movement of the stomach the effect of timepidiumbromide was significantly different from that of placebo on the site of arrival of barium the comparison of degrees of the gastric tonus between main and control tests revealed that the effect of PL obtained in the main test was significantly inferior to that of hyoscinenbutylbromide obtained in the control test whereas there existed no significant differences of the effects among AS drugs effects of each drug on the gastric tonus which was scored by hypertonic normotonic and hypotonic state were evaluated by stratification the result showed that the effect of timepidiumbromide was significantly greater than that of PL all active drugs were not significantly different in terms of observed values each on the gastric form
1892,the rapid and sensitive assay of betabetahandrogen aromatization by measurement of ho PR thompson ea jr and siiteri pk j biol chem has been analyzed to determine its applicability to initial rate studies it was found that aromatization is the sole reaction catalyzed by lyophilized placental microsomes that causes a loss of tritium from position or of androstenedione and testosterone 3H is however removed from position of the estrogen products presumably in hydroxylation but this does not invalidate use of the assay for initial rate measurements it was therefore used to characterize the catalytic properties of aromatase aromatization by the freezedried preparation was stimulated by k edta and dithiothreitol and was maximally active at ph to with incubation conditions optimized for these factors the apparent km for nadph is approximately mum the maximum velocity of androstenedione aromatization exceeds that of testosterone and the affinity of the substrate binding site is higher for the former substrate the apparent km values being mum and mum respectively mutual competition experiments with the androgen substrates showed that each gives simple competitive inhibition of the others aromatization furthermore the apparent ki values for each are in close PA with their respective km values androsttrienedione competitively inhibits the aromatization of both androstenedione and testosterone the apparent ki in both cases being mum it is concluded that the two androgen substrates are aromatized at a single MZ site
1893,under anaerobic conditions at low ph and degrees commercial bakers yeast loses k ion in the presence of salicylic acid glucose utilization is inhibited in suspensions containing no glucose carbohydrate stores of the cell are dissimilated to carbon dioxide and alcohol the ion loss and inhibitory effects of salicylic acid on gl utilization are reversed by washing the cells free of salicylate the loss of k appears to be due at least partly to a kh exchange process an unexplained maximum is seen in the curves of either net k loss or k efflux versus salicylic acid concentration at degrees the effects of salicylic acid on both endogenous metabolism and net k loss are minimal furthermore no maximum is seen in the k losssalicyclic concentration curve at this temperature it is generalized that salicylic acid or salicylate may elicit k leakage from many types of cells ie a fundamental action of this compound may be its ability to affect reduce k content of the cell furthermore it appears that the salicylate effects on k loss may be associated in an asyetunknown manner with the metabolic effects of this compound the effects of salicylate on k loss in yeast may not be unique for this compound since no experiments of this nature have been done with other penetrating undissociated acids
1894,the kinetics of the hydrogendeuterium exchange reaction in a subtilisin inhibitor from streptomyces albogriseolus has been examined by infrared absorption measurement in AQ solutions at various ph values and temperatures in the analysis of each piece of kinetic data it was assumed that the total peptide hydrogen atoms are classified into three kinetic classes a b and b and that the sizes of these classes are and respectively at every ph and at every temperature examined on the basis of the peak position determined for the amide ii band in each stage of the exchange reaction an approximate assignment was suggested of the a b and b respectively to an unordered structure a betastructureand an alphahelical structure in the molecule this assignment was supported by infrared absorption measurement of a film of this protein and by circular dichroic study of the solutions on the basis of the temperature effect on the hydrogenexchange rate constants and on the basis of ultraviolet absorption T0 in the higher temperature region to degrees c a discussion has been made on the nature of the fluctuation of the molecular structure of this protein
1895,digestion of human subcomponent cq with pepsin at ph for h at degrees c fragmented most of the noncollagenlike amino acid sequences in the molecule to small MMP whereas the entire regions of collagenlike sequence that comprised by weight of the subcomponent cq were left intact the collagenlike fraction of the digest was eluted in the void volume of a sephadex g column was was showm to be composed of two major fragments when examined by electrophoresis on PAGE run in buffers containing sodium dodecyl sulphate these fragments were separated on cmcellulose at ph in buffers containing murea human subcomponent cq on reduction and alkylation yields equimolar amounnts of three chains which have been designated a b and c reid et al biochem j one of the pepsin fragments was shown to be composed of the NT residues of the a chain linked via residue a by a single disulphide bond to a residue in the sequence bb in the NT residues of the b chain the second pepsin fragment was shown to be composed of a disulphidelinked dimer of the NT residues of the c chain the only disulphide bond being located at residue c the mol wts of the unoxidized and Ox pepsin fragments were estimated from their CAA compositions to be and for the ab and cc dimers and and for the collagenlike fragments of the a b and c chains respectively estimation of the molecular weights of the peptic fragments by polyacrylamidegel PACE run in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate gave values that were approx higher than expected from the CAA sequence data this is probably due to the high collagenlike sequence content of these fragments
1896,the stability of oxyhemoglobin s during mechanical shaking was enhanced by the addition of human SS albumin the stabilizing effect was maximum when the concentration of serum albumin approached that of oxyhemoglobin suggesting a molecular level interaction between them the effects of serum Al on oxyhemoglobin a were essentially similar to those on oxyhemoglobin s deoxy and methemoglobins were also stabilized by serum albumin the addition of human serum albumin to a solution containing sickle cell oxyhemoglobin slowly formed a compound which had an absorbance peak at nm after purification by sephadex g column chromatography this compound was identified as methemalbumin comparison of the rates of formation of methemalbumin from hemoglobin with various ligand states and human serum albumin showed that the rate of formation from hemichrome was much faster than from met oxy and deoxyhemoglobin about of the heme was transferred from hemichrome to Al when the mixture was kept standing at room temperature for min in contrast to only from methemoglobin this result suggests that hemichrome rather than methemoglobin is the intermediate in the formation of methemalbumin from oxyhemoglobin and human serum albumin this hypothesis is supported by the finding that the rate of formation of methemalbumin was faster at alkaline ph values than at acid ph values serum albumin from various animal sources showed different stabilizing effects the formation of methemalbumin from these animal albumins was far less than that from human albumin
1897,the intercalative trypanosomal drug ethidium bromide forms a crystalline complex with the dinucleoside monophosphate iodiuridylyladenosine iodoupa these crystals are monoclinic space group c with unit cell dimensions a nm b nm c nm beta degrees the structure has been solved to atomic resolution by patterson and fourier methods and refined by full matrix least squares to a residual of on observed reflexions the asymmetric unit contains two ethidium molecules two iodoupa molecules twenty water molecules and four methanol molecules a total of atims excluding hydrogens the two iodoupa molecules are held together by adenineuracil WC basepairing adjacent basepairs within this paired iodoupa structure and between neighbouring iodoupa molecules in adjoining unit cells are separated by nm this separation results from intercalative binding by one ethidium molecule and stacking by the other symmetry is utilized in this MM drubnucleic acid interaction the intercalative ethidium molecule being oriented such that its phenyl and ethyl CG lie in the narrow groove of the miniature nucleic acid double helix solution studies have indicated a marked sequence specificity for ethidiumdinucleotide interactions and a probable structural explanation for this has been provided by this study
1898,the question of ph or flow dependence for the renal elimination of procainamide pca was studied under conditions in each of subjects each subject received mg of pca intravenously at weekly intervals while in a state of acid load nhcl and water deprivation acid load and water excess alkali load nahco and WD and alkali load and water excess plasma and urine were collected at frequent intervals for pca and nacetyl pca napa analysis urine flow rates varied markedly between the WD and water excess states approximately vs mlmin respectively and urine ph varied markedly between the acid and alkali load states ph ca vs respectively despite this marked R2 there were no significant changes in pca renal clearance or hr pca or napa excretion if passive DWI of pca were taking place such flow and ph changes would have caused marked changes in pca clearance were the ph partition hypothesis true we therefore conclude that passive diffusion is not an important mechanism in the renal elimination of pca in man and that there must be tubular secretion the implication for the clinical use of the drug is that dose adjustments need not be made in response to variations in urine flow and ph
1899,imidazole catalysis of phenylalanyl transfer from phenylalanine adenylate anhydride to the hydroxyl groups of homopolyribonucleotides was investigated as a chemical model of the biochemical aminoacylation of trna imidazole catalyzed transfer of phenylalanine to polyu increases from ph to and decreases above ph at ph approximately of the phenylalanyl residues are transferred to polyu at ph transfer to polyu was five times as great as to polya and transfer to a polya polyu double helix was negligible at ph approximately mole percent linkages to polyu were monomeric phenylalanine the remainder of the linkages were peptides of phenylalanine the number of linkages and their lability to base and neutral hydroxylamine indicates that phenylalanine and its peptides are attached as esters to the hydroxyl groups throughout polyu and the hydroxyl CG at the terminus of polyu these results do model the contemporary process of aminoacyl transfer to trna and continue to suggest that a histidine residue is in the active site of aminoacyltrnasynthetases
1900,a new in vitro preparation the isolated lung strip of the cat is described for investigating the direct effect of drugs on the smooth muscle of the peripheral airways of the lung the preparation comprises a thin strip of lung parenchyma which can be mounted in a conventional organ bath for isometric tension recording its pharmacological responses have been characterized and compared with the isolated tracheal preparation of the cat the lung strip exhibited an intrinsic tone which was relaxed by catecholamines aminophylline and flufenamate it was contracted strongly by histamine prostaglandin falpha acetylcholine compound potassium depolarizing solution and alternating current field stimulation in contrast the cat trachea was unresponsive to histamine and prostaglandin falpha and did not exhibit an intrinsic tone isoprenaline and adrenaline were much more potent in relaxing the lung strip than the tr the potency order of relaxation responses to isoprenaline adrenaline and noradrenaline in the lung strip was isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline but in the trachea was isoprenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than or equal to adrenaline betaadrenoceptor selective agonists salbutamol and terbutaline were more potent in the lung strip than the trachea suggesting betaadrenoceptors predominated in the lung strip propranolol was equipotent in inhibiting isoprenaline relexations of the lung strip and trachea whereas practolol was much less effective in inhibiting lung strip than trachea further supporting a predominance of betaadrenoceptors in lung strip and betaadrenoceptors in trachea strong schultzdale type contractions were elicited in both lung strips and trachea by ascaris lumbricoides antigen in actively sensitized cats the initial phase of the contractile response of the lung strip following challenge was shown to be due to histamine release and was absent in the tr the delayed phase of the contraction which took several T2 to develop in both the mepyraminetreated lung strip and trachea was not due to prostaglandins e falpha or bradykinin the probable mediator being slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis srsa it is concluded that the isolated lung strip of the cat is useful as an in vitro model for investigating the effect of drugs on the smooth muscle of the peripheral airways of the lungs
1901,kinetic analyses of monoanion inhibition and cl nuclear magnetic resonance at mhz were employed to study monoanion interactions with the zinc metalloenzyme renal dipeptidase the enzymecatalyzed hydrolysis of glycyldehydrophenylalanine exhibited competitive inhibition when the reaction rate was determined in the presence of the monovalent anions fluoride chloride bromide iodide azide nitrate or thiocyanate or upon the addition of the divalent anion sulfate competitive inhibition was produced by these anions one anion was bound per enzyme molecule and except in the case of fluoride all of the anions appeared to bind at the same site cyanide ion produced a much more ERP inhibition of renal dipeptidase than the other monoanions and it was shown that two cyanide ions were bound per enzyme molecule an investigation of the effect of ph upon monoanion inhibition suggested that the anion inhibitors bind to the group with a pk of approximately complete dissociation of this group approximately ph eliminates the GABA effect of anions the cl L1 broadening produced by renal dipeptidase in m nacl solutions was times more effective than that produced by equivalent concentrations of aquozincii the line broadening was dependent upon the concentration of the metalloenzyme and independent of the frequency of the exciting radiation when zinc ion was removed from the metalloenzyme by dialysis or when chloride was titrated from the metalloenzyme by cyanide line broadening was decreased treatment of renal dipeptidase with saturating concentrations of the competitive inhibitor guanosine triphosphate in the presence of m nacl also produced a significant decrease in the cl L1 width the cl L1 broadening produced by renal dipeptidase was shown to decrease with increasing ph through the range ph this linewidth variation with ph appeared to result from the titration of a site on the metalloprotein with an approximate pk of temperature studies of cl L1 broadening by the metalloenzyme in the presence of chloride and cyanide inhibitors suggest that the fast exchange process pertains and that the dominant EC50 mechanism is quadrupolar in nature
1902,contradictory views have been expressed about the role of the various antisperm antibodies which develop after vasoligation the present T0 was conducted in normal fertile males vasectomized subjects and subjects T3 recanalization of their vas deferens in order to investigate the development of various antisperm antibodies after vasectomy along with their incidence their persistence after successful relief of vasoobstruction by vasovasostomy and their role in the causation of infertility in vasoanatomized normospermia males sperm agglutinating immobilizing and haemagglutinating antibodies showed rises in titres with increase during the postvasectomy period indicating continuous antigenic stimulus age postoperative complications and blood group did not seem to alter the results of subjects developed antisperm agglutinins mostly tailtotail type years after vasoligation while only of fertile men had circulating spermagglutinins a lower incidence of positive sperm in the immobilization test than in the agglutination test suggests either that different antibodies are detected by these two tests or these tests have differing sensitivities of the vasovasostomized subject cases became normospermic and oligospermic while remained azoospermics except for oligospermic subjects all had circulating spermagglutinins among the normospermic vasovasostomized persons a significant rho was found between the titres of circulating antisperm agglutinins and autoagglutination of spermatozoa in their ejaculates and also between the sperm immobilization values of their sera and the degree of their sperm motility three normospermic recanalized men having low levels of sperm agglutinins and haemagglutinins with normal seminogram and no sperm immobilizing antibody successfully impregnated their wives another vasovasotomized infertile subjects had sperm agglutinins in significant titre showed positive sperm immobilization values a similar number showed autoagglutination of sperm while a decreased degree of motility of sperms was noted in cases thus there was a significant rho between the titres of antisperm antibodies and autoagglutination of spermatozoa which might be an important cause of male infertility T3 successful anatomic relief of vasoobstruction histological studies of testicular biopsy showed normal spermatogenesis in azoospermic recanalized subjects although they had high levels of antisperm antibodies this suggests that these antibodies do not affect normal spermatogenesis and sperm counts
1903,a shortage of Rh monkeys for use in drug toxicity studies has made it necessary to search for a potential replacement species in the event that one should be needed in the near future to this end parameters of drug metabolism in hepatic microsomal and soluble fractions were examined in preparations from AD male and female rhesus monkeys squirrel monkeys hanford miniature pigs common tree shrews and spraguedawley rats model substrates were utilized and comparisons were made on a quantitative basis all species tested demonstrated activity in all but one test CA and all showed some similarity to the rhesus none of the species however was totally comparable to the rhesus in drugmetabolizing ability the squirrel monkey showed the least similarity to the rhesus and the miniature pig was the most similar with the exception of the expected differences in the rat the tree shrew demonstrated the only sex difference in drug metabolism the enzyme activities of females being higher than the male in several pathways the data suggest that any of the four species tested could be a suitable replacement for the rhesus in studies of drug metabolism in vitro
1904,beta adrenergic receptor antagonists beta blockers differ greatly in their cardioselectivity and ISA and these differences may have important therapeutic consequences we have therefore studied the effect on blood pressure heart rate and plasma renin activity of the beta blocking drug oxprenolol trasicor which has considerable intrinsic sympathomimetic activity both alone and in combination with the benzothiadiazine cyclopenthiazide eleven patients with mild to moderate benign essential hypertension were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups oxprenolol was given as the first drug to group and cyclopenthiazide as the first drug to group the patients were assessed before the start of treatment T3 to weeks of treatment with one drug and T3 a further to weeks of treatment with both drugs heart rate blood pressure and plasma renin activity were measured with the patients recumbent and T3 a standardized tilt to degrees to provide a reflection of day to day cardiovascular AS oxprenolol reduced arterial blood pressure without inducing significant bradycardia the addition of cyclopenthiazide had little further effect oxprenolol alone suppressed plasma renin activity both at rest and during tilt and also abolished the increase in plasma renin activity C2 of cyclopenthiazide the combination of moderate reduction of blood pressure inhibition of the otherwise inevitable increase in plasma renin activity with the use of a diuretic drug and only moderate inhibition of overall sympathetic activity indicates that it is possible to achieve physiologic balance with the appropriate beta blocking drug
1905,the proliferation of transplanted mu haematopoietic cells derived from the femoral bone marrow of young adults and from the liver on the sixteenth day of gestation has been compared under standardized conditions suspensions of bone marrow cells contained cfu per cells sm and suspensions of fetal liver cells contained cfu per cells slslsm the mean diameter of colonies established by cells derived from bone marrow was mm established mean volume vm mm and the mean diameter of colonies established by cells derived from fetal liver was mm estimated mean volume vl mm vlvm the relationship between the weight of the SP and the number of bone marrow cells injected into lethally irradiated recipients days previously has been confirmed and a similar relationship between the weight of the spleen and the number of fetal CL cells injected has been demonstrated an arbitrarily defined difference of mg between the weight of the spleen in untreated irradiated controls and the weight of the spleen in irradiated recipients of haematopoietic cells has been observed days after the administration of x bone marrow cells dm or x FL cells dl dmdl the calculated values of dmdl relative proliferative capacity slsm relative SC content and vlvm relative clone size are in good agreement with the values estimated using the equation dmdl slsm x vlvm
1906,an lasparaginase has been purified some fold from extracts of klebsiella aerogenes to near homogeneity the enzyme has a molecular weight of as measured by gel filtration and appears to consist of four subunits of molecular weight the enzyme has high affinity for lasparagine with a km below m and hydrolyzes glutamine at a fold lower rate with a km of m interestingly the enzyme exhibits marked gammaglutamyltransferase activity but comparatively little betaaspartyltransferase activity a mutant CS lacking this asparaginase has been isolated and grows at to the rate of the parent strain when asparagine is provided in the medium as the sole source of nitrogen this strain grows as well as the wild type when the medium is supplemented with histidine or ammonia glutamine synthetase activates the formation of lasparaginase mutants lacking glutamine synthetase fail to produce the asparaginase and mutants with a high constitutive level of glutamine synthetase also contain the asparaginase at a high level thus the formation of ASP is regulated in parallel with that of other enzymes capable of supplying the cell with ammonia or glutamate such as histidase and proline oxidase formation of the asparaginase does not require induction by asparaginase and is not subject to catabolite repression
1907,crude cell membrane fractions from a number of tissues can form acidic glycolipids the formation of acidic galactose lipid and mannose lipid was greatly reduced in VAD primarily in tissues known to be mucusproducing mouse mastocytoma tissue was active in forming acidic galactose lipids with udpgalactose as substrate one of the products was identified as retinylphosphate galactose the synthetase reaction producing this compound exhibited an apparent ph optimum at the presence of detergent and retinol stimulated the synthetase reaction which exhibited an absolute requirement for mn or mg the synthetase reaction was readily reversible incubation of particulate enzyme with retinylphosphate galactose and udp yielded udpgalactose and a compound tentatively identified as retinylphosphate the galactose lipid was isolated by column chromatography on deaecellulose and silica gel the retinylphosphate galactose was homogeneous when examined by thin SL chromatography mild acid hydrolysis of labeled retinylphosphate Gal yields cgalactose whereas ALP hydrolysis and hydrogenolysis produced cgalactose phosphate retinylphosphate galactose bound to vitamin adepleted retinolbinding protein
1908,the activities of nadphdependent oxidative demethylation of aminopyrine and other methyl compounds in the CL microsomes from dystrophic mice were found to be about higher than those of the normal mice consumption of reduced pyridine nucleotides during the demethylation reactions was also significantly larger in the dystrophic mouse system than in the normal mouse system the synergistic effect of further addition of nadh on the oxidative demethylation in the reaction system with nadph however was not significant in either the normal or the dystrophic mouse system the activities of nadphcytochrome c reductase and lipid peroxidation were also higher by about in the dystrophic mouse than in the normal mouse but the contents of cytochrome p and phospholipids in the CL microsomes from normal and dystrophic mice were not appreciably different the results suggest the possibility that the progressive muscular dystrophy may involve abnormal features in not only muscle but also liver and other tissues
1909,acetylsecohemicholinium no achc the acetate of the open ring seco form of hemicholinium no hc hydrolyzes in vitro to the hemiacetal hc at ph values above a temperaturedependent conversion illustrated by ultraviolet spectral shifts from to mmu and to a limited extent by certain esterases as measured by manometric analysis an ld of mugkg for a neutral solution of achc was decreased to mugkg the ld of hc upon being made basic prolonged treatment of mice with ld doses of achc was associated with decreased FAO in the liver and resulted in infiltration of fat into hepatic cells a reaction preventable by treatment with small doses of choline mgkg achc causes NM and autonomic ganglionic blockade cholinesterase inhibition and in vitro inhibition of acetylcholine ach synthesis these actions although hclike appear to be due to achc rather than hc since neither cholinesterase inhibition nor hepatic ligation altered the NM blocking actions of achc in addition to its hclike properties achc consistently produced a transient increase in twitch height of GM before blockade and was doseresponsive in depressing blood pressure and in eliciting contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum achc is both a cholinomimetic depresses arterial blood pressure decreases HR rate and increases ileal contractions and a competitor of acetylcholine that is in most preparations tested achc at lower concentrations has as much intrinsic activity as ach and at somewhat higher concentrations competitively blocks the responses to ach these cholinomimetic actions may be due to the presence of two ach moieties on the achc molecule which attach to cholinergic receptor sites also noted was an action of achc that seems to be peculiar to the secohemicholiniums namely the potentiation of catechloamines
1910,the pnitrophenyl betadgalactosidase asctivity in rat liver homogenates of lysosomerich fractions was shown to be markedly affected by the ionic composition of the medium a stimulation of the reaction rate at ph was produced by most of the salts tested which contained anions such as acetate so and cl and cations such as na k and mg the most pronounced effect was observed with mgcl only potassium glutamate was GABA five peaks of betagalactosidase activity obtained by deaecellulose chromatography were equally sensitive to changes in the ionic composition of the medium in the presence of added nac the whole rateph curve was displaced towards higher ph values the optimum being shifted from to the stimulation at ph appeared to be mainly due to changes in vmax whereas the apparent km was slightly modified unlike the total the free betagalactosidase activity remained unchanged or even declined when kc was added to the reaction medium
1911,intraperitoneal administration to rats of d or dlalphahydrazinoimidazolylpropionic acid was found to produce a substantial inactivation of hepatic histidine ammonialyase ec in vivo proportional to this loss in CEA was an impairment of the ability of treated rats to oxidize lringc histidine to co rats in which hepatic histidine ammonialyase activity was either depressed by dlhydrazinoimidazolylproprionic acid injection or elevated by feeding a HPD displayed proportionately altered rates of ho PR into plasma water following lh histidine administration plasma lhistidine clearance following loading with this CAA was similarly affected by these treatments administration of dlalphalhydrazinoimisazolylproprionic acid to rats was also found to inactivate nonspecifically pyridoxal phosphate enzymes in vivo pyridoxine injection was found to reverse the dlalphahydrazinoimidazolylproprionic acidinduced inactivation of hepatic aspartate aminotransferase ec in vivo but not that of hepatic histidine ammonialyase these findings demonstrate that histidine ammonialyase is the ratelimiting factor in lhistidine degradation in the rat the potential usefulness of dlhydrazinoimidazolylproprionic acid in the production of an animal model for histidinemia hereditary histidine ammonialyase deficiency is discussed
1912,the effects of chronic nicotine administration or mgkg sc twice daily were studied in IN and DNX rat adrenal PG to determine the relative roles of central input and direct actions on catecholamines catecholamine depletion was obtained in the intact glands from days of treatment with mgkg with REC by days of treatment catecholamines were not decreased in DNX adrenal glands catecholamine depletion was accompanied by a decline in PET storage LDV determined by hadrenaline uptake per gland in the intact side while no change was seen in the DNX side the proportion of newly synthesized vesicles increased markedly during days of treatment with mgkg in the intact side while a much smaller increase of shorter duration was seen in the denervated adrenal gland chronic nicotine administration at either dose level induced tyrosine hydroxylase in both IN and denervated glands but the increase occurred more slowly in the denervated glands dopamine betahydroxylase levels increased similarly in both sides during treatment with nicotine mgkg these studies suggest that although LT adrenal denervation eliminates the catecholamine depletion caused by chronic administration of nicotine the mechanisms for induction of catecholamine synthesizing enzymes are still capable of responding to the drug
1913,in normal boys unilateral and BL cryptorchids a gonadal CF test iu of hcg im each day for three days and assays of plasma testosterone and plasma oestradiolbeta before and after the hcg administration as well as an lhrh test were carried out in of the cases both normal and cryptorchid boys plasma oestradiolbeta both in basal conditions and T3 stimulus were found to be less than the sensitivity pgml of the method while the plasma testosterone was similar under basal conditions in the three groups of children T3 hcg it was significantly lower than the mean value of the control group only in the bilateral cryptorchids the testosterone levels both under basal conditions and T3 CS- are correlated to BA only in the normal boys and in the unilateral cryptorchids there were no significant differences among the various groups for either lh and fsh both under basal conditions and T3 lhrh the lh curve area during the lhrh test is in correlation with bone age only in the normal children
1914,tetrahymena pyriformis were grown in proteosepeptone medium and then washed and incubated in a dilute salt solution for one hour the cells were then discarded and the lysosomal hydrolases that had been secreted were subjected to deae cellulose column chromatography at least three isoenzymes of acid phosphatase three of acid protease and two of betanacetylhexoseaminidase were found as well as single peaks of alphamannosidase betagalactosidase and betafucosidase the latter two activities were not resolved by the deae column and could not be separated in a second chromatographic step on cmcellulose cells were also grown under identical conditions and homogenized in m sucrose in order to allow comparison of some of the intracellular lysosomal hydrolases with their secreted counterparts two lysosomal populations were resolved by sucrose density gradient sedimentation a heavy lysosomal fraction contered at a density of about gmcm and a CS lysosomal fraction centered at a density of about gmcm these two populations differed in that the CS lysosomes did not appear to contain significant amounts of betafucosidase betagalactosidase or acid protease whereas all six of the hydrolase activities studied were present in the heavy lysosomes the light lysosomal peak occurred in cells grown to transition phase but was markedly reduced in cells from cultures grown to stationary phase in addition to these two fractions a third very CS particle containing only alphamannosidase activity was detected just inside the gradient measurements were made of the effect of heat T2 at degrees and of a NC in ph from standard CA condition to on the three acid phosphatases and two betanacetylhexoseaminidase isoenzymes resolved by deae column chromatography of the secreted hydrolases and on these hydrolyases in the heavy and CS lysosomal fractions on the sucrose gradient use of the thermostability and ph criteria permitted computation of the expected properties of the intralysosomal acid phosphatase and hexoseaminidase activities if these consisted of the respective isoenzymes in the proportions secreted it was found that neither the intralysosomal acid phosphatase nor the intralysosomal hexoseaminidase had the properties expected if they consisted of the secreted mixture of the respective isoenzymes indicating that modification of some of these isoenzymes may have occurred during the hour starvation period or after secretion
1915,patients with AD have abnormal autonomic responses of the arterioles pilomotor smooth muscle and SGs their lesions have been reported to contain increased amounts of the neurohumors acetylcholine and norepinephrine as well as increased activity of acetylcholinesterase and catecholomethyltransferase in vitro studies of epidermis show that beta adrenergic agonists fail to evoke the normal inhibition of mitosis of basal cells of patients with AD epidermis removed not only from the lesions but also from normalappearing skin responded abnormally the increase in intracellular levels of camp T3 exposure to catecholamines was similar in normal and atopic epidermis lymphocytes and pmn leukocytes isolated from patients with atopic dermatitis show both a decreased physiologic response glycogenolysis and inhibition of lysosome enzyme release and a decreased rise in intracellular levels of camp upon incubation with beta agonists but a normal response to pge cortisol increases the response of lymphocyte adenyl cyclase to both agonists and in the case of the patients with atopic disease more than overcomes the depressed response to beta agonists because the leukocytes respond normally to pge and because others have reported normal activities of skin and adenyl cyclase phosphodiesterase and protein kinases we conclude that the step responsible for the diminished beta adrenergic response lies antecedent to the catalytic site of adenyl cyclase
1916,g heavy walkercarcinoma bearing male spraguedawleyrats showed rapid tumour weight dependent loss of CL glycogen until CR depletion in tumour CG heavier than ganimal simultaneously the glycogen mobilization after massive glucagon stimulation was successivly diminished and finally abolished in different groups with increasing RT weight concomitantly the spontaneous and stimulated activity of liver phosphorylase a was found markedly reduced in advanced tumour cachexia the extent of stimulation of CL phosphorylase a activity by intracardial injections of epinephrine not being altered tumour induced inhibition of glycogen mobilization thus appears to have been excluded to account for the relative late pronounced hypoglycemia in peripherial rat blood in face of the early loss of CL glycogen accelerated gluconeogenesis has been postulated in accord with this spontaneous rise in liver TAT was found in tumour bearing rats along with a doubled maximal stimulation value after medrol injection as compared to control groups this behavior could not be shown for liver alanine aminotransferase and CL fructose diphosphatase the former showed no differences between control and tumour groups neither of spontaneous nor of stimulated activity the latter showed only a very reluctant rise after massive stimulation by triamcinolone for days in the control groups the tumour bearing groups showing no deviation from spontaneous control values
1917,this study was undertaken to establish the time CS of lipogenic changes in AT of rats when converted from ad libitum feeding to mealeating rats were fed a high carbohydrate diet hoursday for to days mealeating the high speed supernatant fraction from homogenized epididymal fat pads was assayed for citrate cleavage enzyme acetyl coa carboxylase fatty acid synthetase and malic enzyme activities the effects of mealfeeding on in vitro and in vivo rates of fatty acid synthesis in adipose tissue as well as the amounts of glycogen deposited in the adipose tissue were measured during the first days of mealfeeding the lipogenic enzyme activities were actually decreased or unchanged in the mealfed rats but during this time the in vitro and in vivo rates of fatty acid synthesis were progressively increased in the mealfed rats glycogen C2 in the adipose tissue of mealfed rats were greater than the levels in the nibblers the initial hyperlipogenesis observed in the mealfed rat appears to be due to changes in ATP uptake by the AT andor to alterations in enzyme activation in the adipose tissue rather than to changes in the quantity of enzyme present in the tissue
1918,the effect of multiple oral administration of the hypocholesterolemic agent cholestyramine a strongly basic anionexchange resin on the metabolism of salicylazosulfapyridine by microflora present in the colon and cecum was assessed in conventional rats by following the time course of salicylazosulfapyridine and its metabolites in the urine and feces the intestinal metabolism of salicylazosulfapyridine a single mgkg oral dose which involves reduction of the azo linkage by bacterial azo reductases and the liberation of SP and aminosalicylic acid potential active metabolites of the drug was markedly inhibited by the resin mgkg oral doses at and hours resulting in an enhanced fecal excretion of IN salicylazosulfapyridine the existence of a rankorder correlation between the in vitro IB of salicylazosulfapyridine sulfapyridine and aminosalicylic acid to the resin and their fecal excretion pattern in resintreated animals suggests that a direct cholestyraminesalicylazosulfapyridine interaction occurred within the intestinal tract and that in the bound state the azo bond of the drug was inaccessible to bacterial azo reductases these findings suggest that chronic p.o. of cholestyramine to patients with ulcerative colitis who are receiving salicylazosulfapyridine could result in a significant reduction in the absorption and metabolism of the drug and hence in its therapeutic efficacy
1919,a preparation of atpase from the CM of micrococcus lysodeikticus solubilized and more than pure showed two main bands in analytical polyacrylamide gel PACE they did not correspond to isoenzymes because one band could be converted into the other by exposure to a mildly ALP ph value the conversion was paralleled by changes in molecular weight circular dichroism and catalytic properties denaturation by ph at degrees c was followed by means of circular dichroism ultracentrifugation and PAGE a C1 conformational transition took place in the acid range with midpoints at about ph i m i m and i m the transition was irreversible strong aggregation of the protein occurred in this range of ph the final product was largely random coil but even at ph dissociation into individual subunits was not complete however partial dissociation took place at ph i m at this ph value the enzyme was inactive but of the activity could be recovered when the ph was returned to in the ALP region the midpoint of the transition occurred near ph i m the pk of most of the tyrosine residues of the protein was about the unfolding was irreversible and the protein was soon converted into peptide species with molecular weights lower than those determined for the subunits by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate conventional proteolysis did not account for the transformation
1920,calcium IB to adipocyte plasma membranes has been assessed by equilibrium dialysis and by MF techniques calcium binding was specific and saturable displaying two distinct classes of binding sites the affinity constants and maximum binding capacities in the presence of m kcl were x m and nmolmg of protein and x m and nmolmg for the high and low affinity sites respectively bound calcium was totally dissociated in the presence of excess calcium within min in two distinct phases corresponding to the two classes of sites association and dissociation rate constants for the high affinity sites were x ms and x s respectively free energy changes at degrees were kcal mol for the high affinity CS and kcal mol for the LA CS the high affinity CS demonstrated a ph optimum of whereas the IB to the low affinity sites progressively increased between ph and low concentrations of mgcl less than mum enhanced calcium binding slightly whereas high concentrations of kcl and mgcl were MK-801 inhibitors of calcium IB procaine and ruthenium red had no effect on calcium binding and lanthanum was a poor inhibitor of calcium IB this represents the first report of calcium binding to adipocyte plasma membranes and the first kinetic analysis of calcium binding to biological CM the specificity of this calciumbinding system in adipocyte plasma membranes suggests its importance in cellular bioregulation
1921,norepinephrine hne binding to the microsomal fraction of the rabbit aorta has been studied binding appears to increase linearly with time up to at least min shows no evidence of stereoselectivity and may be inhibited only by compounds possessing the catechol or methoxyhydroxyphenyl moieties with the latter being fold less effective hne binding is saturable with a km of x m and v max of pmolesmg protein a hill plot indicates that binding is noncooperative whereas a scatchard plot suggests that two sites may be present IB does not appear to require physiological concentrations of ca or mg and is inhibited significantly by edta and sodium metabisulfite in addition binding is markedly enhanced by low and high ph values this binding is also inhibited by sodium metabisulfite which suggests that an oxidized form of the catecholamine is the AS IB species experiments with several group specific reagents indicate that binding may require a free sulfhydryl group but not a carboxyl function the binding process requires an energy of activation of kcalmole whose magnitude may be partly explained with the aid of optical rotatory dispersion spectra by a nonstereoslective conformational change in protein structure induced by the amine the characteristics of the hne binding sites observed in the microsomal fractional of the rabbit aorta appear to be different from those expected if binding were to the adrenoreceptors a possible mechanism for catecholamine binding to free sulfhydryl groups on protein is presented
1922,the receptor of coliphage omega is the ospecific mannan of escherichia coli o in which the trisaccharide alphamannosylalphamannosylmannose is joined through alphamannosyllinkages coliphage omega produces an endoalphamannosidase which destroys the receptor liberating a series of oligosaccharides repeating trisaccharide and multiples the enzyme is an integral part of the phage particles and also occurs in a free form in the lysates phage particles hydrolyze alphamannosyl linkages in the lipopolysaccharide the polysaccharide mannan moiety and higher oligosaccharides with an efficiency decreasing in this order no transmannosylation could be detected phage particles also degrade the receptor mannan on whole bacteria as determined with clabeled e coli o the values of km and vmax were determined with omega particles and free enzymes using native lipopolysaccharide and its triethylammonium salt the latter which was obtained after ED has a micellar weight of x whereas the native lipopolysaccharide forms supermicelles with micellar weights of several millions with coliphage omega as enzyme and supermicellar lipopolysaccharide as substrate km x m was obtained this together with the fact that omega attaches irreversibly to e coli o was used in proposing a hypothesis for the possible role of the enzyme in the first steps of infection with coliphage omega
1923,treatment of submitochondrial particles etp with trypsin at degrees destroyed nadph leads to nad or acetylpyridine adenine CpG acpyad transhydrogenase activity NOX activity was unaffected nadph oxidase and nadh leads to acpyad transhydrogenase activities were diminished by less than when etp was incubated with trypsin at degrees nadph leads to nad transhydrogenase activity was rapidly lost nadph oxidase activity was slowly destroyed but NOX activity remained IN the reduction pattern by nadph nadph nad and nadh of chromophores absorbing at minus nm flavin and ironsulfur centers in complex i nadhubiquinone reductase or etp treated with trypsin at degrees also indicated TPS destruction of transhydrogenase activity the sensitivity of the nadph leads to nad transhydrogenase reaction to trypsin suggested the involvement of susceptible arginyl residues in the enzyme arginyl residues are considered to be positively charged binding sites for anionic substrates and ligands in many enzymes treatment of etp with the specific argininebinding reagent butanedione inhibited transhydrogenation from nadph leads to nad or acpyad it had no effect on nadh oxidation and inhibited nadph oxidation and nadh leads to acpyad transhydrogenation by only to even T3 to min incubation of etp with butanedione the inhibition of nadph leads to nad transhydrogenation was diminished considerably when butanedione was added to etp in the presence of nad or nadp when both nad and nadp were present the butanedione effect was completely abolished thus suggesting the possible presence of arginyl residues at the nucleotide binding site of the nadph leads to nad transhydrogenase enzyme under conditions that transhydrogenation from nadph to nad was completely inhibited by TR or butanedione nadph oxidation rate was larger than or equal to nmol min mg etp protein at ph and degrees the above results establish that in the respiratory chain of beefheart mitochondria nadh oxidation nadph oxidation and nadph leads to nad transhydrogenation are independent reactions
1924,the solubility of fatty acids in aqueous media containing bile salts alone and in admixture with either lecithin phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine was determined over the ph range the order of fatty acid solubility in aqueous solutions containing bile salts was linoleic greater than oleic greater than elaidic greater than palmitic greater than stearic the solubility of each fatty acid increased as the ph of the miceus solutions of bile salts greatly increased the solubility of palmitic acid and stearic acid in the presence of bile salts and lecithin the solubility of OA and elaidic acid decreased with increasing ph of the micellar solution indicating a competitive effect between the fatty acid anions and lecithin the solubility of linoleic acid increased linearly with lecithin concentration phosphatidylethanolamine as an additive to bile salts increased the solubility of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the ph range the effectiveness of phosphatidylethanolamine as an amphiphile was similar to that of lecithin although at ph fatty acid solubility was greater in the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine the significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the intestinal absorption of fatty acids in sheep
1925,the coupling of the TS acid protease ec of penicillium duponti k to ethylenemaleic acid linear copolymer in the presence of cyclohexylmorpholinoethylcarbodiimide at ph afforded a soluble enzyme derivative with a protein incorporation yield of under optimal conditions the protein content of the enzymepolymer complex the molecular weights of the reactants and the mean value of lysine residues per mol of enzyme found in NH linkage to the matrix support a structure consisting of two CP chains per mol of protease each chain acylating a single lysine residue of the enzyme the isoelectric point of the coupled enzyme was found to be a value lower than that measured on the free protease the TPS activity of the bound protease against casein at ph and degrees c was of that of the free enzyme and at degrees c increased to the increased size of the coupled enzyme resulted in an improved retention of activity by UF membranes over that observed with free protease alone or in admixture with ethylenemaleic acid copolymer a watersoluble coupled pepsin was prepared in yield on protein basis by using the aminoethylmonoamide of ethylenemaleic acid copolymer and the same watersoluble carbodiimide
1926,the NS of caenorhabditis elegans is arranged as a series of fibre bundles which run along internal hypodermal ridges most of the sensory integration takes place in a ring of nerve fibres which is wrapped round the pharynx in the head the body muscles in the head are innervated by motor neurones in this nerve ring while those in the lower part of the body are innervated by a set of motor neurones in a longitudinal fibre bundle which joins the nerve ring the ventral cord these motor neurones can be put into five classes on the basis of their morphology and synaptic input at any one point along the cord only one member from each class has neuromuscular junctions members of a given class are arranged in a regular linear CS in the cord and have nonoverlapping fields of motor synaptic activity the transition between fields of adjacent neurones being sharp and well defined members of a given class form gap junctions with neighbouring members of the same class but never to motor neurones of another class three of the motor neurone classes receive their synaptic input from a set of interneurones coming from the nerve ring these interneurones can in turn be grouped into four classes and each of three motor neurone classes receives its synaptic input from a unique combination of interneurone classes the possible developmental and functional significance of these observations is discussed
1927,a technique utilizing pregnant mares serum gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin treatment of hens gallus domesticus followed by manual ovulation of the excised follicles was developed to obtain a large number of mature ova the IN ova were used to test whether acrosin partially purified from the spermatozoa of the cock gallus domesticus partially purified rb testicular acrosin and commercial preparations of several hydrolytic enzymes could dissolve the inner vitelline membrane enzymes were applied to pieces of filter paper placed on the ovum cock acrosin and endopeptidases such as trypsin chymotrypsin MMP-8 and elastase hydrolyzed the membrane whereas exopeptidases such as LAP and carboxypeptidase a did not phospholipase a sulfatase hyaluronidase betaglucuronidase and rabbit testicular acrosin also failed to hydrolyze the membrane cock acrosin hydrolysis of the ovum surface was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor the surface of the ovum over the germinal disc region was hydrolyzed more quickly by cock acrosin than the surface over other regions of the ovum acrosin from cock sperm caused the PR of trichloroacetic acid soluble material absorbing at nm from sonicated preparations of inner vitelline membranes hydrolysis was greatest at ph and was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor
1928,rabbits or in each experiment were injected with the international pyrogen standard ipst in different seasons the maximum temperature rises were registered randomized and interpreted according to the requirements of the bp usp p hung and p nord although the dose of ng kg ipst proved to be nonpyrogenic as tested in summer when tested in winter the same dose was qualified pyrogenic to be rejected by up to one third of the combinations by the criteria of the four pharmacopoeias in the spring experiment to be rejected qualifications predominated as based on the response of large groups of rabbits exclusion of the rabbits showing low sensitivity before randomization barely influenced the results with ng kg ipst in the experiment in which the mean temperature rise was degrees if however the mean temperature rise was higher or degrees such a selection practically resulted in the disappearance of passable qualifications in the triplet groups and a great predominance of to be rejected qualifications in the larger CG the dose ng kg consistently proved to be pyrogenic in large groups of rabbits
1929,bacillus subtilis tryc thya thyb lysogenic for the phage dna polymerase negative mutant spo susl was induced under conditions preventing phage and bacterial dna synthesis the biological activity of dna from induced cells and from uninduced controls was assayed by transformation and transfection respectively about of the phage dna biological activity in dna extracted from induced cells was resistant to exposure to ph to this dna was operationally defined as alkaliresistant phage dna transforming bacterial dna from uninduced or induced cells and transfecting dna from uninduced cells were more than inactivated T3 exposure to high ph the alkaliresistant phage dna was characterized by sucrose gradient centrifugation by centrifugation in cesium chloridepropidium iodide and by electron microscopy it was found to consist of a majority of covalently closed circular dna molecules length measurements of a few relaxed circular molecules indicate a molecular weight of these similar to that previously found for mature spodna attempts to isolate similar covalently closed circular phage dna from induced bacteria lysogenic for spo phage with a functional dna polymerase gene were unsuccessful the gene order in mature and prophage spo was determined by rescue of single and double markers from the respective type of dna the data obtained show that prophage dna is genetically permuted relative to mature dna the phage attachment site is suggested to be located between genes i and j
1930,mn uptake in the chick chorioallantoic membrane an embryonic epithelial tissue which transports ca in vivo was studied using electron paramagnetic resonance epr mn was used as a paramagnetic analog for ca since there is evidence that mn is accumulated by the ca transport mechanism after h of uptake the epr spectrum of the mn in the membrane indicated that of the mn was in a spinexchange form indicating close packing of mn the mn spacing was estimated from the line width to be about a the remaining mn was very likely mn hexahydrate at ph the spinexchange spectrum tended to broaden when uptake was inhibited while at ph the spinexchange spectrum was CR abolished in the presence of inhibitors the epr spectrum of mn in the chorioallantoic membrane had a broader line width than that of mn in isolated mitochondria suggesting that in this tissue mitochondria are not directly involved in divalent cation transport these epr studies support the concept that divalent cations are sequestered in high concentrations from the rest of the cell contents during transcellular active transport
1931,the effect of metabolic and hypercapnic acidosis on MBF was studied during intravenous infusions of hydrochloric acid solutions n and during passive ventilation with co n in anaesthetized closed chest dogs below a ph of metabolic acidosis at normal arterial cotensions caused an increase of coronary blood flow and a decrease of coronary vascular resistance associated with a narrowed myocardial arteriovenous odifference indicating vasodilation at unchanged myocardial oxygen consumption in propranololpretreated dogs myocardial blood flow and coronary oxygen av difference remained unaffected suggesting that the coronary dilatory effect of metabolic acidemia involves beta adrenergic stimulation coronary vasodilation induced by increasing arterial pco was found to the significantly greater as compared with the dilatory effect of metabolic acidosis at the same blood ph level blocking of beta receptors did not reduce the coronary response to increased arterial cotensions it is concluded that the coronary vasodilation observed during hypercapnic acidosis is neither mediated by a beta adrenergic stimulation nor dependent of the concomitant NC in blood ph the possible sites of the coronary dilatory actions of increased arterial cotensions are discussed
1932,the influence of aging on the RAA system was evaluated by comparing young to yr with elderly to yr healthy subjects despite comparable body sodiumfluid balance in the two age groups serum renin concentration plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations were lower in the elderly the agerelated decreases in circulating renin and aldosterone concentrations were slight while subjects were supine and receiving normal sodium intake when upright and during sodium depletion they were more pronounced inverse reninblood pressure interrelations were noted during two of four T0 conditions involving normal sodium intake or mild sodium depletion r and respectively but not during progressive sodium depletion plasma renin C2 were decreased in the elderly regardless of the presence or absence of an inverse relationship with blood pressure aldosterone and cortisol responses to corticotropin infusion were unaltered in the elderly it is concluded that aging may cause a decrease in circulating renin with parallel lowering of plasma aldosterone concentrations
1933,phospholipase d ec from streptomyces hachijoensis was purified about fold by column chromatography on deaecellulose and sephadex g followed by isoelectric focusing the purified preparation was found to be homogeneous both by ID and polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis the isoelectric point was found to be around ph and the molecular weight was about the enzyme has Vmax at ph at degrees the optimal temperature is around degrees at ph using min incubation the enzyme was SD at degrees for min at neutral ph between and the enzyme retained more than of its activity on hr incubation at degrees however the enzyme lost of its activity under the same conditions at ph the enzyme was stimulated slightly by ca mn and co and significantly by triton x and ethyl ether it was inhibited by sn fe fe al edta sodium dodecyl sulfate sodium cholate and cetylpyridinium chloride this phospholipase d hydrolyzes phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylcholine cardiolipin sphingomyelin phosphatidylserine and lysophosphatidylcholine liberating the corresponding bases the km value was mm determined with phosphatidylethanolamine as a substrate
1934,the immunosuppressive effect of the graftversushost gvh reaction was studied in cba x a f caf mice which had been rendered immunologically unresponsive by the i.t. of parental a strain lymphoid cells gvh mice suppression of both cellmediated and humoral immune responses was demonstrated by the prolonged survival of cbl b skin allografts and by the inability of gvh mice to produce detectable antibody following stimulation with sheep erythrocytes srbc AGA stimulation of gvh mice induced cellmediated immune reactions to xeno and allogeneic antigens while the humoral immune responses to the same antigens remained suppressed multiple challenges of the gvh mice with b tissue caused a rapid rejection of subsequent b skin grafts but failed to stimulate the production of any detectable antibodies to b allotransplantation antigens sensitization of gvh mice with srbc in freunds complete adjuvant stimulated a delayed hypersensitivity response to srbc although no humoral response to srbc could be detected even after three challenges with srbc the experimental results are discussed in terms of a proposed model for gvhinduced immunosuppression
1935,the use of cfourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance ftnmr has led to the observation that while molecules of cala are incorporated into vitamin b in p shermanii cala labels only seven of the carbon atoms of cyanocobalamin ie one of the amino methyl CG of ala is lost in the process it has also been confirmed that seven of the methyl groups of b are derived from chenriched methionine and further that the chirality of the gemdimethyl grouping at c labelled with chmethionine is r a soluble enzyme mixture from the or g supernatant of disrupted cells of p shermanii converts both clabelled ala and curogen iii to cobyrinic acid the simplest corrinoid material on the pathway to vitamin b and the coenzyme in presence of nadph co mg sadenosylmethionine and glutathione multiplylabelled urogens c c and h have been used to show that incorporation takes place without randomization a sequence for corrin synthesis from urogen iii is presented
1936,within the limits granted neuroleptanalgesia constitutes a very interesting technique in the major part of management of labour in particular it has the advantage of preserving maternal consciousness on the other hand it allows analgesia of rather long duration which renders early management of labour possible while still respecting its physiology the institution of this technique demands the presence at the parturients bedside not only of the obstetrician and the medwife but also that of a qualified anesthetist as in all cases of L1 management of labour it engages the responsability of the obstetrical team which undertakes it and this is even more so the earlier it is started to us its indications seem comparable with those of gamma oh the early management of labour however has the advantage over the latter of preserving maternal consciouness moreover it proved to be particularly interesting in the management of breech presentations but if its properties are an advantage in the indications which we have just mentioned they can constitute an invonvenience and restrain its use under different circumstances its slowness of induction the absence of narcosis which limits the effect on cervical resistance means that one prefers the toulouse method using pentothal for the management of labour after centimeters of dilatation in conclusion it seems important to us to state that neuroleptanalgesia is not the ideal method for management of labour any more than is thiopental or gammaoh other techniques merit being studied their T0 must obey strict rules in order to specify the risks and therefore the indications and limits it should cover different fields which are pharmacology the objective assessment by quantitative criteria of the effects on uterine contraction on the mothers clinical and biological state as well as that of the fetus in utero then that of the child in the first hours of live and up to the first years of his development
1937,a deoxyribonuclease which requires nucleoside triphosphate for reaction has been purified about fold from extracts of bacillus laterosporus potassium phosphate and ethylene glycol stabilize the purified enzyme the enzyme degrades doublestranded dna about times faster than heatdenatured dna in the presence of nucleoside triphosphate dsDNA is not degraded to any measurable extent in the absence of atp but the enzyme exhibits activity toward denatured dna in the absence of nucleoside triphosphate and this activity seems to be an intrinsic property of this enzyme protein the optimum ph is and the maximum activity is obtained in the copresence of mg x m and mn x m atp and datp are most effective and nucleoside di or monophosphates are ineffective atp is converted to adp and inorganic phosphate during the reaction and the ratio of the amount of atp cleaved to that of hydrolyzed phosphodiester bonds of dna is about an inhibitor of the enzyme was observed in bacterial extracts prepared by sonic disruption the inhibitory substance is produced in the bacteria in the later stages of cell growth preliminary results show that the inhibitor emerged near the void volume of a sephadex g column and was relatively heatstable rnaseresistant and dnasesensitive
1938,alpha proteinase inhibitor was isolated from human plasma by a fivestep procedure isoelectric focusing showed that six components focused between ph and the molwt of the inhibitor was by sedimentation equilibrium and sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamidegel PACE the amino acid and carbohydrate compositions of the inhibitor were also determined the faruvcd circulardichroism spectrum indicated that the inhibitor had about alphahelical content the loss of proteinaseinhibitory activity when the inhibitor was exposed to ph values less than or greater than was accompanied by small changes in the faruvcd spectrum and large changes in the nearuvcd spectrum the change at alkaline ph was associated with ionization of IMT residues interaction of inhibitor with chymotrypsin caused perturbation of the cd spectrum and this was used to follow the interaction and show a stoicheiometry cd electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing showed that the inhibitorenzyme complex is degraded by free enzyme parallel studies with trypsin indicated that it too forms a complex with inhibitor and is degraded by excess of enzyme
1939,each of dogs was bled until mean arterial blood pressure fell to torr this HS state was then maintained for two hours during hemorrhagic shock the blood lactate concentration increased sixfold the severe MA in arterial blood was partially compensated by a decreased pco caused by increased ventilation however in mixed A-V blood the MA was combined with a respiratory acidosis this hypercapnia in venous blood was indicative of the increased pco in tissues poorly perfused following hemorrhage the increase in the pco of the FA venous blood was greater than that in mixed venous blood suggesting that some tissue beds were better perfused than those of the hind limb during shock the intracellular lactate concentration of hind limb skeletal muscle was greatly increased in the shock state and tissue pco rose intracellular ph of skeletal muscle was only slightly decreased and bicarbonate concentration was unchanged during this combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis this capacity of skeletal muscle to maintain a high hco concentration in intracellular fluid during MA may be an enhanced response of the mechanism responsible for maintaining hcoi normally at a level approximately ten times that which would be expected if hco were distributed passively
1940,"the delta delta of the phosphates of diphosphoglycerate and adenosine triphosphate atp were determined by phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance p nmr spectroscopy and were found to be displaced downfield following the addition of hemoglobin mm to a solution of either 2,3-DPG mm or atp mm the binding of these compounds to hemoglobin was also determined by membrane UF a direct relationship was observed between the change in chemical shift delta delta of the p and p of diphosphoglycerate and the percent 2,3-DPG bound when the latter was varied by altering ph oxygenation state or total 2,3-DPG concentration in comparable studies with atp binding a linear relationship between the delta delta values of the gamma beta and alphap of atp and the percent of atp bound was not observed when the data from all of the experiments were plotted nmr signals were not detectible in deoxyhemoglobin solutions containing mm atp but were seen in solutions containing mm atp the results indicate that p nmr spectroscopy is a promising tool for investigating organic phosphate interactions with hemoglobin"
1941,spectrophotometric and fluorimetric techniques were employed to charcterize the environment of the heme chromophore of rabbit hemopexin and to monitor changes in the environment of aromatic CAA residues induced by the interaction of hemopexin with porphyrins and metalloporphyrins difference spectra showed maxima at and nm when hemopexin binds heme or deuteroheme but not deuteroporphyrin these maxima are attributed to alterations in the local environment of tryptophan and tyrosine residues spectrophotometric titrations of the IMT residues of hemopexin hemehemopexin and hemopexin in m urea showed apparent pk values at and respectively perturbation difference spectra produced by vv DDE glycol are consistent with the exposure of of the tyrosine residues and of the tryptophan residues of rb hemopexin to this perturbant only small differences were found between the perturbation spectra of apo and hemehemopexin near nm suggesting that slight or compensating changes in the exposure to solvent of tryptophan chromophores occur in the soret spectral region the exposure of heme in the hemehemopexin complex to DDE glycol was relative to the fully exposed heme peptide of cytochrome c the fluorescence quantum yields of rb apo and hemehemopexin were estimated to be and respectively compared to a yield of for ltryptophan iodide quenched of the fluorescence of the deuterohemehemopexin complex cesium was not an ERP quencher modification of approximately tryptophan residues with NBS also decreased the relative fluorescence of apohemopexin by and concomitantly reduced the hemebinding ability of the protein by the existence of sterically unhindered tryptophan residues in either apo hemehemopexin is unlikely since no charge transfer compelxes between these proteins and nmethylnicotinamide were detected
1942,since the original reports suggesting that the antihypertensive action of betaadrenoreceptor blocking drugs is related to their GABA action on renin release much evidence has been put forward both to refute and support this hypothesis our studies of the acute and chronic effects of treatment with propranolol in hypertensive patients showed that the antihypertensive action of the drug was of later onset than the initial cardiodepressant and reninsuppressive effects and had little relationship to the pretreatment levels of treatmentinduced changes in plasma renin activity pra when pindolol was substituted for propranolol in these studies pra rose but blood pressure control was undisturbed again in animal experiments although a range of different betaadrenoreceptor blocking agents induced decreases in both blood pressure and pra the hypotensive effects of pindolol was associated with a rise in pra further pra proved to be a poor guide to therapeutic effectiveness in the treatment of an unselected population of hypertensive patients with propranolol it is concluded that the antihypertensive action of betaadrenoreceptor blocking agents as a class is not dependent upon suppression of pra
1943,mechanisms involved in the development of the alcoholic fatty liver in kkay mice were investigated incorporation studies using cacetate and hpalmitate indicated that the halflife of hepatic triglycerides was doubled in the ethanolingesting mice and utilization of the exogenous fat was significantly increases as compared with that of the control no persistent alteration was recognized in hepatic oxidation of palmitate as estimated by in vitro experiments using liver slices obtained from control and ethanoldrinking mice enzymic studies indicated that the activities of acetyl coa carboxylase atp citrate lyase malic enzyme and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were increased with ethanol drinking the increment in hepatic triglycerides accumulated during ethanol ingestion was largely accounted for by palmitoleic OA and LA acids these findings demonstrated an augmentation in hepatic lipogenesis as well as an increased utilization of exogenous fats ethanol drinking did not cause any appreciable change in plasma triglyceride level and metabolism of adipose tissue in summary of the present studies accelerated lipogenesis and increased utilization of the dietary fats may be possible causal AF in the alcoholic fatty CL of kkay mice
1944,betablockers are completely and rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in their first passage through the liver they are metabolised to a varying extent the socalled firstpass effect for propranolol and alprenolol this degradation is partly compensated for by the formation of AS metabolites the oh derivatives the betablocking effect is linearly correlated with the log plasma concentration of the drugs although there is also a relationship between the antihypertensive effect of the drugs and their log plasma concentration it seems to be of limited value to determine the plasma levels of the drugs in order to adjust the therapeutic dose this is due to the great interindividual differences of the plasma concentrationantihypertensive effect relationship it is essential to investigate whether pharmacologically active metabolites are formed these may not only influence the relationship between plasma concentration and therapeutic effect but may also modify the pharmacological profile of the drug the plasma levels and thereby the effects of the drugs can be modified by other drugs and diseases thus practolol which is mainly eliminated via the kidneys has a longer plasma halflife in patients with renal failure the plasma of propranolol which is eliminated from the body by biotransformation in the CL is not prolonged in patients with renal failure but its metabolites are excreted at a lower rate in such patients although most betablockers have a relatively short plasma halflife to hours the drugs can be administered twice daily in clinical practice this due to the fact that the effect declines according to zeroorder kinetics while the elimination of the drug follows firstorder kinetics it is desirable that all these AF are clarified before a drug is used in clinical practice as they all will have an influence on its dose regimen the responsibility for this must be on the drug company which must be able to inform physicians not only about the standard dosage of the drug but also how other drugs and diseases can NC the individual responses to the drug
1945,their frequency is estimated with difficulty although on autopsy pulmonary edema is found almost routinely it is a major complication of overdoses p of severe intoxications their formation can be suspected when after the first phase of respiratory depressions with coma myosis and a variable latent period a second attack of respiratory insufficiency occurs with tachypnea and cyanosis the chest xray shows diffuse alveolar infiltration sparing the apices the heart being generally of normal size rapid disappearance of this infiltrate to hours enables the elimination of two diagnoses pneumonia due to inhalation of gastric fluid an infectious pneumonia their pathogenesis remains very debatable in the majority of cases abrupt lvf can be eliminated on the other hand it could be an allergic accident of the anaphylactic type or local liberation of histamine or a local toxic action on the pulmonary capillaries hypoxia AA to respiratory depression could lead to pulmonary edema by the same mechanism as at altitude finally owing to the central neurological disorders a neurogenic theory can be put forward their treatment is essentially a combination of nalorphine with oxygen therapy by mask or if necessary by assisted controlled ventilation with prevention of inhalation of gastric fluid GE or curative treatment of possible aspiration by antibiotics and corticosteroids diuretics can be useful as well as cardiotonics
1946,the effects of varying the external calcium concentration on the suppression of membrane ionic conductances by procaine and benzocaine have been examined under voltageclamped conditions the suppression of peak conductance and steadystate conductance by procaine or benzocaine applied externally or internally was not affected by changing the external calcium concentration between and mm when the calcium concentration was lowered below mm or mm the procaine effect was slightly potentiated this augmentation could not be ascribed to an acceleration in the rate of penetration of procaine into the axon in low calcium solutions the resting Gm was slightly decreased by procaine in a manner independent of the external calcium concentration the maximum effect of procaine on resting conductances was obtained at a concentration much lower than that required for maximum suppression of peak and steadystate conductances the present results are not compatible with the hypothesis that calcium competes with local anesthetics for a negatively charged site on the membrane it is suggested that hydrophobic interactions of local anesthetic molecules with the membrane affect the resting membrane conductance whereas coulombic interactions are responsible for the conductance changes observed during nerve activity
1947,in this study women were analysed whose ages ranged between and born between and and who had had no artificial menopause this is of the total female population in this actual period of life living in martin district in the mean age at the menopause was found by status quo method to be years sigma and by the method of weighted arithmetical means years sigma the mean age at the onset of the climacteric calculated by the same methods was years or years respectively the mean age at menarche was years the average birthrate was the mean period of fertility for the series as a whole was years women with menstrual disturbances had their menopause about year earlier we have noted a similar tendency in nulliparas and primiparas we could find no great difference in the age at menopause between those who had had an early or a late menarche menstrual disturbances also influenced the onset of the climacteric it was at least one year earlier than with regular menstruation age at menarche and parity had no effect on the age at the onset of climacteric women working in agriculture and housewives had their menopause a little later than mean age of the series whereas manual workers and those in other occupational categories had their menopause and onset of the climacteric about year earlier furthermore single women had their menopause about one year earlier than the married ones widows had their menopause twice so often as the married women and they got it very soon after the husbandss death
1948,primary aldosteronism and renovascular hypertension are two different diseases in which renin determinations are necessary for establishment of diagnosis or therapeutic procedure low renin values which are not stimulated by acute stimuli combined with elevated plasma aldosterone concentrations confirm the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism when in a patient with proven renal i.a. stenosis a significant difference in renal venous renin activity is observed between the two kidneys a connection between hypertension and renal artery stenosis is likely when in addition the renin secretion of the unaffected kidney is suppressed a favourable outcome for surgery can be predicted when the individual clinical picture in such a case is also considered a similar view also holds for the connection between hypertension and unilateral small kidney not due to renal i.a. stenosis in essential hypertension the plasma renin level makes it possible to a certain extent to predict whether a patient will benefit from diuretics or from betablocking agents despite this experience however renin determinations are not indicated in every case of essential hypertension it has not been proven that the prognosis of this disease is improved by renin oriented monotherapy rather than by effective treatment with other antihypertensive agents
1949,the coupling of bulk water flow to active ion transport has been described in various epithelia evidence presented here suggests that this is also a feature of the rat lung measurements of the ionic composition of lung liquid and its rate of formation in the fetal lamb in vivo have made it possible to estimate the net flux of each ion and with water tracer measurements of ion oneway fluxes to calculate flux ratios when these are compared with the ratios predicted by the ussing flux ratio equation it is clear that the secretion of lung liquid is linked to active transport of cl from plasma sodium moves passively in addition there is an apparent uphill transfer of hco out of lung liquid in an in vitro preparation of adult canine tr cl is actively transported towards the lumen and is associated with a small net flux of na in the opposite direction addition of acetylcholine increases the net cl flux towards the lumen but reverses the orientation of the net na flux changes such as these may be important determinants of bulk liquid flow in vivo as well as in vitro
1950,betabungarotoxin a presynaptic neurotoxin isolated from the venom of the snake bungarus multicinctus has been shown to modify release of neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction in this communication we demonstrate that betabungarotoxin is a potent phospholipase a phosphatide acyl hydrolase ec comparable in activity with purified phospholipase enzymes from naja naja and vipera russellii the phospholipase activity of betabungarotoxin requires calcium and is stimulated by deoxycholate when strontium replaces calcium no phospholipase activity is detected since neuromuscular transmission is not blocked when calcium is replaced by strontium it was possible to examine the effects of the toxin on NMT in the presence of strontium under these conditions when the phospholipase activity should be inhibited the toxin has little or no effect on NM transmission if betabungarotoxin owes its toxicity in part to its enzymatic activity then it must be placed in a different class from those toxins which produce their effect by IB passively to an AGA receptor
1951,destruction of catecholaminecontaining SF in brain at days of age with intracisternal injection of hydroxydopamine reduced body growth intake of a SU solution and acquisition of an active avoidance response further characterization of behavioral deficits indicated that treated animals also showed reduced ingestion of saline solution when injected with desoxycorticosterone and a decreased eating response to insulin in addition all of these deficits produced by catecholamine depletion with hydroxydopamine were observed in rats in which BB dopamine was preferentially reduced but not in rats having preferential destruction of NE SF suggesting that dopamine depletion amounts for the observed alterations in developing animals although animals treated with hydroxydopamine at days showed reduced intake of a sucrose solution they did not have reduced growth since early malnourishment reduced growth it seems possible that the reduced growth observed after destruction of dopaminergeic fibers may be related to an acute reduction of food NI which is perpetuated by persistent deficits in ingestive behavior evidence implicating malnourishment in other deficits produced by hydroxydopamine could not be obtained
1952,the sh groups of glutamine synthetase ec from bacillus stearothermophilus were modified with dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid in order to determine the number of sh CG in the molecule as well as the effect of the modification on the CEA three sh groups per subunit were detected T3 complete denaturation of the enzyme with m urea one of which was essential for the enzyme activity in view of its reactivity with dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid on addition of mgcl with loss of the activity the cd spectra of the modified enzyme in the near ultraviolet region changed from that of the native enzyme indicating that aromatic amino acid residues were affected by modification of the sh group the fluorescence derived from tryptophanyl residues was quenched depending on the extent of modification of the sh group suggesting that the tryptophanyl residues was located in the proximity of the sh group the thermostability of the enzyme was remarkably decreased by modification of the sh group
1953,the interaction of insulin with human circulating granulocytes was studied with the use of iinsulin human granulocytes isolated from blood by the bÃ¶yum technique showed high insulindegrading activity in vitro which almost obscured the presence of specific high affinity binding sites degradation measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and by binding to well characterized insulin receptors on cultured human lymphocytes im L1 was due to extracellular as well as cellbound enzymes Kd was enhanced by ca and thiols and inhibited by various PIs and sulfhydrylblocking reagents phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride x m a serine protease inhibitor was the most potent and inhibited iinsulin Kd by to tertbutyl hydroperoxide x m a glutathioneoxidizing reagent inhibited degradation by to possibly due to an effect on a glutathioneinsulin transhydrogenase neither of the inhibitors affected cell viability in the presence of inhibitors of Kd binding sites for insulin with high affinity were detected which by multiple criteria were TI receptors binding to these sites was rapid saturable and reversible with about sitescell the hill coefficient for binding was and the scatchard plot of bf versus b was curvilinear due to sitesite interactions of the negative cooperative type the latter were demonstrated directly by kinetic studies as shown previously for all other insulin receptors binding was highly phdependent and insulin analogues had affinities for these CS that closely correlated with their biological potencies
1954,attempts were made to characterize mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase lmalate nad oxidoreductase ec mmdh purified from bovine cerebrum and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for inhibition of the enzymic activity by ag the molecular weights of the native enzyme and its subunits were and respectively in general the physiochemical and catalytic properties of bovine CBF mmdh was not very different from those of other corresponding rat enzymes incubation of the enzyme with ag caused the loss of equivalent amounts of sulfhydryls with a parallel decrease of the enzymic activity when the enzyme was exposed to and fold molar excesses of ag the enzymic activity showed an initial rapid fall and a subsequent slow restoration to a partially inactivated level and of an untreated control respectively while the alphahelical content of the enzyme fell exponentially with time a fold molar excess of ag reduced both the enzymic activity and the alphahelical content to a much greater degree and no restoration of the enzymic activity was observed the km values of aginactivated enzyme for nadh and oxaloacetate were the same as those of the native enzyme the data suggest that ag could inhibit enzymic activity both by reducing the structural regularity of the enzyme molecule and by attacking sulfhydryl CG necessary for the catalytic activity of bovine cerebral mmdh
1955,examination of insulin and glucagon degradation by rat kidney subcellular fractions revealed that most degrading activity was localized to the x g pellet and x g supernatant fractions further characterization of the degrading activities of the x g pellet and supernatant suggested that three types of enzymatic activity were present at neutral ph from the cytosol an enzyme with characteristics of the insulin glucagon protease of skeletal muscle was purified this enzyme appeared to be responsible for insulin Kd by the kidney at physiological insulin concentrations this enzyme also contributed to glucagon degradation but was not the most AS mechanism for this in the x g pellet at least two separate enzymatic activities were present one of these had properties consistent with those described for glutathione insulin transhydrogenase and appeared to be responsible for insulin degradation at high insulin concentration the other enzyme was associated with the brush border and had properties consistent with the brush border neutral protease this enzyme appeared responsible for glucagon degradation at both low and high ATP concentrations an apparent marked synergism between the x g pellet and the x g supernatant was noted for insulin degradation at physiological insulin concentrations pellet glucagondegrading activity and soluble insulindegrading activity were necessary for this the mechanism was found to be limited insulin Kd by the soluble enzyme resulting in both trichloroacetic acidprecipitable trichloroacetic acidsoluble fragments followed by further degradtion of the fragments by the glucagondegrading enzyme resulting in an additional increase in trichloroacetic acidsoluble products
1956,membrane vesicles can be prepared from murine lymphoid cells by nitrogen cavitation and fractionated by sedimentation through nonlinear sucrose density gradients two subpopulations of membrane LDV pmi and pmii can be distinguished on the basis of sedimentation rate the subcellular distribution of adenylate and GCs in these membrane subpopulations have been compared with the distribution of a number of marker enzymes approximately of the total adenylate and guanylate cyclase activity is located at the top of the sucrose gradient soluble enzyme the remainder of the activity being distributed in the pmi and pmii fractions membranebound enzyme more than of the nucleotidase and nadh oxidase activities detected in lymphoid cell homogenates are located in pmi and pmii fractions whereas succinate cytochrome c reductase activity is detected only in the pmii fractions in addition betagalactosidase activity is distributed in the soluble and pmii fractions of the SU density gradients on the basis of the fractionation patterns of these various enzyme activities it appears that pmi fractions contain LDV of BPM and endoplasmic reticulum whereas pmii fractions contain mitochondria lysomes and plasma membrane LDV approximately of the adenylate and guanylate cyclase activities in pmii can be converted to a pmilike form following dialysis and resedimentation through a second nonlinear sucrose gradient adenylate and guanulate cyclases can be distinguished on the basis of sensitivity to nonionic detergents
1957,in the light of controversy over the PET significance of the abundant sympathetic innervation of large cerebral blood vessels an in vitro analysis of the adrenergic receptors mediating contractile effects in the rb BA artery was undertaken beta adrenergic stimulation had no effect and agents that block norepinephrine ne uptake did not alter contractile responses to lne the lne DR curve could be resolved into two components sshaped curves the first had an ed of m and reached a plateau at m the C2 continued above m without reaching a plateau phenylephrine and epinephrine DRCs were also biphasic dne responses corresponded to the second phase of the lne curve relative potencies for the two components were different for the first component these were for lne epinephrine phenylephrine and dne respectively relative potencies for the C2 of the curve were phentolamine dissociation constants were analyzed separately for each component the value for low lne concentrations was x m and for higher concentrations it was x the insensitivity of the alpha adrenergic receptor and the poor responsiveness of the muscle to its activation with agonist concentrations below m can probably account for the small contractile responses to nerve stimulation of C1 pial arteries in spite of their abundant innervation
1958,phenacylcobalamin has been synthesized and characterized by thinlayer chromatography and uvvisible spectroscopy as well as identification of the cobaltcontaining and organic products of its cleavage in acid and base and by aerobic photolysis the major organic product from all three cleavage reactions is acetophenone and the cobaltcontaining product is aquacobalamin or hydroxocobalamin its conjugate base in aqueous acidic solution ph to ionic strength m and degrees c the kinetics of the formation of aquacobalamin are biphasic representing the linear sum of two exponential terms the ph dependence of the firstorder rate constant of both phases shows a firstorder dependence on proton concentration but with an inflection point ot ph for the faster phase and at ph for the slower phase this behavior is interpreted in terms of the TPS acid catalyzed formation of an intermediate from both base on and base off phenacylcobalamin with different secondorder rate constants for each form followed by an intermediate decompotion step with a similar formal mechanism the nature of the intermediate is discussed and it is concluded to be a picomplex between cobiiialamin and the enol of acetophenone
1959,during two days in november tvtapes of psychiatric interviews were demonstrated and the psychopathology was documented on amprecord sheet it was a purpose of the discussion to get stimulation for the improvement of the ampmanual and to decrease the interratervariance it was only the first tape which was not followed by a discussion this film was presented a second time at the end of the seminar in order to examine the training effects both recordsheets were compared with each other generally the variance decreased the discussion as to an improvement of the ampmanual lead to the following suggestions in defining a psychopathological item it is important to differentiate more precisely between the patients subjective experience and his behaviour to find better criteria concerning the rating of different intensities and to improve discrimination between singular items furthermore the logic of documentation procedure should be unequivocal and more practical following the seminar there was a symposion discussion more GA and some specific methodological problems of the further development of the ampsystem finally study CG were formed to elaborate on the topics ampmanual ratertraining social data and EDP
1960,in conscious trained dogs administration of bromazepam mgkg po or diazepam and mgkg po had no influence on HR rate a higher dose mgkg po of two benzodiazepines elicited a positive chronotropic effect which was rapid in onset and of long duration the betaadrenoceptor blocking agent practolol mgkg iv did not revert HR rate after the benzodiazepines to the same level as in controls indicating that the ART was not produced by an increase in sympathetic outflow to the heart for diazepam a sympatheticparasympathetic interaction cannot be excluded however diazepam and bromazepam significantly reduced the tachycardia which is normally observed T3 administration of methylatropine mgkg iv CT or in combination with practolol in anaesthetized dogs bromazepam failed to modify the HR rate responses to electrical stimulation of cardiac vagal or sympathetic nerves excluding an action on this compound on ganglionic transmission and cardiac cholinoceptors and adrenoceptors it is concluded that high doses of diazepam and bromazepam influence the HR rate of conscious dogs in a biphasic way firstly they cause a central reduction of vagal tone to the heart resulting in tachycardia secondly the two drugs decrease the cardiac pacemaker rate directly since the overall effect is tachycardia the CE action is more pronounced
1961,some physical catalytic and RII properties of ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase methylenetetrahydrofolate alphaketoisovalerate hydroxymethyltranferase from escherichia coli are described this enzyme catalyzes the reversible synthesis of ketopantoate reaction an essential precursor of pantothenic acid hcchcocoo methylene tetrahydrofolate f in equilibrium r hochcchcocoo tetrahydrofolate it has a molecular weight by sedimentation equilibrium of a sedimentation coefficient sw of s a partial specific volume of mlg an isoelectric point of and an absorbance see article of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and CAA analyses give a subunit molecular weight of and respectively both procedures indicate the presence of MZ subunits the nhterminal sequence is mettyr the enzyme is stable and active over a broad ph range with an optimum from to it requires mg for activity mn co zn are progressively less AS the enzyme is not inactivated by borohydride reduction in the presence of excess substrates ie it is a class ii aldolase reaction f is partially inhibited by concentrations of formaldehyde mm and tetrahydrofolate mm below or near the km values apparent km values are and mm for tetrahydrofolate alphaketoisovalerate and formaldehyde respectively for reaction r apparent km values are and mm respectively for ketopantoate and tetrahydrofolate and the saturation curves for both substrates show positive cooperativity forward and reverse reactions occur at similar maximum velocities vmax approximately equal to mumol of ketopantoate formed or decomposed per min per mg of enzyme at degrees only tetrahydrofolate is active in reaction dtetrahydrofolate folate and methotrexate were neither active nor GABA however tetrahydrofolate was effectively replaced with conjugates containing to additional glutamate residues of these tetrahydropterolpenta tetra and triglutamate were effective at lower concentrations than tetrahydrofolate itself they were also the predominant conjugates of tetrahydrofolate present in e coli alphaketobutyrate alphaketovalerate and alphaketobetamethylvalerate replaced alphaketoisovalerate as substrates pyruvate was inactive as a substrate but like isovalerate methylbutanone and d or lvaline inhibited reaction the transferase has regulatory properties expected of an enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in a biosynthetic pathway pantoate greater than or equal to mum and coenzyme a above mm all inhibit the vmax is decreased km is increased and the cooperativity for substrate ketopantoate is enhanced catalytic activity of the GOT is thus regulated by the products of the reaction path of which it is one component transferase synthesis is not repressed by growth in the presence of pantothenate
1962,glycolysis is not of importance for the process of carcinogenesis it is very likely however that certain molecularbiological and genetic changes are produced which enable the malignant cell to develop an intensive glycolysis for instance to form specialized glycolytic isoenzymes already during oncogenesis and may possible become effective in the PT as soon as the capacity of the cancer cell to intensive aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis has become manifest this process is an irreversible one the extent of glycolysis of a malignoma is greatly dependent on the degree of its dedifferentiation and vascularization gl supply although a direct correlation between growth and the amount of lactic acid formed does not seem to exist however a certain utilization of gl is essential for cell proliferation supply of basic substances in many cases there is a rho between the extent of glycolysis measurable under optimal conditions in vitro glycolytic power in a malignant tumour and its growth rate recognizable in vivo the formation of a strong capacity for glucose degradation via the embdenmeyerhof pathway that cannot be fully utilized by the whole tumour in vivo is first of all designed to ensure survival and proliferation of cells even at extremely low C2 of gl supply this process can be regarded as an adaptation of cancer cells to a situation of unsufficient supply this circumstance endows the cancer cell with an essential advantage over the normal cell which enables or even promotes its invasive and destructive growth and M1 dissemination in this respect they differ for instance from benignant neoplasms the possibility is discussed to control neoplastic growth by adjusting an optimal ph difference between normal and tumour tissue by combined administration of detoxicated drugs which are converted to their toxic forms only in the tumour by means of strongly phdependent exogenous enzymes
1963,murine spleen cells were separated on the basis of adherence to glass beads into distinct subpopulations that differ in their ability to produce acute graftversushost disease gvhd nonadherent cba SP cells produce acute gvhd in days in lethally irradiated B6 x cbaf mice as do UF SP cells spleen cells which are adherent to glass beads however enable of the mice to survive without symptomatology of acute gvhd the low proliferative response of these cells to phytohemagglutinin pha correlated with the mitigated gvhd seen in animals grafted with this fraction proliferative cells as determined by the spleen colony CA and the in vitro agar colonyforming assay are present in this fraction as are cells responsive to mitogenic stimulation with lipopolysaccharide lps bcbf mice grafted with cba adherent cells exhibit a gradual return over a period of months to normal pha and lps stimulation levels as shown by splenic cell responses of these mice to mitogens surviving mice grafted with AC were chimeric as determined by electrophoretic hemoglobin DP analysis and serial bone marrow transplantation
1964,phospholipase d preferentially contained in human eosinophil polymorphonuclear WBCs as compared to other leukocytes was isolated by sequential asion and cation exchange chromatography and GF the purified eosinophil enzyme specifically liberated choline from ialphaphosphatidyl choline with a ph optimum of and exhibited a pi of on polyacrylamidegel isoelectric focusing which are properties shared by phospholipase d from plant sources however its apparent mol wt of is approximately onehalf that of the plant enzymes eosinophil and cabbage phospholipase d inactivated a partially purified rat plateletactivating factor paf in a time and dosedependent reaction the cleavage of this paf activity was attributed to the inherent phospholipase d activity of the eosinophil enzyme since the two activities chromatographed together at each purification step and there was apparent reciprocal inhibition of cholinegenerating activity by paf and of pafinactivating activity by phosphatidyl choline thus possible regulatory functions of the eosinophil in immediate hypersensitivity reactions include inactivation of a paf by phospholipase d as well as degradation of slowreacting substance of anaphylaxis by ASB
1965,a synthetic iodopeptide having a glutamic aciddiiodotyrosine molar ratio of has been shown to be an effective AC both in vivo and in vitro contrasted with heparin the following GA conclusions may be made regarding its action the iodopeptide does not act through the inactivation of thrombin in plasma iodopeptide does interact with fibrinogen to form a complex which in vitro is not soluble in buffered saline at physiological ph at ph iodopeptide interacts with fibrinogen to form a soluble complex in the presence of nacl that is not coaguable either by thrombin or crotalus venom enzymes all the available evidence indicates that the fibrinogen to fibrin conversion is not inhibited under these conditions but that Fn once formed is not able to polymerize due to interference by iodopeptide similar results were obtained with heparin in vitro with thrombinfibrinogen mixtures in the absence of nacl studies with russells viper venom in native prp strongly suggest that the iodopeptide also interferes with processes in the early coagulation pathway associated with prothrombin activation
1966,the effects of acute changes in plasma na concentration pna on RBF rbf and glomerular filtration rate gfr were studied in anaesthetized greyhounds saline was infused at a constant rate ml kg min either into a renal artery or into a SVR vein plasma na concentration was altered by varying the na concentration of the infused saline from to or m blood pressure bp packed cell volume pcv concentration of plasma solids ps and the plasma concentration of h and k pk ions were measured but no attempt was made to contain their fluctuation an infusion of hypertonic saline into a renal i.a. usually led to an ipsilateral increase in rbf for min followed by a progressive fall overall mean values of rbf fell with pna throughout the range studied mmole l glomerular filtration rate rose with pna to reach maximal values at pna levels of mmole l but fell thereafter the combined fall in rbf and gfr without NC in filtration fraction at pna values above mmole l is consistent with an alteration in AA resistance the fall in gfr despite a rise in rbf noted when pna was reduced below mmole l requires an additional explanation renal blood flow was independent of pk it was inversely related to h and directly related to ps glomerular filtration rate was independent of pcv and pk it was also inversely related to h and directly related to ps up to a value of g g plasma after which the relationship was reversed these results suggest that the renal V1 responses to acute changes in pna may be mediated in part at least by concurrent NC in ps and h
1967,the erythrocruorin of the leech haemopis grandis possessed an sw of s at neutral ph its isoelectric point at ph and exhibited a slightly sigmoid oxygenation curve with n approximately and p mm at ph a minimum molecular weight of per heme group was determined from the iron and heme contents and weight respectively the subunit composition of the erythrocruorin was investigated using gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate and SDS-PAGE at neutral ph haemopis erythrocruorin dissociated in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate into four subunits through possessing molecular weights of about and respectively when the erythrocruorin was reduced with mercaptoethanol prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis three subunits were observed possessing molecular weights of about i ii and iii sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the isolated subunits through showed that S1 i was provided by subunits and subunit ii was provided by subunit and subunit iii was provided by both subunit and subunit haemopis erythrocruorin thus appeared to consist of at least five different polypeptide chains it is likely that not all of the constituent polypeptide chains were associated each with a heme group the shape of the haemopis erythrocruorin observed by electron microscopy appeared to be consistent with the twotiered hexagonal array characteristic of annelid erythrocruorins and chlorocruorins
1968,studies in patients with benign essential hypertension showed that the betablockers bufuralol patients and propranolol patients at a dose ratio of possess comparable antihypertensive efficacy despite different properties regarding intrinsic sympathomimetic activity betablockermonotherapy normalized blood pressure less than mm hg in one fourth of the patients body weight and plasma and blood volumes remained unchanged during betablockade of four to six weeks duration the mean plasma potassium was slightly increased the inhibition of plasma renin activity pra was more pronounced with propranolol than with bufuralol wirth both betablockers decreases in blood pressure correlated inversely with pretreatment pra p less than propranololinduced changes in blood pressure correlated also with associated changes in pra p less than in contrast no such relationship was observed with bufuralol the blood pressure effects of bufuralol however correlated significantly with changes in urinary noradrenaline excretion r p less than patient subgroups with low normal or high i.c.v. pra in the average showed a comparable pattern of pretreatment noradrenaline excretion and patients with normal renin levels exreted more adrenaline than those with low renin levels p less than these data are consistent with the concept that in untreated essential hypertension pra may be an index of adrenergic activiity the latter representing an important determinant of blood pressure response to betablockade the blood pressure lowering effects of bufuralol in benign essential hypertension seem to be independent of renin and may be related at least partly to diminished free IP noradrenaline levels
1969,the behavioral effects of low doses of the catecholamine ca synthesis inhibitor alphamethylptyrosine alphampt mgkg ip or the norepinephrine ne synthesis inhibitors fla mgkg ip u mgkg ip or disulfiram mgkg ip were studied in rats pretreated with RES mgkg ip h before rats were implanted either in the area ventralis tegmenti avt or in the lateral hypothalamus lh the modifications of ca synthesis and endogenous ca C2 were estimated in a parallel experiment RES treatment produced a slow decrease in SS ss rates during the first h ss rates were of control values h after reserpine treatment i.t. of alphampt in reserpinepretreated rats inhibited ss decrease h C2 either in avt or lh rats whereas dopamine betahydroxylase inhibition had no great effect on ss the administration of very low doses of alphampt mgkg ip to rats treated with reserpine h before plus fla h before induced an important decrease in ss rates in avtimplanted rats only the major conclusion is that dopaminergic neurons seem to be involved in avt and lh ss the last experiment suggests the involvement of a balance between dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons in avt ss
1970,the regulatory properties of partially purified adenosine diphosphateadp glucose pyrophosphorylase from two serratia marcescens strains atcc and atcc have been studied slight or negligible activation by fructosep pyridoxalphosphate or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph was observed these compounds were previously shown to be potent activators of the adpglucose pyrophosphorylases from the enterics salmonella typhimurium enterobacter aerogenes enterobacter cloacae citrobacter freundii escherichia aurescens shigella dysenteriae and escherichia coli phosphoenolpyruvate stimulated the rate of adpglucose synthesis catalyzed by serratia adpglucose pyrophosphorylase about to fold but did not affect the s values concentration of ATP required for maximal stimulation of the substrates alphaglucosephosphate and adenosine triphosphate adenosine monophosphate amp a potent inhibitor of the enteric adpglucose pyrophosphorylase is an effective inhibitor of the s marcescens enzyme adp also inhibits but is not as ERP as amp activators of the enteric enzyme counteract the inhibition caused by amp this is in contrast to what is observed for the s marcescens enzyme neither phosphoenolpyruvate fructosediphosphate pyridoxalphosphate nadph phosphoglycerate fructosephosphate nor pyruvate effect the inhibition caused by amp the properties of the s marcescens hy strain and serratia liquefaciens adpglucose pyrophosphorylase were found to be similar to the above two s marcescens enzymes with respect to activation and inhibition these observations provide another example where the properties of an enzyme found in the genus serratia have been found to be different from the properties of the same enzyme present in the enteric genera escherichia salmonella shigella citrobacter and enterobacter
1971,four possible metabolic approaches to improving cardiac function in the presence of myocardial hypoxia have been considered it appears that there is increasing evidence which suggests that free fatty acids are harmful to the ischemic heart although it has been demonstrated that krebs cycle intermediates can result in anaerobic energy formation by the mitochondria and under certain extreme conditions can lead to improved performance of the heart the potential for a physiologically important effect of this approach is probably limited the protection of the ischemic or hypoxic heart by alkalosis may be a feasible approach the major beneficial effect appears to be exerted through more efficient conversion of energy that is already available to contractile performance rather than by increasing energy supply there appears to be some real potential for improving cardiac SE delivery via the glycolytic pathway calculations based on isolated rat heart studies indicate that at oxygenation glycolytic atp generation could totally correct for the deficit in mitochondrial atp formation therefore it is in the area of overcoming the inhibition of glycolytic atp formation and tapping this potential metabolic pathway that energy delivery may be restored toward normal in the hypoxic and perhaps the borderline zone of underperfusion in the ischemic heart the problem of the ischemic inhibition of glycolysis may partially be overcome by creating extracellular alkalosis but this presumption will have to be tested
1972,TBG was isolated from human plasma by AS fractionation chromatographic separations on diethylaminoethylsephadex gel chromatography and two different electrophoretic procedures the highly purified was homogeneous when subjected to polyacrylamide gel PACE UC analyses and immunochemical determinations the weight average molecular weight as determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugations was and by sedimentation diffusion data amino acid analyses indicated a minimum of CAA residues per molecule by determination of the minimum in the curve for the fraction of maximum deviation from the CAA analyses it was found that the minimum molecular weight for the polypeptide was carbohydrate analyses demonstrated the presence f equimolar amounts of amnnose galactose and glucosamine and the carbohydrate portion constituted of the total weight the amino acid analyses suggested that thyroxinebinding globulin is composed of subunits molecular weight determinations by gel chromatography in m guanidine hydrochloride indicated the presence of three species of globulin with apparent molecular weights and respectively prolonged storage in guanidine hydrochloride promoted a more than yield of the monomeric species moreover a halfmolecule of TBG was isolated and shown to consist of two polypeptide chains of similar molecular weight
1973,in investigating the staphylococcal proteasecatalyzed hydrolysis of ntertbutoxycarbonyllglutamate alphaphenyl ester nbenzyloxycarbonyllglutamate alphaphenyl ester and nbenzyloxycarbonyllglutamate alphapnitroanilide we obtained kinetic evidence consistent with the formation of an acylenzyme intermediate we found that addition of a nucleophile such as methanol led to the partition of the common acylenzyme intermediate between water and the alcohol with nbenzyloxycarbonyllglutamate alphaphenyl ester a specific ester substrate deacylation was shown to be the ratelimiting step by studying the kcatkm ratio of these hydrolyses as a function of ph we have shown that two ionizable CG on the enzyme are essential to the catalytic process one of these groups has a pk of and the other a pk of the assignment of these pk values is discussed in connection with the known features of the serine proteinase reaction mechanism in addition monovalent anions were shown to inhibit staphylococcal protease hydrolyses they seem to compete with the negative charge of the substrate thus inhibiting its IB on the enzyme molecule finally we compared the kinetic parameters obtained with five proteases isolated from different strains of staphylococcus aureus
1974,in years at bristol there have been cases of torsion of the testis cases of torsion of a testicular appendage and cases of testicular ischaemia due to other causes the risk of a male developing torsion of the testis or its appendix by the age of is about in both conditions occurred primarily in adolescents but among prepubertal boys torsion of an appendage was as common as torsion of a normally descended testis there was a slight leftsided preponderance in TT more marked in torsion of the appendages the incidence of bilateral torsion was and per cent respectively the clinical features and differential diagnosis of the two conditions are compared torsion of a testicular appendage is the most commonly misdiagnosed scrotal lesion the preoperative diagnosis being correct in only per cent of cases compared with per cent for torsion of the testis twentyone cases of recurrent torsion underwent prophylactic BL orchidopexy there were cases of torsion of undescended testes with a salvage rate of only per cent the overall testicular survival rate was per cent viability depends upon the possibility of spontaneous reduction the preoperative delay after the onset of symptoms the degree of torsion of the cord and the length of followup in doubtful cases urgent scrotal exploration is advised in every case of acute testicular pain unless there is overwhelming evidence of epididymoorchitis exploration of the opposite side is mandatory in torsion of the testis and advisable in torsion of an appendage
1975,previous studies have shown that chlorite serves as a halogenation ATP for horseradish peroxidase in its substrate role chlorite serves both as a halogen donor and as a source of oxidizing equivalents in the chlorination reaction we now show that a new spectral intermediate which we have termed compound x can be detected as the initial product of the reaction of chlorite with horseradish peroxidase the reaction of chlorite with horseradish peroxidase to form compound x is a relatively fast reaction especially at acidic ph values the second order rate constant kf for the formation of compound x at ph optimum ph is x m s compound x in the absence of a halogen acceptor decomposes to compound i and chloride ion the first order rate constant kd for the decay of compound x to compound i is s at ph the ph optimum for enzymatic chlorination with chlorite compares favorably with the ph profile for the lifetime of compound x kfkd these observations indicate that compound x is the halogenating intermediate in the chlorite reaction and that the rate of enzymatic chlorination is directly related to the stability of compound x we propose an ocl ligand on a ferric heme as the most likely structure for compound x
1976,kinetic parameters of the interaction of the toxic lectins abrin and ricin with human erythrocytes and hela cells have been measured the binding of ilabeled abrin and ricin to human erythrocytes and to hela cells at degrees was maximal around ph whereas at degrees the binding was similar over a broad ph range the binding occurred at similar rates at degrees and degrees with rate constants in the range to x m s the dissociation was strongly temperaturedependent with rate constants in the range to x s at degrees and to x s at degrees the presence of unlabeled lectins as well as lactose increased the rate of dissociation the association constants measured at equilibrium or calculated from the rate constants were between x m and x m for abrus lectins and between x m and x m for ricinus lectins the association constants for the toxins were lower at degrees than at degrees isolated ricin b chain appeared to bind with similar affinity as intact ricin the number of binding sites was estimated to be to x per erythrocyte and to x per hela cell the binding sites of hela cells all displayed a uniform affinity towards abrin and ricin both at degrees and at degrees the same was the case with the binding sites of erythrocytes at degrees however the data indicated that at degrees erythrocytes possessed binding CS with two different affinities only a fraction of the cellbound toxin appeared to be irreversibly bound and could not be removed by washing with m lactose the fraction of the total amount of bound toxin which became irreversibly bound to hela cells was for both toxins about x min at degrees whereas no toxin was irreversibly bound at degrees in the case of erythrocytes no toxin became irreversibly bound either at degrees or degrees indicating that the toxins are unable to penetrate into these cells
1977,the characterization and localization of a caatpase atp phosphohydrolase ec in the tooth germ of the porcine fetus are reported this enzyme a microsome fraction is preferentially activated by ca in the presence of mm atp maximal CEA is obtained at mm cacl the maximal rate of atp hydrolysis is approx mumol per h per mg of protein as the enzyme preparation is used here at optimal ca concentration the mg has an inhibitory effect the enzyme does not require na orand k for activation by ca other nucleotide triphosphates may serve as the substrate but v for atp is the highest the km for atp is m the optimal ph for ca activation of the enzyme lies around well known inhibitors of na katpase mitochondria atpase and caatpase in the erthrocyte do not inhibit the enzyme in the subcellular order the enzyme may be assumed to be localized in the SER fraction containing cell and golgi body membrane fragments and in the tissue order in the enamel organ containing an ameloblast SL stratum intermedium and stellate reticulum
1978,"a new haemoglobin with increased oxygen affinity beta ef lysine leads to threonine hb rahere was found during the investigation of a patient who was found to have a raised haemoglobin concentration after a routine blood count the substitution affects one of the 2,3-DPG IB sites resulting in an increased affinity for oxygen but both the haemhaem interaction and the alkaline bohr effect are normal in the haemolysate this variant had the same mobility as haemoglobin a on PACE at alkaline ph but was detected by measuring the whole blood oxygen affinity it could be separated from haemoglobin a however by electrophoresis in agar at acid ph the raised haemoglobin concentration was mainly due to a reduction in CPV a relative polycythaemia and was associated with a persistently raised white blood count this case emphasises the need to measure the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin in all patients with absolute or relative polycythaemia when some obvious cause is not evident"
1979,OCT activity was determined by estimation of the citrulline formed during the reaction citrulline is estimated by DAM in the presence of TSC the conditions of enzyme analysis were then studied in buffer veronalacetate medium at degrees c the optimum ph for activity depended on the ornithine concentration but was independent of carbamylphosphate concentration at ph ornithine at concentrations higher than mm inhibited enzyme activity ornithine km was mm and that of carbamylphosphate was mm the incubation time for determination of oct activity was minutes citrulline production was proportional to the enzyme concentration up to activities of unitsl serum urea was destroyed by a urease of high quality so that the formation of citrulline in the control reagents was minimal REF values determined on a hospital population without liver HR or pulmonary disease lay between unitsl the coefficient of variation of the technique determined on a pool of serum of moderate activity was unitsl ie per cent
1980,the immunological unreactive state occurring in tgal nonresponder mice T3 secondary antigen challenge was investigated syngeneic igm antitgal antibodycontaining plasma transferred at the time of the time of primary challenge induced persistent suppression of autologous TPS antibody production removal of plasma igm with goat antimu antisera removed the ability of the plasma to supress the induction and maintenance of the suppressed state were not different in Tx or shamthymectomized animals primed animals subjected to graftvshost reaction gvhr at the time of AA challenge switched over to igg production animals suppressed by passive antibody transfer reacted to gvhr at the time of secondary challenge with specific igm but not igg antibody production transfused normal spleen cells partially abrogated suppression only when suppressed hosts had been lethally irradiated spleen cells from antigenplusantibody suppressed donors upon transfer to previously normal syngeneic hosts were less immunocompetent than spleen cells from UT donors these data are consistent with a MM of igm mediated t cellindependent persistent suppression of HI
1981,a method is described for the purification of native hexokinases pi and pii from yeast using preparative isoelectric focussing to separate the isozymes the IB of glucose to hexokinase pii and the effect of this on the monomerdimer associationdissociation reaction have been investigated quantitatively by a combination of titrations of intrinsic protein fluorescence and equilibrium ultracentrifugation association constants for the monomerdimer reaction decreased with increasing ph ionic strength and concentration of gl saturating concentrations of glucose did not bring about complete dissociation of the enzyme showing that both sites were occupired in the dimer at ph and high ionic strength where the enzyme existed as monomer the KB of the enzymeglucose complex was x mol and was independent of the concentration of enzyme IB to the dimeric form at low ph and ionic strength i mol ph less than was also independent of enzyme concentration in the range mug ml but was much weaker the process could be described by a single dissociation constant showing that the two available CS on the dimer were equivalent and noncooperative values of the intrinsic dissociation constant varied from x mol at ph to x at ph under intermediate conditions ph ionic strength mol where monomer and dimer coexisted the binding of gl showed weak positive cooperatively hill coefficient in addition the binding was dependent upon the concentration of enzyme in the direction of stronger binding at lower concentrations the results show that the phenomenon of halfsites reactivity observed in the binding of glucose to crystalline hexokinase pii does not occur in solution the simplest explanation of our finding the two sites to be equivalent is that the dimer results from the rat association of two identical subunits
1982,fivehydroxytryptamine ht causes a hyperpolarization and increased conductance of the leech body wall muscle cell membrane if ht is applied in the absence of the cl minus ion the response appears as a depolarization whereas if ht is applied in the absence of the k ion the response is a hyperpolarization in both cases the conductance of the muscle CM is increased stimulation of the IP nerve to the body wall muscle produces a complex junctional potential in muscle cells exposing the muscle to dtubocurarine dtc eliminates the excitatory component ejp of the complex potential the GABA potential ijp that remains has an equilibrium potential at approximately mv furthermore this ijp appears as a depolarization when the nerve is stimulated in the presence of dtc and low cl minus whereas this is not the case if the nerve is stimulated in the presence of dtc and low k the drugs bol and cyproheptadine block the ijps in the body wall muscle these data are interpreted as indicating that ht acts on leech body wall muscle cells by increasing the conductance to the cl minus ion and that the ijps caused by nerve stimulation are probably the result of ht release at nerve terminals as a final point it has been shown that the inhibition by ht of the spontaneous ejps that occur on the leech body wall muscle results from an inhibition of central neurons and not from any direct effect on the muscle cell or on peripheral synapses
1983,total c activity in juice secreted by gastric pouches of six dogs and seven isolated canine stomachs was determined in response to intravenous and intraarterial infusions of histamine and chistamine the proportions of c attributable to histamine nalphamethylhistamine nalphameh nalphanalphadimethylhistamine nalphanalphameh ntellemethylhistamine ntaumeh imidazole acetic acid imaa nmethylimidazole acetic acid ntaumeimaa acetylhistamine ach and histaminol hoh were defined using TLC chromatography similar estimates were made at the end of infusions on blood GM and gastric muscle methylation was the L1 or sole route of metabolism of histamine in the gastric mucosa and the L1 product was inactive ntaumeh small quantities of the active nalphame derivatives particularly nalphanalphameh were identified in both the juice and mucosa little or no imaa ntaumeimaa ach and hoh were present in juice from isolated stomachs while they did occur in the juice from intact dogs demonstrating they are extragastric metabolites of histamine a major mucosal function of methylation of histamine is inactivation although nalphame derivatives formed may play a role in the secretagogue action of histamine
1984,the changes in the EA of the antrum muscle SF of the guinea pig stomach caused by atp and its related compounds were compared with those caused by catecholamines the antrum preparation exhibited SEA and this was suppressed or inhibited by treatment with catecholamines adrenaline noradrenaline and isoprenaline the GABA actions of catecholamines were observed in the presence of tetrodotoxin or alphablockers phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine while the effects were antagonized by betablockers propranolol or dci at higher concentrations than that of CAs atp or related nucleotides also produced the GABA effect on the spike activity and the generation of SWs the GABA actions of atp and related substances were still observed in the presence of alpha or betaadrenergic blockers furthermore the inhibition was present T3 treatment with tetrodotoxin from these results it is concluded that the inhibitory action of atp and related EDC is due to a direct action on the antrum muscle and is not mediated via alpha or betaadrenoceptors
1985,in order to facilitate interpretation of the deazaisoalloxazine system as a valid mechanistic probe of flavoenzyme catalysis we have examined some of the fundamental chemical properties of this system the enzymatic synthesis on a micromole scale of the flavin coenzyme analogues deazariboflavin phosphate deazafmn and deazariboflavin diphosphate leads to adenosine ester deazafad has been achieved this latter synthesis is accomplished with a partially purified fad synthetase complex from brevibacterium ammoniagenes containing both phosphorylating and adenylylating activities allowing direct conversion of the riboflavin analogue to the FAD level the structure of the reduced deazaflavin resulting from enzymatic and chemical reduction is established as the dihydrodeazaflavin by proton magnetic resonance similarly the c position of the deazaflavins is demonstrated to be the locus for hydrogen transfer in deazaflavin redox reactions preparation of dihydrodeazaflavins by sodium borohydride reduction stabilized them to autoxidation t approximately h degrees c although dihydrodeazaflavins are rapidly oxidized by other electron acceptors including riboflavin phenazine methosulfate methylene blue and dichlorophenolindophenol mixtures of oxidized and reduced deazaflavins undergo a rapid twoelectron disproportionation k m s degrees c and oxidized deazaflavins form transient covalent adducts with nitroalkane anions at ph less than generalized methods for the synthesis of isotopically labeled flavin and deazaflavin coenzymes and their purification by adsorptive chromatography are given
1986,the binding constants of alpha and betaglcnac to hen and turkey lysozymes ec were determined at various phs using the method proposed by ikeda and hamaguchi j biochem the ph dependence of the binding of betaglcnac to hen lysozyme was essentially the same as that for turkey lysozyme the ph dependence curves of the IB constants of betaglcnac to hen and turkey lysozymes were interpreted in terms of the participation of glu pk asp pk asp pk and asp pk the binding constants of alphaglcnac to hen and turkey lysozymes were the same below ph but were different above this ph the main participant residues in the binding of alphaglcnac were glu asp and asp for hen lysozyme and glu and asp for turkey lysozyme the results obtained here were well explained by the following assumptions above about ph alphaglcnac binds to hen lysozyme in both alpha and betamodes which correspond to the IB orientation of alphaglcnac and that of betaglcnac respectively as determined by xray crystallographic studies but it binds predominantly in the betamode below about ph betaglcnac binds to hen and turkey lysozymes predominantly in the betamode above about ph and in both alpha and betamodes below ph and alphaglcnac binds to turkey lysozyme predominantly in the betamode over the whole ph range studied
1987,the basic PTI bpti was investigated by high resolution h nmr techniques at mhz observation of the amide proton resonances of the polypeptide backbone showed that the globular conformation of bpti determined by xray studies in single crystals is maintained in aqueous solution over the temperature range from degrees to degrees nmr studies over this temperature range of the aromatic amino acid residues of bpti ie tyrosines and phenylalanines led to CR assignments of all the aromatic spin systems in the protein from this information was obtained on the rotational motions about the c betacv bond axis of the aromatic rings in the globular form of pbti at degrees two tyrosine rings and one phenylalanine ring are rotating rapidly on the nmr time scale for the other rings the transitions from slow to rapid rotational motions were investigated at variable temperatures and SE barriers for these intramolecular rate processes determined the studies of the tyrosine resonances had been described in detail in a previous publication the present paper describes the identification of the phenylalanine resonances and comments on some technical aspects which might be of quite GA interest for the analysis of highly resolved h nmr spectra of proteins data for the tyrosines and the phenylalanines are compiled in three tables ie the pk alphavalues for the tyrosines the nmr parameters for all eight aromatics and the parameters delta g not equal to and where available delta h not equal to and delta s not equal to for the rotational motions of the rings
1988,hydroxydopamine ohda treatment of rats at birth with the analyses conducted in the adult stage produced marked regional variations in changes in endogenous noradrenaline na and hna uptake in the cns the most pronounced reductions were seen in the cerebral SC hippocampus and the spinal cord moderate changes or none at all were seen in the hypothalamus septum and thalamus marked increases in endogenous na and hna uptake were seen in the MES and the ponsmedulla oblongata there was in general a close rho between the changes in endogenous na and hna uptake the results from the cerebellum varied depending on the developmental stage at which the ohda treatment was performed ohda treatment up to three days after birth generally led to a marked increase in both endogenous na and hna uptake while continuing the treatment caused a marked reduction of both parameters the ohda treatment caused no changes in endogenous dopamine da in all regions analysed CEA assays showed that dabetahydroxylase dbh and tyrosine hydroxylase th were greatly reduced in the CBF cortex while the activity of both enzymes was almost double in the PM no changes in the activity of phenylethanolamine nmethyltransferase pnmt DDC comt and mao were seen after ohda at birth measurements of choline acetyltransferase activity displayed only minute changes the present results strongly support the view that ohda treatment in the neonate stage produces a very selective action on na neurones belonging to the LC system from a structural standpoint leaving da and pnmtcontaining neurones unaffected hna uptake in whole cns was almost unchanged despite the marked regional variations the results have been interpreted as being due to a pruning effect where the permanent na denervation in distant nerve terminal projections eg CBF cortex leads to a compensatory sprouting and increased outgrowth of na terminal projections in areas close to the perikarya eg PM furthermore the results support the view that the growing locus coeruleus neurones are strictly programmed to produce a certain quantity of nerve terminal volume and arborization during the PN development
1989,the enzyme rhodanese ec appears as a single polypeptide chain protein on sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel PACE the molecular weight of this species is approx this contrasts with previous reports that rhodanese behaves on GF chromatography as a rapidly equilibrating monomerdimer system composed of identical subunits with a molecular weight of we have investigated this apparent discrepancy by isolating the enzyme by the two different preparative procedures used in the above investigations the two crystalline samples were subjected to GFC under a wide variety of conditions and to sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis the two S9 yielded rhodanese which behaved identically and no evidence for the monomeric species was obtained under any experimental condition tested thinlayer gel chromatography of clarified liver homogenates gave no evidence of rhodanese species other than that present in the purified samples the R2 in molecular weights observed in gel filtration chromatography may be a reflection of the conformational mobility of the enzyme leading to solventdependent changes in stokes radius if rhodanese is dimeric special interactions must stabilize it under the conditions tested here
1990,cytotoxic tlymphocytes ctls harvested from mixed splenic lymphocyte cultures dba cbl were tested for their ability to lyse allogeneic p mastocytoma cells under various tumorlike assay conditions with or without previous exposure to ionizing radiation or hyperthermia degrees there was little or no decrease of immune cytolysis when ctls were assayed by cr release under tumorlike conditions plateauphase target cells low ph or anoxia or after irradiation but cytolytic activity was greatly reduced when ctls were exposed to heat min of hyperthermic treatment decreased activity by greater than or equal to while reducing the apparent cell viability as indicated by trypan blue exclusion by only when the p target cells rather than the ctls were exposed to heat their susceptibility to immune lysis was not affected even T3 treatment times that were lethal to the tumor cells despite the dissimilar heat sensitivities of ctl and p cells the doseresponse curves for inhibition of protein synthesis by heat as indicated by hleucine incorporation were similar for both cell types neither the depression of protein synthesis in heated ctls nor the decreased cytolytic ability of these cells was reversed within hr when irradiated or heated p cells were incubated with ctls the resulting survival curves were always additive indicating that neither irradiation nor heat treatment affected the susceptibility of the tumor cells to immune attack the extreme heat sensitivity of cytotoxic tlymphocytes raises important questions about the possible effects of hyperthermic treatment on the immune competence of cancer patients
1991,the metabolism of a novel polyvalent saluretic agent dichloromethyloxophenylindanyloxyacetic acid mk was studied in the chimpanzee following oral administration of the radioactive dose was recovered in the urine in four days of the dose was excreted as unchanged drug the fecal specimens accounted for of the dose following i.v. an initial rapid elimination of drug from the plasma was observed talpha approximately hr tbeta approximately hr the data are consistent with the rapid elimination of radioactivity approximately of dose in the urine during the first hr followed by a much slower rate of excretion of drug and metabolites these findings are congruous with the high affinity greater than of mk and the L1 metabolite with plasma proteins the urinary metabolites were isolated and identified by the following techniques solvent extraction column TLC and GLC derivatization and mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the major metabolite which resulted from parahydroxylation of the phenyl substitutent accounted for about of the urinary radioactivity reduction of the ketone group methylation of the phydroxy group and additional phenyl ring hydroxylation were also shown to occur there was no evidence for TG formation nor did skfa inhibit the metabolism of the drug in the chimpanzee under conditions of induced metabolic alkalosis the urinary C2 of mk increased from to PB and paminohippurate administered during metabolic alkalosis decreased the clearance of drug to
1992,selective lesions of the dorsal b median b or lateral b raphe nuclei were made stereotaxically in male rats weeks before sacrifice the extent of damage to each raphe nucleus was quantified histologically by means of a simplified formaldehyde histochemical method for visualization of serotonin in cryostat sections a detailed mapping of the distribution of the yellowfluorescent raphe perikarya provided the basis for quantification tryptophan hydroxylase activity was measured in forebrain regions from each animal and the results were correlated with the per cent damage to each raphe nucleus tyrosine hydroxylase was also assayed in of these regions it was not significantly affected by any of the raphe lesions dorsal raphe lesions reduced tryptophan hydroxylase activity in the striatum TH cortex and hypothalamus but not in the septal nuclei or hippocampus damage to b resulted in decrements in this serotonergic enzyme in the septal nuclei hippocampus cortex and hypothalamus but not in the striatum or thalamus lesions of the scattered B1 had no significant effect on enzyme activity in any region examined these data suggest that the dorsal and median raphe nuclei provide two distinct though perhaps overlapping serotonergic systems innervating different parts of the forebrain a mesostriatal pathway originating in b and a mesolimbic system derived from b behavioral studies on the animals which are presented in a companion paper indicated that damage to the median nucleus is responsible for many of the behavioral effects previously reported after combined lesions of both major raphe nuclei
1993,effects of sodium nitrate were compared with sodium chloride loading on transport of electrolytes by the nephron maximal levels of free water clearanceclomerular filtration rate chogfr averaged with nitrate loading and with saline loading since ethacrynic acid and chlorothiazide exert their L1 natriuretic effect in the distal nephron the increment in na ad cl reabsorbed beyond the PT tubule the administration of these agents resulted in an increase in fractional sodium excretion cnagfr of urinary sodium excretion unav of mueqmin and urinary chloride excretion uclv of mueqmin during nitrate loading compared with an increase in cnagfr of unav of mueqmin and uclv of mueqmin during saline loading the smaller diureticinduced increment in na and cl excretion in the nitrate studies suggests as do the hydrated studies that less cl and na are reabsorbed in the distal nephron during nitrate than saline loading at every level of unav fractional bicarbonate reabsorption was higher urine ph was lower and urinary potassium excretion ukv was higher in the nitrate studies thus compared with saline loading sodium nitrate decreases chloride and sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron the higher hydrogen and potassium secretion in the nitrate studies may be consequent to the decreased ability of the distal nephron to reabsorb chloride
1994,in order to T0 the relationship between arterial pco and CBF blood flow cbf in hypothermia the body temperature of artifically ventilated rats was decreased to degreesc and changes in cbf were evaluated from arteriovenous differences in oxygen content avdo at paco values of and mm hg the results were compared to those obtained at normal body temperature degrees c over the paco range mm hg separate experiments were performed to evaluate cbf and cmro at degrees c and a paco of mm hg using an inert gas technique for cbf the tissue contents of phosphocreatine atp adp amp and lactate were measured in hypothermic animals at paco values of and mm hg the results showed that changes in cbf were of the same relative magnitude in HT and normothermia when paco was increased from about to about mm hg however with a decrease in paco the reduction in cbf was much more pronounced in hypothermia and at paco mm hg cbf was less then of the value measured in normothermic and normocapnic animals the results of the metabolite measurements gave no evidence of tissue hypoxia in spite of the pronounced reduction in cbf although the results demonstrate that the brain of a hypothermic animal is protected against the harmful effects of a lowered cbf it may not warrant recommending hyperventilation in clinical cases of hypothermia especially not in patients with arteriosclerosis or cerebrovascular diseases
1995,in a study of groups of patients with atopic extrinsic asthma nonatopic intrinsic asthma and CB no difference could be detected in the numbers having precipitating antibodies against species specific antigens from staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pneumoniae compared to suitably matched control subjects precipitating antibodies against species TPS antigens from haemophilus influenzae demonstrated in this investigation by double diffusion in agar gel were found much more frequently in patients with chronic mucopurulent or obstructive bronchitis than in either asthmatic subjects or NCs p less than while the precipitating antibody demonstrated in these patients against the extracts of str pneumoniae and staph aureus was in the igg class alone igm and iga antibody were detected against the species TPS but not the nonspecies specific antigens of h influenzae these results underline the importance of h influenzae as an infecting agent in chronic bronchitis and suggest that the finding of precipitins against the species specific h and h antigens of this bacterium denotes infection either concurrently or in the recent past there is no evidence to suggest from this T0 that infection with staph aureus str pneumoniae or h influenzae is any more common in asthmatics as a group compared to controls or between patients with the nonatopic intrinsic and atopic extrinsic form of the disease
1996,to determine the role of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in pneumococcal pneumonia hemodynamic measurements were made in dogs before and within hours after intrapulmonary administration of type iii pneumococcus ten dogs with one lobe or more of pneumonia increased their pulmonary V1 resistances and slightly decreased their arterial o tensions hypoxia increased and hyperoxia decreased their pulmonary vascular resistances during o breathing arterial po was less during than before the pneumonia and increased when pulmonary perfusion was diverted away from the diseased lung in dogs PLB air forcing the cardiac output through the diseased lung caused an increase in vascular resistance that could clearly be reduced by o PLB in dogs lung mast cell counts showed no decrease in the lobes with pneumonia in pneumococcal pneumonia the hypoxic pulmonary pressor mechanism serves to decrease blood flow to the diseased lobes and thus to maintain the arterial po lung mast cells could participate in this response
1997,the mechanism by which clonidine suppresses RR was investigated in conscious rats this suppression was studied by means of selected autonomic interventions in conjunction with changes in sodium balance serum renin activity and direct arterial pressure were monitored clonidine administration suppressed basal by diureticinduced by and sympathetic nervous systemmediated by RR ACh ganglionic and peripheral sympathetic neuronal blockade did not prevent this inhibitory effect of clonidine these results indicate a peripheral site of action for suppression of renin release by clonidine the alphaadrenergic blocking drug phentolamine prevented clonidine suppression of renin release in sodiumdepleted rats and was partially effective in normal rats phentolamine blocked the decrease in renin caused by clonidine in ganglionblocked rats CLZ a new neuroleptic agent with alphaadrenergic blocking activity or phenoxybenzamine blocked the effect of clonidine on renin release in both sodiumdepleted and normal rats after ganglionic blockade in sodiumdepleted rats clonidine caused a significantly greater suppression of RR than did an equipressor dose of methoxamine these data combined with hemodynamic correlates suggest that clonidine inhibits renin release by activation of an intrarenal alphaadrenergic receptor
1998,IC blood flow ifbf was determined in each of nine macaca mulatta by means of a flow transducer implanted around an IC the monkeys were lightly anesthetized intubated and paralyzed normoxia and normocarbia were maintained stable throughout the experiment icbf was monitored while mean arterial blood pressure mabp was lowered by withdrawal of blood mabp was kept within the known limits of autoregulation in order not to compromise cbf cerebrospinal fluid csf from the cisterna magna was analyzed for ph pco and po before and after a min hypotensive period in which mabp was lowered from to mmhg mean se corresponding hco concentrations were calculated the decrease in mabp did not result in a significant reduction in icbf but elicited a reduction in calculated cerebrovascular resistance indicating normal autoregulation mena csf ph was not significantly decreased p less than it changed from to after the induced hypotensive period thus csf ph does not appear to have a significant role in CBF blood flow autoregulation
1999,a nonadrenergic inhibitory nervous system has been demonstrated in the guinea pig trachea electrical FS of this system in the presence of adrenergic and cholinergic blockade resulted in relaxation of tracheal rings contracted by the mediators of immediate hypersensitivity or histamine the relaxation was blocked by tetrodotoxin which indicated that nerve stimulation was responsible for the relaxation the gastrointestinal tract which has a similar embryological origin to the respiratory tract also has a nonadrenergic GABA system in the gastrointestinal tract this system is thought to be responsible for the relaxation phase of peristalsis and absence of this system in the colon and the rectum is thought to be an explanation for the spastic bowel in hirschsprungs disease it is possible that an abnormality of the respiratory nonadrenergic GABA system may play a role in the pathogenesis of the hyperreactive airways in asthma the airways due to a lack of inhibition may be either partially contracted or unable to relax and thus appear hyperreactive to stimuli
