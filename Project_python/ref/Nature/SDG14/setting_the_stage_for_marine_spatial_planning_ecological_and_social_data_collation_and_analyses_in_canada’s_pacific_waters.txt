Canadas Pacic coast is one region where there is a renewed commitment to pursue marine spatial
planning (MSP). The British Columbia Marine Conservation Analysis (BCMCA) project aimed to set the
stage for MSP, and was designed to provide resource managers, scientists, decision-makers, and
stakeholders with a new set of resources to inform coast-wide integrated marine planning and
management initiatives. Geographic Information Systems and the decision support tool Marxan were
used to develop two main products: (1) an atlas of known marine ecological values and human uses;
and (2) analyses of areas of conservation value and human use value. 110 biophysical datasets and 78
human use datasets were collated and rened where applicable, as identied through ve ecological
expert workshops, one expert review of physical marine classication and representation, and guidance
from the human use data working group. Ecological data richness maps and Marxan results show the
importance of nearshore and continental shelf regions. Data richness maps for the six categories of
human uses show that all, except shipping and transport, are also closely linked to the shoreline and
continental shelf. An example ecological Marxan solution identifying areas of conservation value
overlapped human use sector footprints by percentages ranging from 92% (i.e., 92% of planning units
selected by Marxan also contain commercial sheries) to 3%. The experience of the BCMCA project has
the potential to provide valuable guidance to regions seeking to jump-start planning processes by
collating spatial information and carrying out exploratory analyses.

1. Introduction
Declining marine resources and ecosystem services [1], and
evidence that sector-based approaches to management have been
inadequate at achieving sustainability [2], have led to increased global
interest in marine spatial planning (MSP) [2,3]. MSP is a framework
that informs the spatial distribution of marine activities to support
current and future uses, and maintain delivery of ecosystem services
to meet ecological, economic and social objectives [2]. Complementary literature on systematic conservation planning emphasises the
importance of rigorous process, transparency and efciency (e.g.,
through setting quantitative targets) throughout the planning process
[4,5]. One example of combined systematic conservation planning
and MSP is the rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, which
assigned six different zones, allowing a range of uses, in a region

about 350,000 km2 [6]. Many regions are following suit, instigating
systematic MSP processes [e.g., Belgium, 7, California, 8, Australia, 9].
As illustrated in MSP exercises worldwide, a critical component
to its efcacy is comprehensive ecological and social data to support
the process [2]. Ecological data are necessary to identify areas of
importance for biodiversity conservation and delivery of ecosystem
services. Data on human activities are useful for identifying areas of
importance to marine industries and other uses. The combination of
ecological and human use data is particularly valuable in explicitly
identifying overlapping interest to multiple users and/or biodiversity
conservation, and investigating tradeoffs [8]. Spatial data are also
necessary to use decision-support tools, such as Marxan [10,11] or
Marxan with Zones [12]. Such decision-support tools can aid MSP by
identifying options for areas requiring special management [e.g.,
marine protected areas, 6], or human use areas [e.g., designated
shing areas, 13].
Canadas Pacic coast (province of British Columbia, BC) is
one region where there is a renewed commitment to carry out
MSP, also referred to as Integrated Management in Canada [14].
In particular, the provincial government is partnering with some

12

N.C. Ban et al. / Marine Policy 39 (2013) 1120

coastal First Nations to create marine plans, through what is
called the Marine Planning Partnership for the North Pacic Coast
(www.mappocean.org), and the federal government is working on
a planning process called the Pacic North Coast Integrated
Management Area. In other areas, such as the west coast of
Vancouver Island, MSP has been taking place via local community,
First Nations and government partnerships (i.e., West Coast
Aquatic, http://westcoastaquatic.ca/plans/). While these initiatives are promising, previous discussions about MSP have been
slow to get started, which has signicantly impeded progress to
date [1517].
The British Columbia Marine Conservation Analysis (BCMCA)
project emerged from the interest of a multitude of stakeholders
to set the stage for MSP in British Columbia. The BCMCA (www.
bcmca.ca) is a collaborative project designed to provide resource
managers, scientists, decision-makers, and those with a vested
interest in the marine environment with a new set of resources to
inform coast-wide integrated marine planning and management
initiatives. Furthermore, the BCMCA project set out to spatially
identify marine areas of high conservation value and areas
important to human use in Canadas Pacic Ocean. The BCMCA
is not a planning process as it does not have the ability or
mandate to implement management actions, and it does not seek
to replace planning initiatives that are underway or in preparation. Rather, the results are intended to inform and help advance
marine planning initiatives in BC by providing collaborative
analyses based on the best available ecological and human use
spatial data at scales relevant to a BC coast-wide analysis. The
BCMCA project is coordinated by a Project Team, comprised of
representatives from the Canadian government, BC government,
First Nations (self-dened as observers), academia, marine users
and environmental organisations, which is responsible for coordinating, organising and implementing the project. The BCMCA
projects ecological objectives were to represent the diversity of
BCs marine ecosystems across their natural range of variation,
maintain viable populations of native species, sustain ecological
and evolutionary processes within an acceptable range of variability, and build a conservation network that is resilient to
environmental change. The history and approach of the project
has been described by Ban et al. [18], and supporting documents
can be found online (www.bcmca.ca).
The purpose of this paper is to report the process and results of
the multi-year BCMCA effort, and discuss its relevance to BC and
beyond. With increasing global popularity of MSP, the impetus for
the BCMCA project, an interest by a diversity of stakeholders to
set the stage for MSP is likely emerging in many regions of the
world. The experience of the BCMCA project has the potential to
provide valuable guidance to those regions seeking to jump-start
planning processes by collating spatial information and carrying
out exploratory analyses.

2. Methods
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and the decision support tool Marxan were used to develop two main products: (1) an
atlas of known marine ecological values and human uses; and
(2) analyses to identify areas of high conservation value and areas
important to human use. The BCMCA Project Team guided and
implemented the methods, informed by ecological and human
use experts who provided overarching direction and advice about
the collation, use and analyses of data. All data layers were stored,
mapped and documented using ArcGIS (versions 9.010). Key
steps of the Marxan analyses, after data were collated, were to
create planning units, develop targets, carry out calibration, run
analyses, and draft reports explaining results.

2.1. Collation of existing data
Differing approaches were used to identify ecological and human
use data to incorporate in the BCMCA project. Ecological features
and datasets recommended by experts via workshops were collated
and prepared for use in Marxan. Individual workshops were held for
seabirds, marine plants, marine mammals, marine and anadromous
sh, and marine invertebrates. Approaches used, and other details of
the workshops, are described in Ban et al. [18]. A list of features and
datasets to represent the physical marine environment was rst
proposed by the BCMCA Project Team based on a review of similar
projects, then revised following expert review. Once all available
datasets for a given feature were obtained, data were collated using
GIS and prepared following advice given at the workshops or given
by data providers. Checkplots of mapped features and supporting
metadata, which documented collation and preparation methods,
were reviewed by workshop participants and/or data providers
in a comprehensive review process. Review questionnaires asked
reviewers to (1) conrm existing target ranges or recommend new
values, (2) comment on data collation and preparation methods, (3)
comment on the appropriateness of older data, (4) recommend
dates of expiry for use of these data in a marine planning context,
and (5) make the project aware of additional data sources.
Human use datasets were rst sourced by BCMCA Project
Team members within each of their organisations (e.g., federally
held sheries data, provincially held recreation data). Example
maps were drafted and a review of these data was sought through
a two-pronged strategy of group-by-group engagement and the
formation of a human use data working group to advise on the
collation, mapping and analysis of human use data. Six sectors or
categories of human use were identied (i.e., commercial sheries, recreational sheries, ocean energy, shipping and transportation, tenures, and recreation and tourism), and a nomination
process was held for each sector to self-identify two representatives to participate in the working group. The working group was
lead by a neutral facilitator and was designed to be broadly
representative of user groups, but participants were not expected
to represent a constituency in any formal capacity. The working
group held thirteen meetings over almost 2 years. Two of the
working group representatives  with the support of the rest of
the working group  also participated on the Project Team.
Due to data limitations, it was not possible to create spatial
data for some recommended features, while other datasets not
specically mentioned at workshops were developed from available data (e.g., general kelp). While the focus of the BCMCA
project was to collate existing data, opportunities arose to create
or update some ecological and human use datasets. Known gaps
in digital datasets for four ecological features were lled by
digitising data (e.g., central coast Marbled Murrelet surveys). For
the purposes of the BCMCA, the existing provincial benthic
classication scheme was replaced by a new benthic classication
developed by Parks Canada using methods published by the
Nature Conservancy (TNC) [19]. The benthic classication combined three parameters: (i) landscape features, (ii) depth, and (iii)
substrate in order to identify areas of similar benthic characteristics. Human use datasets were reviewed by the appropriate
sector and some were deemed outdated or inadequate for marine
planning. A comprehensive local knowledge collection project,
funded and overseen by the BCMCA, was undertaken through
consultation with members of the Sport Fishing Advisory Board to
update sport shing data. BCMCA also undertook work which
enabled access to spatial data describing commercial sheries
including Roe Herring, Sardine, and Salmon sheries. In addition,
oil and gas prospectivity data were updated, cruise ship and ferry
route data were corrected, and multiple datasets were merged
and/or veried with knowledgeable users to develop updated and

corrected, coast wide scuba diving, campsite and marine facilities
(marinas and other tourism facilities with docks) data. The
BCMCA also developed a dataset illustrating areas of interest for
ocean energy (wave and tidal) through a participatory exercise at
a mapping workshop.
Once all features were compiled and reviewed, maps and
descriptive information were combined into atlas pages, available
online (www.bcmca.ca). Maps showing the number of features
found in each planning unit (i.e., data richness maps) were
created for each ecological group and human use sector, counting
only datasets designated for use in Marxan.
2.2. Marxan analyses
Marxan (version 2.1.1) was used to identify areas of high
conservation value and areas important to human use. Marxan is
a free decision support tool that nds efcient solutions to the
problem of selecting a set of areas that meet a suite of conservation [10,20] or human use targets [e.g., 13]. Explanations of how
Marxan works have been provided in detail elsewhere and are not
repeated here (e.g., see the Marxan website http://www.uq.edu.
au/marxan/). An expert workshop was held in May 2009, bringing
together Marxan practitioners to advise the BCMCA on its proper
and robust use and make recommendations related to specic
questions posed by the BCMCA (proceedings from the workshop
can be found at http://www.bcmca.ca/document-library/). During
the Marxan experts workshop, a new tool called Marxan with
Zones [12] was recommended for running analyses incorporating
human use data. At that time BCMCA decided it was not feasible
to use Marxan with Zones due to the learning curve, time
constraints and the unproven nature of the new tool. Instead, all
the human use scenarios were designed to use Marxan to identify
areas important to human use by exploring what happens to the
footprint if uses were reduced.
2.2.1. Dening targets
Targets for ecological features are intended to quantify the
amount required to meet ecological objectives. At the ecological
workshops, experts were requested to recommend a range of targets
for each feature, spanning a minimum to preferred amount (see Ban
et al. [18] for details). Workshops were attended by regional species
experts who drew upon their own experience and knowledge to
recommend targets. Targets for physical classication and representation features were proposed by the Project Team and reviewed
by experts. During data review, workshop experts and data providers were given a chance to view the collated spatial data, and were
asked to review target recommendations and provide targets for any
features lacking an established target range. Any targets still missing
after the review were systematically assigned by the Project Team.
An unanticipated result of asking experts to recommend targets
through separate workshops was that values differed greatly among
ecological themes (e.g., recommended seabirds targets differed from
marine plant targets and invertebrate targets, etc). The BCMCA
Project Team decided to illustrate solutions for three added What
ify? scenarios using consistent targets for features in all ecological
themes. Target ranges for these scenarios were collaboratively set by
the BCMCA Project Team after consulting best practices, peerreviewed scientic literature and the advice of the ecological experts
(Fig. 1). Marxan scenarios were run using low, medium and high
target values for both the expert-recommended and Project Team
target ranges in order to visually display the impact that targets
have on the footprint of the Marxan solutions.
To incorporate human use features, the Project Team initially
suggested running Marxan for ecological features, using human
uses as a cost, as is commonly done in Marxan analyses [21].

Fig. 1. Criteria used by Project Team to set ecological targets. The owchart
indicates the process used for assigning targets to ecological features (i.e., whether
features are special or representational), and the corresponding percentage targets
used in the three scenarios.

Alternately, an option was to set targets for human use features,
which tells Marxan how much of each feature to include in the
solution (i.e., to identify areas of important for all human uses, as
per [13]). The human use data working group was introduced to
Marxan and ultimately recommended using a range of targets,
run through separate Marxan analyses for the six human use
sectors: (1) commercial sheries, (2) sport shing, (3) ocean
energy, (4) tourism and recreation, (5) tenures, and (6) shipping
and transportation. The idea of running one combined analysis for
all human uses did not receive support from the human use data
working group, primarily because of the variation in metrics and
quality among human use datasets (i.e. data varied from quantied use, to presence/absence to potential future areas of use), and
for this reason was not performed.
2.2.2. Calibration
Calibration was conducted to ensure that Marxan was behaving
in a robust and logical manner, following guidance from the BCMCA
Marxan expert workshop and Marxan Good Practices handbook
[22]. First, the inuence of the boundary cost was tested in order to
alleviate bias for or against external edges. This test highlighted
problems inherent in using two different-sized planning units
(nearshore and offshore) in the same analysis and a decision was
made to use consistent 2 km by 2 km planning units throughout the
study area (for a total of 120,499 planning units). The number of
iterations was tested to determine how many were sufcient, such
that Marxan consistently produced near optimal solutions. The
Boundary Length Modier (BLM) controls the importance of minimising the overall boundary length relative to minimising the total
area of the selected planning units. Increasing the BLM encourages
Marxan to select fewer, larger contiguous areas to meet its targets.
This parameter was tested in order to ne-tune the degree of
clumping present in the Marxan solutions. The Feature Penalty
Factor parameter is a user-dened weighting which controls how
much emphasis is placed on fully representing a particular input
feature in the solution. This parameter was calibrated to ensure that
Marxan was adequately reaching its targets for each input feature.
2.2.3. Ecological Marxan analyses
Once Marxan parameters were nalised through calibration,
the BCMCA explored a range of What ify? scenarios designed
to identify areas of high conservation value. Eighteen ecological
scenarios were used: High, medium and low target scenarios for
the targets set by experts during the workshops as well as those
identied by the Project Team. Each of these six scenarios had

14

N.C. Ban et al. / Marine Policy 39 (2013) 1120

three sub-scenarios with different BLMs. The best and summed
solutions were mapped for all scenarios.
2.2.4. Human use Marxan analyses
Marxan was used to produce a range of solutions for the
human use scenarios. In this case, the scenarios were designed to
explore the most efcient reduction of footprint for each human
use sector. For each of the six human use sectors, ve separate
scenarios were performed to explore how a range of reductions in
each sectors use would affect that sectors footprint. Reduction
values of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% were applied resulting in a
range of corresponding Marxan targets (95%, 90%, 85%, 80%, and
75%) and a total of 30 unique scenarios. Various metrics were
used in Marxan for characterising the human use data. Marxan
runs for commercial shing targeted total catch; ocean energy
used a combination of area and relative importance; shipping and
transport, and tourism and recreation, used relative intensity; and
sport shing and tenures used area. The best and summed
solutions for all scenarios were mapped but are not shown here.
2.2.5. Overlap analyses
ArcGIS was used to identify the per cent of overlap between
the six human use sectors and one example solution from an
ecological Marxan scenario. The scenario with the Project Team
medium targets and medium clump size was chosen for this
overlap analysis because it illustrates a middle-of-the-road scenario. For each of the human use sectors, the combined footprint
of all uses within each sector was used. Some caveats regarding
the footprint data are that they only reect the mapped footprint
(which may or may not represent the most current footprint), and
not the relative importance for any particular human use.

3. Results
3.1. Collation of existing data
110 biophysical datasets were collated and rened, where
applicable, to create 200 features, many of which were targeted by
class or region in the Marxan analyses (see Supplementary Table 1).
Reports from each of the workshops were posted online (http://
www.bcmca.ca/document-library/). Once the datasets were collated
into the recommended features, the features were reviewed by
experts. Features, and reviewer comments for each feature, can be
found in the online data library (http://www.bcmca.ca/data/).
Seventy-eight human use datasets were collated and rened
where applicable (see Supplementary Table 2). These datasets
were identied through the process described in Section 2.1
above. Once the datasets were collated into features for each
human use sector, members of the human use data working
group were provided an opportunity to review relevant features.
The purpose of the review was threefold; to identify deciencies
in the data, to identify missing or proprietary data, and to record
concerns about use of the data. In some cases features and
descriptions drafted for atlas facing pages were circulated to
other experts (i.e. people who partake in those uses) for further
review; in others (i.e. tenures) no review was undertaken as the
data were generally considered accurate. Features, and reviewer
comments for each feature or human use, can be found in the
online data library (http://www.bcmca.ca/data/).
3.2. Marxan analyses
3.2.1. Targets
Low, medium and high values for ecological targets were
identied from the ranges recommended at expert workshops (as

described in Section 2.2.1) (see Supplementary Table 1). For the
Project Team scenarios, features were split into two categories:
representational (i.e., whether the feature represents an ecosystem
or species) or special (i.e., higher target warranted if a species has
been listed as endangered or threatened, for example, Fig. 1).
Representational features were assigned low, medium and high
targets of 10, 20 and 30% while special features were assigned
targets of 20, 40 and 60%. The Project Team also considered using
the footprint  spatial extent  of a feature to determine targets
(i.e., so that features covering a large portion of the coast have
smaller targets than those with small footprints), but decided not
to pursue this criteria because no feature covered more than 14 per
cent of the coast, and it would have raised too many additional
questions (e.g., Should the % of shoreline linear features be
calculated for each ecoregion? Or for the coast overall? What
happens if % is high in just one region? How high is too high?).
Human use targets were set based on the human use working
group recommendation of conducting analyses where the use
declines by 5% for each scenario, and the metric for that use
depends upon the sector. Therefore scenarios consisting of these
ve target values: 95%, 90%, 85%, 80% and 75% were run for each
of the six human use sectors.
3.2.2. Calibration
Sensitivity tests uncovered a problem with the initial plan of
using two different-sized planning units (smaller nearshore and
larger offshore) in the same Marxan analysis. Marxan solutions for
runs using a BLM equal to zero, area as cost, and a single feature
lling all planning units equally but targeted at 30%, signicantly
favoured the smaller planning units (Fig. 2). The problem was
resolved by using only one size of planning units, although the
trade-off was increased computing time. Additional details of how
the problem was discovered and solved are provided in the Marxan
Good Practices Handbook, Version 2 (Box 8.1) [22].
Other calibration tests included number of iterations, boundary
length modier, and feature penalty. We determined that 750
million or 1 billion iterations effectively and efciently produced
solutions that adequately considered the solution space (Fig. 3A).
The ecological runs used 1 billion iterations while the human use
runs used 750 million iterations because there were more ecological
features than human use features, thus warranting more iterations.
The BLM for the ecological analyses was determined by calibration
and visual inspection of several options and consensus decision by
the Project Team (Fig. 3B). BLMs of 0, 750, and 2500 were chosen to

Fig. 2. Illustration of the problem of using two sizes of planning units. The effect
was tested with one feature that was distributed across all planning units, with
cost reecting the size of planning units. The smaller planning units located
inshore of the continental shelf, 2 km by 2 km, were selected more frequently
(redder, darker colours) than the larger 4 km by 4 km planning units located
offshore (yellow, lighter colours).

illustrate results with no BLM and possible solutions to the range of
What ify? scenarios that might be recommended by planners.
The human use runs used a BLM of 1000, accepted by the human
use data working group as the most appropriate BLM suitable for
use across all six sectors. A consistent feature penalty factor of 8 was
used for ecological features, and 500 for human use features.
3.2.3. Ecological Marxan analyses
Ecological data and Marxan results show the importance of
nearshore and continental shelf regions. Overlaying all ecological
datasets (i.e., displaying data richness, Fig. 4) shows that much of the
available data hugs the shoreline, likely the result of a combination of
survey effort and actual elevated biodiversity along the nearshore and
on the continental shelf. The various ecological Marxan results  low,
medium, and high targets (expert [Fig. 5] and Project Team derived
[Fig. 6]) using medium and large clumps  highlight similar areas as
being of high conservation value. The results are intuitive: lower
targets depict fewer areas as being of high importance compared to

high targets, and medium clump size solutions shows smaller areas
highlighted than those with large clump size (Figs. 5 and 6). Despite
having different target ranges, the expert-set and Project Team-set
target ranges (medium, high) show similar patterns and areas as
being important for conservation. Targets were met 95% of the time
or better. The expert recommended targets ranged up to 100%, and
features targeted at this level were underrepresented more often than
others.
3.2.4. Human use Marxan analyses
Data richness layers for the six categories of human uses show
that all, except for shipping and transport, are closely linked to
the shoreline and continental shelf (Fig. 7). As expected, the
Marxan results closely mirror the data richness layers, with areas
of higher data richness selected more frequently in Marxan. The
human use sectors had concerns about the limitations of the
input data (see discussion), and did not want the results published; hence the maps are not included.

3.2.5. Overlap analyses
Overlapping the footprint of one example solution of an
ecological Marxan scenario with the footprint of each of the six
human use sectors showed that all sectors utilise areas that
appear in the Marxan solution as areas of high conservation
value. The percentage of the Marxan solution that overlapped
the sector use footprints ranged from 92% (i.e., 92% of planning
units selected by Marxan also contain commercial sheries) to 3%.
Conversely, the area of each sector footprint that overlapped with
the example Marxan solution ranged from 18% to 23% (Table 1).

4. Discussion
The BCMCA projects multi-year effort to collate existing
data, augment existing datasets by making additional and new
data available, and provide examples of Marxan analyses, has
made available an impressive resource for marine planners and

stakeholders in British Columbia and elsewhere. The project
attempted to follow best practices for data analysis [22] for not
only ecological conservation scenarios, but also for involving
stakeholder groups and integrating human use data into analyses
[23,24]. These data and supporting Marxan analyses may also
have utility for habitat mangers, marine ecologists, oil spill
response teams, coarse scale environmental assessments and
marine protected area designall applications beyond the projects intent to support MSP efforts. It provides a successful
example of a collaborative effort to move ahead with preparatory
work for marine planning without requiring the mandate to carry
out the planning, a situation that likely applies to many other
regions where marine planning has not been initiated.
While data collation is time-intensive, although relatively
straightforward, the experience of the BCMCA project with
Marxan analyses highlights several lessons that may be of interest
to similar endeavours elsewhere. First, setting conservation

targets is notoriously difcult [25,26] and although the BCMCA
projects approach of using workshops, organised by ecological
theme, provided some good input and advice, it also created
several challenges. It proved difcult to get experts to recommend percentage targets for features and, for those that were
provided either as specic numbers or as ranges, values differed
greatly among ecological themes (e.g., recommended seabirds
targets differed from marine plant targets and invertebrate
targets, etc). Also, experts tended to recommend very high
percentage targets, often 100% for some features, which can skew
the results for features with a large spatial footprint and resulted
in some feature targets not being achieved in scenario results.
Follow-up sensitivity analyses with several increases to the
number of iterations did not solve this problem, conrming
recommendations not to use 100% target values [22]. As a way
around these issues related to expert recommended targets, the
BCMCA Project Team decided to illustrate solutions for three

added What ify? scenarios using consistent targets for features
in all ecological themes. This also served as a sensitivity analysis
of the effect of varying the targets, and showed that the results
(i.e., the patterns of areas of conservation value) were quite robust
to such variations.

Second, the creation of a human use data working group was a
key strength of the BCMCA project, but more could have been
done to involve human users earlier and more effectively [23,24].
A common recommendation for marine planning and conservation projects is to be inclusive and transparent [2,2729]. The
BCMCA project started with a focus on identifying ecological areas
of conservation importance in the marine environment in British
Columbia [18], with Project Team members or observers from
academia, federal and provincial governments, environmental
groups, and First Nations groups (the latter self-identied as
observers). It soon became apparent that the input of marine
users would be crucial in identifying these areas of importance,
and the human use data working group was conceived. However,
because marine users were not part of the inception of the
project, a fact that could not be changed, they may have felt less
ownership of the project than other project team members. It also
created some challenges for the desired outputs and the overall
scope of the project because some marine users wanted to amend
some components. In response, the project team strengthened the

N.C. Ban et al. / Marine Policy 39 (2013) 1120

terms of reference and claried terminology based on comments
from marine users. Additional time was needed to build the new
relationships with marine users within the Project Team. Furthermore, members of the working group had a different background
than most of the Project Team, and for this reason a concerted
effort was made to introduce Marxan and systematic conservation planning concepts to them. Terminology used in conservation planning did not always directly translate to the day-to-day
lexicon of members of the working group, highlighting the
importance of regular, two-way communication. A facilitator,
independent of the process, was hired to ensure the working
group process was meaningful to participants, that all participants input was obtained, concerns recognised, addressed where
possible, and documented where they could not be addressed.
Third, experts, including human use sector representatives,
were crucial to identifying the limitations of existing human use
data for use in Marxan, and data gaps. Challenges are similar for
ecological and human use data. For example, some species distributions and human uses are seasonal, and where spatially
explicit seasonality data are missing, Marxan results do not capture
such nuanced information. Similarly, some areas may be particularly important for some species or human uses (e.g., spawning
grounds, shipping trafc to small communities, shing areas close
to communities), but this level of detail may not be represented in
available data. Thus, although analyses were designed to identify
areas important to ecosystems and human users, with little or no
relative value information in the data sets, Marxan uses data
density to determine areas of importance. Another data limitation
is that the time period over which data were originally collected
was not consistent. Some data are older, even though they may be
the best-available data, and data sets for different features used in
a single analysis may have been compiled for different time
periods. Furthermore, data illustrated for some features may not
reect current or future reality in terms of the various measures of
relative importance. Both ecological and human use features shift
spatially over time due to ongoing changes in the environment and
management. Thus feedback from the human use sectors was that
the Marxan results for human uses were of limited value, and may
not represent actual areas of importance.
Fourth, as highlighted in the Marxan Good Practices Handbook
[22], the BCMCA project found that calibrating parameters in
Marxan and documenting and communicating data limitations
was crucial. Calibration uncovered problems with the external edges
and the use of two sizes of planning units. Without careful
calibration, the analyses would not be robust, and the results might
not have represented areas of conservation value. Similarly, because
such a project involves a vast amount of data and numerous data
providers, clear and transparent documentation of the limitations of
each dataset is very important. Without this, the integrity of the
project and its results could be compromised. One of the particular
strengths of the BCMCA projects atlas is that it pairs each map with
a facing page that documents details of the data sources, limitations,
and any other comments noted as important by peer reviewers of
the dataset(s) illustrated on the map.
Fifth, unfamiliarity with Marxan was an obstacle, but a
surmountable one. Education about Marxan, how it works, what
it does, and what it is used for, was necessary with most
participantse.g., ecological experts, data providers, government
employees, non-prot groups and marine users. Much effort was
put into educating participants about this tool and its potential
uses and limitations. An ancillary benet to the marine based
community in British Columbia is a better understanding of
Marxan, both its strengths and limitations. This may prove useful
for marine planning processes in the future.
Finally, while the BCMCA project was made possible in part
because of the commitment and dedication of many people who

19

volunteered their time, having adequate funding ultimately made
the project possible. Some groups needed funding to participate,
workshops cost money, GIS contractors were needed for preparation of the many datasets, and so on. Thus, while volunteer efforts
can go a long way to instigating a data collation and analysis
project, to realise its full potential, the BCMCA required nancial
resources to be completed.
Ultimately, one of the most important benets of a project
such as the BCMCA is the development and maintenance of
working relationships among stakeholder groups. As shown by
the exploratory overlap analyses, marine areas of conservation
value in the Canadian Pacic are also important to a variety of
stakeholders. The process that the BCMCA project developed 
including development of a Project Team, human use working
group, user group outreach, presentations to planners  served to
get parties to work together, strengthen relationships, raise
awareness about the need for data collation and analysis, and
educate marine users and others on the value of quality data and
Marxan analyses. Communication with collaborators was a part of
the project throughout. Such benets are difcult to substantiate,
yet anecdotal feedback from participants indicates that communication and collaboration among stakeholders has improved
because of the project, and that the BCMCAs data products are
in high demand.
This project afrmed the importance of several issues discussed in the marine spatial planning and conservation planning
literatures. Involving stakeholders early in the process is important for their support for the project [23,24], but it is also difcult
to conceive a project with all stakeholders involveda conundrum that most planning processes are faced with [7,9,15,30].
Having good data is important for achieving quality analyses, but
much more emphasis exists in the literature on how to incorporate ecological than social data [2,3,23]. Ultimately, the acceptance of any projects analyses  and the BCMCAs in particular
because the project itself does not have an implementation
mandate  depends upon acceptance by stakeholders, which is
partly inuenced by the process followed and the quality of the
data and analyses.

5. Conclusion
The BCMCA project has been invaluable in supporting MSP
initiatives in British Columbia. The BCMCA project has received
additional funding for a period ending May 2013 for product
support, updates to select datasets, and support (if requested) to
marine planning processes that are now underway. Additional
communication and outreach are also planned to help people
understand and build trust in the data products and supporting
analyses. Furthermore, the Project Team is interested in exploring
tradeoffs and win-win solutions for human uses and conservation.
The simple overlap analyses reported here were illustrative only;
more sophisticated and informative analyses would be useful. For
example, possible use of a sister tool of Marxan, Marxan with Zones
[12], to develop trade-off curves between different human uses and
ecological features, is under discussion. This is one way to explore
analysing and visualising overlap amongst users and between
human uses and biodiversity hotspots.
