Abstract
Predicting when and where key oceanic processes will be encountered is problematic in dynamic coastal
waters where diverse physical, chemical, and biological factors interact in varied and rapidly changing combinations. Defining key processes often requires efficient sampling of specific water masses and prompt sample
return for subsequent analyses. This compound challenge motivated our efforts to develop mobile autonomous
process sampling (MAPS) for use with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). With this system, features are
recognized by artificial intelligence that integrates AUV sensor data to estimate probabilistic states for adaptive
control of survey navigation and triggering of targeted water samplers. To demonstrate the utility of the
MAPS/AUV system, we focused on intermediate nepheloid layers (INLs), episodic transport events that may play
a role in zooplankton ecology. During multiple field tests in Monterey Bay, California, the MAPS/AUV system
recognized, mapped, and sampled INLs. Invertebrate larvae contained in the water samples were subsequently
characterized with molecular probes developed for high-throughput screening. Preliminary results support the
hypothesis that INLs function as vehicles for episodic larval transport. Applying MAPS within a greater coastal
ocean observing system permitted description of regional oceanographic dynamics that influenced the patterns
and scales of INL and larval transport.

Understanding the hydrodynamic and biological processes
affecting the connectivity of natural populations is one of the
great challenges facing scientists and policy-makers involved in
coastal ocean management, defining marine protected areas,
and regulating sustainable fisheries (Gawarkiewicz et al. 2007;
Hare and Walsh 2007; Marinone et al. 2008). The connectivity
of most benthic organisms is strongly influenced by interactions between pelagic larval stages and hydrodynamics that
vary spatially, from local to basin-scale, and temporally, from
episodic to climatic. Identifying larval species, determining

their longevities in the water column, and assessing hydrodynamic processes that transport them, however, are very difficult (Brown and Roughgarden 1985; Garland and Zimmer
2002; Shanks and Brink 2005). Approaches needed to advance
this challenging research include in situ molecular detection of
marine larvae (Goffredi et al. 2006; Jones et al. 2008), adaptive
sampling methods capable of responding in real-time to eventdriven transport processes (Pineda et al. 2007), and long-term
studies that examine interactions between hydrodynamic and
biological processes (Cowen et al. 2007).
Intermediate nepheloid layers (INLs) have the potential to
influence geographical connectivity of benthic species having
pelagic larval stages. Forced by diverse physical processes, INLs
develop episodically from transport of the turbid bottom
boundary layer (BBL) (Pak et al. 1980; Hickey et al. 1986;
Washburn et al. 1993; Houghton and Visbeck 1998; McPheeShaw et al. 2004; Ryan et al. 2005). To effectively study INLs
and evaluate their potential role in connectivity essentially
requires the abilities to search for, detect, map, and sample
unpredictable, episodic phenomena. Here we report on novel
capabilities to robotically map and obtain water samples from
INLs with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Engineering aspects of the water sampling system were previously doc-

umented (Bird et al. 2007). The artificial intelligence (AI) software capable of recognizing oceanic features with AUV sensor
data and adaptively controlling the AUV has also been documented (Fox et al. 2007; McGann et al. 2008). This study is the
first demonstrative application of these novel advancements
to a methods-limited area of marine ecology. We have coupled
these engineering advancements for AUVs with (1) highthroughput molecular methods for the detection of larval
invertebrates (Jones et al. 2008), and (2) data from a coastal
ocean observing system, to illustrate how mobile autonomous
process sampling (MAPS) can synergistically link emergent
technologies.

Materials and procedures

Fig. 1. The Dorado AUV and its water sampling system. The AUV (A) is
4.2 m in length and has a diameter of 0.53 m at its midsection. The
water-sampling midsection (B) is covered by the AUV fairing during
deployment. Intake valves of individual Gulper water samplers penetrate
the lower half of the AUV fairing (empty upper-left sample container slot
in B).

We employed the MBARI AUV Dorado, an operational system
with an extensive suite of physical, optical, and chemical sensors
for interdisciplinary research. Specifics of AUV sensors and methods of data processing have been published (Ryan et al. 2008). A
custom AUV midsection was developed for Dorado to support
operation of ten Gulper water samplers (Fig. 1). For a complete
engineering description of the Gulper sampler design, see Bird et
al. (2007). Here we describe the science-motivated functional
requirements of the sampling system design. All sampler materials are non-toxic, and no materials can introduce iron, a limiting
nutrient for phytoplankton in the study region (Fitzwater et al.
2003). To avoid source-water mixing that could occur in a shared
sample-intake duct, each sampler intake valve opens directly to
the outside the AUV mid-body to ensure discrete sample acquisition. To avoid sample contamination after acquisition, each sampler has a pressure-compensating diaphragm to ensure that pressure oscillations of AUV yoyo surveys do not pump fluid across
the intake valve. The design supports a depth rating of 1500 m,
much greater than the typical operating depth of this AUV (< 300
m, as constrained by the depth rating of one sensor). The relatively large individual sample size of 2 L was motivated by the
need to sample biological constituents that may be at low concentrations. Rapid (1-2 s) sample intake, which motivated the
name Gulper, serves two requirements: (1) it ensures that highly
localized samples can be taken from vertical profiles of a rapidly
moving AUV, and (2) it minimizes the opportunity for swimming
plankton to escape capture. Sample acquisition start and end
times are recorded by the AUV main computer to allow precise
co-location of water samples with AUV sensor data.
The AI advancements of this research employ a newly
developed Teleo-Reactive EXecutive (T-REX) control system
that integrates probabilistic state estimation, planning, and
execution (McGann et al. 2008). T-REX is built upon the paradigm of sense-plan-act (Gat 1998) to autonomously synthesize
control actions. Onboard the AUV, T-REX senses the environment using the vehicles sensors, generates a plan by deliberating about the best way to accomplish specified goals, and
executes the plan. It automatically re-plans when the perceived environmental or system states do not match expectations encoded in the synthesized plan.

Deliberation in T-REX utilizes methods developed for
applying mature computational techniques to command
NASA space missions (Muscettola et al. 1998; Jonsson et al.
2000; Rajan et al. 2000; Ai-Chang et al. 2004; Bresina et al.
2005). T-REXs architecture handles deliberation with modules
called reactors, each of which is a planning and execution
component. Reactors are differentiated on the basis of functional scope, indicating appropriate variables of interest for
reasoning, and temporal scope, indicating the horizon over
which to plan and the speed at which a reactor should reason.
Each control loop is embodied within a reactor that encapsulates all details of how to accomplish its control objectives,
with the overall T-REX agent coordinating all concurrent control loops. The agent fielded on the Dorado AUV has three
reactors, a mission manager (MM) that plans and reasons
about mission requirements, a navigator that manages the
MM sub-goals and determines navigation and localization for
the vehicle, and an executive that dispatches commands to
the low level functional layer of the vehicle to actuate control.
The MM can reason about plan alternatives for periods on the
order of minutes whereas the executive has to resolve its goals
with little or no delay; the temporal scope of the navigator lies
in between.
To detect INLs using T-REX, we use Hidden Markov Models
(HMM) (Rabiner and Juang 1986) to classify and enable online
estimation based on offline machine learning techniques (Fox
et al. 2007). To execute the HMM for feature detection, we
encode it directly within the unified representational and computational framework of a T-REX reactor, allowing for a seamless integration of state estimation through synchronization
and planning. The reactor receives the state estimation, and the
implications are applied by the planner and resolved while considering the entire context of the plan. If the target feature is
detected with a specified level of certainty, and other sampling

constraints are met (such as spatial separation requirements
between samples), they together initiate a re-planning by TREX. Execution of the new plan results in triggering sample
acquisition and/or adapting navigational control of the AUV.
INLs can be detected optically by elevated attenuation and
backscattering of light caused by their relatively high concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM). Although phytoplankton cells also cause elevated attenuation and backscattering, they are distinguishable from INLs by the fluorescence
of their chlorophyll. Therefore, INLs are characterized by high
optical backscattering and low chlorophyll fluorescence. We
used optical backscattering and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements from a HOBI Labs HS2 sensor for training and realtime application of the INL cluster analysis (Fox et al. 2007).
Training of the INL clustering algorithm used a 5-year (20032007) time-series of approximately monthly AUV vertical sections (Transects T1 and T2 in Fig. 2). This data set was also used
to identify the location of most frequent and intense INL signals, which defined the domain for autonomous detection,
mapping, and sampling of INLs in this study (box in Fig. 2).
Definition of a survey volume for MAPS testing, rather than a
linear vertical section, was motivated by scientific and operational reasons. Scientifically, a volume survey permits threedimensional resolution of INL patchiness. Operationally, a volume survey introduces more degrees of freedom in
autonomous control of the AUV. In each MAPS field test, T-REX
was applied to (1) detect INLs, (2) adapt survey navigation for
higher (lower) horizontal resolution of vertical sections in the
presence (absence) of INLs, (3) trigger Gulper water sampling,
and (4) control spatial allocation of samples within the survey
volume, using a minimum separation distance of 1 km.
MAPS missions were conducted on 10 Jan 2008 and 10 and
13 Nov 2008. Modifications of sample triggering control were
made between the January and November field tests to acquire
samples closer to the center of INLs. For the January test, samples were acquired as soon as the minimum probability of INL
detection (set to 0.4) was reached. For the December tests, the
learned model was improved by including information on INL
vertical position, and sample triggering control was separated
into two steps: (1) activation of a ready state when the minimum probability of INL detection (increased to 0.48) was
reached, and (2) triggering of the sample acquisition only
when the INL signal strength began to decrease, as would
occur when passing the layer peak. Following each ~7-h survey, water samples were immediately returned to shore and
transferred into clean carboys. Samples were then concentrated to 50 mL using a 100 m mesh filter and sterile seawater for rinsing. All water samples were processed and analyzed
using previously described molecular probes and sandwichhybridization assays (Scholin et al. 1999; Goffredi et al. 2006;
Jones et al. 2008). The molecular analyses applied in this study
allowed detection of crustaceans, polychaetes, and mollusks.
Remote sensing data from satellite sensors and shore-based
HF radar were used to examine event-driven transport phe-

nomena related to the observed INL and larval variability.
Methods for processing these remote sensing data have been
published (Paduan et al. 2006; Ryan et al. 2008).

Assessment
Interpretation and assessment of MAPS results will be aided
by first examining synoptic examples of INLs in the study
region. INL observations from two transects in Monterey Bay
are presented (Fig. 2). Transect T1 extends along Monterey
Submarine Canyon (MSC), and transect T2 crosses the northern and southern shelves, which are separated by MSC. Each
transect has been occupied ~ 50 times since 2003. For graphical representation in all examples presented (Fig. 3), areas of
relatively high particulate backscattering (> 75th percentile) at
470 nm are shaded gray, and isotherms are contoured. The
threshold chlorophyll fluorescence level for defining where
significant phytoplankton populations resided was determined statistically. The stippled areas in Fig. 3 indicate where
chlorophyll fluorescence intensity was above the level at
which bio-optical signal can be clearly distinguished from random noise in the chlorophyll fluorescence data.

0 km distance mark at 122.2W. Dates of the observations are (A) 21 Jan 2004 and (B) 14-15 Mar 2006. C and D are surveys along transect T2 (Fig. 2).
Dates of the observations are (C) 13 May 2005, and (D) 17 Dec 2004. In all panels, shaded areas indicate high particulate backscattering, stippled areas
indicate phytoplankton populations, and contour lines are isotherms (see text for further detail).
INLs in nature are defined by their structure, specifically a
layer of elevated concentrations of SPM originating and
detached from the BBL, and located between the BBL and the
surface. INLs are represented in Fig. 3 as areas of high optical
backscattering (shaded) and low chlorophyll fluorescence (no
stippling). Regions where INLs and phytoplankton populations intersect are ecologically significant because of the
potential chemical and biological influences of transported
BBL waters on plankton. For example, an INL that was
observed extending from ~60 m depth on the southern shelf
of Monterey Bay up into a phytoplankton layer at ~10 m
depth revealed a potential chemical influence of the INL on
the toxicity of a harmful algal bloom (HAB) species (Ryan et
al. 2005). Vertical transport into the mixed layer in this way
would also strongly influence the dynamical and biological
exposure of larvae transported with an INL. Internal tidal
oscillations of the thermocline over MSC can be up to ~100 m

in amplitude (Shea and Broenkow 1982). This physical forcing
in our study region may also be important to determining the
degree of coupling between the surface mixed layer and INLs
being transported over the canyon.
In the first example along transect T1 (Fig. 2), an INL was
observed as a contiguous feature along ~23 km, below 50 m
depth (Fig. 3A). In the second T1 example, INL patches were
mapped along ~33 km of the transect (Fig. 3B). While the previous example showed separation of the INL material and the
phytoplankton populations of the surface layer, this example
indicates that SPM of the INL patches were evidently intermixed with phytoplankton populations of the surface layer
(~3 to 20 km and near the end of the transect). In this example, the backscattering by phytoplankton was significantly less
than that caused by the INL, hence the absence of shading
throughout the stippled area of phytoplankton populations.
Without concurrent observations over the adjacent shelf

regions, it is not possible to determine where introduction of
SPM from the BBL to the mixed layer originated. Surveys
along transect T2, extending across the shelf and canyon (Fig.
2), better serve to identify INL source regions on the shelf. In
the first example (Fig. 3C), INLs were observed over the northern and southern shelves, and an INL patch over the canyon
evidently originated from the northern shelf (10 to 25 km
along transect, 40 to 90 m depth). In the second T2 example
(Fig. 3D), INLs observed over the northern and southern
shelves both extended over the canyon. Whereas the INLs
were concentrated in the thermocline, high optical backscattering levels of the INL over the northern shelf extended well
above the thermocline (~7-14 km along transect). This relatively shallow penetration of the INL coincided with outcropping of the 13C isotherm and sharp upward bending of
cooler isotherms below 30 m depth. A phytoplankton patch
also extended deepest in the water column (to ~60 m) immediately adjacent to a finger of the INL that penetrated shal-

lowest (~11-17 km along transect). These physical and biooptical patterns are consistent with enhanced vertical circulation in a frontal zone, and horizontal banding in the salinity
field (not presented) also indicated frontal dynamics.
With introductory perspective provided by synoptic examples of INLs, we now turn to assessment of the MAPS testing.
During the first experiment, INL waters were autonomously
detected in the pycnocline in all AUV profiles, and five INL
samples were acquired (Fig. 4). Because the optical properties
for INL detection in a vertical profile were first encountered
within the gradients of INL upper and lower boundaries, samples were preferentially acquired as the AUV traversed these
boundaries (Fig. 4b). The crustacean probe results were significant in all samples, whereas polychaete larvae were detected
only in the two samples nearest the upper and lower INL
boundaries (Table 1; Fig. 4b).
The second experiment advanced INL sampling and
hypothesis testing. INL samples were acquired on 2 d within a

4-d period, permitting examination of short-term temporal
variability, and samples were acquired both within and immediately outside INL patches, permitting biological screening of
both categories. Modification of the INL model (see Materials
and procedures) also allowed sample acquisition closer to the
center of INLs (compare Fig. 4b and 5b). Major changes were
observed in oceanographic conditions between 10 and 13
Nov. Decreased temperature and increased salinity resulted in

a significant density increase throughout the upper 100 m
(mean density profiles in Fig. 5A). Observations from a mooring 3 km west of the AUV survey domain showed intensification of upwelling-favorable (equatorward) winds during 10-13
Nov, and hydrographic changes like those observed in the
AUV surveys (mooring data not presented). These changes
indicated movement of recently upwelled waters into the
study site.

veyed over the canyon shifted strongly over the 3-d period
between 10 and 13 Nov (mean density profiles in Fig. 5A).
This indicates that the changes in INLs between 10 and 13
Nov were linked to the upwelling-forced hydrographic shift.
To simply illustrate how MAPS may be used more effectively
within the greater context of coastal ocean observing systems,
we present remote sensing data from the November experiment. Satellite imagery showed a plume of bright waters emanating from the Point Ao Nuevo upwelling center (large
arrow in Fig. 6). The coldest waters (label C) were in this bright
plume, linking the plume to upwelling. From this source
region, the bright waters extended into Monterey Bay and the
AUV survey domain, and southward past the bay. Average HF
radar velocity during 10-13 Nov showed southward transport
across the study domain (Fig. 6). The data indicate that the
hydrographic shift and the INLs sampled on 13 Nov originated north of the MAPS testing domain.
The general crustacean probe results were significant for all
samples from both November surveys (Table 1). The most interesting larval signal was the absence of polychaetes in INL samples from 10 Nov, before the upwelling pulse, and their presence in INL samples from 13 Nov, coincident with the
environmental and INL changes linked to the upwelling pulse
(Figs. 5, 6). Detection of barnacle and mussel larvae also
increased between 10 and 13 Nov (Table 1). Polychaete larvae
were detected in the samples having the highest particle
backscattering, near 15, 35, and 100 m depth (circled in Fig. 5B).
The samples without significant signal for polychaete larvae
(Fig. 5B) were sampled immediately outside an INL patch (#2;
the relationship was determined from the high-resolution profile data), and within a distinct INL patch centered at 60 m
depth (#4). Of all INL samples, #4 had the lowest red:blue
backscattering ratio, suggesting a somewhat different color, and
possibly sediment composition, in this spatially isolated patch.
Of the organisms targeted with molecular probes, polychaete larvae exhibited the clearest patterns. Polychaetes comprise the largest component of soft-sediment infauna, yet the
complete life history is known for only about 5% of the > 8000
described species (Ramey 2008). Presence/absence of polychaete larvae within/outside INL samples suggests that INLs
function as transport vehicles for their larval stages. Presence/absence of polychaete larvae in INL waters sampled during/before an upwelling pulse suggests that upwelling pulses
may generate hydrodynamic benthic-pelagic coupling essential to transport of their larval stages. In addition to the strong
benthic-pelagic coupling that occurs in the upwelling center
at Point Ao Nuevo (Fig. 6; Fitzwater et al. 2003), benthicpelagic coupling within Monterey Bay may be enhanced by
strong flow of upwelling filaments across the shelf.

Fig. 6. Remote sensing of coastal ocean dynamics related to the
observed oceanographic, INL, and larval variability. The true-color satellite image is from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS) Aqua sensor on 14 Nov 2008, and surface velocity vectors are
averaged from hourly CODAR measurements of 11-13 Nov 2008. The
gray rectangle shows the AUV survey domain, as in Fig. 2. A plume
emanated from the upwelling center at Point Ao Nuevo (thick gray
arrow). The labels C and W indicate the locations of the coldest and
warmest sea surface temperature, which differed by 3C.

Accompanying the 10-13 Nov hydrographic shift were
changes in the intensity and vertical distribution of INLs. INL
patches were detected over a greater depth range on 13 Nov,
when they were found between ~15 and 100 m, than on 10
Nov, when they were only below 80 m (Fig. 5B). By 13 Nov,
average optical backscattering (bb) increased significantly
above 80 m depth, with peaks centered near 15 and 60 m
depth, and bb decreased below 80 m. Whereas the average
chlorophyll profile remained very similar between 10 and 13
Nov (Fig. 5C), average bb increased significantly in parts of the
water column, by a factor of up to ~ 5 between 15 and 20 m
(Fig. 5B). These patterns indicate a major increase in SPM of
the surface mixed layer that was not caused by increased phytoplankton abundance, and it is consistent with the introduction of SPM into the surface mixed layer (e.g., Fig. 3B,D).
Without AUV data over the shelf (e.g., Fig. 3C,D), we cannot identify the source region for the strong SPM increase in
the mixed layer. However, the AUV data clearly show that
hydrographic conditions within the 100-m vertical extent sur-

Discussion
The aspect of marine ecology that we approached with the
newly developed MAPS system, population connectivity, is
extremely challenging. By their very nature as episodic trans400

port events that couple near/benthic habitat to the greater
pelagic environment, INLs have a potentially significant role
in the population connectivity of benthic species having
pelagic larval stages. MAPS detected, mapped, and sampled
INLs in each of the field studies. Recognizing the boundary
sampling inclination of the initial INL model in the first survey, we improved the model for better sample acquisition control and more consistently acquired samples from INL centers.
Because of the effective INL sampling by MAPS, we could
apply molecular methods to precisely targeted water samples
and identify larval constituents. Because these samples were
acquired within the environmental context provided by AUV
sensors and a greater coastal ocean observing system, we could
link larval patterns to oceanographic processes. The preliminary data set produced by this integration of autonomy,
oceanography, and molecular ecology yielded insights into
the constituents, dynamics, and scales of INL transport, and
thereby a compelling glimpse of the role of INL transport in
population connectivity. The MAPS system is being applied
for more extensive INL surveying to more thoroughly study
this multidisciplinary, multifaceted process.
The methodological requirements of the MAPS application
demonstrated here are representative of the requirements for
advancing studies of many other important coastal ocean
processes, for example episodic harmful algal blooms (HABs) or
development of riverine and estuarine plumes that follow
intense flushing of a land drainage basin. The stochastic nature
of complex marine ecosystems and the inability to adequately
sample these dynamic environments necessitate advanced
methods that intelligently focus limited observing and sampling resources when and where collection of data and samples
are most needed. The MAPS system represents a widely applicable approach to meeting this fundamental need.

ing multiple target states simultaneously. AUV onboard sample processing will support real-time alert capabilities for
processes such as HABs that may have immediate human
health or fisheries impacts. Ongoing development of molecular probes and methods will target a broader spectrum of
marine life and access more specific genes to identify organisms at lower taxonomic levels and to assess metabolic activities. Incorporation of preservation methods in water sampling
systems will be required for some biological applications.

Comments and recommendations
The critical requirements for applying MAPS to diverse
problems in coastal ocean science include (1) a robust AUV
with a sensor suite sufficient to detect processes of interest, (2)
a water sampling system with appropriate attributes (sample
volume, number, avoidance of contamination), (3) a data set
sufficient to develop an accurate model for target detection,
and (4) development of adaptive AUV control strategies
appropriate to the process of interest, e.g., increasing spatial
resolution of mapping when a target feature is detected.
Expanding the application of MAPS will benefit from other
developments. Two-way satellite communication with the
AUV, a capability recently demonstrated with the MAPS system, allows shore-side scientists to optimize or alter AUV survey characteristics based on real-time information coming
from the AUV or from other ocean-observing system assets.
State estimation models used to detect features may be
improved by continuously refining feature identification as
new data becomes available, and by incorporating greater
plasticity for adapting to variable signal intensities and track401
