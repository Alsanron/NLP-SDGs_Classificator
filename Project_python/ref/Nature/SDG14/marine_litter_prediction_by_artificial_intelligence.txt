Abstract
Articial intelligence techniques of neural network and fuzzy systems were applied as alternative methods to determine beach
litter grading, based on litter surveys of the Antalya coastline (the Turkish Riviera). Litter measurements were categorized and
assessed by articial intelligence techniques, which lead to a new litter categorization system. The constructed neural network
satisfactorily predicted the grading of the Antalya beaches and litter categories based on the number of litter items in the general
litter category. It has been concluded that, neural networks could be used for high-speed predictions of litter items and beach
grading, when the characteristics of the main litter category was determined by eld studies. This can save on eld eort when fast
and reliable estimations of litter categories are required for management or research studies of beachesespecially those concerned
with health and safety, and it has economic implications. The main advantages in using fuzzy systems are that they consider linguistic adjectival denitions, e.g. many/few, etc. As a result, additional information inherent in linguistic comments/renements and
judgments made during eld studies can be incorporated in grading systems.

1. Introduction
Litter in the marine environment leads to numerous
problems, which adversely aects coastal development
sectors. Marine litter is dened as solid materials of
human origin that are discarded at sea or reach the sea
through waterways or domestic or industrial outfall
(Williams et al., 2000). Because of beach litter, possible
adverse eects can occur for human health and wild life
on beaches. Prevention at source is one of the most
important strategies in enabling litter pollution reduction, but for this aim to be achieved strong links between
measurement and management need to be realized (Earll
et al., 2000; Tudor and Williams, 2001; Balas et al.,
2001; Tudor et al., 2002). Due to the high variability of
beach characteristics and sources of beach litter, there is

determination of beach litter grading by using litter
survey results obtained from the Antalya coastline,
which is known as the Turkish Riviera.
Articial intelligence consists of dierent techniques
such as neural networks and fuzzy logic, utilized to solve
complex problems based on human intelligence (Pham
and Pham, 1999). Neural networks and fuzzy systems
represent two methodologies that deal with uncertainty
arising from system complexity. An articial neural
network (neuronet) is a non-linear computing system
consisting of a large number of interconnected processing units (neurons), which simulates human brain
learning. In recent years, neuronets have been successfully used for analysis of coastal environments, such as
for time series processing (Deo and Kumar, 2000), tidal
level forecasting (Tsai and Lee, 1999), pattern classication (Deo and Naidu, 1999; Balas, 2001), wave data
assessment (Tsai et al., 1999) and structural failure
predictions (Mase et al., 1995).
Fuzzy systems are the collection of if-then rules
dening the fuzzy relations of fuzzy variables in the
systems by utilizing fuzzy logic or fuzzy set theory
(Zadeh, 1997; Zadeh, 1999). Fuzzy systems make eectively use of additional information such as knowledge and experience of humans, i.e. it is dierent from
standard modeling approaches. It simulates management ability regarding complex tasks under signicant
uncertainties. Fuzzy systems can be used in modeling,
analyzing, predicting and/or controlling of complex
system behaviors associated with inherent non-linearity,
when adequate knowledge and reliable methods of
measuring system variables are not available (Moshgbar
et al., 1995).
Available methodologies of beach litter grading cannot predict the number of litter items and categories
based on previous measurements of litter data. Therefore, these are litter assessment methods rather than a
prediction model. Furthermore, available methods require the tasks of counting, classication, surveying and
evaluation carried out at various beaches. Field campaigns generally necessitate well-trained measurement
teams and extensive disbursements over long time. The
litter prediction model developed in this study provides
the prediction of litter categories based on articial intelligence. Therefore, this model will save timeonly
one category is measured, so it is easier for the eld
worker, and provides fast and reliable estimations of
litter categoriesa necessity for successful beach management. The constructed neural network satisfactorily
predicted the beach gradings and litter categories, based
on the number of litter in general litter category for
beaches in Antaya. As a result, future predictions of
litter items and categories can be performed by this
model, which will lead to better management scheme
concerning the health, safety and economic implications
of beaches.

The articial neural network was chosen as the prediction model for litter grading, since it is a non-linear
robust prediction method that can satisfactorily handle
the randomness and uncertainty inherent in data sets
and complex natural systems. Neuronets exhibit the
characteristics of biological networks to simulate the
human brain learning and they have been successfully
used nowadays for the prediction of environmental
processes.
In addition, a fuzzy system was developed to obtain
the classication of the beaches, since uncertainty is
generally inherent in beach work due to the high variability of beach characteristics and the sources of litter
categories. This resulted in eective utilization of the
judgment and knowledge of beach users in the evaluation of beach gradings. Frequently, linguistic descriptions, such as very good, above average have been
used to grade a beach, many/few items etc. have been
used for litter counts. Available methods cannot include
qualitative knowledge of human to this extent.
In summary, articial neural networks can demonstrate the learning and adaptation capabilities of biological neural systems by predicting litter grades from
new data sets considering the change in environmental
conditions. Therefore, they are exible and robust nonlinear prediction models. On the other hand, fuzzy systems can eectively utilize the uncertainties inherent in
human knowledge, but they do not have the capability
of learning. Therefore, neural networks have more
generalization ability (functional approximation capability) than the fuzzy systems in using a database.
However if the database is limited and contains qualitative information, fuzzy systems can be alternatively
used as litter assessment models. The advantage of fuzzy
systems is that, they can handle human based information such as experience and judgment, and can consider
qualitative data described by language.

2. Articial neural networks
Articial neural networks (neuronets) are based on a
simplied modeling of the human brains biological
functions. Therefore, they are very eective in computational systems where complex real world problems are
modeled (Svozil et al., 1997). The analogy between the
articial neuron and the biological neuron is that connections between neurons represent axons and dendrites, connection weights stand for synapses, and the
threshold approximates the activity in the soma as illustrated in Fig. 1, where yj is the output of the jth
neuron, xi is the ith input signal, wi is the connection
weight from the ith input neuron to jth neuron, tj is the
threshold or bias value of the jth neuron and f x is the
nonlinear function modeling the system response. Neural networks can be classied according to their activa-

A multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MFF)
has a layered structure as given in Fig. 2. Hidden layers
exist between the input (rst) and the output (last) layer.
Each layer has neurons that receive input from a layer
below and send their output to units in a layer above.
Activation of a hidden unit is a function of the weighted
input and the threshold. A multi-layer feed-forward
neural network is trained by a supervised learning algorithm with a set of chosen examples called a training

3. Fuzzy systems
Fuzzy systems or fuzzy rule based systems are formal
representations of informal linguistic descriptions by
means of if-then rules or fuzzy rule base. A fuzzy rule
base represents the relationship between two or more
fuzzy variables in the general form of if antecedent
proposition; then consequent proposition or a set of
consequences that can be inferred. In the linguistic fuzzy
system the antecedent and consequent propositions are
always fuzzy propositions. For example, a fuzzy rule
base consists of: if x is Ai then y is Bi i  1; 2; 3; . . . ; N ,
where, x and y are linguistic variables or antecedent
(input) and consequent (output) fuzzy variables, respectively; Ai and Bi are antecedent and consequent
linguistic terms or primary values of the fuzzy variables.
The values of the primary values Ai and Bi are fuzzy sets
given by membership functions. A number between 0
and 1 indicates the degree of membership to a set. For
example a membership function maps every element of
the universe discourse X to an interval 0; 1 and this
mapping can be written as lA x : X ! 0; 1. Fuzzy
logic diers from binary logic in the way that the membership function in binary logic suddenly jumps from 0
to 1, while the membership function in fuzzy logic
smoothly varies between the values of 0 and 1. The main
advantage of fuzzy sets for solving real world problems
is the ability to capture non-linear relationship between
inputs (antecedents) and outputs (consequents) without
oversimplication. In order to use the fuzzy systems, an
algorithm or fuzzy inference mechanism can be generally applied to compute the output value for the given
input values, as conceptual units of fuzzy rule base.
Fuzzication is to transform the input fuzzy sets (the
input information) into an appropriate form to be
handled by the fuzzy rule based system. In the fuzzy rule
based system, logical relationship between the fuzzy
input and output sets are revealed and quantied. The
fuzzy rule base consists of conditional statements that

452

C.E. Balas et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 48 (2004) 449457

describe the dependence of one or more linguistic variable on another. The analytical form of an if/then rule is
the fuzzy relation called the implication relation, which
can be dened

where lRi x; y is the membership function of the implication relation. There are dierent forms of implication relations reported in the literature (Czogala and
Leski, 2001). Implication relations are obtained through
dierent fuzzy implication operators, for example the
Larsen implication operator (Ambalal, 2002) can be
dened as follows

Fuzzy rules are connected by an aggregation operator of
either union (_) or intersection (^) depending on the
implication operator. Results obtained from the fuzzy
rule based system are retransformed from internal fuzzy
quantities (consequent) into numerical quantities or
crisp outputs (y 0 ) by the defuzzication methods. The

defuzzication method and is given as

4. A case study on beaches in Antalya, Turkey
In the rst stage, litter categorization for the Antalya
coast was obtained using articial neural networks
trained by litter measurement data obtained at Antalya
beaches. In the second stage, these measurements were
assessed by fuzzy systems and an alternative litter categorization system developed.
Field litter studies were conducted on some of the
most attractive tourist beaches of the Turkish Riviera
(Antalya) coast, namely Cirali, Konyaalti, Kemer, Side
and Belek. For a 100 m stretch of beach located on the
normal access points (Fig. 3), all litter items were enumerated and placed in their respective EA/NALG (2002)
categories/grades. Litter amounts collected ranged from
18 to 743 items/100 m stretch of beach. Seven categories
were determined for the assessment of litter, namely,
sewage related litter and debris; potentially harmful litter items; gross litter; general litter; accumulations of
litter; oil pollution and occurrence of faeces of nonhuman origin (EA/NALG, 2002). Litter items were
graded from the best (grade A) to worst case (grade D)
as shown in Table 1. Field measurements indicated that
the main beach litter item (the most abundant in terms
of quantity) was the general litter category. The number
of litter items in other categories was low and oil pollution was not observed (Table 2).

The amount of litter in the other categories was in
correlation with the general litter category and as
numbers in the general litter category were amplied an
increase in other litter items was commonly observed.
For example, from Table 2, when numbers in the general litter category were taken at their minimum value of
13, there was no litter item in other categories, except
sewage related debris (ve items). When the number of
items in the gross litter category was taken at its maximum value (10category C), the number of litter items
occurring in general litter was 473 (category B). As the
number of sewage related debris was taken to its maximum value of 9 (category C), general litter items were
measured as 103 (category B). When harmful litter items
were measured at its maximum value of 31 (category D),
the number of general litter items observed was 529
(category C). For the number of faeces taken at a
maximum value of 14 (category C), general litter items
were measured as 239 (category B).
Therefore, this relationship between general litter
(when the number of litter items in the general litter category can be measured or identied) and other litter
categories, was used for the construction of neural networks in order to predict the number of litter items in
other categories and the beach grade. Input to the neural
network is the number of litter items in the general litter
category. The neural network predicts the classication
of the beaches (AD) for other litter categories given in
Table 1.
For the neural network training stage, a single hidden
layer consisting of 40 neurons was utilized. The CG
learning algorithm was applied and the minimum mean
square errors of computations (MSE) was dened as the
performance index for the training stage. The unibipolar sigmoid and linear functions were allocated as
activation functions of hidden and output layers, respectively. The initial value of the step size was taken as
g  0:01 and the number of iteration steps was selected
as 1000. The minimum mean square errors of computations at the end of iterations were calculated as 0.0928.
Input and output values of the neural network were
normalized between 0 and 1 by using the maximum and
minimum values of the ranges. Grading of litter categories (AD) which are the output values of the neural
network, were coded as numerical values of 1, 2, 3 and 4,
respectively.
Testing stage results of the trained neural network are
given in Fig. 4 for Antalya beaches. In this gure, the
predicted litter categories of the trained neural network
are compared with ones obtained from the measurements in their numerically coded form. The neural network predicted, with a high correlation of R  0:91, the
classication of litter items for the remaining six categories, (sewage related litter and debris; potentially
harmful litter items; gross litter; general litter; accumulations of litter; oil pollution and occurrence of faeces of

network for Antalya beaches.

Spearman rank correlation coecients were used to
describe the relation between the predicted and measured litter categories. The overall predictions of litter
categories from general litter items can be considered as
satisfactory, due to the high correlation coecient between prediction and measurement for the overall data
of the surveyed site. These predictions were converted to
their original alphabetical litter categories in Fig. 5, for
which the nal grading can be obtained for Antalya
beaches. In Fig. 4, the neural network predictions of
litter categories are non-integer numerical values. In Fig.
5 they are converted to the alphabetical grades (AD) of
EA/NALG (2000). Taking the worst grade of the predictions of litter categories for each of the predictions
obtained from the neural network, the correlation coecient between prediction and measurement was increased to R  0:965, although the correlations are
carried out on dierent data set sizes (Fig. 6). Here the
worst grade denotes the grade that involved the largest
number of litter items for a specic category, as given in
Table 1. Therefore, the constructed neural network
satisfactorily predicted the grading of the beaches and
litter categories based on the number of litter items in
the general litter category. The main source of litter on

these beaches was beach users. A similar study in the
UK yielded, in addition, sewage related debris, river,
shipping, shing sources (Williams et al., 2000). For
Antalya beaches, the trained neural network can be used
for a fast estimation of the number and grading of litter
categories, if the number of litter items in the main litter
category is determined by eld studies.
In the second stage of this study, a fuzzy system of
articial intelligence was developed, which had input
parameters of general litter and sewage related debris,
and an output parameter of the grading of litter categories. In this study, the uncertainty inherent in litter
data that has not a standardized assessment methodology, was appraised by using the fuzzy system. In the

fuzzication process of the system inputs, which were
the number of general litter and sewage related debris
items, the grading criteria and approach of EA/NALG
(2000) was utilized. The fuzzy input sets and membership functions of these variables were obtained for the
grading of AD, from the best to worst case depending
on the number of litter items measured on beaches as
shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Fuzzy output sets for the
grading of litter categories (A: excellent, B: good, C:
average and D: worst) were coded as 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, as given in Fig. 9. The fuzzy rule based system was established by the Cartesian product (product
space) of fuzzy input sets, which resulted in the logical
base of 16 fuzzy rules.
An example for the fuzzy rules is the conditional
statement in Fortran computer coded program developed for this study, describing the following dependence
of linguistic variables:

Other pollution categories were also considered in the
analysis, since fuzzy systems can handle additional rened linguistic denitions of beach grades. The linguistic
denitions of beach users, were aggregated with information obtained by eld teams researching public perception, in which attitudes of the public on beach usage
and grading were determined from questionnaires distributed to 381 beach users (Balas et al., 2003).
The fuzzy sets of grades given in Figs. 7 and 8 were
slightly modied to assess the uncertainties inherent in
other litter categories by including supplementary adjectives of very good (B ), to some extend good (B ),
above average (C ), below average (C ) and bad (D ),
i.e. the maximum number of litter items, greater than a
certain limiting value in related categories will decrease a
half grade in the input fuzzy subset of rules. Therefore,
potentially harmful litter, gross litter and accumulations
of litter exceeding their limits given in Table 1, will decrease the grading denition in fuzzy rules for general
litter, a half grade. Similar interactions for the general
litter denitions of rules are available, if there is a trace of
oil pollution on the beach. Likewise, the occurrence of
faeces of non-human origin aects the rules in the input
fuzzy set for sewage related debris. At the testing stage,
the litter measurements of the eld study were compared
with the predictions of the fuzzy system, as illustrated in
Fig. 10. The fuzzy system satisfactorily predicted the
grading of the beaches and litter categories, since the
correlation coecient between predictions and measurements was high (R  0:822). Predictions were performed
for an average central processing unit (CPU) time of 57 s
within a standard mean error of e  1% by using a portable computer having an AMD K6-2 (3-D) processor.

The main advantage in using fuzzy systems was that
they could consider the linguistic denitions/notes of
beach users and eld study teams during measurements.
Therefore, they make eective use of additional information such as the knowledge and experience of team
members. As a result, additional information inherent in
the linguistic comments/renements and judgment of
study teams and beach users could be included in the
grading system. Specic issues related to beach characteristics, litter assessment methodology and denition of
oil pollution, which could not be included in standard
procedures and/or could be easily lost in mathematical
expressions/evaluations, were incorporated by using this
articial intelligence system. Simply by noting the
number of litter items in the general litter category for
any beach, the EA/NALG (2000) beach grading system
can be obtained and/or rened.
As a result, litter measurements were categorized and
assessed by articial intelligence techniques, and it was
concluded that they were practical and fast methods in
handling available litter data obtained by such eld
studies.

5. Conclusions
An alternative categorization system of beaches, to
the EA/NALG (2000), was obtained. EA/NALG (2000)
litter categories for Antalya beaches, Turkey (Cirali,
Konyaalti, Kemer and Belek) were satisfactorily predicted from eld studies using articial neural networks
and fuzzy logic systems.
Available methodologies of beach litter grading cannot predict the number of litter items and categories

based on previous measurements of litter data. Therefore, they are only litter assessment methods rather than
a prediction model. The litter prediction model developed in this study provided the prediction of litter categories based on articial intelligence. Therefore, this
model will save on eld eort when fast and reliable estimations of litter categories are required for management purposes. The developed model, which would lead
to better management schemes concerning beach health,
can perform future predictions of litter items, categories
and safety and it also has economic implications.
In addition, a fuzzy system was developed to obtain a
beach classication, since uncertainty is generally inherent in marine environment litter management due to
the high variability of beach characteristics and sources
of litter categories. Litter measurement techniques, excess of litter sources and variability in the coastal characteristics of beaches, were observed as the main
uncertainties inherent in the assessment and prediction
of litter data for Antalya beaches. The model resulted in
eective utilization of the judgment and knowledge of
beach users by adding linguistic adjectival descriptions,
such as very good, above average few items, many
items, etc. Available methods cannot include qualitative knowledge to this extent. Therefore, articial intelligence techniques, which take into account uncertainties
inherent in litter data, could be considered as robust alternatives for assessment of EA/NALG (2000) results
and prediction of litter data.
