A critical examination
of the pre-conditions
of learning analytics adoption
in developing countries
in Southeast Asia
Ma. Mercedes T. Rodrigo
1. Introduction
Big data analytics is a field of research that uses data
analysis to make informed decisions (Daniel, 2015). It is
characterized by large amounts of possibly ambiguous
or noisy data collected at a high rate of speed from
a variety of sources. The data is then analyzed to
generate valuable insights about a specific domain.
When applied to educational contexts, big data
analytics has at least three variants  academic
analytics (AA), learning analytics, and educational
data mining (EDM). AA usually has the coarsest
grain size of the three, referring to data collected
and processed at institutional levels for better
administration, resource allocation, and management
(Daniel, 2015). Both learning analytics and EDM, on
the other hand, begin with finer-grained, transactionlevel data and use them in subtly different ways.
Baker and Siemens (2014) cite several differences that
distinguish EDM from learning analytics:


EDM focuses on automated methods for
discovery within data while learning analytics
makes use of more human-led methods;

44





EDM emphasizes modeling of specific
educational phenomena and their interactions
while learning analytics emphasizes a more
integrated, systems-based understanding of
these same phenomena; and
EDM seeks to build applications that will
support personalized learning experiences while
learning analytics seeks to inform and empower
administrators, teachers, and learners.

For simplicitys sake and to remain consistent with the
terminology of Gasevic (2018), to which this paper
responds, this paper will use learning analytics to
refer to all these different forms of big data analysis in
educational contexts.
In Include us all! Directions for adoption of learning
analytics in the global south, Gasevic (2018)
discusses learning analytics potential to increase
education quality, equity, and efficiency in the
Global South. He and other researchers (e.g., Daniel,
2015; Romero & Ventura, 2010) argue that learning
analytics can help improve educational management
processes, upgrade learning and learning
environments, support early identification and

remediation of students-at-risk, provide personalized
feedback and learning experiences, optimize resource
use, evaluate courseware quality, and so on.
Before educational systems can use and benefit from
learning analytics, however, an ecosystem capable
of four key activities  data collection and preprocessing, modeling, presentation and visualization,
and intervention  needs to be in place (Gasevic,
2018; see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Key activities in the learning analytics process
(Gasevic, 2018).

1.1 Research questions
The questions arise: To what extent does Gasevics
(2018) enabling ecosystem exist in the Global South?
How ready is the Global South to embrace learning
analytics and reap its benefits? Does the Global South
collect enough data from enough sources at a fast
enough rate to warrant the kinds of deep analyses for
which learning analytics is known? Do these countries
have the expertise to process the data, even if they
had it? How data-driven are decision-makers when
formulating policy?
1.2 Scope and limitations
This paper is an attempt to answer these questions in
the context of developing countries in Southeast Asia

(SEA), namely, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and
Vietnam (ASEAN member states, n.d.; UNDP, 2016).
It contrasts findings from these countries from the
experiences of Singapore, a SEA country that is one of
the most advanced in the world.
As learning analytics must be built on top of an
ecosystem of educational policy, curriculum,
pedagogy, infrastructure, and professional
capabilities, this paper assesses the state of readiness
of these environmental components. The organizing
framework for this paper is drawn largely from a
report by the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education
Organization (SEAMEO, 2010) on the extent of
information and communications technology (ICT)
adoption in SEA educational systems. The report
makes use of UNESCOs (2005 in SEAMEO, 2010)
four stages of ICT Development: emerging, applying,
infusing, and transforming. The SEAMEO (2010)
report maps these stages along several dimensions of
ICTs in education and describes how each stage would
manifest. It then plots where each SEA country is
within this matrix.
This papers main discussion points, adapted from the
SEAMEO (2010) matrix, are national-level education
policies; ICT infrastructure and resources in schools;
professional development for teachers and school
leaders; ICT in education curriculum and pedagogy;
assessment; and evaluation and research. These
dimensions are the pre-conditions that determine
the extent to which learning analytics can be applied
to an educational system. The national-level policy is
an articulation of a high level commitment to the use
of ICTs in education. Commitment translates to the
scale of ICT investments in schools. The ways in which
these ICTs are used are determined by the curriculum,
pedagogy, assessment styles, and teacher training.
Teacher and administrator training also influence
how data is analyzed. Coming full circle, plans for
high-level evaluation and research determine what
data is collected, how it is analyzed to assess policy
45

effects, and how these results are used to influence
subsequent decision-making.
This paper makes use of academic publications for
theoretical grounding. Most of the inputs for this
paper, however, were collected from reports from
institutions such as the Asian Development Bank
[ADB]; SEAMEO; UNESCO; and government sources.
Findings from SEAMEO (2010) are used to start each
discussion point, together with information from
other, more recent reports and publications. This
paper focuses primarily on basic education because
source materials tended to limit their scope to
primary and secondary school.

On its part, Timor-Leste is in the process of
rebuilding after recent internal conflicts. Its national
development plans cite ICT capability as a cornerstone
of economic development (International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development [IBRD]/The World
Bank, 2013). Primary education is a key focus area,
with projects dedicated to the rehabilitation of
facilities and the provision of textbooks and other
instructional materials. These plans, however, are
silent on ICT education. Indeed, ICT education has
not yet been identified as a learning goal at any
educational level.

Cambodia and Myanmar are considered to be at
the applying stage in which ICT is used to support
or automate existing culture, policies, and practices

Indonesias Five-year Action Plan for the Development
and Implementation of ICT in Indonesia supports the
development of ICT networks and the integration of
ICTs in learning (UNESCO, 2013a). The Philippiness
Education for All Plan of Action calls for ICT integration
as well as the use of ICTs to enhance educational
management at all levels (Philippines National
Education for All Committee, 2014).
Thailand and Vietnam straddle the line between
infusing and transforming (SEAMEO, 2010). Aside
from envisioning ICT as a driver of change and
providing support for infrastructure and human
capacity building, they also show evidence of
integrating ICTs in overall school development.
Teachers and students are included in ICT-related
plans, and funding is broadly available. In Vietnam,
these commitments to education took root as far
back as 2001 when they planned the improvement of
student ICT training and teacher ICT usage (UNESCO,
2013a). In its Master Plan on ICTs in Education 20072011, Thailand continues its efforts to improve
access to technology and indeed strives to become
a creator of technology, not just a user (UNESCO,
2013a). A more recent OECD/UNESCO (2016) report
confirms that ICT has been and continues to be one
of Thailands strategies for economic growth. It notes
that Thai schools began offering computer courses
as far back as 1984 and, by the 2000s, Thailand was
already committed to integrating ICTs in subject areas
as pedagogical tools.
Malaysia was the only developing SEA country
categorized in the transforming stage (SEAMEO,
2010), i.e., possessing exemplary national-level
vision and policies that other countries study and
emulate. In keeping with this status, Malaysias
Education Blueprint 2013-2025 commits to providing
students with Internet access and virtual learning
environments, augmenting online content, and
creating more opportunities for distance and selfpaced learning (UNESCO, 2013a).

While not directly related to education, SEA
countries are in the process of developing legislation
regarding data privacy and protection, which have
implications on analytics in general. As far back as
2005, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
networkwhich includes Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam (APEC, 2017)
crafted a framework for the protection of personal
information. Among the guiding principles of this
framework were the prevention of harm, informed
consent, the need for security and accountability,
and the right to access and correction. Several SEA
countries have since begun codifying these principles
(Zicolaw, 2014). Thailand and Indonesia already have
laws under consideration regarding the protection of
individual data, while the Philippines and Malaysia
have enacted data privacy laws that protect the right
to privacy while ensuring the free flow of information.
Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam are still in
the process of developing similar legislation.
What do these findings say about the readiness of
developing countries in SEA to engage in learning
analytics? The national-level policy seems compatible
with the use of learning analytics. All countries have
mandated investment in ICT-related infrastructure,
curriculum, and skills, and they are formulating laws
to protect personal data. Policies state the desire
for evidence-based decision-making, which hints at
learning analytics without explicitly mentioning it.
In contrast, Singapore began basic ICT skills and
literacy training in the 1960s and, in 1997, began
introducing a series of ICT in Education Masterplans.
As described in Tan, Cheah, Chen and Choy (2017),
the first masterplan established a strong ICT
infrastructure and began intensive teacher training.
The second empowered schools to make their own
autonomous judgments about the use of ICTs while
the third focused on strengthening and scaling in
order to reach a transformational stage of ICT usage.
Although the plans do not explicitly mention learning
analytics, they built-up a healthy IT-oriented mindset,
47

familiarity with technologies, and a general belief
in the value of ICT for Singapores development (p.
35). They also enable the next wave of development,
which includes the use of analytics to track students
and respond to individual needs.
In the succeeding sections, we shall examine other
component parts that help triangulate the readiness of
SEA educational systems in the use of learning analytics.

3. ICT Infrastructure and Resources
in Schools
ICT infrastructure and resources in schools refer to
the computers, the Internet, related peripherals, and
courseware that are available in schools for the use
of the students, teachers, and administrators. The
availability of these resources and the ways in which
they are used determine the volume and variety
of the data captured and the speed at which it is
captured, if at all. It also estimates how possible or
probable it is to deploy educational interventions that
are borne out of learning analytics outputs.
SEAMEO (2010) characterizes Timor-Lestes ICT
infrastructure as emerging. ICT resources are typically
non-existent to very limited. If schools have ICTs at all,
they are standalone computers with productivity tools
for administrators, teachers, and students to use.
Timor-Leste is taking steps to correct this situation.
In 2010, the National University of Timor-Leste was
linked to the School on Internet Project of UNESCO,
which utilized satellite-based Internet to connect
higher education and research institutions in SEA
(UNESCO Bangkok, 2010).
Cambodia, Indonesia, and the Philippines are
transitioning from the emerging to applying stages
(SEAMEO, 2010). Aside from standalone computers
and productivity tools, schools in these countries also
have computer laboratories with a limited number of
printers and other peripherals as well as Internet
access. The presence of ICTs in schools, however, does
48

not guarantee access. In Cambodian schools, there
are over 400 to 500 secondary school students per
computer (UNESCO, 2014). Seven percent of primary
schools and less than 1% of secondary schools
have Internet access. In the Philippines, over 400
primary school students share a single computer. Like
Cambodia, only 7% of primary schools have Internet
access. At the secondary school level, the situation
is less dire with about 50 students per machine while
about 40% of schools have Internet access. It is therefore
unlikely that students in these countries are able to use
school ICT resources in substantial ways.
Myanmars ICT infrastructure is categorized as being
in the applying stage (SEAMEO, 2010). In 2014,
Myanmar reformed its telecommunications industry
resulting in more affordable Internet access. UNESCO
launched an ICT for education project in Myanmar in
which teachers were trained to use mobile broadband
services and ICT-based teaching in rural schools
(Stenbock-Fermor, 2017).
Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam are moving from
the infusing to transforming stage (SEAMEO, 2010).
Schools are equipped with networked computers
in both laboratories and classrooms. Students and
teachers have access to a wide variety of peripherals
and a rich variety of learning resources. In some
cases, schools have access to web-based learning
spaces, conferencing and collaboration tools, and selfmanagement software. The availability of computers
and the Internet in Malaysian and Thai schools bear
this classification out. Malaysia and Thailand provide
one computer for every 7 to 17 students (UNESCO,
2014). Over 90% of schools in these countries have
Internet access.
Even if institutionally provided ICT access is limited,
personal access is on the rise with young people leading
the way. In developing countries, 67% of people aged
1524 have access to the Internet, thanks in large part
to the affordability of mobile broadband (ITU, 2017).

Following through on their policy commitments to
provide schools with more ICT resources, countries
have invested heavily in computers, the Internet,
and peripheral devices. Like national-level policies,
this development is friendly towards the use of
learning analytics. However, the reality on the ground
is much more constrained. Access to computers
and the Internet is uneven both within and among
countries. For every four broadband subscribers per
100 people in developed countries, there are two
subscribers in developing countries and one in the
least developed countries (ITU, 2017). Global mobile
access is estimated at 84%, but only 67% of users are
in rural areas (ITU, 2016). The youngest and oldest
segments of the population, people living in rural
areas, and women and girls are less likely to own
mobile phones (ITU, 2016). Even Thailand, one of the
more advanced SEA nations in terms of infrastructure,
reports an internal digital divide in which learner-tocomputer ratios are lower in urban schools than in
rural schools (OECD/UNESCO, 2016). A study of the
use of tablet computers in Thai schools (Office of
the Basic Education Commission, 2012-13 in OECD/
UNESCO, 2016) showed that hardware distributions
needed to be accompanied by contextualized
content and teacher support. At this stage, ICTs do
not seem diffused enough in SEA schools to enable
the collection of high-volume, fine-grained data for
learning analytics.
As mentioned in the prior section, the Singapore
experience is notably different (Tan et al, 2017).
Many schools have already achieved a 1:1
student-to-computer ratio. Learning management
systems and digital resources are common and
broadband Internet access is widely available.
Many of these environments collect fine-grained,
student interaction-level data that is used to reach
educational goals. This will be discussed in greater
detail in Section 7.

4. Professional Development for
Teachers and School Leaders
A skilled workforce is essential to the use of analytics,
but it is also one of the most difficult resources to
develop. It is estimated that the global public and
private sector is only able to capture 30% of the
value that big data offers (McKinsey Global Institute,
2016). Organizational inability to train, attract, and
retain qualified analytics personnel is one of the
major impediments to the success of analytics within
organizations of all kinds  government, the private
sector, and education.
Laos and Timor-Leste are at the emerging stages
of professional development for teachers and
school leaders (SEAMEO, 2010). They are aware of
the need for professional development but have
not yet formulated concrete plans to address this
need. One impediment is a lack of internal capacity
to support ICTs in education. In Timor-Leste, few
tertiary institutions offer ICT-related courses, and
they themselves lack qualified teachers and proper
teaching and learning facilities (IBRD/The World
Bank, 2013). Timor-Leste teachers often depend on
private or religious organizations for ICT training. The
situation in Laos is slightly more progressive. Teachers
do receive ICT training, but it is generally limited to
productivity tools and Internet searching, browsing,
and communications (Utakrit, 2016).
Cambodia, Indonesia, and Myanmar are in the
applying stage in which ICT training tends to be
unplanned (SEAMEO, 2010). The training that
teachers and school leaders do receive tends to be
limited to ICT applications. The dearth of ICT-related
training for teachers could be caused in part by
the focus on other aspects of teacher training. For
example, Indonesia shifted to a new basic education
curriculum in 2013. It emphasized more interactive
and team-based teaching to develop higher-order

49

thinking skills (OECD/ADB, 2015). Hence, professional
development efforts focus on developing these
specific areas.
At the infusing stage are Malaysia, the Philippines,
Thailand, and Vietnam (SEAMEO, 2010). Teachers and
school leaders receive training in the use of ICTs to
teach specific subject areas. Pre-service teachers in
Malaysia and the Philippines take at least one course
on educational assessment, measurement, and
evaluation (SEAMEO, 2015). In-service teachers are
offered classroom assessment training once a year in
Malaysia and twice a year in the Philippines.
Of interest regarding this dimension is the absence of
any mention of training for learning analytics. Based
on the source documents surveyed, the current focus
of teacher and administrator training in SEA is, at
best, at the level of using ICTs for teaching specific
subjects or for tracking inputs to schools. In the
Philippines, training supposedly includes item analysis
and test score analysis (SEAMEO, 2015), but learning
analytics is not explicitly mentioned in pre-service or
in-service training programs.
The same can be said of Singapores teacher
education and training programs (Tan et al, 2017).
Singapore invests extensive resources in the
development of teachers ICT skills, their capacity for
innovative ICT use, and the creation of ICT resources.
Capacity building for learning analytics is not explicitly
included among training goals. However, Singapores
National Institute for Education regularly engages
teachers in their ICT development and deployment
projects and shares the results of data analysis. This
implies that teachers are kept informed of the effects
and consequences of these various strategies, and
they are literate enough to internalize and appreciate
these findings.
Several authors identify the development of learning
analytics expertise as a priority (e.g., Siemens,
2012) and warn that simplistic data processing may
50

lead to its misinterpretation and misuse, leading to
negative consequences on stakeholders (Karnad,
2014). If learning analytics is to be used correctly and
effectively in SEA, teachers and administrators need
training. The reports reviewed suggest, however, that
this specific type of training is not widely available
at the pre-service and in-service levels. Hence, the
education workforce in developing countries in SEA is
not well-poised to use learning analytics, even if the
data were available.
Not all software captures for fine-grained, user-level
data. Software has to be designed to collect user
interactions. Computer-based learning environments
must be built to log student data and to include other
educationally relevant attributes such as learning
contexts, correctness, and timing. Curriculum and
pedagogy determine whether such environments exist
in schools and the extent to which students use them.

5. ICT in Education Curriculum
and Pedagogy
Curriculum can be described at three levels: the
intended curriculum which refers to high-level
articulations of educational goals; the implemented
curriculum, referring to mid-level plans for content,
time allocations, and instructional strategies;
and the achieved curriculum, which refers to the
competencies that students actually develop as a
result of the educational interventions (Pelgrum,
1999). This and the succeeding section examine what
developing countries in SEA state as their educational
goals, how they implement these goals, and how they
assess whether they have reached these goals.
Within the nationally-prescribed ICT in education
curricula, emerging category countries Cambodia,
Laos, and Timor-Leste mandate the development of
ICT literacy skills (SEAMEO, 2010). The pedagogical
strategies used by emerging category countries
Laos and Timor-Leste are usually highly teachercentered and didactic (SEAMEO, 2010). Several factors

account for a reluctance to shift to student-centered
methodologies. Teachers confront  isolation,
lack of collaboration, and limited support from
administrators; the constraints of the official syllabus
or curriculum and examinations that test memory
instead of understanding; lack of time and resources,
among others (MacKinnon & Thepphasoulithone,
2014). These circumstances make innovation difficult
and traditional teaching methods convenient.
Cambodia and Myanmar span the emerging to
applying categories. They are still teacher-centered,
didactic, and teach ICTs as a separate subject (SEAMEO,
2010). This is consistent with reports on limited
student access to computers and the Internet: About
1% of primary school students and 15% of secondary
school students in Myanmar are enrolled in classes
with access to these resources and only 2% of teachers
were trained to teach with ICTs (UNESCO, 2014).
Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Thailand
are categorized as applying (SEAMEO, 2010). Their
national curricula stipulate the use of ICTs in specific
subject areas but these uses are generally isolated
from one another. At their best, Indonesian and
Thai pedagogical practices are characterized as
infusing, where they introduce more learner-centered
and collaborative methods (SEAMEO, 2010). The
categorization of Thailand, however, might be overly
modest as all Thai students are reportedly enrolled in
classes that make use of computers and the Internet,
and 79% of trained Thai teachers teach using ICTs
(UNESCO, 2014).
In contrast, the categorization of the Philippines as
being in the infusing category (SEAMEO, 2010) might
have been overstated. UNESCOs (2014) report showed
that only 41% of primary school students and 87% of
secondary school students were enrolled in classes
that made use of computers, while 4% of primary
school students and 28% of secondary school students
had classes that made use of the Internet. Indeed, the

same report showed that only 2% of teachers in the
Philippines were trained to teach with ICTs.
In the infusing category, Malaysia and Vietnam have
integrated learning systems that encourage students
to solve problems in authentic contexts (SEAMEO,
2010). None of the intended curricula of developing
countries in SEA have reached the transforming
stage. Teaching and learning strategies in the
schools in Malaysia and Vietnam are varied; hence,
these countries span the applying to transforming
categories (SEAMEO, 2010). There is evidence of both
teacher-centered and student-centered pedagogies.
ICTs are taught as separate subjects and they are
used for experimentation and multi-sensory learning.
Other data sources imply that Malaysia provides its
schools with the resources to achieve transformation.
All Malaysian primary and secondary students are
reported to be enrolled in classes that use computers
and the Internet, and 100% of teachers teach with
ICTs (UNESCO, 2014).
In the search for information about ICT-based
curricula and pedagogical practices, it was evident
that there is a dearth of academic literature regarding
innovative ways in which ICTs are being applied
in SEA schools. The International Conference on
Computers in Education is an annual meta-conference
hosted by the Asia-Pacific Society for Computers
in Education. Under this conference are tracks on
artificial intelligence in education, advanced learning
technologies, game-based learning, and others. A
cursory inspection of the proceedings from 2014 (Liu,
Ogata, Kong, & Kashihara, 2014), 2015 (Ogata, Chen,
Kong, & Qiu, 2015), and 2016 (Chen, Yang, Murthy,
Wong, & Iyer, 2016) showed few contributions from
developing countries in SEA.
Learning analytics typically leverages on the use of
highly interactive learning environments such as
tutorials, games, simulations, and the like. These
environments produce rich data streams that can be

51

mined for interesting patterns. In Singapore, teachers
are trained to make use of ICT-based pedagogies and
are able to implement lessons with ICT components
(Tan et al, 2017). Indeed, Singaporean teachers are so
comfortable with ICTs that they are able to contribute
to the development of ICT-based applications to help
teach subjects such as Math and Physics. The same
cannot be said of their counterparts in developing SEA
countries. The data suggests that teachers in these
countries are either unable or reluctant to make use
of these formats; hence, students in SEA do not have
much exposure to them. The ways in which ICTs are
used in most SEA classrooms  primarily teachercentric, with a focus on ICTs as subject matter in
themselves  do not lend themselves to substantial
data collection and, hence, use of learning analytics.

6. Assessment
Assessments are used to determine how much
of the intended and the implemented curriculum
is actually achieved. They are an indicator of the
effectiveness of teaching and the readiness of
learners to progress. They are also indicators of the
quality of an educational system (SEAMEO, 2015). In
SEA, assessments usually take place at three levels:
the classroom level, where teachers give periodic
tests to gauge student achievement; the national
level, where high-stakes exams determine promotion
from primary to secondary school or from secondary
school to college; and the international level, where
sample schools take standardized tests as a means
of diagnosing the entire educational system to help
formulate or adjust policy (Cambodia Ministry of
Education, Youth, and Sport, n.d.).
At the classroom level, teachers in SEA have access to
a variety of assessment tools: textbooks, workbooks,
assessment toolkits, scoring rubrics, test item banks,
and test item data (SEAMEO, 2015). Students in
emerging countries Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
Myanmar, Philippines, and Timor-Leste tend to be

52

assessed for discrete subjects, using paper-and-pencil
tests (SEAMEO, 2010). ICT use in assessment tends
to be limited to the development, encoding, and
recording of assessments, especially at the primary
school level (SEAMEO, 2015).
Thailand and Vietnam fall into the applying stage
where students are assessed for their skills but the
overall format is still teacher-centered and subjectfocused (SEAMEO, 2010). As with the emerging-stage
countries, the use of ICTs for assessment is limited
because teachers themselves lack confidence, and
because ICTs are taught as subjects in themselves
(OCED/UNESCO, 2016).
Malaysia is the sole entry in the infusing category
(SEAMEO, 2010). The Malaysian school system
designs what it views as holistic, authentic assessment
that measures students cognitive, affective,
and psychomotor skills (SEAMEO, 2015). These
assessments are designed to be taken in authentic
situations as well as during coursework.
At the national level, all SEA countries give
summative, high-stakes examinations. The main use
of the test data is to determine student achievement
levels against the prescribed curriculum (SEAMEO,
2015). There is, however, a certain level of mistrust of
national-level tests. Test validity, sampling methods,
and quality of test administration are all the subject
of doubt (SEAMEO, 2013). In Indonesia, for example,
the national-level examinations are supposed to
assess learning, serve as criteria for graduation, rank
students for competitive entry, evaluate the success
of educational programs, provide information to
improve teaching and learning, and so on (OECD/ADB,
2015). However, there is little confidence that the
exam is able to satisfy any of these purposes.
At the classroom and national levels, it is clear that
all developing SEA countries have massive stores of
student-level assessment data. Much of it though

is not digital and therefore not in a form that can
be easily mined. ICT-based assessments are not
commonly used. Furthermore, questions are raised
about the validity of national-level tests. This is a
challenging environment for learning analytics.
Finally, developing countries in SEA make use of largescale international tests as tools to evaluate their
educational systems. The Programme for International
Student Assessment, Progress in International
Reading Literacy Study, and Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study are examples of tests
in which whole countries participate (Assessment,
Curriculum, and Technology Research Center, 2015).
Countries generally claim to use test results for
policymaking (Assessment, Curriculum, and
Technology Research Center, 2015; UNESCO,
2017a). The Philippines, for example, uses results to
rationalize capacity building and skills development
among teachers. Thailand uses the results to review
the curriculum and design student intervention
programs. Like the Philippines, Myanmar uses results
to design professional development programs. There
is a sense, however, that large-scale assessment data
is underutilized (UNESCO, 2017b). As mentioned in
the section on professional development, teachers
and administrators are not trained to process large
data sets; hence, educational systems lack the human
resources capable of performing the rigorous research
needed to convert data into information.

7. Evaluation and Research
At first blush, evaluation and assessment appear
synonymous. The two areas do overlap, but
evaluation in this context differs from assessment in
terms of focus. Evaluation examines the effects of
broader ICT in education policies on the identified
areas for improvement, while assessment, as
discussed in Section 6, investigates the extent to
which the goals of a curriculum were achieved.

Research, on the other hand, refers to scholarly
inquiry into an educational problem. Evaluating the
effects of policy is a research endeavor that can
result in a cost-benefit analysis of ICT investments,
refinement of educational theory, and identification
of best practices (SEAMEO, 2010). It is here that
learning analytics should be put to work.
At this point, many developing countries in SEA
still lack the capacity for evaluation and research.
Emerging-stage countries Cambodia, Laos, the
Philippines, and Timor-Leste generally do not include
evaluation and research in their national-level ICT
plans (SEAMEO, 2010). There are, however, efforts
that support the evaluation process. The Philippines,
for example, has mounted substantial initiatives to
collect a variety of data on the basic educational
system in a comprehensive and timely manner
(Read, 2017). These include enrollment, staffing, ICT
resources such as computers and the Internet, health
and nutrition, exit assessment results, and others.
Data tends to be coarse-grained though. It includes
all resource inputs  not just ICT  and has a limited
indication of resource usage.
Indonesia, Thailand, and Myanmar are in the applying
stage in which evaluations tend to be summative in
nature and the capability to make evidence-based
decisions is limited (SEAMEO, 2010). One of the issues
surrounding Thailands ICT in education plans is that
the country lacks the capacity to monitor and assess
ICT usage in schools (OECD/UNESCO, 2016). Despite
the substantial investments that Thailand has made in
this regard, it does not systematically collect data on
inputs and outcomes; hence, it has limited data upon
which to build policy.
In the infusing stage are Malaysia and Vietnam
(SEAMEO, 2010). They make use of both summative
and formative assessments and invest in research
to provide the basis for data-driven policies. These
claims are not undisputed though. A UNESCO (2013b)

53

study pointed out that Malaysia has fallen behind its
benchmarking countries because of a lack of policy
formulation, monitoring, and feedback. In Vietnam,
a survey of 32 key representatives from 20 public
and private sector organizations involved in ICT in
education ranked evaluation and research as a 7th
priority among 10 ICT in education dimensions (VVOB
Vietnam, n.d.). Highest among these dimensions are
the deployment of infrastructure, teacher training, and
curriculum. Key representatives agreed that research
was essential for proper policy formulation but only for
as long as it did not impede change and innovation.
Learning analytics is one of the tools of evaluation and
research. At this point, however, developing countries
in SEA lack a culture of evaluation and research, which
leads to an underutilization of these tools.
In contrast, Singapores Learning Sciences Lab within
the National Institute for Education focuses on the
use of learning analytics to develop evidence-based
claims about how people learn to derive practical,
pedagogical, and theoretical implications (Tan et al.,
2017). To illustrate: The Rapid Collaborative Knowledge
Improvement (RCKI) using GroupScribbles (GS) project
refers to both a product and a practice that supports
group participation and face-to-face collaboration. GS
is a shared digital space in which students can share
ideas in textual or graphical forms. Students scribble
on a personal window and post their work to a shared
window when they are ready. The analysis of RCKI
using GS showed that GS classes performed better
than non-GS classes because GS facilitated students
understanding of and attitude towards the subject matter.
Since its introduction, over 300 RCKI lessons have been
designed with the help of 15 teachers and 17 classes.

8. Conclusion
Within developing countries in SEA, there are massive
opportunities to improve education with the use
of learning analytics. As Gasevic (2018) argues,
learning analytics can be used to improve education
54

quality, equity, and efficiency in many ways and
at many levels. Rich sources of data such as social
networking behaviors and discourse can augment
formal assessments to come to better understandings
of learners and their needs, and can help learning
systems direct students to appropriate learning
activities. Learning analytics can help overcome
biases in education access by factoring in the effects
of geography, gender, minority status, and so on
to lead to more equitable learning environments.
Finally, learning analytics can help policy makers and
practitioners better manage educational programs
and resource allocation.
The Singaporean experience provides a success
story. Singapore proves that ICTs in general, and
learning analytics in particular, have the potential
to contribute positively to educational change (Tan
et al, 2017). Examples of Singaporean projects such
as the RCKI using GS and EduLab, point to increased
quality, equity, and efficiency, with even greater
promise ahead. Singaporean researchers anticipate
that learning analytics will lead to more personalized
learning environments capable of complex
interactions and challenge educators to design,
develop, and study such innovations.
However, the Singaporean experience is not universal.
The goal of this paper was to determine the extent to
which the enabling ecosystem of learning analytics
existed in developing countries in SEA. The findings
are somewhat grim. There is a national-level
commitment to the use of ICTs in education, but
the priority is on addressing internal digital divides
through the improvement of telecommunications,
increased technology deployment, and teacher
training for ICT literacy and integration.
The computer-based learning environments in
schools tend to consist of personal computers with
productivity tools, with the possible exception of
schools in infusing and transforming countries such
as Malaysia. Even in these advanced countries,
however, there is little evidence that learning systems

automatically collect the kind of fine-grained data
that drives learning analytics. Rather, most testing
still uses pen and paper. Even when digitized data
is available, the teachers and administrative staff
lack the culture of evaluation and research and
the specialized training to convert the data into
meaningful information.
At this time, none of the pre-conditions to making
full use of learning analytics seem to be present in
developing countries within SEA. Countries are still
in the process of amassing policy, technology, and
human resources, as well as developing the culture to
leverage learning analytics for wide-scale educational
improvements. Fortunately, efforts continue to bolster
ICT in education and develop related expertise within
these countries. It is therefore reasonable to expect
that SEA will become an active participant in the
learning analytics community in the years to come.
