a b s t r a c t
A MIMO (multiple inputs and multiple outputs) fuzzy-logic-based model was developed to predict biogas
and methane production rates in a pilot-scale 90-L mesophilic up-ow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)
reactor treating molasses wastewater. Five input variables such as volumetric organic loading rate (OLR),
volumetric total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal rate (RV ), inuent alkalinity, inuent pH and
efuent pH were fuzzied by the use of an articial intelligence-based approach. Trapezoidal membership
functions with eight levels were conducted for the fuzzy subsets, and a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference
system was used to implement a total of 134 rules in the IF-THEN format. The product (prod) and the
centre of gravity (COG, centroid) methods were employed as the inference operator and defuzzication
methods, respectively. Fuzzy-logic predicted results were compared with the outputs of two exponential
non-linear regression models derived in this study. The UASB reactor showed a remarkable performance
on the treatment of molasses wastewater, with an average TCOD removal efciency of 93 (3)% and
an average volumetric TCOD removal rate of 6.87 (3.93) kg TCODremoved /m3 -day, respectively. Findings of this study clearly indicated that, compared to non-linear regression models, the proposed MIMO
fuzzy-logic-based model produced smaller deviations and exhibited a superior predictive performance
on forecasting of both biogas and methane production rates with satisfactory determination coefcients
over 0.98.

1. Introduction
Distillery efuents from sugar cane factories using molasses as
a raw material are characterized by highly organically polluted
wastewaters, and can have serious impacts on the environment if
disharge untreated. Molasses-based distilleries are one of the most
polluting industries generating large volumes of high-strength
wastewater [1]. Apart from high organic content, distillery wastewater also contains high concentration of nutrients in the form
of nitrogen (16604200 mg/L), phosphorus (2253038 mg/L) and
potassium (960017,475 mg/L) [2] that can lead to eutrophication of receiving water bodies [1,3]. The raw molasses wastewater
is also characterized by moderately acidic (pH 45), very high
total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) (65,000130,000 mg/L),
high concentration of mineral salts and has a bad smell and dark
brown color as the melanoidin pigment [1,35]. This dark color

hinders photosynthesis by blocking sunlight and is deleterious to
aquatic life [6]. Moreover, studies focused on the water quality of a
river contaminated with distillery efuent displayed high biological
oxygen demand (BOD) values of about 160021,000 mg/L within a
radius of 8 km [1,3,7]. Adequate treatment is therefore imperative
before the efuent is discharged [1,3,4,8].
With environmental regulations becoming more stringent, regulatory compliance has also become a matter of increasing concern
to the fermentation and food industries. Therefore, several types of
processes have recently been proposed for treating the molasses
wastewater to improve the quality of the nal discharge in terms
of residual pollutant contents. Sirianuntapiboon and Prongtong
[9] have conducted studies on the removal of color substances in
molasses wastewater by using combined biological and chemical
treatment processes. The study concluded that color substances
can be removed by simple coagulants (such as CaO for stillage
and FeCl3 for anaerobic treated molasses wastewater (An-MWW)).
But to increase the color removal efciency in coagulation step,
the authors suggested the pretreatment of molasses wastewater by aeration with or without sludge-added for about 96 h. In
another study conducted by Pena et al. [5], color removal from
biologically pretreated molasses wastewater by means of chemical oxidation with ozone were explored. The study concluded
that ozonation was an effective treatment to remove color but

F.I. Turkdogan-Aydnol, K. Yetilmezsoy / Journal of Hazardous Materials 182 (2010) 460471

less effective to remove organic matter. The authors reported that,
depending on the applied ozone dosage, color removal from 71%
to 93% and TCOD reduction from 15% to 25% were reached after
30 min reaction time. In a recent study, Zhang et al. [4] proposed a novel UASBMFCBAF (up-ow anaerobic sludge blanket
reactormicrobial fuel cellbiological aerated lter) integrated system for simultaneous bioelectricity generation and high-strength
molasses wastewater treatment. The study concluded that TCOD,
sulfate and color removal efciencies of the proposed system were
achieved of 53.2%, 52.7% and 41.1%, respectively. Moreover, each
unit of this system had respective function and performed well
when integrated together. Sirianuntapiboon and Prasertsong [10]
carried out investigations on the treatment of molasses wastewater by acetogenic bacteria BP103 in a sequencing batch reactor
(SBR) system. They used acetogenic bacteria BP103 cells as the
absorbent for melanoidin pigment (MP) and molasses wastewater.
The study concluded that the strain showed the highest TCOD, BOD5
TKN (total Kjedahl nitrogen) and MP removal efciencies of 65.2%,
82.8%, 32.1% and 50.2% on average, respectively. In another recent
work, Liang et al. [8] applied coagulation/occulation process in
the polishing treatment of molasses wastewater on a bench-scale.
The study concluded that ferric chloride was found to be the
most effective in removing melanoidins from bio-treated molasses
wastewater, achieving color and TCOD removal efciencies of
98% and 89%, respectively. Finally, Sohsalam and Sirianuntapiboon
[3] applied a surface ow constructed wetland (SFCW) system
with Cyperus involucratus, Typha augustifolia and Thalia dealbata
J. Fraser to treat An-MWW under the organic loading rates (OLR)
between 612 and 1213 kg BOD5 /ha-day. The proposed SFCW system showed that the highest SS (suspeded solids), BOD, TCOD,
total phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and molasses
pigments removal efciencies of 9093%, 8889%, 67%, 7076%,
7782%, 9495% and 7277% were detected under the lowest OLR
of 612 kg BOD5 /ha-day, respectively. Detailed information on several other existing and advances methods applied to the treatment
of molasses-based distillery wastewater can be found in a comprehensive review of Satyawali and Balakrishnan [1].
In recent years, anaerobic digestion technology has become a
technology of growing importance, especially for high-strength
wastewater [11,12]. Although anaerobic digestion has been
regarded as one of the benecial and advantageous processes, particularly in treatment of highly polluted wastewaters, however this
type of treatment is thought to be a difcult system due to its instability and complexity in solving this problem in a short time in a
real-scale plant.
Modeling is a valuable tool in both design and operation of
biological treatment plants, and can be used for process optimization and testing of control strategies at a reasonable cost. Hence,
modeling helps to develop a better understanding of the treatment processes and provides a signicant potential for solving
operational problems as well as reducing operational cost in a specic treatment process. Moreover, model results can be evaluated
for different operating data before transferring the concepts to a
full scale plant [13]. In the literature, there are numerous studies such as integral dynamic modeling of the UASB reactor [14],
mathematical simulation of the sludge blanket of UASB reactor [15],
dynamic modeling of a singlestage high-rate anaerobic reactor [16],
and mathematical modeling of a batch anaerobic digestion [17],
conducted about the comprehensive and complex models to control and simulate several anaerobic treatment systems. In a recent
study, Pontes and Pinto [18] conducted studies on the analysis of
integrated kinetic and ow (or hydraulic) models for two anaerobic
digesters, the UASB and the EGSB (expanded granular sludge bed)
reactors. In the study, the ow models were found to be quite different for the UASB and EGSB reactors. Since many of the parameters
used in the UASB reactor ow model can be critical for an accurate

461

simulation, the study concluded that the volume variations of the
sections of the UASB reactor were necessary to accurately describe
the behaviour of such digester in non-steady-state. Because of
the mechanisms associated with anaerobic processes are not adequately understood to formulate reliably, many of conventional
models require simplications of the process representation for a
better understanding of the underlying phenomena in anaerobic
digestion. Hence, more simple and useful models are required to
overcome complexity and applicability [19]. Biyikoglu et al. [20]
have reported that conventional numerical methods require much
time to obtain accurate results, and sometimes it is not possible to
reach a solution due to convergence problems regarding the type
of governing equations and boundary conditions.
The performance of anaerobic digestion processes is complex
and highly dependent on the congurations of the different reactors, and varies signicantly with different inuent characteristics
and operational conditions [19,21]. Therefore, the system must be
continuously monitored and controlled due to its instability in circumstance conditions, particularly in terms of biogas or methane
production rates, providing an indication of the overall anaerobic
biomass activity in the process [22]. Since anaerobic digestion process is very susceptible to uctuations in process inputs such as
organic loading rates, inuent pH, and toxic organic compounds,
biogas or methane production rates are highly dependent on the
applied process conditions. Therefore, the complicated interrelationships among a number of system factors in the process
may be explicated through a number of attempts in developing
a representative knowledge-based prediction model allowing the
investigation of the key variables in greater detail.
Because of their speed and capability of learning, robustness,
predictive capabilities and non-linear characteristics, several articial intelligence-based modeling techniques, such as articial
neural networks [2326], fuzzy-logic [27,28], adaptive neuro-fuzzy
inference systems [19,29], have recently been conducted in the
modeling of various real-life processes in environmental engineering eld. Among these methods, fuzzy-logic methodology has been
successfully applied in a variety of ecological and environmental
applications, ranging from mapping to modeling, evaluation and
prediction tasks [30]. Fuzzy-logic-based models have also been
conducted by many researchers as an established and promising method for modeling of various types of anaerobic processes
[3139]. However, there are no systematic papers in the literature
specically devoted to a study of an articial intelligence-based
modeling of biogas and methane production rates in a pilot-scale
mesophilic UASB reactor treating molasses wastewater using the
fuzzy-logic technique. Such an articial intelligence-based control
of real-time gas production rates may provide several potential
advantages such as protection of the system from possible risks
associated with signicant uctuations in inuent characteristics, optimization of the process at a reasonable cost, providing a
rapid evaluation and estimation of emissions on energetic basis,
and development of a continuous early-warning strategy without requiring a complex model structure and tedious parameter
estimation procedures. Therefore, clarication of the place of the
present subject in the scheme of fuzzy-logic methodology can be
considered as a particular eld of investigation to evaluate in realtime biogas and methane production rates that are necessary to
control the anaerobic process and to establish fault diagnosis.
Considering the above-mentioned facts, the specic objectives
of this study were: (1) to develop a fast predicting MIMO (multiple inputs and multiple outputs) fuzzy-logic-based model for the
estimation of biogas and methane production rates in a pilot-scale
mesophilic UASB reactor running under various organic, hydraulic
and alkalinity loading conditions; (2) to compare the proposed articial intelligence-based model with the conventional non-linear
regression approach by means of various descriptive statistics; and

462

(3) to verify the validity of the MIMO fuzzy-logic model by several
additional testing data sets which were not used in training the
model.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Source of molasses wastewater and feed preparation
Molasses was taken from a commercial sugar factory located
in Adapazari, Turkey and stored in the refrigerator at 4  C to minimize substrate decomposition before the experiment. The content
of molasses used as feedstock (in g/kg molasses) was Total Chemical Oxygen Demand (TCOD): 800900, ammonia nitrogen (NH3 N):
2580, oxygen: 48, K+ : 4060, and Na+ : 150200, respectively.
Weight percentages of other components in molasses (%) were
determined as saccarose: 50, betaine: 5.5, K2 O: 4.7, and others:
39.8, respectively.
Satyawali and Balakrishnan [1] have reported that although
the UASB system is the most popular high-rate digester that has
been utilized for anaerobic treatment of various types of industrial wastewaters, however, dilution is required before treatment
due to the presence of some inhibitory substances left in solution after pH correction. Therefore, the feed for UASB reactor
was prepared by diluting the predetermined amount of molasses
with the desired quantity of tap water (1:101:3-fold). After the
acclimatization of seed culture, the dilution ratio was gradually decreased from 1:10 to 1:3 to increase organic loading rate
(from about 2 to 17 kg TCOD/m3 -day) and to study the effects
of different feed strengths on the digestion performance of the
reactor. Since molasses wastewater is characterized by moderately acidic [4], the pH of the feed wastewater was adjusted
by the gradual addition of NaHCO3 (Merck Chemical Corp.), as
similarly conducted by Gohil and Nakhla [40]. A nutrient solution/basal media containing essential micro and macro nutrients
for an optimum anaerobic microbial growth was also prepared
with the following components, and added 1 mL/L of the daily fed
subtrate at relatively high organic loading conditions [41]: 5 g/L
MgSO4 7H2 O, 6 g/L FeCl2 6H2 O, 10 g/L CoCl2 6H2 O, 1 mg/L H3 BO3 ,
1 mg/L ZnSO4 7H2 O, 1 mg/L CuSO4 5H2 O, 100 mg/L MnCl2 6H2 O,
1 mg/L (NH4 )6 Mo24 4H2 O, 585 mg/L Al2 (SO4 )3 18H2 O, and 1 g/L
Na2 SiO3 9H2 O. It is noted that addition of other micronutrients
(such as nickel and selenium) to the feed material in the form
of their salts may also play an important role on the growth of
microorganisms and help to increase biogas production.
2.2. UASB set-up and operation
The molasses wastewater was anaerobically treated in a pilotscale UASB reactor under different organic and hydraulic loading
conditions. The internal diameter, total height and total tank capacity of the system were 20 cm, 190 cm and 90 L, respectively. All parts
of the reactor was made of ANSI 316 stainless steel. The reactor
had a conical bottom of 20 cm length and a feed inlet pipe of about
1.0 cm diameter to avoid chocking during operation. An outlet weir
was provided at the top (1.85 m), which was connected to an outlet
pipe to the efuent collection tank. The reactor was equipped with
ve sampling ports, localized at 0.30, 0.45, 0.60, 0.75 and 0.90 from
the bottom of the system. The diameter of each sampling port was
about 1.5 cm.
Biogas was collected from the headspace on the top of the reactor via a gas collecting system. The gas collecting and measuring
system consisted of a gassolidliquid (GSL) separator (made from
inverted plastic funnels of 15 cm diameter), a gas collecting pipe, a
glass water trap used as hydrogen sulde (H2 S) scrubber and a wettip gas meter. The reactor was kept under mesophilic conditions

(35.2  0.7  C) by circulating the hot water through the external
reactor jacket with a Fisher Isotemp 2100 (Fisher Company, Pittsburgh) immersion circulator. Heated water was pumped through
the jacket surrounding the reactor and glass wool was used as an
isolation material.
Ward et al. [42] have reported that a certain degree of mixing
can be benecial in terms of productivity, as well as of presenting
substrate to the bacteria. Although the low speed mixing conditions
allow the digester to better absorb the disturbance of shock loading
than did high speed mixing conditions, however, excessive mixing
can reduce methane production and disrupt the granule structure, reducing the rate of oxidation of fatty acids which can lead
to digester instability [4345]. Moreover, Appels et al. [46] have
reported that proper auxiliary mixing prevents both the formation
of surface scum layers and the deposition of sludge on the bottom of
the tank. Therefore, considering the above-mentioned facts, reactor contents were gently mixed by an adjustable low-speed top
mounted mixer shaft coupled with two stainless steel impellers
(ANSI 316) driven by a geared DC motor (0.25 kW, 60 rpm).
Depending on the feed ow rates (from 40.5 to 165.1 L/day),
the reactor was operated in a semi-continuous mode feeding (i.e.
twice an hour for 15 min) by pumping of the fresh feed into the
reactor and collecting efuent samples daily. The reactor was run
for a period of about 2 years under various organic and hydraulic
loading rates. Inuent and efuent sampling was carried out once
the steady-state period was achieved. In feeding, different target
hydraulic retention times (HRTs) were achieved using a peristaltic
pump (ColeParmer, Masterex ). Sufcient up-ow velocity was
maintained to achieve proper uidization inside the reactor. During
the feeding of the reactor, the feeding tank was occasionally agitated with a glass rod to prevent the sedimentation of suspended
solids, as well as to make the feeding solution homogeneous. In
order to increase the efciency of the digestion process, the reactor were seeded with anaerobic sludge (about 25% of the working
volume) taken from the Kartonsan Factory Anaerobic Treatment
Facility (Corlu, Istanbul, Turkey). A detailed schematic of the experimental set-up is depicted in Fig. 1.
2.3. Representation of model parameters
Identication of parameters that could be used for monitoring
the biological treament system is an important factor for efcient operation of the anaerobic digestion processes. Choosing the
most appropriate model components representing the behaviour
of the studied process can help to recognize possible technical
faults and to reduce operating costs of plants in the planning stage
[12,47]. There are several suggestions in the literature regarding
the choice of parameters [22]. On the basis of the existing experimental data, several combinations of parameters were pre-trained
until the best input parameters and best tting input structure were
developed. Following to preliminary computations, we selected
volumetric organic loading rate (OLR), volumetric Total Chemical
Oxygen Demand (TCOD) removal rate (RV ), inuent alkalinity, inuent pH and efuent pH as the input parameters in our modeling
study. Biogas and methane production rates in the UASB reactor
were the output parameters of the proposed fuzzy-logic model. The
present model components, which are among the most widely used
and monitored parameters in the literature, are briey discussed
below:
2.3.1. Effect of organic loading rate
The organic loading rate (OLR) is an important parameter significantly affecting microbial ecology and characteristics of anaerobic
systems. This parameter integrates the operational characteristics
of the reactor, and bacterial mass and activity into the volume of
media [48]. Verma [49] has reported that OLR is a measure of the

F.I. Turkdogan-Aydnol, K. Yetilmezsoy / Journal of Hazardous Materials 182 (2010) 460471

463

biological conversion capacity of the anaerobic treatment system.
It depends on the technology used and on the type of wastewater
to be treated [22]. Satyawali and Balakrishnan [1] have reported
that, depending on various anaerobic reactor congurations, a wide
range of OLRs ranging from 0.6 to 86.4 kg TCOD/m3 -day have been
successfully applied for treating molasses distillery wastewater.

alkalinity is not only important for pH-regulation, but also as the
pool for CO2 in methane production. In general, sodium bicarbonate
is used for supplementing the alkalinity, as it is the only chemical that gently shifts the equilibrium to the desired value without
disturbing the bacterial activity [22].

2.3.2. Effect of volumetric TCOD removal rate
The volumetric TCOD removal rate (RV ) is a function of inuent ow rate, working volume of the reactor, and the difference
between inuent and efuent substrate concentrations [50]. This
is an important parameter for biological treatment processes in
terms of a measure of substrate utilization efciency and microbial
metabolic activity in real-time. It is clear from the literature that
high RV values have been achieved in treatment of various organicladen wastewaters such as poultry manure wastewater [47], dairy
wastewater [51], specically with the use of anaerobic processes.

2.3.4. Effect of pH
It has been determined that an optimum pH value for anaerobic treatment lies between 5.5 and 8.5 [49]. Methane bacteria
are very sensitive to pH value. They need a pH range between 6.5
and 7.8 whereas the acid-producing bacteria have optimum pH
value between 5 and 6 [53]. This is an important reason why some
designers prefer the separation of the hydrolysis/acidication and
acetogenesis/methanogenesis processes in two-stage processes
[42]. Liu et al. [54] have reported that the pH range is relative wide
in the plant scale and the optimal value of pH varies with substrate
and digestion technique.

2.3.3. Effect of alkalinity
Alkalinity refers to the ability of a solution to resist changes in
pH. Alkalinity is important because as acid is added to solution,
carbonates will contribute hydroxide ions, which tend to neutralize the acid. This is known as the buffering effect of alkalinity [52].
Buffer capacity is a more reliable method of measuring digester
imbalance than direct measurements of pH, as an accumulation
of short chain fatty acids will reduce the buffering capacity signicantly before the pH decreases [42]. Moreover, it is noted that

2.3.5. Biogas and methane production rates
In any anaerobic digester, effectiveness of the process is usually represented in terms of biogas production rate [55]. The most
important step in the operation of biogas reactor is the control of the
digestion process to maximize the methane production from biological decomposition of organic matters in the waste. Decreases in
biogas yield and methane content are the potential indicators of an
unstable process condition in the anaerobic digestion. The stability of the system should be attentively examined for the methane

content below 65% [52]. The gas production rates provide an indication of the overall anaerobic biomass activity [22]. Therefore, in
this study, we selected biogas and methane production rates as the
output parameters of the proposed models.
2.4. Fuzzy-logic methodology
A general fuzzy system has basically four components: fuzzication, fuzzy rule base, fuzzy output engine, and defuzzication
[56]. In fuzzication step, numerical inputs and output variables
are converted into linguistic terms or adjectives (such as low, high,
big, small, etc.), and the corresponding degrees of the one or more
several membership functions are determined [28]. Since multiple measured crisp inputs rst have to be mapped into fuzzy
membership functions, the fuzzication process requires good
understanding of all the variables [57]. Akkurt et al. [56] have
reported that fuzzy inference engine takes into account all the fuzzy
rules in the fuzzy rule base and learns how to transform a set of
inputs to corresponding outputs. Two kinds of inference operators,
minimization (min) and product (prod), are basically employed in

this step [56,58]. In this study, we conducted the prod technique
due to its better performance in collection of all the relations among
inputs and outputs fuzzy sets in the fuzzy rule base.
Finally, in the defuzzication step, linguistic results obtained
from the fuzzy inference are translated into a real value by using
the rule base provided [20]. This phase is responsible for transforming the fuzzy results from the fuzzy system into crisp values [58].
Akkurt et al. [56] have reported that there are many defuzzication methods such as centre of gravity (COG or centroid), bisector
of area, mean of maxima, leftmost maximum, rightmost maximum, etc. As conducted by several researchers [28,56,57], in this
study, we employed centroid method which is most commonly
used defuzzication technique. It is expressed as follows [56,57]:
(yi )d =

n
(yi )yi
i=1
n
i=1

(yi )

(1)

where (yi )d is the defuzzied output, yi is the output value (or the
centroidal distance from the origin) in the ith subset, and (yi ) is
the membership value of the output value in the ith subset. For the

continuous case, the summations in Eq. (1) are replaced by integrals, as given by Sadiq et al. [59]. On the basis of above-mentioned
fuzzy steps, a detailed schematic of the MIMO (multiple inputs and
multiple outputs) fuzzy system applied in this study is depicted in
Fig. 2.
The situations of uncertainties in fuzzy-logic are dened via giving appropriate membership functions to the elements of the set
that represent the situation. The value of the variation between 0
and 1 (the highest level) for each element is called membership
degree and its value in subset is called membership function [60].
In fuzzy models, the shape of membership functions of fuzzy sets
can be triangular, trapezoidal, bell-shaped, sigmoidal, or another
appropriate form, depending on the nature of the system being
studied [30,59,61]. Among them, triangular and trapezoidal shaped
membership functions are predominant in current applications of
fuzzy set theory, due to their simplicity in both design and implementation based on little information [62]. As suggested by others
[63,64], in this study, we selected trapezoidal shaped membership
functions for both input and output variables for optimal software
performance. The scalar parameters of trapezoidal membership
functions were adjusted until satisfactory outputs were obtained
with respect to the set of rules used in the study, as similarly conducted by Mitra et al. [63]. The trapezoidal curve is membership
function of a vector, x, and depends on four scalar parameters, a, b,
c, d, as follows [28,57,65]:

(x) = (x; a, b, c, d) =

fourth input variables, ranged from 230 to 1950 mg CaCO3 /L, and
from 4.0 to 7.4, respectively (Fig. 5a and b). The efuent pH (pHeff ),
the fth input variable, ranged from 6.4 to 7.6, and the shape and
range of membership functions for this input are depicted in Fig.
6c. Biogas production rate, output 1, ranged from 45 to 760 L/day in
X-axis. Fig. 6a presents the shape and range of each level for the rst
output variable. Methane production rate were considered as output 2, and ranged from 35 to 490 L/day, as shown in Fig. 6b. Table 1
summarizes the number of membership functions and their ranks,
trapmf[a b c d], for each of the input and output variables considered
in the present fuzzy sets.
In this study, a total of 134 rules were established with the
Fuzzy IF-THEN Rule Editor, and a decision from the combinations of
input membership functions (premise part or the antecedent block)
to output membership functions (consequent part) was made by
experience and the steady-state experimental data set. As an example, Table 2 presents the rule base of 30 rule sets randomly selected
from the total 134 sets built on the MATLAB environment.
In the applications of the fuzzy system in both control and
forecasting, there are two types of fuzzy inference systems,
namely, Mamdani-type [66] and Takagi-Sugeno-type [67] fuzzy
systems [62,68,69]. Because of allowing a simplied representation
and interpretation of the fuzzy rules, Mamdanis fuzzy inference
method is the most commonly applied fuzzy methodology [61].

In this work, Fuzzy Logic Toolbox was used to create and to
edit the present Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) within the framework of MATLAB V7.0. The steady-state data obtained from the
experimental study were allocated into fuzzy sets to represent different levels of crisp numerical variables. Input and output variables
were built by using the FIS Editor, and fuzzied with trapezoidal
membership functions (trapmf). Fig. 3 illustrates input and output
variables on the MATLAB numeric computing environment. Each
input variable and output variable had eight membership functions namely A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Some extreme values for
each variable were also considered with their respective ranges to
enhance the prediction exibility of the model. Organic loading rate
(OLR) ranged from 1.9 to 16.7 kg TCOD/m3 -day in X-axis. Fig. 4a
depicts the shape and range of each level for the rst input variable. Volumetric TCOD removal rate (RV ), the second input variable,
ranged from 1.9 to 16.7 kg TCOD/m3 -day, and the shape and range
of its membership functions are shown in Fig. 4b. Inuent alkalinity (ALKinf ) and inuent pH (pHinf ), considered as the third and the

and efuent pH (pHeff ).

This kind of system allows a simplied representation and interpretation of the fuzzy rules, and the integration of expert knowledge
is thus easily realizable [70]. Therefore, as similarly conducted
by several researchers [56,61,65,7073], in this study, we used a
Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system to implement IF-THEN rules
for prediction of both biogas and methane production rates.
2.5. Non-linear modeling study
In this study, a non-linear modeling study was also carried out
to appraise the performance of the UASB reactor treating molasses
wastewater by means of biogas and methane production rates.
The steady-state experimental data was evaluated by DataFit scientic software (version 8.1.69, Copyright 19952005 Oakdale
Engineering, RC167) containing 298 two-dimensional (2D) and
242 three-dimensional (3D) non-linear regression models. As similarly done in our previous studies [12,13,47,74], in this study,
the non-linear regression analysis was conducted based on the
Levenberg-Marquardt method with double precision. The experimental data was imported directly from Microsoft Excel used as
an open database connectivity data source, and then the non-linear
regression analysis was performed. As regression models were
solved, they were automatically sorted according to the goodnessof-t criteria into a graphical interface. Moreover, t-ratios and the

corresponding p values were determined to appraise the significance of the regression coefcients. Descriptive statistics of the
residual errors were also provided to better evaluate the model
performance. To determine the statistical signicance of the predicted results, an alpha () level of 0.05 (or 95% condence) was
used in the non-linear modeling study.
2.6. Analytical procedure
Inuent and efuent pH values were measured by a pH meter
(Thermo Orion 210). Total Chemical Oxygen Demand (TCOD),
volatile fatty acids (VFA) and alkalinity analyses were conducted

by the procedures described in the Standard Methods [75]. Biogas produced in the reactor was measured continuously by a drum
type Ritter wet-tip gasmeter (Ritter Apparatebau GmbH & Co.),
and biogas composition was determined by using a portable Orsat
apparatus. Stability of the treatment process and components of
wastewater samples were monitored in the Civil Engineering Laboratory at Yildiz Technical University in Istanbul, Turkey. Each
experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three
times to observe the reproducibility, and experimental results were
reported as the mean value of each parameter with standard deviation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. UASB process
On the basis of the cross-sectional area of the reactor
(314.16 cm2 ) and applied feed ow rates (40.5165.1 L/day, mean:
73.4 (34) L/day), hydraulic loading rates (LH ) were controlled
between 1.29 and 5.26 m3 /m2 -day, with an average value of 2.34
(1.09) m3 /m2 -day. The UASB reactor were conducted with different HRTs between 0.36 and 1.48 days. Imposed volumetric organic
loading rates (OLR) ranged from 1.95 to 16.56 kg TCOD/m3 -day,
with a mean value of 7.40 (4.26) kg TCOD/m3 -day.
Depending on various organic and hydraulic loading conditions,
daily biogas production rates ranged between 46 and 753 L/day.
Daily methane (CH4 ) production rates ranged from 36 to 490 L/day
with a mean value of about 160 L/day. Percentages of the typical components in biogas, such as CH4 and CO2 , ranged between
5070% and 1644%, with mean values of about 68 (6)% and 27
(5)%, respectively. Moreover, high volumetric TCOD removals (RV )
were achieved between 1.8515.97 kg TCODremoved /m3 -day, with
an average value of 6.87 (3.93) kg TCODremoved /m3 -day. Result
also showed that the rounded TCOD removal percentages ranged
from 84 to 98%, with an average value of 93 (3)%.

467

The average values of inuent and efuent pH were about 5.01
(0.20) and 6.82 (0.21), respectively. The increase in pH can be
attributed to the anaerobic bio-convertion of amino acids contained
in feed wastewater to ammonia [11,47]. During the experimental study, inuent alkalinity ranged from 240 to 1940 mg CaCO3 /L,
and the average increase in alkalinity across the UASB reactor was
determined to be about 1280 mg CaCO3 /L. The increase in alkalinity
can be ascribed to the degradation of proteins in molasses wastewater by anaerobic treatment, which resulted in generation of
alkalinity due to the reaction of ammonia with carbon dioxide and
water, as similarly reported by others [40,76]. Alkalinity increase in
the UASB reactor averaged about 0.20 mg CaCO3 /mg TCODremoved
during the continuous experimental period. This is comparable
to the value of 0.17 mg CaCO3 /mg TCODremoved reported by Gohil
and Nakhla [40]. The stability of the anaerobic system was also
monitored using the ratio of VFA:alkalinity. The steady-state data
indicated that the average efuent VFA:alkalinity ratio was about
0.13, which was less than 0.4 as similarly observed by several
authors [7779].
Mudunge [80] has reported that at steady-state the daily mass
of inuent TCOD (MSi ) is equal to the daily mass of TCOD leaving the system by means of the daily mass of efuent COD (MSe ),
the daily mass of COD in discharged sludge (MSx ), the daily mass of
digested sludge (MSd ), and the daily mass of oxidised sludge (MSo ).
MSe and MSx are contained in the efuent wastewater (TCODout ),
while the daily mass of oxidised sludge (MSo ) is incorporated into
the biomass. For anaerobic bacteria, the growth rate is very slow
that this amount is negligible [11]. On the basis of the present
steady-state experimental data, the mole of methane in biogas was
calculated using the well-known ideal gas equation, and then theoretical TCOD of methane was determined for its oxygen equivalent,
as conducted by Yetilmezsoy and Sakar [11]. The present TCOD
mass balance revealed that over 92% of inuent organic matters
imposed to the system were transformed to biogas on average.
A linear regression showed a good agreement between the daily
mass of inuent TCOD and the daily mass of effuent TCOD, with a
high determination coefcient of R2 = 0.8409. In addition, the value
of adjusted determination coefcient (Ra 2 = 0.8397) was also very
high, showing a high signicance of the TCOD mass balance. Moreover, a high value of the correlation coefcient (R = 0.9170) signied
a noticeable correlation between the mass of inuent and efuent
TCOD values.
Consequently, the molasses wastewater was satisfactorily
treated by means of a high-rate anaerobic process, specically
with the use of UASB reactor. Although relatively high incoming
OLRs were imposed to the system, the UASB reactor demonstrated
a stable performance on the anaerobic treatability of molasses
wastewater, and no process failure was recorded. This should
be due to acclimatization of both acidogens and methanogens
to the gradual ow regime after a well controlled adaptation
period.

3.2. Prediction of biogas and methane production rates
In this work, the developed MIMO fuzzy-logic-based model
and the non-linear regression analysis-based model were applied
to predict biogas and methane production rates obtained from
the steady-state experimental data. In the non-linear study, one
exponential model and two rst-order polynomial models were
obtained for prediction of both biogas and methane production
rates. Results are summarized in Table 3.
Regression variable results including standard error, the tstatistics and the corresponding p values for the best-t model are
summarised in Table 4. The best-t models dened as a function
of ve process variables [Biogas (Y1 ) or methane (Y2 ) = f(OLR, RV ,

The larger t-ratio indicates the more signicant parameter in
the regression model. Moreover, the variable with the lowest p
value is considered the most signicant [12]. Based on t-ratios
and p values given in Table 3, volumetric TCOD removal rate and
efuent pH had more importance than the OLR, inuent alkalinity
and inuent pH for the derived exponential models in prediction
of both biogas and methane production rates. In this study, the
MIMO fuzzy-logic-based model was developed based on a total
of 134 rules in the IF-THEN format and tested with 40 different experimental data, used as the testing set, randomly selected
from the remaining steady-state data set. Briey, about 77% of
the total steady-state experimental data was used as the learning set based on a total of 134 rules, and the remaining (about
23% of the total) was used as the testing set (a total of 40 rules)
to verify the prediction performance of the proposed the MIMO
fuzzy-logic-based model. Fig. 7 shows a head-to-head comparison
of performance for experimental data, fuzzy-logic testing outputs and the regression model outputs by means of biogas and
methane production rates. Moreover, variations of other variables
(organic loading rate and volumetric TCOD removal rate, inuent
pH and efuent pH, and inuent and efuent alkalinity) in the
testing set are depicted in Fig. 8. In the testing set, the average
values of imposed volumetric organic loading rates and volumetric
TCOD removals were about 7.25 (4.74) kg TCOD/m3 -day and 6.74
(4.39) kg TCODremoved /m3 -day, respectively (Fig. 8a). Result indi-

the UASB reactor was determined to be about 1193 mg CaCO3 /L
(Fig. 8c). Moreover, the alkalinity increase in the UASB reactor averaged about 0.22 mg CaCO3 /mg TCODremoved in the testing set. The

testing data also revealed that the average efuent VFA:alkalinity
ratio was about 0.12, which was less than 0.4 as previously observed
in the learning set.
Finally, in order to describe the overall performance of the
proposed models, results were assessed with various descriptive
statistics such as coefcient of determination (R2 ), correlation coefcient (R), mean-absolute error (MAE), root mean-square error
(RMSE), systematic and unsystematic RMSE (RMSES and RMSEU ,
respectively), index of agreement (IA), mean bias (MB), fractional
bias (FB), the factor of two (FA2), fractional variance (FV), intercept
(a) and slope (b) of the adjusted line between observed and predicted values, and proportion of systematic error (PSE). Detailed
denitions and calculations of these estimators can be found in several studies [19,26,8184]. The obtained results are summarized in
Table 5.
The obtained PSE, IA and MB values were in line with those
reported by others [18,78]. Present FB and FV values were also
in agreement with the values reported by Agirre-Basurko et al.
[82]. However, it is noted that differences between the present
results and other ndings may be ascribed to the characteristics of studied input vectors and mean-squared error performance
index, as well as to non-linear nature of the problems. As seen in
Table 5, descriptive performance indices such as MAE, RMSE, FV,
revealed that the fuzzy-logic-based model produced smaller deviation and exhibited a superior predictive performance on forecasting
of both biogas and methane production rates compared to nonlinear regression model. The value of determination coefcients
(R2 = 0.9847 and 0.9848) indicated that only 1.53% and 1.52% of the
total variations were not explained by the fuzzy model in prediction
of biogas and methane production rates, respectively. However, for
the non-linear regression model, about 12.79% and 10.65% of total
variations did not t the experimental data in estimation of biogas and methane production rates, respectively. Results showed
that the non-linear regression did not yield satisfactory predictions of gas production rates as good as the fuzzy model. This
can be attributed to the advantage of articial intelligence-based
models on complex interactions between multi-input and output
variables in a complex system, such as anaerobic digestion process. The linear regression between the fuzzy-logic testing outputs
and the corresponding targets indicated that the forecasted data
were obviously agreed with the experimental data compared to
non-linear regression model. Consequently, it can be concluded
that the proposed MIMO fuzzy-logic model can be a good alter-

native to the conventional multiple regression-based method due
to its ability to precisely discriminate the arbitrary non-linear functional relationships without requiring a mathematical model to
dene complex biochemical reactions between input and output
data sets.

4. Conclusions
The pilot-scale UASB reactor showed a noticeable performance on the treatment of molasses wastewater under various
organic and hydraulic loading conditions. TCOD removal efciencies ranged between 84% and 98%, and high volumetric TCOD
removal rates (RV ) ranging from 1.85 to 15.97 kg TCODremoved /m3 day) were achieved. TCOD mass balance revealed that over 92%
of inuent organic matters imposed to the system were transformed to biogas on average. Although relatively high OLRs
(1.9516.56 kg TCOD/m3 -day) were imposed to the system, no process failure was observed.
On the basis of the experimental ndings, a real-world modeling
study was conducted as an important objective to develop an articial intelligence-based model that could make a reliable prediction
on both biogas and methane production rates. For ve different
model components (OLR, RV , ALKinf , pHinf , pHeff ) the proposed
MIMO fuzzy-logic model showed precise and effective predictions
with satisfactory correlation coefcients over 0.96. Moreover, two
exponential non-linear regression models were also developed as
the best-t models to appraise the performance of the UASB reactor treating molasses wastewater by means of biogas and methane
production rates. Non-linear regression variable results showed
that RV and efuent pH had more importance than other model
components in prediction of both biogas and methane production
rates.
Descriptive performance indices clearly indicated that the proposed MIMO fuzzy-logic-based model showed a superior predictive
performance on forecasting of both biogas and methane production
rates compared to non-linear regression model. The applicability
of the fuzzy-logic model is very simple and there is no need to
dene the complex reactions and their mathematical or biochemical equations. Moreover, due to highly non-linear structure of the
fuzzy-logic model model, it was shown that a complex system such
as anaerobic digestion could be easily modelled. Since fuzzy-logic
methodology gave encouraging estimation results for the online
control of a pilot-scale system, it is believed that this kind of model
will help the control engineer to evaluate in real-time production
rates that are necessary to control the anaerobic process and to
establish fault diagnosis before transferring the concepts to a full
scale plant.
On the basis of the advantages of articial intelligence-based
modeling approach, for future studies, an improved MIMO fuzzylogic-based model, including additional inputs and outputs, will be
developed to estimate parameters that are not measured on-line in
the process, as well as to evaluate the effects of unexpected input
changes on the outputs. Furthermore, different types of membership functions and their combinations will also be tested to enhance
the prediction performance of the proposed diagnosis system based
on fuzzy-logic.
