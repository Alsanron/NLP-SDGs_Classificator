Abstract: A fuzzy logic model was developed to simulate the effect of leachate recirculation and sludge addition on the
biogas generation in anaerobic bioreactor landfills. The model was designed using a fuzzy logic system (FLS) which incorporated 3 input variables (time, leachate recirculation, and sludge addition) and a single manipulated output (biogas generation rate). The biogas production rate was measured during the experiment and was increasing proportionally with the
rate of both leachate recirculation and sludge addition. The experimental work involved the operation of six simulated laboratory-scale bioreactors for over a year under different operating schemes. The experimental results were employed in
formulating the fuzzy rule base, calibrating the model, and verifying its predictions. Then, the model was validated against
other measured data that was compiled from published studies. The FLS model simulations demonstrated high correlation
with the experimental observations.
Key words: fuzzy logic model, biogas generation, anaerobic bioreactor landfills.

1. Introduction
Leachate recirculation and sludge addition are among the
most effective techniques used in enhancing the design and
operation of bioreactor landfills. In both methods, the concept is to control and manipulate the influencing factors, specifically moisture content and nutrients, in a positive manner
to accelerate the biodegradation of municipal solid waste
(MSW). One special advantage of leachate recirculation is
lowering the treatment cost and environmental impacts of
the high strength leachate as the organic component of

leachate is reduced by the active biological communities
within the refuse mass.
Several studies have developed mathematical models to
simulate the quantity and quality of biogas generated from
landfills (El-Fadel et al. 1989; Peer et al. 1992; Lay et al.
1998; White et al. 2004). In addition, stochastic modeling
was used to simulate landfill processes (Copty et al. 2004;
Zacharof and Butler 2004). Thus far, most of these models
are practically inapplicable as they are complicated and require extensive data inputs. Furthermore, the heterogeneity
in MSW characteristics as well as the complex processes
taking place within the landfill add difficulty in assessing
the individual and coupled effect of various parameters in
the system. Therefore, this study targeted an entirely different approach which is based on fuzzy logic modeling. The
fuzzy logic can offer advantages in dealing with systems
that are complex, ill structured, and best described qualitatively (Ibrahim 2004).
The fuzzy logic is a generalization of Boolean logic implementing the concept of partial truth or uncertainty.
Within the fuzzy set theory, an element can have a gradual
membership to different sets. The system behaviour is
described by defining fuzzy sets, fuzzy rules or so-called
IFTHEN rules, and applying a fuzzy inference scheme.
The generation of a fuzzy logic system (FLS) model can be
based both on experts knowledge and experimental data.

Over the last few decades, applications of fuzzy logic have
reached almost every area of science, engineering, business,
and high-tech industries.
In this study, the FLS was employed to develop a model
for MSW biodegradation in terms of biogas generation. The
time, leachate recirculation and sludge addition were set as
the controlled input variables and the biogas generation was
the only manipulated output variable. The data obtained
from the present experimental investigation was employed
in building and calibrating the rule base of the fuzzy inference system. The model was validated by examining its predictions against measured data that were compiled from the
literature (Bae et al. 1998; San and Onay 2001). The statistical analyses used to test model adequacy included linear
regression between actual and predicted data and mean
squared deviation (MSD) measures.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental setup
The experimental setup consisted of six simulated anaerobic bioreactor landfill models made from Plexiglas1 with
dimensions of 150 mm in diameter and 550 mm in height.
The schematic representation of the simulated bioreactor is
shown in Fig. 1. The bioreactors were equipped with a
leachate recirculation system including an outlet port at the
bottom for leachate collection, as well as an inlet port to distribute the simulated rainfall and the recycled leachate.
To achieve a representative sample of MSW commonly
disposed in a landfill, waste was collected from the curbside
of the city of Ottawa. The major components of this waste
were paper (36.6%), food (36.2%), and yard trimmings
(27.2%). The collected waste was shredded manually to a
size of 5 to 10 mm and then mixed uniformly. The shredded
solid waste was filled in 100 mm layers and compacted to a
density of 350 kg/m3. The final height of the waste inside
each bioreactor was 400 mm. The total mass and volume of
waste in the bioreactors were 2.5 kg and 7 L, respectively.
In addition, a layer of 15 mm diameter marbles was placed
at the bottom of each bioreactor. This supporting layer was
used as a leachate drainage system and to prevent clogging
of the leachate outlet.
The simulated rainfall was maintained at a rate of 2 L/week.
Leachate was collected in a 15 L tank and was then recycled
daily to the top of the bioreactors starting from the third week
of operation. The sludge addition was carried out through the
leachate recirculation system and using anaerobically digested
and thickened waste activated sludge from the Robert O. Pickard Environmental Centre (ROPEC) municipal wastewater
treatment plant in Ottawa. The volume of gas produced in the
simulated bioreactors was measured using a wet tip meter device. The number of tip readings was converted into a rate of
biogas generation using a calibration curve.
2.2. Operating schemes
The operational conditions of the six bioreactors, notated
as R1 to R6, are outlined in Table 1. The design strategy
which was put forward for this study included four combinations of operating conditions and two center point replicates.

2.3. Fuzzy Logic Controller
A static fuzzy logic controller (FLC) structure was designed to model the biodegradation of MSW. As illustrated
in Fig. 2, the typical elements of the FLC structure include:
(i) inputs, (ii) fuzzification unit, (iii) database, (iv) rule base,
(v) fuzzy inference engine, (vi) defuzzification unit, and
(vii) output.
Inputs included time, leachate recirculation, and sludge
addition. The crisp values of the input variables were obtained from the conducted experimental work.
Fuzzification is to map the observed inputs to fuzzy sets
in the universe of discourse. The fuzzification strategy involves the following: (i) acquiring the crisp values of the
three input variables, (ii) mapping the crisp values of the input variables into the corresponding universes of discourse
and finally (iii) converting the mapped data into suitable linguistic terms so as to make it a compatible fuzzy sets representation.

define the system behaviour and replace the mathematical
modeling of the system. These rules are noted as an IFTHEN
statement that describes the action to be processed in response to various fuzzy inputs. A total number of 55 statements were created to describe the system behaviour under
different operating scenarios. The following rule is an example of the developed fuzzy rule base statements, IF
time is D AND leachate recirculation is HR AND sludge
addition is HR THEN biogas generation is MH, where D,
HR, and MH stand for, respectively, degradation, high rate,
and medium high. Table 3 shows all the developed fuzzy
rules in the developed model.
Fuzzy inference engine is required to determine the fuzzy
output and to compute the rules along with the membership
function of the fuzzy input. The MAX-MIN fuzzy inference
technique was applied to compute a numerical value representing the aggregate effect of all that was triggered by an
input value.
Defuzzification occurs as part of the last stage of fuzzy
inference. Typically, it involves weighting and incorporating
a number of fuzzy sets in a calculation which gives a single
crisp value for the output. The defuzzification method used
in this study is the centroid method. In this method, the defuzzified value, m, can be calculated as:
X
r
r
X
m
mci Ci
mci
i1

i1

where r is the total number of rules, mci is the degree of
membership of the output fuzzy set i, and Ci is the value
associated with the peak of output fuzzy set i.
2.4. Model Simulation
The fuzzy inference system was developed using the
MATLABTM 7.0 program through the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox.
The simulation was designed and run at discrete variable
steps using SimulinkTM software, which work concurrently
with the fuzzy logic toolbox. The flowchart of the developed
simulation is illustrated in Fig. 4.
Database is provided by defining the membership functions (MF) of the fuzzy sets used as values for each system
variable. Membership functions must be defined for each input and output variable and are represented by a real number
ranging between 0 and 1. Figure 3 illustrates the designed
MF for the leachate recirculation and sludge addition as an
example. The figure shows the fuzzy sets defined as low
rate (LR), medium rate (MR), and high rate (HR). The complete fuzzy sets and MF, which were defined to the developed model, are illustrated in Table 2.
Rule base maps fuzzy values of the inputs to fuzzy values
of the outputs. It consists of a number of fuzzy rules which

2.5. Model evaluation criteria
In addition to graphical assessment, the model was evaluated statistically using a group of criteria that was established prior to the evaluation process. These criteria
included linear regression between actual and predicted data
and MSD measures. The regression estimates of the intercept (a) and the slope (b) are good indicators of accuracy;
the simultaneously closer to zero the intercept is and the
slope is to unity, the higher the accuracy. On the other
hand, the correlation coefficient (R) is a good indicator
of precision; the higher the R, the higher the precision

(Tedeschi 2006). The MSD is the mean of the squared deviations around the regression line in a plot of model simulation against measured values. Following the approach
developed by Gauch et al. (2003), the MSD was partitioned into three components to achieve further understanding of model performance; square bias (SB), nonunity
slope (NU), and lack of correlation (LC). These MSD
components, which add up to give MSD, have simple and
distinct geometrical interpretation. SB, NU, and LC point
up the translation, rotation, and scattering around the regression line, respectively. Additionally, the root mean
square error (RMSE) is calculated by square-rooting the
MSD. The RMSE indicates the mean difference between
observed and predicted values in their same units. However, due to the different scales of the involved experimental setups, the RMSE is normalized by dividing its value
by the mean of the measured data.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Experimental data analyses
The experimental data of biogas production rate was plotted together with the model simulations for the simulated bioreactors in Fig. 5. The general patterns of the biogas

production in the six bioreactors followed an analogous
trend; starting with an increasing rate to a peak value, followed by a declining phase. Based on the experimental data,
the positive effect of leachate recirculation was more substantial than that of sludge addition. The baseline for the
analyses was set to be R1, which was operated under minimum leachate and sludge recirculation rates (285 mL/kg
wasted and 28.5 mL/kg wasted, respectively). Increasing
the rate of leachate recirculation to 855 mL/kg wasted in
R2 enhanced the biogas generation in terms of peak production time (18 weeks earlier) and total biogas production
(71% higher). On the other hand, increasing the rate of
sludge addition to 85.5 mL/kg wasted in R3 improved the
biogas generation in terms of peak production time (13 weeks
earlier), and total biogas production (53% higher). In R2 and
R4, where the leachate recycling rate was high (855 mL/kg
wasted), increasing the sludge addition rate didnt affect the
biogas generation significantly. Conversely, when the leachate recycling rate was low (285 mL/kg wasted), higher
sludge addition rate in R3 (85.5 mL/kg wasted) improved
the bioreactor performance in terms of biogas production
compared with R1 (28.5 mL/kg wasted). Operating R5 and
R6 at medium leachate and sludge recirculation rates
doubled the total biogas production compared with R1.

3.2. Model verification
The evaluation of the developed model is carried out
through verification and validation. Initially, the model is
verified by comparing its predictions to the experimental
data that were used already in creating the fuzzy rules and
calibrating the membership functions. Referring to Fig. 5,
the model overestimated the biogas generation in the same
manner for bioreactors R1 and R3. However, the actual
production trend was fairly reproduced by the model
simulations. The differences of biogas production rate between the simulation and experimental data ranged from
0.25 to 0.5 L/week. The comparison plotted for R2 was
largely similar to the one for R4. The simulation results of
R2 duplicated the experimental data with the exception at
the peak. Slight discrepancies of around 0.5 L/week could
be recognized during weeks 10 to 17 and 27 to 35 of the
experiment. The model developed for R5 and R6 was the
same due to the fact that these bioreactors were replicates.

The FLS model was most successful in predicting biogas
production rates for R6.
3.3. Model validation
Model validation was used to examine the applicability of
the simulation model under a wide range of operating conditions. Data used for model validation were compiled from
two published studies on laboratory-scale bioreactor landfills.
The first experimental study, by Bae et al. (1998), was processed on laboratory-scale lysimeters. The experiment consisted of one control and two recycled setups; one with
sludge and the other with leachate. For each lysimeter,
114 kg of solid wastes were filled at a density of 700 kg/m3.
Before recycling, the leachate was treated in an anaerobic digester. The effluent of this digester was used for sludge addition purposes.
The second experimental study, by San and Onay (2001),
included two reactors, one with leachate recycle and the

Table 4 summarizes the main features and operating conditions for the selected setups. The operational inputs and scenarios of the validation data sets were introduced to the FLS
model. Then, the predicted outputs were plotted with the
measured data in Fig. 6.
In the first study, the model overestimated the biogas generation by an average of 20% during the periods of gradual
increase and decrease of the rate. In contrast, the model
underestimated the peak and produced a constant generation
rate during this part. This could be due to the fact that, in
this study, the sludge addition rates between week 30 and
week 40 were higher than the maximum recycling rate that
was defined in the model. As these rates were not expressed
in the fuzzy rules, the FLS model applied the maximum defined recycling rate scenario constantly during that period.
Despite that, the model predicted accurately the average
measured production through that period and eventually followed the decreasing trend of the actual data.
In the second experiment, the pattern of the biogas generation was anomalous; the curve started with a major generation rate followed by gradual decrease to the dip.
Afterwards, the production rate started to increase steadily.
This irregular shape was produced as a result of the operating scheme that was followed in that particular experimental
study. This actually added to the merit of the FLS model

the production pattern adequately despite the fact that it
underestimated the generation rate during most of the operation period.

data sets. It can be observed that, in all data sets, the slope
was close to unity and the intercept was close to zero. This
could be a positive indication of the model accuracy. The
values of slope, intercept, and correlation coefficients of the
regression lines are illustrated in Table 5. The slope exceeded unity in all cases and the intercept was negative in
both the verification data and one of the validation data
sets. This demonstrates that the FLS model overestimated
the measured data in general. The model predictions
achieved high correlation with the verification data set (R =
0.99). It should be clarified that this ideal correlation was
achieved because the model was calibrated on this data set.
In the validation process, the model simulations were reasonably correlated to the actual data with correlation coefficients of 0.84 and 0.91.
Based on the MSD partitioning shown in Table 5, LC was
the main contributing component to MSD. The average percentages of SB, NU, and LC to MSD were 25%, 1%, and
74%, respectively. Accordingly, the deviations could be attributed mostly to scattering around the regression line as
well as translation of the regression line from the 1:1 line.
The differences between measured and simulated values
were expressed in terms of the normalized RMSE. The FLS
model achieved an acceptable normalized RMSE of 13.72%
for the present experiment, whereas, it achieved a significantly high percentage (42.34% in average) for the validation data sets. These shortcomings could have been avoided
if more data and operating scenarios were implemented in
the construction and calibration processes of the fuzzy rules
and membership functions of the FLS model.

4. Conclusions
The main objective of this work was to develop a fuzzy
logic system that is capable of simulating the biogas generation in an anaerobic bioreactor landfill. The developed
model went through several steps to evaluate its potentials
and reveal its weak points. In the verification step, the FLS
model proved to simulate perfectly the experimental data;
this was confirmed statistically. On the other hand, the validation process revealed certain weaknesses in the model.
Although the model predictions were in reasonable agreement with the validation data sets, it produced significant
difference between simulated and measured data in terms of
the normalized RMSE.
The overall model simulation proved significant concurrence with the experimental results indicating the model reliability in capturing the pertinent features of the system.
The validation process showed that the fuzzy logic system
functions better when the modeled system is fully described

under all possible operating conditions. However, the validation process proved the model flexibility in dealing with
atypical operating scenarios such as irregular biogas generation trends and extreme recirculating rates. Based on these
findings, the application of the fuzzy logic system in modeling the MSW biodegradation process can be considered as a
successful simulating technique that implicitly describes the
large number of complex physical and biochemical processes that occur within the bioreactor landfill.
