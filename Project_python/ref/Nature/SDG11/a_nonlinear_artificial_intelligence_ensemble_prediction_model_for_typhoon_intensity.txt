ABSTRACT
A new nonlinear artificial intelligence ensemble prediction (NAIEP) model has been developed for
predicting typhoon intensity based on multiple neural networks with the same expected output and using
an evolutionary genetic algorithm (GA). The model is validated with short-range forecasts of typhoon
intensity in the South China Sea (SCS); results show that the NAIEP model is clearly better than the
climatology and persistence (CLIPER) model for 24-h forecasts of typhoon intensity. Using identical
predictors and sample cases, predictions of the genetic neural network (GNN) ensemble prediction
(GNNEP) model are compared with the single-GNN prediction model, and it has been proven theoretically
that the former is more accurate. Computation and analysis of the generalization capacity of GNNEP also
demonstrate that the prediction of the ensemble model integrates predictions of its optimized ensemble
members, so the generalization capacity of the ensemble prediction model is also enhanced. This model
better addresses the overfitting problem that generally exists in the traditional neural network approach
to practical weather prediction.

1. Introduction
Ensemble numerical prediction (ENP; see the appendix for a list of the key acronyms used in this paper) is
a new technique that has been developed within the last
decade (Stensrud et al. 2000; Du 2002; Scherrer et al.
2004). An ENP model, whether created with different
physical process parameterization schemes or with different initial conditions from a Monte Carlo approach,
formally consists of many different ensemble members;
the effectiveness of ENP has been widely recognized
(Nohara and Tanaka 2004; Zhou and Johnny 2006). At
present, traditional mathematic modeling methods,
such as multivariate analysis and time series analysis
are widely used in statistical prediction and dynamical

statistical prediction (Zhou and Huang 1997; Ding et al.
2002), in which the future state of a prediction object is
forecasted using a statistical prediction equation (Zhou
and Huang 1997; Ding et al. 2002).
With the development of the artificial intelligence
technique, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been
applied successfully in many disciplines (Li et al. 2003;
Has et al. 2004; Liu 2005). In the atmospheric sciences,
many applications have been found in research areas
such as short-range climate prediction, interpretation
and application of numerical prediction products, air
pollution prediction, and precipitation data processing
of radarsatellite cloud pictures (Jin 2004; Ali 2004;
Tapiador et al. 2004). However, despite its excellent
performance in self-adaptative learning and nonlinear
mapping, in-depth studies have shown that ANNs lack
the guidance of a rigorous theoretical system in determining adequate network structure; the effect of the
application mainly depends on personal experience. In
particular, overfitting of the ANN method frequently

occurs in meteorological prediction modeling due to
subjective determination of hidden nodes of the network, impeding its wide application (Jin 2005a,b).
A genetic algorithm (GA) is a global optimum algorithm based on natural selection and natural inheritance that has been widely used in the field of artificial
intelligence techniques in recent years (Zheng et al.
2003; Guo et al. 2004). With GA, as in biological evolution, new quality populations are continuously generated by the genetic evolutionary operations of selection, crossover, and mutation (information exchange)
among individuals of a genetic population. Therefore,
GA is a population-searching algorithm independent of
gradient information and is very effective at solving
complex and nonlinear problems (Luo et al. 2004; Zhou
et al. 2004). In 2005, Jin found that by optimizing the
network structure and the connection weight of ANNs,
genetic evolution is able to create a number of different
neural network individuals (Jin et al. 2006). In this
work, using key principles from ensemble prediction in
numerical weather prediction (NWP), we try to construct a number of quality individual neural networks to
build a new NAIEP model for South China Sea (SCS)
typhoon intensity prediction.

2. Nonlinear meteorological ensemble prediction
In addition to NWP, statistical and dynamic
statistical prediction methods are still the predominant
objective prediction modeling methods used in the atmospheric sciences. In traditional regression analysis,
the prediction equation predicts the future state of a
specific prediction object (predictand). In statistical ensemble prediction, however, several different prediction equations are set up for the same predictand using
different methods, and the final deterministic prediction is obtained by integrating the results of these different prediction equations with equal or different
weights (Liu et al. 2003). Until now, among the statistical weather prediction methods there has been no one
analog to ensemble prediction in NWP. Ensemble prediction of NWP is motivated by the fact that NWP forecasts are sensitive both to small uncertainties in the
initial conditions and model errors, so it is hard to further improve the accuracy of single model deterministic
predictions. Ensemble prediction is therefore suggested
in which a series of forecasts made by different initial
value perturbations or different physical parameterization schemes are integrated to yield a resultant ensemble forecast. A number of ensemble prediction
studies suggest that ensemble forecasts are more accurate than deterministic forecasts of a single model. This
is because ensemble prediction focuses on nonlinear

VOLUME 136

weather processes, which are governed by the complicated comprehensive effects of interior dynamics and
exterior environmental conditions. Present numerical
prediction models still have difficulties in accurately describing the physical processes of the genesis and development of weather systems. This design of ensemble
prediction has obviously improved the effectiveness of
NWP, so ensemble prediction is widely used in NWP.
Statistical weather prediction and NWP attempt to predict weather change, which is characteristic of obvious
nonlinearity, transientness, and abrupt change. However, traditional regression analysis models for typhoon
intensity prediction are constructed based on linear correlations between the predictand and predictors. This
modeling basis for (dynamical) statistical weather prediction contains similar uncertainties to those found in
the NWP process, so it is clear that commonly used
statistical prediction, model output statistics, and the
perfect prog contain similar uncertainties as do those in
the single-model deterministic prediction of NWP.
Here, we try to develop a prediction modeling theory
that differs from traditional regression analysis and to
design and construct a new nonlinear statistical ensemble prediction model to improve the traditional
single statistical prediction equation model.

3. Principle behind and method for creating
ensemble prediction individuals
To construct an NAIEP model, a number of individual neural networks are first created and then integrated to build an ensemble prediction model.
A GA is used to construct the members of the ensemble, and a three-layer back-propagation (BP) network is used as the basic model for the neural networks
[for the detailed algorithm, see Jin et al. (2003)]; the
major computational steps are summarized below:
1) Randomly generate the connection weights and
thresholds from input layer to hidden layer and from
hidden layer to output layer, and set the global convergence error, , of the model.
2) Perform supervised learning training of the network
with learning matrix samples, calculate the error between the real input and expected output of the network, and tune the connection weight coefficients
from input layer to hidden layer and from hidden
layer to output layer using the learning algorithm of
the error-inverse propagation of the BP network.
3) If the calculated output error of the model is greater
than , return to step 2; otherwise, end the training
and compute the prediction value using the connection weights, thresholds of the network, and predictors of the prediction samples.

The three-layer BP network model is the most widely
used neural network model in various disciplines; evolutionary GA is used in this paper to create a limited
number of individual analog BP neural networks. The
GA was first presented by Professor J. Holland (Chen
et al. 1996). Its fundamental principle is to emulate the
adaptation seen in natural biological evolution processes for building an intelligent global optimization
searching algorithm. It is simpler and better in the
goodness of fit than are traditional optimization algorithms. To compute optimization, GA starts researching the population using fitness information, and does
not tend to choose local optima. Even if the fitness
function is discontinuous or noise impacted, it can
probably find the global optimum solution.
In recent years, the GA has been applied to function
optimization, machine learning, highway traffic, and industries (Su et al. 2005; Wang and Wang 2006; Wang et
al. 2006). It provides an effective approach for optimizing the practicability, structure, learning rules, and connection weights of neural networks, and for concurrently optimizing the structure and connection weights.
In the atmospheric sciences, the GA approach is used
to estimate near-surface specific humidity from satellite-based observations (Singh et al. 2005), as well as
nonlinear dynamic model retrieval of subtropical high
characteristic indices (Zhang et al. 2006). However, our
attempt to construct a meteorological NAIEP model
based on multiple neural networks using an evolutionary GA is new.
Ensemble prediction modeling of genetic neural network (GNN) involves two major steps: creating the
members of the neural network ensemble using the basic GA (Chen et al. 1996), and integrating the outputs
of the members. The basic GA consists of selection
(breeding), crossover (recombination), and mutation
(abrupt change) operations. It performs these genetic
operations through parameter coding and the continuous evolution of networks in order to determine the
most probable global optimum solution. The following
computational aspects must be considered when creating the members of the neural network ensemble.

a. Encoding
The nodes, connection weights, and thresholds for
each layer of the three-layer BP network model are
arranged in order in a code string, forming a chromosome (a genetic individual) using a mixed encoding of
binary and real numbers. This code has two parts: the
control code, a binary code of network structure mainly
controlling the number of hidden nodes, and the real
number code, representing the connection weights and
thresholds. Each genetic individual is a potentially op-

timized individual and randomly generates an initial
genetic population in the encoding space.

b. Computation of fitness
To compute fitness, we must decode the m genetic
individuals of a genetic population into their hidden
nodes and connection weights, input training samples,
and compute the output of the hidden layer,

and the output of the network,

where p is the total number of hidden nodes; hi and wij
are the matrices of the connection weight coefficients
from the input layer to the hidden layer and from the
hidden layer to the output layer; i and j are the corresponding thresholds, respectively; and the transition
function f (x)  1/(1  ex). We then calculate the global error of the network:

can be used to calculate the fitness of each genetic individual.

c. Computation of evolutionary operations
The three genetic operations (selection, crossover,
and mutation) are applied in the evolutionary operation to genetic populations depending on the fitness of
the genetic individuals; roulette wheel selection is used
in the selection operation. The fitness value Fi(x) of
each individual, as well as the sum of the fitness values
of the genetic population, are first calculated using expression (4); the probability of each individual being
selected is then computed using the following expression:

Those genetic individuals with a higher fitness (i.e.,
higher quality) have a better chance of producing offspring. Multipoint crossover is used in the crossover
operation; except for selected genetic individuals in the
population, gene exchange is performed between the
code strings of the remaining genetic individuals at multiple crossover points randomly determined using the
probability of intersection Pc, producing new genetic
individuals. In the mutation operation, allelic gene replacement between genetic individuals happens with
probability Pm, forming new genetic individuals. If a
neuron of a genetic individual is deleted by mutation,
the corresponding weight coefficient code is set to zero,
and if a neuron is added, its initial weight coefficient
code is generated randomly.
A new generation of the genetic population is produced after each run of the three genetic operators, and
the evolutionary operation repeats for a prescribed
number of times (N ). Afterward, the connection
weights and hidden nodes of the m neural networks are
determined by decoding each genetic individual; thus,
the m ensemble members for ensemble prediction modeling are also obtained. In this paper, each ensemble
member is assigned an equal weight in ensemble prediction modeling, so the sum of the prediction value of
each neural network yields the ensemble prediction
value of the GNN ensemble prediction (GNNEP)
model.

4. Ensemble prediction experiments for typhoon
intensity in July
We produced 24-h predictions of SCS typhoon intensity as an experiment of the nonlinear meteorological
ensemble prediction modeling in this paper. For more
than the past 10 years, studies on statistical and statisticaldynamic forecast models for typhoon tracks and
intensity have been undertaken in China and overseas
(DeMaria and Kaplan 1991; Lu et al. 1996); however,
typhoon intensity predictions have not improved significantly over the climatology and persistence (CLIPER)
prediction method (Meng et al. 2002). Knaff et al.
(2003, 2005) and DeMaria et al. (2005) studied objective prediction methods for hurricane intensity in the
Atlantic and the northeast and northwest Pacific basins,
but objective prediction tools for the intensity of SCS
typhoons are rare. This paper takes the intensity of SCS
typhoons as the prediction object, and uses the
CLIPER prediction of typhoon intensity as a base level
of the forecasting skill to assess our new prediction
method. CLIPER was chosen because it is objective (its
prediction model does not contain tunable parameters),
which makes it suitable for comparing prediction meth-

VOLUME 136

ods. Our results show that our new ensemble prediction
method provides much more accurate predictions than
does CLIPER; it is, therefore, a new tool as well as a
successful prediction modeling method for objectively
predicting typhoon intensity.
We used the GNNEP model (described in section 3)
method for creating individuals in our ensemble prediction experiment. For objective comparison, the
CLIPER prediction equation for typhoon intensity was
first developed, and the same predictors that were selected in the CLIPER model were also used in the
GNNEP prediction modeling. Furthermore, the data
for the two models were similarly manipulated in the
following independent sample experiments.

a. Data
Forty-six years of SCS typhoon data were taken from
the Typhoon Almanac published by the China Meteorological Administration from 1960 through 2005.
SCS typhoons in this paper refer to typhoons that
formed in or moved into the sea area 1023.5N west
of 123E and lasted at least 48 h (required for
CLIPER). The typhoon track was sampled every 12 h,
starting from the first instant the typhoon moved into
the sea area or from when a cyclone developed into a
typhoon in the area. Sample typhoons from 1960 to
1989 were used in the prediction modeling, and those
from 1990 to 2005 were used as independent samples in
prediction testing. The data from 1960 to 1989 contain
56 relevant typhoons in July, with 330 corresponding
typhoon samples for prediction modeling, and the data
from 1990 to 2005 include 27 typhoons and 156 independent samples.

b. Predictors and the CLIPER prediction equation
The CLIPER prediction of typhoon intensity assumes that a future change in typhoon intensity is associated with the current intensity, location (latitude
and longitude), and current rates of change. Thirty-one
CLIPER predictors were selected for this paper for
prediction modeling from the sample data of SCS typhoons (sample size  330), and their individual correlation coefficients with the predictand (typhoon intensity) are statistically significant above the 0.05 confidence level, with the maximum being 0.53 and the
minimum being 0.20 (Table 1). CLIPER is widely used
as a standard statistical comparison in assessing the improvements that result from new objective prediction
methods. In this paper CLIPER is used as a reference
method to show whether or not the GNNEP model is
better than the CLIPER model, which serves as a baseline of forecasting skill (Bessafi et al. 2002; Aberson

adopted to build the prediction equation; it is objective,
since it contains no tunable parameters. The only uncertainty is that in the face of a multitude of predictors,
choosing a different F may yield different combinations
of predictors and, therefore, different prediction equations with different prediction capabilities. For objective comparison and analysis, five stepwise regression
prediction equations for typhoon intensity were developed corresponding to F  1.0, F  2.0, F  3.0, F

The sample sizes of the above five CLIPER prediction equations are all 330, and the predictors in the

prediction errors (Table 2) show that the prediction
errors of Eqs. (6)(8) (F  1, 2, and 3), which contain
10, 9, and 7 predictors, respectively, are smaller (5.04,

abilities of the weight coefficient were both 0.6, and the
mutation algorithm had a mutation probability of 0.05.
The input nodes of GNN were the number of predictors
in the corresponding CLIPER equation, and the number of output nodes was one. The size of the search
space for the hidden nodes of the GNN model was
0.51.5 times the number of the input nodes, with the
solution space of the network connection weight having
been specified as [0, 1]. The training time was 200, and
the learning and momentum factors were both 0.5. After the evolutionary computation, the 50 genetic individuals were decoded to yield 50 neural network ensemble members, which were subsequently used to construct the resultant five GNNEP models using the
ensemble average method. Likewise, prediction verification of the 156 independent samples from the years
19902005 was performed using each of the five
GNNEP models. For each ensembleCLIPER model,
the first independent sample was predicted using the
330 modeling samples, the second using 331 modeling
samples (330 modeling samples plus the first independent sample, which had become a known variable when
the second sample was forecasted), and so on, until the
last (156th) independent sample was predicted using
485 modeling samples. In all successive predictions, all
parameters of the GA and GNN were kept unchanged,
to ensure comparability between independent sample
predictions and actual operational predictions. Figure 3
shows the predicted values of the typhoon intensities of
156 independent samples using the five GNNEP models constructed with different numbers (10, 9, 7, 6, and
5) of CLIPER predictors and the corresponding observed values. The statistics of the deviations of the
predicted values from those observed (Table 3) show
that the mean absolute prediction errors for the five
GNNEP models are reduced by 20.3%, 22.7%, 21.7%,
24.6%, and 20.9%, respectively, in comparison to the
corresponding CLIPER models with identical predictors. The prediction performance of the CLIPER and
ANNEP models for the 156 samples was also assessed
with grading errors. When F  1, the prediction of a
grading error 5 m s1 by the CLIPER (ANNEP)
model occurs 84 (110) times, accounting for 53.8%
(70.5%); therefore, the prediction occurrence of small
grading errors with the CLIPER model is less than that
for the ANNEP model; when F  2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0,
the results are similar. Comparison and analysis of the
statistics of the prediction errors in Tables 2 and 3 show
that although the modeling samples, predictors, and independent samples of CLIPER and the ensemble models are identical, the prediction ability of GNNEP is
clearly higher than that of the traditional CLIPER
model for typhoon intensity.

5. Performance analysis of the ensemble
prediction model
a. Contrast analysis of the ensemble model and
ensemble members
The basic principle of the GNNEP model is that
given the same expected output, the members (50 in
this paper) of the model are first created using the evolutionary GA; then, their predictions are integrated
with an equal weight to yield the resultant prediction of
the ensemble model. To emphasize the difference in
prediction performance between GNNEP and singleGNN prediction, five single-GNN prediction models
were built using the predictors of the CLIPER prediction Eqs. (6)(10) and the three-layer BP network
model introduced in section 3. The input and output
nodes of the network are the number of predictors and
one, respectively, and the number of hidden nodes is
determined by Q   R  SL  a (Ali 2004), where R
is the number of input nodes, SL is the number of output nodes, and a is a constant. The learning factor and
momentum factor are 0.5, and the training time is 200.
The predictions of the five trained single-GNN prediction models were verified, respectively, using 156 independent samples from the years 1990 to 2005, and the
predicted and observed values of the samples are
shown in Fig. 4 with their relevant prediction errors in
Table 4. Tables 2 and 3 clearly show that the mean
prediction errors of the GNN prediction models are all
smaller than those of the corresponding CLIPER models. This may be because the CLIPER prediction equation was set up using linear regression analysis, while
the GNN method was set up using artificial intelligence
nonlinear prediction modeling, which possesses strong
nonlinear mapping and self-adaptation learning abilities and therefore better reflects the nonlinear evolutionary features of typhoon intensity. Furthermore,
comparing the prediction performances of the five
single-GNN models and the five GNNEP models (see
Tables 3 and 4) clearly reveals that for identical predictors, modeling samples, and independent samples, the
GNNEP models are all more accurate than the singleGNN models. The reason for this will be proven from a
theoretical standpoint in the following subsection.

b. Theoretical derivation of the performance of the
GNNEP model
The simple mean method, where the mean weight
(i; i  1, 2, . . . , m; m  50 in this paper; i  0, and

integrate the predictions of the GNN ensemble members. If the model input for the ith GNN member is xp,
and its computed output is fi(xp), then the output of the

higher than the mean accuracy of all ensemble members, and Zheng et al. (2004) also reached the same
conclusion after analyzing the generalization errors of
neural networks. The results of the prediction verification of SCS typhoon intensity in section 4 confirm this.

c. Generalization capability of the ensemble
prediction model
The structure of a single neural network prediction
model is generally determined by personal experience
due to lack of theoretical guidance (Jin 2004). In meteorological applications of the neural network method,
it is difficult to optimize the structure of a network
before the weather event occurs, which results in overfitting of the prediction model (Jin 2005b), thus reducing the prediction accuracy. When training a threelayer BP neural network using a training set of samples,
after a certain time, the fitting accuracy of the network
model to the training samples gradually increases, while
the prediction error obviously grows with the increase
in training time (Fig. 5). In the learning stage, there is
no way to correctly determine the fitting accuracy at
which the prediction model will have the best prediction capacity for unknown samples (future weather).
Therefore, the overfitting of a neutral network prediction model is an important indicator in assessing
whether the model is of operational value. The GNNEP
model put forth in this paper is, by its nature, an ensemble model consisting of multiple neural networks,
so it is necessary to computationally analyze whether
overfitting occurs in predicting with the new ensemble
prediction model.
To determine whether overfitting occurs in GNNEP,
the five ensemble models in Table 3 were trained with
different training times (20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500,
600, 700, and 800 times; all other parameters remained
unchanged), and the successive prediction tests of 156
independent samples for each ensemble model were
performed. Table 5 shows the variations in the fitting
accuracy of the ensemble models to the training
samples and the related prediction accuracy for the independent samples. The results indicate that when the

training time increased from 20 to 100, the fitting and
prediction errors of the five ensemble models changed
only slightly, and that even when the training time increased incrementally by 100 from 100 to 800, the two
errors still remained unchanged, indicating that there
was no overfitting phenomenon in the prediction of the
GNNEP models. The prediction modeling method is of
practical significance, because the overfitting of any
neural network prediction model necessarily deteriorates the prediction accuracy of the model to independent samples. Using the same predictors, modeling
samples, and independent samples, the GNNEP model
has a prediction accuracy that is not only higher than
the CLIPER model, but also higher than the singleGNN model. Because the GNNEP model overcomes
the overfitting obstacle, it is applicable to actual operational weather forecasts.
Using identical modeling samples, predictors, and independent samples, the prediction accuracy of July SCS
typhoon intensities from the GNNEP models was compared with widely used traditional CLIPER models and
single-GNN models; the improved prediction capability
and generalization capability of the new prediction
modeling have been theoretically proven to be reasonable in sections 4 and 5. To examine the stability of its
prediction capability, similar prediction experiments

for August and September were also performed, and
the results are similar to those for July. As space is
limited, it is unnecessary to go into detail here. The
analysis results from the aforementioned large sample
size prediction experiments for July, August, and September SCS typhoon intensities clearly show that the
nonlinear GNNEP model for typhoon intensity introduced here tends to have a higher prediction accuracy,
a stable prediction capability, and robust generalization
capability.

provides theoretical evidence for the computational
result that GNNEP is more accurate than the single
neural network prediction model.
Overall, this research suggests that the meteorological ensemble modeling approach of GNN opens up a
vast range of possibilities for operational weather prediction. The theoretical derivation suggests that constructing a more highly diverse population of ensemble
members will further improve the prediction ability of
the GNNEP model. Therefore, construction of a highly
diverse ensemble merits further exploration.

6. Summary
Ensemble prediction improves the effectiveness of
NWP. In this work, we present a NAIEP modeling approach based on GA and ANN that emulates the ensemble prediction of NWP whose merits are as follow:
1) In the case of identical predictors, prediction modeling samples, and independent prediction samples,
the prediction accuracy of our GNNEP model is
clearly higher than that of the traditional CLIPER
model (which uses regression analysis).
2) Likewise, under the same conditions, the GNNEP
model is also more accurate than the single neural
network prediction model, because the structure of
its member network is determined by the optimized
GA instead of by personal experience. Further computation and analysis indicate that there is no overfitting in the predictions of the new ensemble
model, a phenomenon that generally exists in predictions by traditional single neural network methods. Therefore, GNNEP is directly applicable to actual operational weather prediction, thus providing
statistical weather prediction with a new nonlinear
intelligence prediction technique.
3) The relationship, derived in section 5b, of the prediction error of GNNEP model with the mean prediction error and diversity of its network members,
