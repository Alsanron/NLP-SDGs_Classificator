Introduction
Public transport system is a significant
component of transport system and it plays a
key role in development of sustainable
transport system. The root cause of all the
*

problems of transport system in today's world
are excessive rate of urbanization and
commuters dependency on private vehicles
rather than public transport.

realized the need of developing smart cities in
urban area and announces to develop 100
smart cities in urban areas [4]. The main
concern of new public transport system in
today's world is to control the increasing rate
of urbanization and to reduce the travellers
dependency on private vehicles to make the
transportation system more sustainable.
According to census 2011, there was an
increment in million plus cities from 35 in 2001
to 55, consisting of 107.9 million urban (39%)
population [5]. Figure 1 presents the
forecasting of vehicle population in India [3].

In developing countries like India, most of the
population and economic growth is taking
place. Rapid urbanization has made the
movement of people from the rural areas to
urban cities [1]. Urbanization in Indian Cities is
putting enormous pressure on transportation
infrastructures to respond to an increasing
travel demand with greater strength and
efficiency of the public transport system [2].
With this increasing urbanization, urban areas
are expected to house 40% of Indias
population and contribute 75% of Indias GDP
by 2030 [3]. Thus, due to increasing
urbanization the Indian government has now

There is enormous gap between the demand
and supply of the public transport in most of
the urban cities in India and these cities are
facing the problem of congestion, inadequate
public transport facilities, inappropriate
information, inadequate parking spaces and
environmental pollution. Sustainable Transport
in smart cities provide solutions that take
advantage of Intelligent Transport System
which assure superior quality of life, reduced
costs and increased efficiency [6]. Intelligent
transportation system plays a significant role in
todays transportation system and is an

33

essential expansion for development of a
sustainable transport due to concerns
regarding the economic, environmental, safety
and social equity [7]. Hence, there is urgent
requirement of developing Intelligent
Transport System for safer, effective, efficient
access, proper information and mobility into
the future while considering economic, social,
and environmental needs [8]. The main
objective of this study is to present the major
application of intelligent transport system for
developing sustainable transport system in
smart cities of India. It is expected that this

pollution, accidents, congestion, overcrowding,
lack of information and parking space etc. At
present India is leading country in the world in
traffic accidents and has the extremely high
fatality rate of road accidents in the world.
Therefore, there is immediate requirement to
develop intelligent transport systems in Indian
cities for traffic control management and to
deal with the rising threat of traffic accidents
and fatalities. Intelligent Transport System

in transport system can be adopted to make
the transport system more sustainable.


Application of Intelligent Transport
System
Intelligent transport system can be
implemented to makes the transportation
system sustainable, which is major concern of
today's world. Also, India need world class
infrastructure for the success of recently
addressed projects by Indian government i.e.,
"Make in India" and "Smart City" which
requires transportation system with better
accessibility and adequate information which is
possible with the implementation of Artificial
Intelligence System. The Intelligent Transport
System can be implemented to develop
superior transport facility, passenger
information system, intelligent traffic control
and management system, intelligent parking
system and environment friendly transport
system. Hence this study presents application
of advance technologies to enhance the quality
of transport system with real time passenger
information, safety, reliability, comfort and to
reduce the road accidents, stops and delays
and environmental pollution.

Development of Superior Transport
Facility
Indian cities are provided with poor qualities of
transport facilities, and least safety measures,
which distract the passenger to use public
transport and travellers turn towards private
vehicles. Provision of superior facilities with
implementation of artificial intelligence system

For public transport terminal facilities
generally provided with proper sitting and
waiting arrangements, in addition to this,
it can be provided with digital display
board showing information related to
buses like bus routes, location, next bus
and charges details and public transport
vehicles can facilitate recreation means
during journey to captivate more
passengers.
Electronic toll system can be used to
reduce the delays at toll plaza. Innovative
technologies can be used to make
transport modes faster and safer with
integration of multi-technologies such as
bus transit, metro rail and other modes.
The vehicle can be provided with superior
design to enhance the comfort and light
material can be used to increase power
weight ratio. Vehicles can be attached
with GPS system to develop collision free
system and to reduce rate of accidents.

Development of Passenger Information
system
In India, the transport system lacks appropriate
passenger information, passenger information
system can provide the real time traffic
situation, routes and location of buses,
weather condition, incidents identified and
busy routes etc. The passenger information
system provides all the necessary information
to the passenger so those passengers can
response accordingly. Intelligent transport
system can be applied to generate all the
necessary information and make them
available for passengers so that this system
helps the passenger to react accordingly. Figure
2 presents the detailed passenger information
system.

Intelligence transport system includes various
implementations of advance technologies in
traffic safety by use of CCTV camera attached
with central monitoring system for observing
various sections of road network, public transit
vehicles and terminal station. Another
component of traffic control and management
is traffic demand management which can be
easily managed by proper observation of real
time traffic situation with the use of artificial
intelligence system. Traffic signal can be
synchronized properly to reduce the delays at
intersection with application of artificial

intelligence system. ITS can be applied for
revenue collection and management using
electronic ticketing system and for better
transparency, data can be handled by digital
system. Figure 3 presents development of
intelligent traffic control and management
system.

Intelligent Parking System
Intelligent Parking System has interesting
functional system that assures an easy parking
with no damages, parking within minimum
possible time at any suitable place and get a
message if the parked vehicle has been
damaged anyhow while the driver is not
present in the car.

Development of Environment Friendly
Transport System
The transport system today faces major
challenges because of rapidly growing
transport demand. The main challenges of
inefficient transport system are to control the
environment pollution. Therefore, this study
promotes development of energy-efficient
technologies for development of environment
friendly transport system. The advance
technologies can be applied to encourage clean

37

technology vehicles like electric motors can be
used and vehicles with alternate fuel like bio
diesel and compressed natural gas. For better
enforcement, the air polluting and noise
creating vehicles can be detected with the use
of sensors and automatic challan system can be
used to collect charges from such vehicles.

Conclusions
The important conclusions drawn from this
study are:
