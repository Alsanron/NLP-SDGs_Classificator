A fuzzy logic model was developed to simulate the effect of leachate recirculation and sludge addition on the biogas
generation in anaerobic bioreactor landlls. The model was designed using a fuzzy logic system (FLS) which incorporated
3 input variables (time, leachate recirculation, and sludge addition) and a single manipulated output (biogas generation
rate). The biogas production rate was measured during the experiment and was increasing proportionally with the rate
of both leachate recirculation and sludge addition. The experimental work involved the operation of six simulated
laboratory-scale bioreactors for over a year under different operating schemes. The experimental results were employed
in formulating the fuzzy rule base, calibrating the model, and verifying its predictions. Then, the model was validated
against other measured data that was compiled from published studies. The FLS model simulations demonstrated high
correlation with the experimental observations.

Introduction
Leachate recirculation and sludge addition are among the most
effective techniques used in enhancing the design and operation of
bioreactor landlls. In both methods, the concept is to control and
manipulate the inuencing factors, specically moisture content and
nutrients, in a positive manner to accelerate the biodegradation of
municipal solid waste (MSW). One special advantage of leachate
recirculation is lowering the treatment cost and environmental
impacts of the high strength leachate as the organic component of
leachate is reduced by the active biological communities within the
refuse mass.
Several studies have developed mathematical models to simulate the
quantity and quality of biogas generated from landlls (El-Fadel et
al. 1989; Peer et al. 1992; Lay et al. 1998; White et al. 2004). In
addition, stochastic modeling was used to simulate landll
processes (Copty et al. 2004; Zacharof and Butler 2004). Thus far,
most of these models are practically inapplicable as they are
complicated and require extensive data inputs. Furthermore, the
heterogeneity in MSW characteristics as well as the complex
processes taking place within the landll add difculty in assessing
the individual and coupled effect of various parameters in the
system. Therefore, this study targeted an entirely different approach
which is based on fuzzy logic modeling. The fuzzy logic can offer
advantages in dealing with systems that are complex, ill structured,
and best described qualitatively (Ibrahim 2004).
The fuzzy logic is a generalization of Boolean logic implementing
the concept of partial truth or uncertainty. Within the fuzzy set

theory, an element can have a gradual membership to different sets.
The system behaviour is described by dening fuzzy sets, fuzzy
rules or so-called IF  THEN rules, and applying a fuzzy inference
scheme. The generation of a fuzzy logic system (FLS) model can be
based both on experts knowledge and experimental data. Over the
last few decades, applications of fuzzy logic have reached almost
every area of science, engineering, business, and high-tech
industries.
In this study, the FLS was employed to develop a model for MSW
biodegradation in terms of biogas generation. The time, leachate
recirculation and sludge addition were set as the controlled input
variables and the biogas generation was the only manipulated
output variable. The data obtained from the present experimental
investigation was employed in building and calibrating the rule base
of the fuzzy inference system. The model was validated by
examining its predictions against measured data that were compiled
from the literature (Bae et al. 1998; San and Onay 2001). The
statistical analyses used to test model adequacy included linear
regression between actual and predicted data and mean squared
deviation (MSD) measures.

Materials and methods
Experimental setup
The experimental setup consisted of six simulated anaerobic
bioreactor landll models made from Plexiglas with dimensions
of 150 mm in diameter and 550 mm in height. The schematic
representation of the simulated bioreactor is shown in Fig. 1. The

A fuzzy logic model for biogas generation
in bioreactor landlls
Abdallah, Fernandes, Warith and Rendra

The volume of gas produced in the simulated bioreactors was
measured using a wet tip meter device. The number of tip readings
was converted into a rate of biogas generation using a calibration
curve.
Operating schemes
The operational conditions of the six bioreactors, notated as R1 to
R6, are outlined in Table 1. The design strategy which was put
forward for this study included four combinations of operating
conditions and two center point replicates.
Fuzzy logic controller
A static fuzzy logic controller (FLC) structure was designed to
model the biodegradation of MSW. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the
typical elements of the FLC structure include: (i) inputs, (ii)
fuzzication unit, (iii) database, (iv) rule base, (v) fuzzy inference
engine, (vi) defuzzication unit, and (vii) output.
Inputs included time, leachate recirculation, and sludge addition.
The crisp values of the input variables were obtained from the
conducted experimental work.

Figure 1. Conguration of the simulated anaerobic bioreactor

bioreactors were equipped with a leachate recirculation system
including an outlet port at the bottom for leachate collection, as well
as an inlet port to distribute the simulated rainfall and the recycled
leachate.
To achieve a representative sample of MSW commonly disposed in
a landll, waste was collected from the curbside of the city of
Ottawa. The major components of this waste were paper (366%),
food (362%), and yard trimmings (272%). The collected waste
was shredded manually to a size of 5 to 10 mm and then mixed
uniformly. The shredded solid waste was lled in 100 mm layers
and compacted to a density of 350 kg/m3. The nal height of the
waste inside each bioreactor was 400 mm. The total mass and
volume of waste in the bioreactors were 25 kg and 7 L,
respectively. In addition, a layer of 15 mm diameter marbles was
placed at the bottom of each bioreactor. This supporting layer was
used as a leachate drainage system and to prevent clogging of the
leachate outlet.
The simulated rainfall was maintained at a rate of 2 L/week.
Leachate was collected in a 15 L tank and was then recycled daily
to the top of the bioreactors starting from the third week of
operation. The sludge addition was carried out through the leachate
recirculation system and using anaerobically digested and thickened
waste activated sludge from the Robert O. Pickard Environmental
Centre (ROPEC) municipal wastewater treatment plant in Ottawa.

Fuzzication is to map the observed inputs to fuzzy sets in the
universe of discourse. The fuzzication strategy involves the
following: (i) acquiring the crisp values of the three input variables,
(ii) mapping the crisp values of the input variables into the
corresponding universes of discourse and nally (iii) converting the
mapped data into suitable linguistic terms so as to make it a
compatible fuzzy sets representation.
Database is provided by dening the membership functions (MF)
of the fuzzy sets used as values for each system variable.
Membership functions must be dened for each input and output
variable and are represented by a real number ranging between 0
and 1. Figure 3 illustrates the designed MF for the leachate
recirculation and sludge addition as an example. The gure shows
the fuzzy sets dened as low rate (LR), medium rate (MR), and
high rate (HR). The complete fuzzy sets and MF, which were
dened to the developed model, are illustrated in Table 2.

A fuzzy logic model for biogas generation
in bioreactor landlls
Abdallah, Fernandes, Warith and Rendra

Figure 2. Typical structure of the fuzzy logic controller

Rule base maps fuzzy values of the inputs to fuzzy values of the
outputs. It consists of a number of fuzzy rules which dene the
system behaviour and replace the mathematical modeling of the
system. These rules are noted as an IFTHEN statement that
describes the action to be processed in response to various fuzzy
inputs. A total number of 55 statements were created to describe the

system behaviour under different operating scenarios. The following
rule is an example of the developed fuzzy rule base statements, IF
time is D AND leachate recirculation is HR AND sludge addition is
HR THEN biogas generation is MH, where D, HR, and MH stand
for, respectively, degradation, high rate, and medium high. Table 3
shows all the developed fuzzy rules in the developed model.
Fuzzy inference engine is required to determine the fuzzy output
and to compute the rules along with the membership function of the
fuzzy input. The MAX-MIN fuzzy inference technique was applied
to compute a numerical value representing the aggregate effect of
all that was triggered by an input value.
Defuzzication occurs as part of the last stage of fuzzy inference.
Typically, it involves weighting and incorporating a number of
fuzzy sets in a calculation which gives a single crisp value for the
output. The defuzzication method used in this study is the centroid
method. In this method, the defuzzied value, , can be calculated
as:
r

r

i1

i1

   ci C i =  ci

where r is the total number of rules, ci is the degree of membership
of the output fuzzy set i, and Ci is the value associated with the
peak of output fuzzy set i.
Model simulation
The fuzzy inference system was developed using the MATLAB
70 program through the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox. The simulation was
designed and run at discrete variable steps using Simulink
software, which work concurrently with the fuzzy logic toolbox.
The owchart of the developed simulation is illustrated in Fig. 4.

variables. LR, low rate; MR, medium rate; HR, high rate.

Model evaluation criteria
In addition to graphical assessment, the model was evaluated
statistically using a group of criteria that was established prior to the
evaluation process. These criteria included linear regression between
actual and predicted data and MSD measures. The regression
estimates of the intercept (a) and the slope (b) are good indicators of
accuracy; the simultaneously closer to zero the intercept is and the
slope is to unity, the higher the accuracy. On the other hand, the

correlation coefcient (R) is a good indicator of precision; the
higher the R, the higher the precision (Tedeschi 2006). The MSD is
the mean of the squared deviations around the regression line in a
plot of model simulation against measured values. Following the
approach developed by Gauch et al. (2003), the MSD was
partitioned into three components to achieve further understanding
of model performance; square bias (SB), nonunity slope (NU), and
lack of correlation (LC). These MSD components, which add up to
give MSD, have simple and distinct geometrical interpretation. SB,
NU, and LC point up the translation, rotation, and scattering around
the regression line, respectively. Additionally, the root mean square
error (RMSE) is calculated by square-rooting the MSD. The RMSE
indicates the mean difference between observed and predicted
values in their same units. However, due to the different scales of

142

the involved experimental setups, the RMSE is normalized by
dividing its value by the mean of the measured data.

Results and discussion
Experimental data analyses
The experimental data of biogas production rate was plotted
together with the model simulations for the simulated bioreactors in
Fig. 5. The general patterns of the biogas production in the six
bioreactors followed an analogous trend; starting with an increasing
rate to a peak value, followed by a declining phase. Based on the
experimental data, the positive effect of leachate recirculation was
more substantial than that of sludge addition. The baseline for the
analyses was set to be R1, which was operated under minimum

leachate and sludge recirculation rates (285 mL/kg wasted and
285 mL/kg wasted, respectively). Increasing the rate of leachate
recirculation to 855 mL/kg wasted in R2 enhanced the biogas
generation in terms of peak production time (18 weeks earlier) and
total biogas production (71% higher). On the other hand, increasing
the rate of sludge addition to 855 mL/kg wasted in R3 improved
the biogas generation in terms of peak production time (13 weeks
earlier), and total biogas production (53% higher). In R2 and R4,
where the leachate recycling rate was high (855 mL/kg wasted),
increasing the sludge addition rate didnt affect the biogas

generation signicantly. Conversely, when the leachate recycling
rate was low (285 mL/kg wasted), higher sludge addition rate in R3
(855 mL/kg wasted) improved the bioreactor performance in terms
of biogas production compared with R1 (285 mL/kg wasted).
Operating R5 and R6 at medium leachate and sludge recirculation
rates doubled the total biogas production compared with R1.
Model verication
The evaluation of the developed model is carried out through
verication and validation. Initially, the model is veried by

comparing its predictions to the experimental data that were used
already in creating the fuzzy rules and calibrating the membership
functions. Referring to Fig. 5, the model overestimated the biogas
generation in the same manner for bioreactors R1 and R3. However,
the actual production trend was fairly reproduced by the model
simulations. The differences of biogas production rate between the
simulation and experimental data ranged from 025 to 05 L/week.
144

The comparison plotted for R2 was largely similar to the one for R4.
The simulation results of R2 duplicated the experimental data with
the exception at the peak. Slight discrepancies of around 05 L/week
could be recognized during weeks 10 to 17 and 27 to 35 of the
experiment. The model developed for R5 and R6 was the same due
to the fact that these bioreactors were replicates. The FLS model
was most successful in predicting biogas production rates for R6.

of them was lled with 13 kg of shredded and compacted synthetic
solid waste. The average density of the waste matrix was 178 kg/
m3. In the recycled reactor, the recirculating frequency was
gradually increased from one to four times per week.

Evaluation Criteria section. Figure 7 shows the linear regression
between model-based predictions and measured data for the present
experiment and validation data sets. It can be observed that, in all
data sets, the slope was close to unity and the intercept was close to
zero. This could be a positive indication of the model accuracy. The
values of slope, intercept, and correlation coefcients of the
regression lines are illustrated in Table 5. The slope exceeded unity
in all cases and the intercept was negative in both the verication
data and one of the validation data sets. This demonstrates that the
FLS model overestimated the measured data in general. The model
predictions achieved high correlation with the verication data set
(R = 099). It should be claried that this ideal correlation was
achieved because the model was calibrated on this data set. In the
validation process, the model simulations were reasonably
correlated to the actual data with correlation coefcients of 084 and
091.

The validation process was run on the experimental data of the
sludge-added lysimeter and the leachate-recycled reactor in the rst
and second experiments, respectively. Table 4 summarizes the main
features and operating conditions for the selected setups. The
operational inputs and scenarios of the validation data sets were
introduced to the FLS model. Then, the predicted outputs were
plotted with the measured data in Fig. 6.
In the rst study, the model overestimated the biogas generation by
an average of 20% during the periods of gradual increase and
decrease of the rate. In contrast, the model underestimated the peak
and produced a constant generation rate during this part. This could
be due to the fact that, in this study, the sludge addition rates
between week 30 and week 40 were higher than the maximum
recycling rate that was dened in the model. As these rates were not
expressed in the fuzzy rules, the FLS model applied the maximum
dened recycling rate scenario constantly during that period.
Despite that, the model predicted accurately the average measured
production through that period and eventually followed the
decreasing trend of the actual data.
In the second experiment, the pattern of the biogas generation was
anomalous; the curve started with a major generation rate followed
by gradual decrease to the dip. Afterwards, the production rate
started to increase steadily. This irregular shape was produced as a
result of the operating scheme that was followed in that particular
experimental study. This actually added to the merit of the FLS
model validation process. The model predicted the general trend of
the production pattern adequately despite the fact that it
underestimated the generation rate during most of the operation
period.
Statistical analyses
The evaluation criteria and main features of the statistical tests that
were selected for this study were previously discussed in the Model

Based on the MSD partitioning shown in Table 5, LC was the main
contributing component to MSD. The average percentages of SB,
NU, and LC to MSD were 25%, 1%, and 74%, respectively.
Accordingly, the deviations could be attributed mostly to scattering
around the regression line as well as translation of the regression
line from the 1:1 line. The differences between measured and
simulated values were expressed in terms of the normalized RMSE.
The FLS model achieved an acceptable normalized RMSE of
1372% for the present experiment, whereas, it achieved a
signicantly high percentage (4234% in average) for the validation
data sets. These shortcomings could have been avoided if more data
and operating scenarios were implemented in the construction and
calibration processes of the fuzzy rules and membership functions
of the FLS model.

Conclusions
The main objective of this work was to develop a fuzzy logic
system that is capable of simulating the biogas generation in an
anaerobic bioreactor landll. The developed model went through
several steps to evaluate its potentials and reveal its weak points. In
the verication step, the FLS model proved to simulate perfectly the
experimental data; this was conrmed statistically. On the other
hand, the validation process revealed certain weaknesses in the

The overall model simulation proved signicant concurrence with
the experimental results indicating the model reliability in capturing
the pertinent features of the system. The validation process showed
that the fuzzy logic system functions better when the modeled
system is fully described under all possible operating conditions.
However, the validation process proved the model exibility in
dealing with atypical operating scenarios such as irregular biogas
generation trends and extreme recirculating rates. Based on these
ndings, the application of the fuzzy logic system in modeling the
MSW biodegradation process can be considered as a successful
simulating technique that implicitly describes the large number of
complex physical and biochemical processes that occur within the
bioreactor landll.
