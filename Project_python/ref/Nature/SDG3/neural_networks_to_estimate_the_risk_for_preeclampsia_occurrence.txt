Abstract-A number of neural network schemes have been
applied to a large data base of pregnant women, aiming at generating a predictor for the estimation of the risk of occurrence
of preeclampsia at an early stage. The database was composed
of 6838 cases of pregnant women in UK, provided by the Harris Birthright Research Centre for Fetal Medicine in London.
For each subject, 24 parameters were measured or recorded.
Out of these, 15 parameters were considered as the most influencing at characterizing the risk of preeclampsia occurrence. A
number of feedforward neural structures, both standard multilayer and multi-slab, were tried for the prediction. The best
results obtained were with a multi-slab neural structure. In the
training set there was a correct classification of the 83.6% cases
of preeclampsia and in the test set 93.8%. The preeclampsia
cases prediction for the totally unknown verification test was
100%.

INTRODUCTION

P

reeclampsia is a syndrome that may appear during pregnancy and can cause perinatal and maternal morbidity
and mortality. It affects approximately 2% of pregnancies
[1]-[2]. It is characterized by hypertension (if isolated called
Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension (PIH)) and by significant
protein concentration in the urine (proteinuria). Such a high
blood pressure may result in damage to the maternal endothelium, kidneys and liver [3]-[4].
The time that preeclampsia may occur is during the late
2nd or 3rd trimester. It has also been observed that it is more
common to women on their first pregnancy.
The prevailing conditions that lead to preeclampsia are
not well understood, hence its detection depends on signs or
investigations. The likelihood of developing preeclampsia is
increased by a number of factors in the maternal history,
including Afro-Caribbean ethnicity, nulliparity, high body
mass index (BMI), and previous or family history of preeclampsia [6]. However, screening by maternal history alone
will detect only 30% of those who will develop the condition, with a false positive rate of 10%. Thus, the early diagnosis of preeclampsia is difficult, and the prognosis even
more hard.

tic interventions have been largely unsuccessful [7]-[8].
For these reasons, any tool that may improve the detection
of preeclampsia, as for instance a reliable predictor or a
method for the effective and early identification of the highrisk group, would be of great help to obstetricians and of
course to pregnant women.
In recent years, neural networks and other computationally intelligent techniques have been used as medical diagnosis tools aiming at achieving effective medical decisions
incorporated in appropriate medical support systems [9][11]. Neural networks in particular have proved to be quite
effective and have also resulted in suitable patents [12]-[13].

DATA

This study uses results of a prospective screening study
for preeclampsia in singleton pregnancies from the greater
London area and South-East England. All of the women
were attending the clinical center for routine assessment of
risk for chromosomal abnormalities.
This is performed by measurement of fetal nuchal translucency thickness, maternal serum free human chorionic gonadotropin (thCG) and serum pregnancy-associated plasma
protein A (PAPP-A) at 11 to 13+6 weeks of gestation. Gestational age was derived from the fetal crown-rump length
(CRL).
Written informed consent was obtained from the women
agreeing to participate in the study, which was approved by
King's College Hospital Ethics Committee.
Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire on maternal age, ethnic origin (White, Afro-Caribbean, Indian or
Pakistani, Chinese or Japanese, or mixed), cigarette smoking
during pregnancy, alcohol intake during pregnancy, drug
abuse during pregnancy, medical history, medication, parity
(parous or nulliparous if no delivery beyond 23 weeks), obstetric history (including previous pregnancy with preeclampsia), and family history of preeclampsia (sister,
mother, or both). The maternal weight and height were
measured, and the BMI was calculated in kilograms per meter squared.
The Blood Pressure (BP) was taken by automated devices,
and the arm with the highest final Mean arterial pressure
(MAP) for the subsequent analysis of results was used [14][15].
For the measurement of uterine artery pulsatility index
(UPI) a sagittal section of the uterus was obtained with each
uterine artery along the side of the cervix at the level of the
internal cervical os. Pulsed wave Doppler was used with the
sampling gate set at 2 mm to cover the whole vessel with the
angle of insonation being less than 50 0  When three similar

2221

consecutive waveforms were obtained, the UPI was measured and the mean PI of the left and right arteries was calculated.
The database was composed of 6838 cases of pregnant
women. These were provided by the Harris Birthright Research Centre for Fetal Medicine (FMF) in London. For
each woman, 24 parameters were logged. Some of these
parameters were socio-epidemiologic, others were records
from a clinical examination and a third group from laboratory measurements.
The number of cases that preeclampsia occurred were
only 116, which is a very small sub-database (1.7%) to be
used for training of a neural system aiming at achieving
good generalization . The definitions of pre-eclamps ia used
were those of the guidelines of the International Society for
the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy [16].
From the available data some parameters were excluded,
based on recommendations from medical experts, thus only
15 parameters, out of the total of 24, were ultimately considered as the most influencing at characterizing the risk of
preeclampsia occurrence, and were used in the built-up of
the neural predictor. These parameters are shown in Table 1.

A number of feedforward neural structures, both standard
multilayer - of varying number of layers and neurons per
layer, as well as multi-slab of different structures, sizes, and
activation functions, were systematically tried for the prediction. This was done in a planned manner so that the best
architecture would be obtained.
Considering the results obtained by such a systematic
search, it was possible to ultimately select and use a multislab neural structure having four slabs that were connected
as depicted in Figure 1.
All weights were initialized to 0.3, while the learning rate
was the same for all connections, having value of 0.1. Similarly, the momentum rate was 0.2 for all links. These values
were selected based on extensive experience the authors
have, which was gained during many studies of medical and
other classification and prediction using artificial neural
networks .
The test set was applied at the end of each epoch to test
the progress of training. If the results during testing at time t
were better than those at time t - 1, the weights were saved
as a better set. At the end of the process, the best weight set
was kept for the prediction.

The parameters were encoded in appropriate numerical
scales that could make the neural processing to be most effective.
A set of 36 cases was extracted and used to test the progress of training (test set). This data set included 16 cases
(44%) of women that exhibited preeclampsia.
Also, a hold out verification data set having 9 cases of
which 5 were with preeclampsia (56%), was also extracted
to be used as totally unknown to the neural network, and
thus to be used for checking the prediction capabilities of
each attempted network.

The training progress was monitored to observe whether
there was improvement during the application of the training
and test set data. For most of the network structures that
were attempted, there was little generalization improvement
after about 1200 epochs, as depicted in Figure 2.
Different sets of inputs were used to find an effective neural structure that would predict preeclampsia to an acceptable level. The inputs that were ultimately selected are those
shown in Table 1.
Further to the artificial neural network structures that

2222

were developed as preeclampsia predictors, multiple linear
regression and a form of multiple nonlinear regression were
also explored as possible predictors.
The multiple nonlinear regression model used was of the
form shown below.
PET = C/Iog(MA) + C2exp(UPI) + C3exp(PAPP-A) +
+ C4cxp(Ethnicity) + C5Iog(Weight) +
+ C6Iog(Height) + C7 (Smoking) +
+ Cs(Alcohol) + C9(PrevPET) +
+ ClOcxp(Conception) + Cll(Medications) +
+ C/2(Drugs) + C/3(FHojMother) +
+ C141og(GA-d) + C/5Iog(CRL)

The results from the two regression methods were substantially inferior to those given by the neural structures, as
will be explained in the following section.
In all cases the decision threshold has been set to 0.5.

In Table 2 an overall picture of the prediction results of
the best neural network is presented. The best results were
obtained with a multi-slab neural structure of the type described in Figure 1. In the training set, there was a correct
classification of the 83.6% cases of preeclampsia and in the
test set 93.8%. The preeclampsia cases predicted correctly
for the totally unknown verification test set was 100%. In
this set however, two subjects were predicted to exhibit
preeclampsia, while they actually did not.

Table 3 shows the network prediction results for the 9
cases of the totally unknown verification test set. It is seen
that the sensitivity (and the true positive fraction) is 100%,
while the specificity is 50%, and the false positive fraction
also 50%.
From a parameter contribution analysis it was observed
that all 15 parameters contributed to the prediction. However, the mean arterial pressure and the uterine pulsatility
index were the most influential, while the "Ethnicity" parameter was the least contributing .

As for the multiple linear regression and the multiple
nonlinear regression, the prediction results were rather disappointing . A summary of the results is shown in Tables 4
and 5. It is seen that their generalization capabilities are
rather very poor, since both of the methods did not predict
any preeclampsia cases for the totally unknown verification
test set.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

Attempts to predict preeclampsia using multivariate statistics have been reported in the past [17], but the use of neural
network methodologies is very rare [18].
Furthermore, in other areas of fetal medicine prediction
model methodologies have been equally necessary and clinically meaningful [19]-[20].
Based on the results obtained, it may be concluded that
the neural structure has been shown to be an effective and
reliable predictor for this set of data.

The choice of 11+0 to 13+6 weeks as the gestational age
for screening was made because this has been established as
the first hospital visit of pregnant women at which combined
sonographic and biochemical testing for chromosomal and
other major defects is carried out [22].

The neural network classifier certainly performed much
better than the multiple linear regression and the multiple
nonlinear regression. Indeed, it has identified all five preeclampsia cases in the totally unknown verification set. It also
identified correctly two more cases as non-preeclamptic.
However, it predicted preeclampsia for two unknown subjects, while these women did not manifest preeclampsia .
This means that the doctors should probably look more carefully to such cases, which in any case were on the safe side.
The association between Afro-Caribbean race and obesity
with increased risk of pre-eclampsia is well documented
[17]; [21], a finding not supported by our study. This could
be due to the small number of such cases in the training data
set. Thus, the network needs to be tested further on a completely new and more expanded database of preeclampsia
cases, involving a larger sample of Afro-Caribbean cases.
Such a larger data set is not easily obtained, as it will be
based on real people with real diseases, and not simulated
