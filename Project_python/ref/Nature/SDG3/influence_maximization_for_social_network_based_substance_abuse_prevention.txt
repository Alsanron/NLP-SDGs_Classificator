Abstract
Substance use and abuse is a significant public health problem in the United States. Group-based intervention programs
offer a promising means of reducing substance abuse. While
effective, inappropriate intervention groups can result in an
increase in deviant behaviors among participants, a process
known as deviancy training. In this paper, we present GUIDE,
an AI-based decision aid that leverages social network information to optimize the structure of the intervention groups.

Introduction
Substance use and abuse is a significant public health problem among youth in the United States. According to the
Monitoring the Future study (McCabe et al. 2014), around
54 percent of high school students have tried at least one
illicit substance. Interventions programs have successfully
utilized social networks to disseminate and reinforce positive behavioral norms (e.g., (Valente et al. 2003)). This is
achieved through formation of subgroups where the individuals can talk, share experiences and engage in various
constructive activities, and this way they form new social
ties or abandon some of their existing relationships. Unfortunately, these social network-based efforts may also inadvertently increase the chances of exposure to negative social
influence, as the social network of the youth changes. This
is known as deviancy training and has been a problematic
issue in these prevention programs. From an AI perspective,
this problem can be viewed as a social network partitioning
problem with the objective of maximizing positive influence
and minimizing negative influence. However, to best of our
knowledge no work has addressed such influence-based partitioning of networks with changing structures. To address
this challenge, we propose an AI-based decision aid, called
GUIDE (GroUp-based Intervention DEcision aid). GUIDE
assists interventionists in substance abuse prevention, using
a model for the group-based interventions that enables predicting, both the expected success of the intervention, and
the possibility of harm, or deviancy training. We show that
finding the optimal network partition is NP-hard and we use
both a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) and a greedy-based

local search method that enables us to optimize for the network partitions.
Tie Formation and Breakage. As a result of the interventions, the strength of the relationships is subject to
change (Centola and Macy 2007). For example, there is empirical evidence to suggest that the more similar two individuals are, the stronger their ties are (Aral and Walker 2014).
Also, if two individuals are separated and at least one of
them has user behavior, the intervention message will be
to cut or weaken that tie. Therefore, based on behavioral theories, and observations in the previous interventions, we propose a model to explain how the network evolves during the
course of the intervention which is summarized in Table 1.
In this table, the row labels are the behavior of the nodes, the
column labels show their pre-intervention tie and the entries
indicate the post-intervention tie.
Substance Abuse Prevention Influence Spread Model.
Depending on how the network evolves, we evaluate the influence to predict the changes in the nodes behaviors. We
use a variant of the popular Linear Threshold model proposed in (Borodin, Filmus, and Oren 2010). Base on our
model, each node selects a threshold value, uniformly at random, to represent his/her threshold to change behavior. If
the incoming signal from the opposite behavior exceeds this
threshold, the change happens with a fixed probability.

against three baselines commonly employed by practitioners.

Mixed-Integer Programming Formulation
We present a Mixed Integer Linear Optimization (MIP) formulation for this problem and we use Gurobi solver to find
the optimal partitioning.

Local Neighborhood Search (LNS)
We also use local search methods to optimize for the
network partitions for scalability. LNS starts from a random
feasible graph partition, and it improves the solution by
searching in a space of candidate solutions. In this work, we
restrict the search neighborhood to that created by random
single swap of pairs of nodes. The search continues until no
single swap can further improve the solution.

Results and Discussion
Baselines. For evaluation, we compare three variations of
our optimization approach (MIP, LNS and MIP+LNS which
is MIP using LNS solution as warm-start) against three different baselines that either randomly assign the individuals,
or let them decide based on their friendships, or finally a
teacher nominated baseline, which uses a heuristic to divide
up the participants. One the common heuristics is the even
distribution of the users across groups.
Solution Quality Metrics. Different solution strategies are
compared based on a success metric, which we define as:
success =

intervention impact
maximum possible impact

The numerator is in fact the expected number of youth
that have become non-users as the result of the intervention. The denominator is its maximum possible value
which corresponds to the case where all users threshold
are exceeded (they are surrounded by enough non-user
friends).
Solution Quality. Figures 1 (a) and (b) compare the success of the optimization techniques, MIP and LNS against
different baselines across 4 different network sizes. The MIP
solve time is given a cutoff equal to the solution time of LNS
(summed over the 50 iterations). These results indicate that
the solutions of both MIP+LNS and LNS are significantly
better than any of the traditional methods for forming these

groups, both statistically and practically. Surprisingly, in figure 1 (b) it can be observed that the common intuition of
evenly distributing the users across the groups is in fact
very sub-optimal (Distribute-users baseline). This is an insightful result for practitioners and is one of key areas where
GUIDE can help practitioners. We show that uniform distribution of users, while ignoring their existing relationships,
can greatly decrease the success rate of these interventions.
The high variation in the friendship-based assignment is another important result. This is aligned with the conclusion
in (Valente 2012) that network-based strategies can be very
beneficial for the intervention success, while they can also
cause more harm if are not carefully designed. There are
computational lessons learned as well. For example, MIP is
guaranteed to find the optimal solution by searching the entire solution space, but as shown here, it is not a practical
solution due to time constraints. And in fact, LNS outperforms MIP solution given the same time budget. To further
analyze the quality of the LNS solution, we performed a new
optimization using the LNS solution as the warm up solution
in MIP. These experiments are run for up to 12 hours. Interestingly, the LNS and MIP+LNS warm-start perform almost
the same, providing better confidence in the LNS solution.

Conclusion
Substance abuse is a very significant public health and social problem in the United States. We showed that by careful
construction of the intervention groups, we can outperform
the traditional strategies significantly. GUIDE is developed
in collaboration with Urban Peak, a homeless-youth serving organization in Denver, CO, and is under preparation for
deployment.
