Abstract Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC), and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
are severe complications affecting Very Low Birth Weight
(VLBW) infants. Our findings show that data gathered in the
intensive care unit during the first 24 or 72 hours of care
can be used to predict whether a VLBW infant is at risk
of developing BPD. Using Gaussian process classification, we
achieved classification results with areas under the receiver
operator characteristic curve of 0.85 (standard error (SE) 0.05)
for 24h and 0.87 (SE 0.06) for 72h BPD data. This compares
favourably with results achieved using the clinical standard
SNAP-II and SNAPPE-II scores. Sensitivity for BPD was 0.52
(SE 0.06). Sensitivity for NEC and ROP was close to zero,
suggesting that NEC and ROP can not be reliably predicted
with this approach from our data set.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) infants are born with a
birth weight less than 1500 g. VLBW infants require critical
care in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and are at a
high risk of developing both acute and later serious health
issues. Many of their later problems are thought to originate
from early care phases.
Three major complications affecting VLBW infants are
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [1], necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) [2], and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) [3].
The aim of the present study was to develop machine
learning tools for early prediction of BPD, NEC, and ROP in
VLBW infants using time series data. The contribution of this
paper is to show that Gaussian process (GP) classification [4]
can be used to predict whether a patient is in danger
of developing BPD using time series data from the first
24 or 72 hours after a VLBW infants admission to the
NICU. Prediction of NEC and ROP using data from the
same time frame gives results with close to zero sensitivity,
which suggests that this approach does not work for these
diagnoses.
In our previous work, NICU data from initial 24 hours
has been used to predict in-hospital mortality [5] with GP
classification. Prior to this, logistic regression [6], [7], [8],

978-1-5386-1030-5/17/$31.00 2017 IEEE

[9] and classifiers [9], [10] based on support vector machines
(SVM) [11] have been used for BPD. An algorithm has been
developed for predicting NEC using proteins in urine [12].
The prediction of sepsis, NEC, and in-hospital mortality
using biosignals have also been considered [13], [14], [15].
II. BACKGROUND
BPD, NEC, and ROP all manifest from days to weeks
postnatally, but the development of all these diseases starts
perinatally or during the early postnatal period [16]. Early
prediction and identification of these disorders is a primary
target when aiming at preventing or having early treatments
for these conditions and consequently improving the prognosis of VLBW infants.
BPD is a severe chronic pulmonary complication of
preterm birth. This most common lung disease in preterm
infants can be diagnosed starting from the age of four weeks
(28 days) [16]. Despite many advances in neonatal medicine,
the incidence of BPD has not declined [17]. The majority of
infants developing BPD have a birth weight less than 1250
g and they have postnatally required ventilator treatment for
respiratory distress [16]. With the survivors, BPD is a major
cause of long-term lung dysfunction causing a heavy burden
on health care services and medical resources throughout
childhood.
NEC is a critical illness in which segments of intestine undergo necrosis (tissue death). Severe NEC typically manifests
during the first several weeks after birth, but its origins are
thought be in the early phases of care. It is a life-threatening
condition that often requires surgery and increases the risks
for long term consequences, such as malnutrition, growth
failure, BPD, ROP, and neurodevelopmental problems. Current treatments of NEC are not always effective [2].
Over 30% of VLBW infants weighing less than 1250 g
develop ROP that can lead to severe vision problems and
blindness in one or both eyes. Prematurity, low birth weight,
and inappropriate oxygen levels are known risk factors of
ROP [18], [19]. The incidence of ROP peaks postnatally
at adjusted gestational age of 3638 weeks [20]. Despite
advances in treatments, ROP continues to be a significant
problem in VLBW patients.

186

SNAP-II and SNAPPE-II scores measure neonatal illness severity and predict risk for mortality. SNAP-II represents mortality risk from physiological problems, to which
SNAPPE-II adds supplemental risk factors, such as birth
weight and growth restriction [21]. They are calculated with
data collected during the first 12 hours after admission to
the NICU using variables such as blood pressure, body
temperature, serum pH, birth weight, gestational age, and so
on. Infants with a high SNAPPE-II score have been found
to have significantly higher rates of NEC and BPD [22].

complete time series data for the 24h and 72h periods being
analyzed was available for >1000 patients.
The classification results were validated by stratified 5fold crossvalidation which takes the class priors into account
when forming the partitions.
For comparison purposes, patients were classified using
thresholding with SNAP-II and SNAPPE-II scores only. A
reference classifier which assumes that no patient will get
the diagnosis in question was also used to quantify the
classification results.

IV. R ESULTS

Our data set contains data collected from 2059 VLBW infants treated between 1999 and 2013 in the NICU of Helsinki
University Hospitals Childrens Hospital. There are 416
(20%) patients diagnosed with BPD, 65 (3%) patients
diagnosed with NEC, and 153 (7%) patients diagnosed
with ROP.
For each patient, there are static values (SNAP-II and
SNAPPE-II score, birth weight, and gestational age at birth)
and time series data (systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial
blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation). Time
series data is averaged over 2 minute intervals.

We have compared the classification results using the
area (AUC) under the receiver operator characteristic curve
(ROC) [24]. Tables I (BPD), II (NEC), and III (ROP)
show the classification result using all available features
and using only time series variables (i.e. without BW/GA)
for 24h and 72h data, as well as thresholding results for
SNAP-II and SNAPPE-II and the reference classifier. The
results are shown in descending order by AUC. Standard
error (SE) is shown in parentheses for all results. Figures 1
(BPD), 2 (NEC), and 3 (ROP) show the ROC curves for the
best 24h and 72h GP classifiers, and SNAP-II/SNAPPE-II
thresholding.

For training the classifier we used the GPstuff Toolbox [23] with Laplace approximation on the latent variables
and circular composite design integration over the hyperparameters.
Gestational age and birth weight were used as static features. In addition, we used time series data for the following
five variables: systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial blood
pressure, ECG heart rate, and oxygen saturation. These parameters were chosen because of their clinical and scientific
importance. In the case of time series data, availability was
also a consideration; for the chosen variables, reasonably

As with BPD and NEC, the best AUC 0.83 (SE 0.03)

The best predictive classification results were achieved for
BPD, with AUC 0.85 (SE 0.05) for 24h and 0.87 (SE 0.06)
for 72h data. This was in excess of the results for SNAP-II
(AUC 0.70, SE 0.03) and SNAPPE-II (AUC 0.72, SE 0.04),
indicating that GP classification using time series data is a
better predictor of a patients likelihood of developing BPD
than either of these medical standard scores.
ROP classification results were better than SNAP-II and
SNAPPE-II thresholding, however, sensitivity (true positive
rate) in the best predictions was close to zero. Factors
predisposing to ROP may emerge later than the (up to) 3-day
period of this study, and so its reliable prediction may require
data from a longer time period. It is also quite possible that
the variables chosen for this study are not optimal for ROP
prediction.
In the prediction of NEC, AUC for 24h data (0.72) was
marginally better than SNAPPE-II (0.69). 72h data gave
better results, with AUC 0.74 (SE 0.02). SNAP-II has not
been found to predict later development of NEC [13], and
our AUC 0.68 (SE 0.03) is in agreement. Heart rate characteristics, such as heart rate variability (HRV), are known to
correlate with sepsis and NEC [14]. However, our data set
is averaged over 2 minute intervals and does not have beatto-beat information, so we could not use HRV as a feature.
A SVM-based approach has been used to achieve an
accuracy of 0.832 for BPD prediction [10]. Our best GP
accuracy result was 0.81 (SE 0.01) for 24h and 0.84 (SE
0.01) for 72h data. These accuracy values are not directly
comparable, due to the difference in sample sizes (a cohort
of 109 patients for [10] vs. 2059 for our study) and class
sizes (42% positive for [10] vs. 20% positive for our
study).
In another study [15], heart rate (one of our time series
features) measured during the first 7 days was found to
correlate with BPD, but no such correlation was found for

188

NEC and ROP. SNAP-II was also found to correlate with
BPD, but not with NEC and ROP. This agrees with our
findings.
There is a direct correlation between prediction accuracy
and relative class size. Only 65 out of 2059 were diagnosed
with NEC, making the negative class more than 30 times as
large as the positive class.
Gestational age and birth weight have been found earlier
to be important variables in predicting BPD [6]. There is a
marked correlation with these two features and the general
well-being of a VLBW infant, but they can not be used to
achieve a good classification result by themselves.
The classifier, as presented, can be used to predict BPD but
would have to be revised for NEC and ROP, perhaps by using
a sliding time window tracking recent changes in patient state
instead of only data from the early stages of care. Feature
selection is also an important factor. The data set used in
this paper contains time series data for blood pressure, heart
rate, and oxygen saturation. Using supplementary oxygen,
its effect on oxygen saturation, and the rates of change of
both could shed more light on these, especially in the case
of ROP.
VI. C ONCLUSIONS
Time series data from the initial hours of a VLBW infants
life can be used to predict the infants susceptibility to major
complications. These predictions will in general be more
accurate than just using the medical standard SNAP-II or
SNAPPE-II scores, which are established with data available
from the first 12 hours in the NICU.
In this study we looked at the predictive power of 24h
and 72h data. As can be expected, classification results were
improved when more data was available. However, 24h data
already gives a good prediction of an infants likelihood of
developing BPD.
In contrast with BPD, our findings show that GP classification can not reliably predict NEC nor ROP using early
time series data for blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen
saturation.
A classification tool based on this approach could assist
care personnel in following the most important parameters in
order to identify and predict patients most likely to develop
complications and subsequently to develop personalized care
for these patients at risk.
