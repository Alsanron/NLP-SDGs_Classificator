AbstractPreeclampsia is a major determinant of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. We used a proteomic
strategy to identify urinary biomarkers that predict preeclampsia before the onset of disease. We prospectively collected
urine samples from women throughout pregnancy. Samples from gestational weeks 12 to 16 (n45), 20 (n50), and
28 (n18) from women who subsequently had preeclampsia develop were matched to controls (n86, n49, and
n17, respectively). We performed capillary electrophoresis online coupled to micro-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
Disease-specific peptide patterns were generated using support vector machine-based software. Candidate biomarkers
were sequenced by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. From comparison with nonpregnant controls, we
defined a panel of 284 pregnancy-specific proteomic biomarkers. Subsequently, we developed a model of 50 biomarkers
from specimens obtained at week 28 that was associated with future preeclampsia (classification factor in cases,
1.0320.411 vs controls, 1.0380.432; P0.001). Classification factor increased markedly from week 12 to 16 to
28 in women who subsequently had preeclampsia develop (n16; from 0.3920.383 to 1.0700.383; P0.001) and
decreased slightly in controls (n16; from 0.6470.437 to 1.0240.433; P0.043). Among the biomarkers are
fibrinogen alpha chain, collagen alpha chain, and uromodulin fragments. The markers appear to predict preeclampsia
at gestational week 28 with good confidence but not reliably at earlier time points (weeks 1216 and 20). After
prospective validation in other cohorts, these markers may contribute to better prediction, monitoring, and accurate
diagnosis of preeclampsia. (Hypertension. 2011;57[part 2]:561-569.)  Online Data Supplement

reeclampsia affects 3% to 7% of pregnant women worldwide and represents a significant challenge for the scientific community. Several maternal risk factors are associated
with the condition,1 but it remains extremely difficult to
predict which women are likely to be affected. Once diagnosed, there is no effective treatment other than delivery of
the baby. Accurate identification of those at risk would
facilitate intervention such as low-dose aspirin and/or calcium supplementation,2,3 closer monitoring, and timely intervention when required. In addition to clinical characteristics,
several biochemical markers including serum FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1 and placental growth factor have been proposed for improving early and accurate prediction and diagnosis of preeclampsia;4 however, none has been sensitive or
specific enough to be used routinely in clinical practice.
The majority of biomarkers investigated for the prediction
of preeclampsia have been hypothesis-led and derived from
pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of the condition. It is
probably unrealistic to expect that a single biomarker could
be used to predict such a diverse condition as preeclampsia.

Research in recent years therefore has moved toward unbiased systems medicine approaches, using hypothesisgenerating strategies to investigate new pathways. One such
approach that holds promise in preeclampsia research is
proteomics, the analysis of thousands of peptides and proteins
simultaneously.5
Urine represents a promising medium for proteomic-based
preeclampsia research. Renal pathology is one of the hallmarks of the condition and, in keeping with serum, urinary
levels of antiangiogenic peptides have been shown to be
altered in women with preeclampsia.6,7 Urine is stable when
frozen at 20C or 70C for several years, without requiring special preparation.8 We and others have identified and
validated urinary proteomic biomarkers for the early diagnosis of various diseases, including coronary artery disease,9,10
diabetes,11 and diabetic nephropathy.12 In addition to providing potentially clinically useful biomarkers, these studies also
have given insight to novel pathophysiological mechanisms.
Encouraged by these observations, we used capillaryelectrophoresis (CE) mass spectrometry (MS) techniques to

examine the urinary proteome in pregnancy and to investigate
peptide patterns that could be used as predictive biomarkers
for preeclampsia.

Patients and Methods
Patient Recruitment
Samples from 2 separate study populations were examined. The
Proteomics in Preeclampsia (PIP) study was a longitudinal study
designed to identify urinary proteomic biomarkers in early pregnancy that could be used to predict preeclampsia in later pregnancy.
Two-thousand five hundred women with singleton pregnancies were
recruited by study nurses at their initial antenatal hospital visit
(gestational week 1216) at the Southern General Hospital, the
Queen Mothers Hospital, and the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital, Glasgow, between October 2007 and March 2009. Women with
a history of chronic hypertension, diabetes, or renal disease were
excluded. After written informed consent, urine and blood samples,
and information about medical and obstetric history were obtained.
Delivery information, obtained from hospital databases, was available for 2407 women (95%); those who had fetal losses at 20
weeks of gestation (n22) were not included, leaving 2385 women
in the final analysis. Case notes were reviewed by 1 investigator
(D.M.C.) for all women who had gestational hypertension or
preeclampsia develop. Characteristics of the overall study population
are shown in Table 1.
To identify biomarkers in mid pregnancy that could be used to
predict preeclampsia, 132 of the 2385 women who were identified as
having at least 2 traditional risk factors for preeclampsia1 attended
for further sampling at gestational week 28. Of the 132 women, 18
(13.6%) had preeclampsia develop and were matched for age and
body mass index at sampling to 17 controls who had normotensive

deliveries of appropriately grown babies after 37 weeks of gestation.
Patient characteristics are shown in Supplemental Table S1 (please
see http://hyper.ahajournals.org).
Overall, 45 (1.9%) of the 2385 women in the PIP study had
preeclampsia develop (cases). Cases were matched for age, body
mass index, and gestational age at sampling with 86 women who had
uncomplicated pregnancies (controls) using a nested case-control
design. Patient characteristics are shown in Supplemental Table S2
(please see http://hyper.ahajournals.org). Of the 45 cases, 12 had
proteinuria confirmed either by 24-hour collection or by protein-tocreatinine ratio, and the remainder had dipstick-positive proteinuria.
Eighty percent of the 45 women with preeclampsia delivered after 37
weeks of gestation; none had documented hypertension before 28
weeks of gestation.
Further early pregnancy urinary samples were obtained from the
Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) study, an international
cohort study of healthy nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies.13 Between November 2004 and October 2008, 3234 women
were recruited into the SCOPE study in Auckland, New Zealand, and
in Adelaide, Australia. Women were interviewed, examined, and
specimens obtained at 151 and 201 weeks of gestation and had
an ultrasound scan at 201 weeks of gestation. Women were
followed-up prospectively throughout pregnancy, with outcome data
collected by research midwives. All preeclampsia cases were reviewed by the principal investigators and the diagnosis was confirmed. Data were entered directly into a web-based database with a
complete audit trail (MedSciNet). Pregnancy outcome data were
available for 99% (n3196). After exclusion of fetal losses before
22 weeks of gestation (n26) and women not attending the 20-week
interview (n69), the base population for this study comprised 3101
women (96% of recruits). Of the 3101 women, 175 (5.6%) had
preeclampsia develop, of whom 158 (5.1%) delivered after 34 weeks
of gestation. SCOPE cases (n50) were randomly selected from the
late-onset preeclampsia subgroup and controls (n50) were selected
from women with uncomplicated pregnancies (n1767), defined as
no antenatal obstetric or medical complications with delivery of an
appropriately grown healthy baby at 37 weeks of gestation. Among
the 50 women with preeclampsia, 45 had proteinuria and 5 had
preeclampsia diagnosed after multi-organ complications developed.
Urinary samples from gestational week 20 were used for proteomic
analysis, with 1 control specimen excluded for technical reasons.
Patient characteristics are shown in Supplementary Table S3 (please
see http://hyper.ahajournals.org).
Preeclampsia was defined as blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg
after 20 weeks of gestation (but before the onset of labor) or in the
postnatal period, with either proteinuria (24-hour urinary protein
300 mg, spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 30 mg/mmol, or
urine dipstick ) or evidence of multi-organ complications or
both.14
To characterize the urinary proteome in normal pregnancy, the
results from pregnant women were compared with the urinary
proteome in apparently healthy, nonpregnant, female employees of
the University of Hannover, Germany, recruited in 2002 to 2003.
Samples from 17 women with uncomplicated pregnancies (PIP
study, gestational week 28) were compared with samples from 67
nonpregnant women aged 285 years for biomarker discovery. A
further 248 samples from healthy pregnant women and 141 samples
from apparently healthy nonpregnant women aged 3412 years
were used for validation of the pregnancy-specific urinary proteomic
panel.
All women provided written informed consent; PIP research
protocols were approved by the West Glasgow Research Ethics
Committee (07/S0709/79) and SCOPE protocols were approved by
New Zealand (AKX/02/00/364) and Australia (1712/5/2008) Research Ethics Committees. Both studies adhere to the principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki.

Sample Handling

or study interview (SCOPE), separated, and stored in aliquots within

4 hours. Samples were frozen at 70C and were thawed immediately before analysis.
For each sample, a 0.7-mL aliquot of urine was diluted with 0.7
mL of 2 mol/L urea and 10 mmol/L NH4OH containing 0.02% SDS.
To remove proteins with a molecular mass 20 kDa such as
albumin, samples were filtered using Centrisart ultracentrifugation
filter devices (Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany) at 3000g until 1.1 mL
of filtrate was obtained. To remove urea, electrolytes, and salts, and
to enrich the polypeptides present, the filtrate was then applied onto
a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Bioscience) equilibrated in
0.01% NH4OH in high-performance liquid chromatography-grade
H2O (Carl Roth). Finally, all samples were lyophilized, stored at
4C, and resuspended in high-performance liquid chromatographygrade H2O before analysis.
CE-MS analysis was performed as previously described15,16 using
a P/ACE MDQ capillary electrophoresis system (Beckman Coulter)
online coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (micro-timeof-flight MS; Bruker Daltonic). Data acquisition and MS acquisition
methods were automatically controlled by the CE via contact close
relays. Spectra were accumulated every 3 seconds over a range of
mass-to-charge ratios from 350 to 3000. Accuracy, precision, selectivity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and stability using this technique
are described in detail elsewhere.16,17 In brief, the detection limit is
in the range of 1 fmol, depending on the ionization properties of the
individual peptide. In a urine sample, the detection limit in the crude
sample before processing is 100 to 1000 fmol/mL. Platform validation was performed as described previously.18

Data Processing
Data were analyzed using the Mosaiques-Visu software;19 CE/MS
peaks were detected using a signal-to-noise ratio of 4, and the charge
of each peak was calculated based on isotopic distributions and
conjugated masses. The data were then deconvoluted, allowing mass
spectral ion peaks from the same molecule at different charge states
to be recorded as a single mass.
MS data were normalized to correct for analytic issues such as
signal suppression as well as biological issues such as hydration of
the patient. Reference signals of 1700 urinary peptides were used
for CE time calibration.16 MS signal intensities were normalized
relative to 29 housekeeping peptides with small relative standard
deviation. These peptides, which are the result of normal biological
processes, are not affected by age, sex, or disease state. Normalization using these peptides has been shown to be as accurate as
absolute peptide quantification using urinary quantification or stable
isotope-labeled synthetic marker analogues.17 For time-of-flight MS
mass calibration, 80 reference masses exactly determined by Fourier
transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry were used. The
resulting peak list characterizes each peptide by its molecular mass
(Da), CE migration time, and signal intensity, providing a unique
identification mark. Data were entered into a Microsoft SQL database for further analysis and comparison with other samples. MS
peaks from different samples were presumed identical if mass
deviation was 50 ppm for small or 75 ppm for larger peptides,
and the migration time deviation was 5 minutes.
Disease-specific polypeptide patterns were generated using support vector machine-based MosaCluster software20 as described
recently.21 In brief, MosaCluster displays data points (urine samples)
from n proteomic markers as an n-dimensional vector and
attempts to separate them by (n1) dimensional hyperplane. A
classification factor was calculated for each sample from the distance
and direction of its vector to the separating hyperplane.

Sequencing
Candidate biomarkers were sequenced using liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry analysis as described,11,22 including the
use of instruments with electron transfer dissociation capability.2325
Spectral data were searched against the SwissProt database using the
open MS search algorithm (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omssa/;
accessed December 21, 2010) using an e-value cut-off of
1.00102. All matched sequences were manually validated. All
sequences obtained from human urine can be assessed at http://

Statistical Methods, Definition of Biomarkers, and
Sample Classification
Estimates of sensitivity and specificity were calculated based on
tabulating the number of correctly classified samples. Confidence
intervals (95% CI) were based on exact binomial calculations and
were performed in MedCalc version 8.1.1.0 (MedCalc Software).
The reported unadjusted probability values were calculated using the
natural logarithm-transformed intensities and the Wilcoxon ranksum test. Statistical adjustment for multiple testing was performed
either using the stringent maxt test27 or using false discovery rate
adjustments of Benjamini and Hochberg.28

Results
Urinary Proteome of Healthy Pregnancy
We initially investigated whether differences exist in the urinary
proteome of healthy pregnant women (who did not subsequently
have preeclampsia develop; n17) when compared to apparently healthy, nonpregnant, female volunteers (n67). Clear
differences between these 2 cohorts were seen (Figure 1). On
examination of the datasets, 284 peptides that were significantly
altered between the 2 groups were identified by using the maxt
test. The discriminatory peptides are listed in Supplemental
Table S4 (please see http://hyper.ahajournals.org).
The pregnancy-associated urinary peptides were then evaluated in a second set of independent samples: 248 urine
samples from pregnant women that were included in the
study and 141 apparently healthy nonpregnant controls.
Support vector machine classification based on the 284
peptides revealed 98.6% specificity and 98.4% sensitivity in
the independent dataset.

Biomarkers for Prediction of Preeclampsia at
Gestational Week 28
Our next step was to investigate whether biomarkers for the
prediction of preeclampsia could be detected in the urinary
proteome at gestational week 28. Among the women with at
least 2 risk factors for preeclampsia, 18 samples from women
who subsequently had preeclampsia develop (cases) and 17
samples from women who had normotensive pregnancies
(controls) were examined (Figure 2). After adjustment for
multiple testing (Benjamini-Hochberg), 10 biomarkers that
were significantly associated with preeclampsia were identified. A model containing these 10 biomarkers differentiated
between cases and controls (P0.001). We then constructed
a biomarker model that included an additional 40 peptides
that were nominally significant between cases and controls
and had highest significance scores in the absence of false
discovery rate adjustment. This more stable model enabled
classification of the samples with 100% sensitivity and
specificity, even when evaluated using complete take-one-out
cross-validation. Classification factor was 1.0320.411 in
women who subsequently had preeclampsia develop compared to 1.0380.432 (P0.001) in those whose pregnancy continued without preeclampsia developing (Figure 3).
Details of the biomarkers, which include sequences of collagen chains, fibrinogen, and uromodulin, used in the model are
shown in Table 2.

with normal pregnancies. Using the preeclampsia pattern
generated from week 28, we were able to differentiate
between those who went on to have preeclampsia develop
(classification factor, 0.5670.372) and those who had
uncomplicated pregnancies (classification factor,
0.7210.439; P0.047; Figure 4A). In a second step, we
compared the classification factors in women with known
risk factors who had provided urine samples both at weeks 12
to 16 and week 28. Classification factor decreased slightly
from gestational week 12 to 16 to 28 in those women who
were sampled at both times and had a normal pregnancy
(n16; from 0.6470.437 to 1.0240.433; P0.043;
Figure 5A), whereas it markedly changed toward positive
scores in those women who subsequently had preeclampsia
develop (n16; from 0.3920.383 to 1.0700.383;
P0.001; Figure 5B). In a third step, we analyzed urine
samples from gestational week 20 of 99 women (50 cases, 49
controls) from the SCOPE study. In this cohort, there was no
significant difference between cases (classification factor,
0.7550.533) and controls (0.7240.418; P0.73; Figure 4B), suggesting that the biomarkers identified at week 28
do not reliably predict preeclampsia when analyzed earlier in
pregnancy. Finally, the samples from gestational week 12 to
16 and 20 were analyzed to find whether other biomarker
patterns could be used to accurately differentiate between
cases and controls, and thereby to predict preeclampsia, at an
earlier time in pregnancy. We were unable to identify any
such early predictive biomarker patterns.

Proteomics in Preeclampsia

Discussion
We designed a large study (PIP) in which we used CE-MS
technology to examine the urinary proteome in pregnancy
and attempted to identify a urinary proteomic signature that
can be used in early and mid pregnancy to predict preeclampsia. At gestational week 28, we were able to identify a urinary
peptide pattern, characterized by breakdown products of
fibrinogen, collagen, and uromodulin, which could differentiate women who subsequently had preeclampsia develop.
Although there is a limited role for late screening for
preeclampsia, this set of biomarkers may prove to be a helpful
aid in diagnosis of preeclampsia. We were able to use this
peptide pattern to differentiate between cases and controls at
gestational week 12 to 16, but we were not able to replicate
this in an independent cohort of pregnant women (SCOPE) at
gestational week 20. The magnitude of overlap between cases
and controls at 12 to 16 weeks and failure to replicate our
findings in another cohort precludes use of this urinary
peptide pattern as an early screening test. The different
findings in the 2 cohorts may result from differences in
gestational age at sampling (20 weeks rather than 28 weeks)
and study populations; SCOPE comprised healthy nulliparous
women, whereas PIP was a mixed-parity general obstetric
population.
The performance of our urinary peptide pattern at 28 weeks
to discriminate women who subsequently had preeclampsia
develop from those with an uncomplicated pregnancy is
similar or better than that reported with serum FMS-like
tyrosine kinase-1 and placental growth factor in the second
trimester for early-onset preeclampsia and is a better predictor than these markers for all preeclampsia (preterm and term
disease).29 31 The discrimination seen with the urinary peptide pattern at 28 weeks is more aligned with the diagnostic
performance of the angiogenic biomarkers after presentation
with symptoms or signs of preeclampsia.32,33 Because our
study is small, it requires further evaluation in larger predictive and diagnostic studies to define its potential role in
clinical care.
To date, 1 other study has used a proteomic technique to
identify disease-specific urinary biomarkers for preeclampsia
after diagnosis. Buhimschi et al7 identified fragments of
serpin peptidase inhibitor-1 and albumin as biomarkers for
preeclampsia, and for differentiation of preeclampsia from
other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Increased urinary
albumin excretion is a hallmark of preeclampsia and serpin
peptidase inhibitor-1 increases 10-fold in pregnancy (unpublished observations, R. North). We would expect our
findings to be different because they used SELDI technology
to investigate the urinary proteome.
The differentially expressed polypeptide sequences between cases and controls at gestational week 28 point toward
biological processes that are altered during the development
of preeclampsia, particularly the late-onset variant of the
disease. Changes in extracellular matrix are a feature of all
vascular diseases and are represented by a number of differentially expressed collagen fragments in the polypeptide
signatures. These findings are in line not only with plasma
proteome data by Blumenstein et al34 but also with our
previous studies of urinary proteomic markers of chronic

their respective metabolites generally can be detected in urine
using mass spectrometry,38 the sample preparation and the
data evaluation used in our study essentially excluded these
and most other metabolites because of their smaller molecular
mass and the generally observed single charge of metabolites.
Our analytic approach therefore should be regarded as complementary to other approaches for the identification of
diagnostic and predictive markers including metabolomic
studies.39

Perspectives
The pathogenesis of preeclampsia is thought to begin in the
first trimester of pregnancy and is characterized by impaired
placental implantation and development. Detection of the
pathophysiological changes in the first trimester would be a
key to early detection of the disease and would be extremely
useful for early risk stratification. The fact that we were
unable to reliably detect preeclampsia before gestational
week 28 and the nature of the biomarkers sequenced suggest
that we were able to detect early signs of preeclampsia rather
than the underlying causes.
In clinical practice, proteinuria is used to differentiate
gestational hypertension from preeclampsia. Current tests for
proteinuria have a number of limitations,40 and a better
measure of renal involvement in preeclampsia is required to
improve accurate diagnosis. Proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors (placental growth factor and serum FMS-like

kidney disease11,17 and coronary artery disease.9,10,21 These
conditions share some of the features of preeclampsia, including endothelial dysfunction and inflammation,35 and therefore
may also share some of the characteristic proteomic markers
with preeclampsia.
Differential expression of uromodulin sequences in urine
between cases and controls is not surprising. Uromodulin
(Tamm-Horsfall protein) is the most abundant protein in
normal urine; therefore, this could simply indicate nonspecific changes in the composition of urine. The UMOD gene
locus, however, has been found to be associated with glomerular filtration rate in genetic studies,36 indicating a potential
functional role of uromodulin in the development of cardiovascular diseases. More recently, we have demonstrated in a
genome-wide association study that rs13333226 in the promoter region of UMOD is associated with hypertension
independently of renal function.37 These more recent data on
uromodulin, as a key player in renal disease and hypertension, could point toward subclinical vascular and renal
damage in the early stage of preeclampsia that are indicated
by differential urinary expression of uromodulin fragments
and warrant further investigation.
It should also be noted that in our approach, we restricted
the analysis to peptides and proteins with a molecular mass
800 Da that, in addition, had to be at least 2-fold different
between cases and controls. Whereas typical pregnancyassociated hormones such as estrogen or progesterone and

tyrosine kinase-1) are being investigated as potential diagnostic tests for preeclampsia, especially early-onset disease,
but their diagnostic utility in term preeclampsia is much less
certain.33 The biomarkers we detected may have a role in
improving the diagnosis of women with late-onset preeclampsia, whereas their potential to act as a predictive test
and to trigger preventative therapy and more intensive monitoring may be limited.
