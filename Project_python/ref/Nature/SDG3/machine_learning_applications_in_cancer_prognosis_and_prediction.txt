Cancer has been characterized as a heterogeneous disease consisting of many different subtypes. The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent
clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has
led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics eld, to study the application of machine
learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and
treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex
datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Articial Neural Networks (ANNs),
Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied
in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making.
Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an
appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression.
The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input
features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we
present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient
outcomes.

ML, a branch of Articial Intelligence, relates the problem of learning
from data samples to the general concept of inference [1012]. Every
learning process consists of two phases: (i) estimation of unknown dependencies in a system from a given dataset and (ii) use of estimated
dependencies to predict new outputs of the system. ML has also been
proven an interesting area in biomedical research with many applications, where an acceptable generalization is obtained by searching
through an n-dimensional space for a given set of biological samples,
using different techniques and algorithms [13]. There are two main
common types of ML methods known as (i) supervised learning and
(ii) unsupervised learning. In supervised learning a labeled set of training data is used to estimate or map the input data to the desired output.
In contrast, under the unsupervised learning methods no labeled examples are provided and there is no notion of the output during the

Over the past decades, a continuous evolution related to cancer research has been performed [1]. Scientists applied different methods,
such as screening in early stage, in order to nd types of cancer before
they cause symptoms. Moreover, they have developed new strategies
for the early prediction of cancer treatment outcome. With the advent
of new technologies in the eld of medicine, large amounts of cancer
data have been collected and are available to the medical research
community. However, the accurate prediction of a disease outcome is
one of the most interesting and challenging tasks for physicians. As a result, ML methods have become a popular tool for medical researchers.
These techniques can discover and identify patterns and relationships
between them, from complex datasets, while they are able to effectively
predict future outcomes of a cancer type.
Given the signicance of personalized medicine and the growing
trend on the application of ML techniques, we here present a review
of studies that make use of these methods regarding the cancer prediction and prognosis. In these studies prognostic and predictive features
are considered which may be independent of a certain treatment or
are integrated in order to guide therapy for cancer patients, respectively
[2]. In addition, we discuss the types of ML methods being used, the
types of data they integrate, the overall performance of each proposed
scheme while we also discuss their pros and cons.
An obvious trend in the proposed works includes the integration of
mixed data, such as clinical and genomic. However, a common problem
that we noticed in several works is the lack of external validation or
testing regarding the predictive performance of their models. It is clear
that the application of ML methods could improve the accuracy of cancer
susceptibility, recurrence and survival prediction. Based on [3], the
accuracy of cancer prediction outcome has signicantly improved by
15%20% the last years, with the application of ML techniques.
Several studies have been reported in the literature and are based on
different strategies that could enable the early cancer diagnosis and
prognosis [47]. Specically, these studies describe approaches related
to the proling of circulating miRNAs that have been proven a promising class for cancer detection and identication. However, these
methods suffer from low sensitivity regarding their use in screening at
early stages and their difculty to discriminate benign from malignant
tumors. Various aspects regarding the prediction of cancer outcome
based on gene expression signatures are discussed in [8,9]. These
studies list the potential as well as the limitations of microarrays for
the prediction of cancer outcome. Even though gene signatures could
signicantly improve our ability for prognosis in cancer patients, poor
progress has been made for their application in the clinics. However,
before gene expression proling can be used in clinical practice, studies
with larger data samples and more adequate validation are needed.
In the present work only studies that employed ML techniques for
modeling cancer diagnosis and prognosis are presented.

learning process. As a result, it is up to the learning scheme/model to
nd patterns or discover the groups of the input data. In supervised
learning this procedure can be thought as a classication problem. The
task of classication refers to a learning process that categorizes the
data into a set of nite classes. Two other common ML tasks are regression and clustering. In the case of regression problems, a learning
function maps the data into a real-value variable. Subsequently, for
each new sample the value of a predictive variable can be estimated,
based on this process. Clustering is a common unsupervised task in
which one tries to nd the categories or clusters in order to describe
the data items. Based on this process each new sample can be assigned
to one of the identied clusters concerning the similar characteristics
that they share.
Suppose for example that we have collected medical records
relevant to breast cancer and we try to predict if a tumor is malignant
or benign based on its size. The ML question would be referred to the estimation of the probability that the tumor is malignant or no (1 = Yes,
0 = No). Fig. 1 depicts the classication process of a tumor being malignant or not. The circled records depict any misclassication of the type
of a tumor produced by the procedure.
Another type of ML methods that have been widely applied is
semi-supervised learning, which is a combination of supervised and
unsupervised learning. It combines labeled and unlabeled data in
order to construct an accurate learning model. Usually, this type of
learning is used when there are more unlabeled datasets than labeled.
When applying a ML method, data samples constitute the basic
components. Every sample is described with several features and
every feature consists of different types of values. Furthermore, knowing in advance the specic type of data being used allows the right selection of tools and techniques that can be used for their analysis. Some
data-related issues refer to the quality of the data and the preprocessing
steps to make them more suitable for ML. Data quality issues include the
presence of noise, outliers, missing or duplicate data and data that is
biased-unrepresentative. When improving the data quality, typically
the quality of the resulting analysis is also improved. In addition, in
order to make the raw data more suitable for further analysis, preprocessing steps should be applied that focus on the modication of the
data. A number of different techniques and strategies exist, relevant to
data preprocessing that focus on modifying the data for better tting
in a specic ML method. Among these techniques some of the most important approaches include (i) dimensionality reduction (ii) feature selection and (iii) feature extraction. There are many benets regarding
the dimensionality reduction when the datasets have a large number
of features. ML algorithms work better when the dimensionality is
lower [14]. Additionally, the reduction of dimensionality can eliminate
irrelevant features, reduce noise and can produce more robust learning
models due to the involvement of fewer features. In general, the dimensionality reduction by selecting new features which are a subset of the
old ones is known as feature selection. Three main approaches exist
for feature selection namely embedded, lter and wrapper approaches
[14]. In the case of feature extraction, a new set of features can be

performance of a classier. Specically, accuracy is a measure related
to the total number of correct predictions. On the contrary, AUC is a
measure of the model's performance which is based on the ROC curve
that plots the tradeoffs between sensitivity and 1-specicity (Fig. 2).
The predictive accuracy of the model is computed from the testing
set which provides an estimation of the generalization errors. In order
to obtain reliable results regarding the predicting performance of a
model, training and testing samples should be sufciently large and independent while the labels of the testing sets should be known. Among
the most commonly used methods for evaluating the performance of
a classier by splitting the initial labeled data into subsets are:
(i) Holdout Method, (ii) Random Sampling, (iii) Cross-Validation and
(iv) Bootstrap. In the Holdout method, the data samples are partitioned
into two separate sets, namely the training and the test sets. A classication model is then generated from the training set while its performance
is estimated on the test set. Random sampling is a similar approach to
the Holdout method. In this case, in order to better estimate the accuracy, the Holdout method is repeated several times, choosing the training
and test instances randomly. In the third approach, namely crossvalidation, each sample is used the same number of times for training
and only once for testing. As a result, the original data set is covered
successfully both in the training and in the test set. The accuracy results
are calculated as the average of all different validation cycles. In the last
approach, bootstrap, the samples are separated with replacement into
training and test sets, i.e. they are placed again into the entire data set
after they have been chosen for training.
When the data are preprocessed and we have dened the kind of
learning task, a list of ML methods including (i) ANNs, (ii) DTs,
(iii) SVMs and (iv) BNs is available. Based on the intension of this review
paper, we will refer only to these ML techniques that have been applied
widely in the literature for the case study of cancer prediction and prognosis. We identify the trends regarding the types of ML methods that are
used, the types of data that are integrated as well as the evaluation
methods employed for assessing the overall performance of the
methods used for cancer prediction or disease outcomes.
ANNs handle a variety of classication or pattern recognition problems. They are trained to generate an output as a combination between
the input variables. Multiple hidden layers that represent the neural
connections mathematically are typically used for this process. Even
though ANNs serve as a gold standard method in several classication
tasks [19] they suffer from certain drawbacks. Their generic layered
structure proves to be time-consuming while it can lead to very poor

created from the initial set that captures all the signicant information
in a dataset. The creation of new sets of features allows for gathering
the described benets of dimensionality reduction.
However, the application of feature selection techniques may result
in specic uctuations concerning the creation of predictive feature
lists. Several studies in the literature discuss the phenomenon of lack
of agreement between the predictive gene lists discovered by different
groups, the need of thousands of samples in order to achieve the desired
outcomes, the lack of biological interpretation of predictive signatures
and the dangers of information leak recorded in published studies
[1518].
The main objective of ML techniques is to produce a model which
can be used to perform classication, prediction, estimation or any
other similar task. The most common task in learning process is classication. As mentioned previously, this learning function classies the
data item into one of several predened classes. When a classication
model is developed, by means of ML techniques, training and generalization errors can be produced. The former refers to misclassication
errors on the training data while the latter on the expected errors on
testing data. A good classication model should t the training set
well and accurately classify all the instances. If the test error rates of a
model begin to increase even though the training error rates decrease
then the phenomenon of model overtting occurs. This situation is
related to model complexity meaning that the training errors of a
model can be reduced if the model complexity increases. Obviously,
the ideal complexity of a model not susceptible to overtting is the
one that produces the lowest generalization error. A formal method
for analyzing the expected generalization error of a learning algorithm
is the biasvariance decomposition. The bias component of a particular
learning algorithm measures the error rate of that algorithm. Additionally, a second source of error over all possible training sets of given size
and all possible test sets is called variance of the learning method. The
overall expected error of a classication model is constituted of the
sum of bias and variance, namely the biasvariance decomposition.
Once a classication model is obtained using one or more ML techniques, it is important to estimate the classier's performance. The performance analysis of each proposed model is measured in terms of
sensitivity, specicity, accuracy and area under the curve (AUC).
Sensitivity is dened as the proportion of true positives that are correctly observed by the classier, whereas specicity is given by the proportion of true negatives that are correctly identied. The quantitative
metrics of accuracy and AUC are used for assessing the overall

performance. Additionally, this specic technique is characterized as a
black-box technology. Trying to nd out how it performs the classication process or why an ANN did not work is almost impossible to detect. Fig. 3 depicts the structure of an ANN with its interconnected group
of nodes.
DTs follow a tree-structured classication scheme where the nodes
represent the input variables and the leaves correspond to decision outcomes. DTs are one of the earliest and most prominent ML methods that
have been widely applied for classication purposes. Based on the architecture of the DTs, they are simple to interpret and quick to learn.
When traversing the tree for the classication of a new sample we are
able to conjecture about its class. The decisions resulted from their
specic architecture allow for adequate reasoning which makes them
an appealing technique. Fig. 4 depicts an illustration of a DT with its
elements and rules.
SVMs are a more recent approach of ML methods applied in the eld
of cancer prediction/prognosis. Initially SVMs map the input vector into
a feature space of higher dimensionality and identify the hyperplane
that separates the data points into two classes. The marginal distance
between the decision hyperplane and the instances that are closest to
boundary is maximized. The resulting classier achieves considerable
generalizability and can therefore be used for the reliable classication

of new samples. It is worth noting that probabilistic outputs can also
be obtained for SVMs [20]. Fig. 5 illustrates how an SVM might work
in order to classify tumors among benign and malignant based on
their size and patients' age. The identied hyperplane can be thought
as a decision boundary between the two clusters. Obviously, the existence of a decision boundary allows for the detection of any misclassication produced by the method.
BN classiers produce probability estimations rather than predictions. As their name reveals, they are used to represent knowledge
coupled with probabilistic dependencies among the variables of interest
via a directed acyclic graph. BNs have been applied widely to several
classication tasks as well as for knowledge representation and reasoning purposes.
Fig. 6 depicts an illustration of a BN across with the calculated conditional probability for each variable.

to a class label.

The last two decades a variety of different ML techniques and feature
selection algorithms have been widely applied to disease prognosis and
prediction [3,2227]. Most of these works employ ML methods for
modeling the progression of cancer and identify informative factors
that are utilized afterwards in a classication scheme. Furthermore, in
almost all the studies gene expression proles, clinical variables as
well as histological parameters are encompassed in a complementary
manner in order to be fed as input to the prognostic procedure. Fig. 7
depicts the distribution in published papers using ML techniques to
predict (i) cancer susceptibility, (ii) recurrence and (iii) survival. The information was collected based on a variety of query searches in the
Scopus biomedical database. More specically, queries like cancer
risk assessment AND Machine Learning, cancer recurrence AND
Machine Learning, cancer survival AND Machine Learning as
well as cancer prediction AND Machine Learning yielded the number of papers that are depicted in Fig. 3. No limitations were imposed
in the resulted hits except the exclusion of articles published before
2010. As mentioned above, the number of papers presented in Fig. 7
refers to the exact numbers yielded from the databases without any
renement except the date that they were published.
The success of a disease prognosis is undoubtedly dependent on the
quality of a medical diagnosis; however, a prognostic prediction should
take into account more than a simple diagnostic decision. When dealing
with cancer prognosis/prediction one is concerned with three predictive tasks: (i) the prediction of cancer susceptibility (risk assessment),
(ii) the prediction of cancer recurrence/local control and (iii) the prediction of cancer survival. In the rst two cases one is trying to nd (i) the
likelihood of developing a type of cancer and (ii) the likelihood of
redeveloping a type of cancer after complete or partial remission. In
the last case, the prediction of a survival outcome such as diseasespecic or overall survival after cancer diagnosis or treatment is the
main objective. The prediction of cancer outcome usually refers to the
cases of (i) life expectancy, (ii) survivability, (iii) progression and
(iv) treatment sensitivity [3].

4. Survey of ML applications in cancer

364

An extensive search was conducted relevant to the use of ML techniques in cancer susceptibility, recurrence and survivability prediction.
Two electronic databases were accessed namely PubMed, Scopus. Due
to the vast number of articles returned by the search queries, further
scrutinization was needed in order to maintain the most relevant articles. The relevance of each publication was assessed based on the keywords of the three predictive tasks found in their titles and abstracts.
Specically, after reading their titles and abstracts we only selected
those publications that study one of the three foci of cancer prediction
and included it in their titles. The majority of these studies use different
types of input data: genomic, clinical, histological, imaging, demographic, epidemiological data or combination of these. Papers that focus on
the prediction of cancer development by means of conventional statistical methods (e.g. chi-square, Cox regression) were excluded as were papers that use techniques for tumor classication or identication of
predictive factors. According to [3] and their survey based on ML applications in cancer prediction, we noted a rapid increase in papers
that have been published in the last decade. Although it is impossible
to achieve a complete coverage of the literature, we believe that a

Technologies (HTTs) nowadays has produced huge amounts of cancer
data that are collected and are available to the medical research community. However, the accurate prediction of a disease outcome is one
of the most interesting and challenging tasks for physicians. As a result,
ML methods have become a popular tool for medical researchers. These
techniques can discover and identify patterns and relationships between them, from complex datasets, while they are able to effectively
predict future outcomes of a cancer type. Additionally, feature selection
methods have been published in the literature with their application in
cancer [4143]. The proposed computational tools aim at identifying
informative features for accurately identication of disease class.
There are nowadays separate subgroups among the same type of
cancer based on specic genetic defects that have different treatment
approaches and options as well as different clinical outcomes. This is
the foundation of the individualized treatment approach, in which computational techniques could help by identifying less costly and effectively
such small groups of patients. Furthermore, the development of a community resource project, namely The Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network (TCGA) has the potential support for personal medicine as it
provides large scale genomic data about specic tumor types. TCGA provides with the ability to better understand the molecular basis of cancer
through the application of high-throughput genome technologies.

Major types of ML techniques including ANNs and DTs have been
used for nearly three decades in cancer detection [22,2830]. According
to the recent PubMed results regarding the subject of ML and cancer
more than 7510 articles have been published until today. The vast majority of these publications makes use of one or more ML algorithms
and integrates data from heterogeneous sources for the detection of
tumors as well as for the prediction/prognosis of a cancer type. A growing trend is noted the last decade in the use of other supervised learning
techniques, namely SVMs and BNs, towards cancer prediction and prognosis [24,3136]. All of these classication algorithms have been widely
used in a wide range of problems posed in cancer research.
In the past, the typical information used by the physicians conclude
with a reasonable decision regarding cancer prognosis and included histological, clinical and population-based data [23,37]. The integration of
features such as family history, age, diet, weight, high-risk habits and
exposure to environmental carcinogens play a critical role in predicting
the development of cancer [3840]. Even though this type of macroscale information referred to a small number of variables so that standard statistical methods could be used for prediction purposes, however
these types of parameters do not provide sufcient information for
making robust decisions. With the rapid advent of genomic, proteomic
and imaging technologies a new kind of molecular information can be
obtained. Molecular biomarkers, cellular parameters as well as the expression of certain genes have been proven as very informative indicators for cancer prediction. The presence of such High Throughput

We performed a Scopus and a PubMed advanced search which was
limited to the last 5 years. Out of these results one of the publications
employs ML techniques for the prediction of susceptibility in a cancer
type [55]. The authors perform a genetic epidemiology study of bladder
cancer susceptibility in terms of Learning Classifying Systems (LCSs).
We decided to exclude this work from the present case study as it
deals with genetic information and examines further genetic problems.
Based on these limitations we continued our search to the specic biomedical databases. Most of these titles neither referred to the specied
keywords that are mentioned in the relevant survey nor used ML
techniques for their predictions. Among the most recent publications
that resulted after our limited literature search regarding the cancer
risk assessment prediction [19,5658], we selected a recent and very interesting study to present relevant to the breast cancer risk estimation
by means of ANNs [19]. It is a different study among the others presented in this review article regarding the data type used. Although all of the

publications selected make use of molecular, clinical or populationbased data, this work encompasses mammographic ndings and demographic characteristics to the model. Even though this work doesn't t
our general statement regarding our search criteria, we decided to
include it in this case study because no other search result met our
needs. We excluded this work from our general statement because no
other search result met our needs. The major intense in developing
decision-making tools that can discriminate among benign and malignant ndings in breast cancer is commented by the authors. They also
mention that when developing prediction models, risk stratication is
of major interest. According to their knowledge, existing studies
based on the use of computer models, have also utilized specic ML
techniques, such as ANNs, in order to assess the risk of breast cancer patients. In their work, ANNs are employed in order to develop a prediction model that could classify malignant mammographic ndings from
benign. They built their model with a large number of hidden layers
which generalizes better than networks with small number of hidden
nodes. Regarding the collected data in this study, 48.774 mammographic ndings as well as demographic risks factors and tumor characteristics were considered. All of the mammographic records were
reviewed by radiologists and the reading information was obtained.
This dataset was then fed as input to the ANN model. Its performance
was estimated by means of ten-fold cross validation. Additionally, in
order to prevent the case of overtting the authors used the ES approach. This procedure, generally, controls the network error during
training and stops it if overtting occurs. The calculated AUC of their
model was 0.965 following training and testing by means of ten-fold
cross validation. The authors claimed that their model can accurately
estimate the risk assessment of breast cancer patients by integrating a
large data sample. They also declared that their model is unique
among others if we consider that the most important factors they
used to train the ANN model are the mammography ndings with
tumor registry outcomes. One very interesting characteristic in this
study is the calculation of two main components of accuracy, namely
discrimination and calibration. Discrimination is a metric that someone
calculates in order to separate benign abnormalities from malignant
ones, while calibration is a measurement used when a risk prediction
model aims to stratify patients into high or low risk categories. The
authors plotted (i) a ROC curve in order to evaluate the discriminative
ability of their model and (ii) a calibration curve for comparing afterwards their model's calibration to the perfect calibration of predicting
breast cancer risk. Apart from these ndings, the authors also noted
that the use of a mix of screening and diagnostic datasets cannot be
reliably separated when feeding as input to the ANN. So, in order to
overcome such limitations the authors should consider the purpose of
preprocessing steps for transforming the raw data into appropriate formats for subsequent analysis.

signicant number of relevant papers were extracted and are presented
in this review. As mentioned above, from the initial group of papers we
selected a representative list that follows a well-organized structure.
Specically, we selected these studies that make use of recognizable
ML techniques and integrated data from heterogeneous sources in
order to predict the desirable outcome. We focused mainly on studies
that have been published the last 5 years as an aim to present the
most recent state of the art in the eld and their advances in comparison
to older publications. Tables 1a, 1b, and 1c depict some of the publications presented in this review. Cancer type, ML method, number of
patients, type of data as well as the overall accuracy achieved by each
proposed method are presented. Each sub-table corresponds to studies
regarding a specic scenario (i.e. cancer susceptibility prediction, cancer
recurrence prediction and cancer survival prediction). It should be
noted that in articles that more than one ML techniques are applied
for prediction, we decided to present here the most accurate predictive
model.
A detailed analysis of more recent studies revealed that there is a
growing trend in risk assessment as well as the prediction of recurrence
of a cancer type regardless the ML technique used. Many research
groups have tried to predict the possibility of redeveloping cancer
after remission and appeared to improve the accuracy of predictions
compared to alternative statistical techniques. Moreover, the vast
majority of these publications used molecular and clinical data in
order to make their predictions. The use of such measurable features
as input data is a growing trend based on the advent of HTTs.
In the following, we are going to discuss one case for each of the objectives of predicting (i) susceptibility, (ii) recurrence and (iii) survival,
all by means of ML techniques. Each sub-section summarizes the representative studies we have selected based on their predictive outcomes.
We only selected those publications that have been accepted the last 5
years and make use of distinguishable ML methods. We provide the
readers with the appropriate details of the most recent techniques
used for the prediction and prognosis of most frequent cancer types.

selection scheme performed better in the discrimination with directly
input of the clinical and imaging features (78.6% and 82.8% accuracy, respectively). In a similar manner, genomic-based classication results revealed that the best performing classier was the BN in conjunction
with the CFS algorithm (91.7% accuracy). In the nal stage of their
study, the authors combined the more accurate individual predictors
(i.e. BN and BN coupled with the CFS) in order to yield a consensus decision for discrimination between patients with and without an OSCC
relapse. A comparison of this approach to other studies in the literature
revealed that this proposal yields robust results than other methodologies. The proposed study illustrated in an explanatory way how the integration of heterogeneous sources of data, by means of ML classiers,
can produce accurate results regarding the prediction of cancer recurrence. Furthermore, the authors used more than one classication technique in order to obtain robust results. It is clear that when you estimate
the performance of a classier predictor among others, then you are
able to nd the most optimal tool. However, we should highlight an
important aspect of this work regarding the small sample size. Only
86 patients were considered with their clinical, imaging and genomic
features. Although their classication results were very promising, we
should consider that a relatively small sample size compared to data
dimensionality can lead to misclassication and biased predictors. Another interesting article published in the same year with [24] proposed
an SVM-based model for the prediction of breast cancer recurrence,
called BCRSVM [47]. The authors support the idea that the classication
of cancer patients into high-risk or low-risk groups allows experts to adjust a better treatment and follow-up planning. Their study is based on
the development of a predictive model regarding the breast cancer
recurrence within ve years after surgery. SVM, ANN as well as
Cox-proportional hazard regression were employed for producing the
models and nd the optimal one. The authors claimed that after
comparing the three models based on their resulted accuracies, they
found that the BCRSVM model outperformed the other two. From the
initial set of 193 available variables in their dataset, only 14 features
were selected based on their clinical knowledge. These data refer to
clinical, epidemiological and pathological variables of 733 patients considered out of 1.541. In the nal stage of the feature selection, Kaplan

oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is proposed in [24]. They suggested a multiparametric Decision Support System in order to analyze
the basis of OSCC evolvement after total remission of cancer patients.
They exploited heterogeneous sources of data (clinical, imaging and
genomic) in order to predict a possible relapse of OSCC and thus a
subsequent recurrence. A total number of 86 patients were considered
in this study, 13 of which have been identied with a relapse while
the remaining was disease free. A specic feature selection procedure
was followed with the employment of two feature selection algorithms,
namely CFS [59] and wrapper algorithm [60]. As a result, any bias could
be avoided when selecting the most informative features of their reference heterogeneous dataset. Then the selected important variables
could be used as input vectors to specic classiers. Before the employment of the feature selection techniques the total number of the clinical,
imaging and genomic features was 65, 17 and 40 in each category. Subsequently, after the employment of the CFS algorithm the total number
of clinical, imaging and genomic data used in each classier was 8, 6 and
7, respectively. More specically, among the clinical variables the most
informative ones, for each classication algorithm, were the smoker,
tumor thickness and p53 stain. Concerning the imaging and the genomic features, after the utilization of the CFS algorithm, the most important were the extra-tumor spreading, the number of lymph nodes and
the SOD2, TCAM and OXCT2 genes.
The basic idea in this study is summarized in the discrimination of
patients into those with a disease relapse and those without after the
performance of ve classication algorithms. The employed algorithms
include the BNs, ANNs, SVMs, DTs and RF classiers. After the performance of each ML method an evaluation technique, namely ten-fold
cross-validation, was employed for evaluation purposes. Additionally,
accuracy, sensitivity and specicity were also calculated for comparison
reasons among the employed classication schemes. The analysis of
ROC curve was considered by the authors for evaluation purposes as
well. Their predictive results regarding the classication schemes
employed were obtained based on the classication of data without
performing feature selection and on the classication of data after
employing a feature selection algorithm. Regarding their outputs the
authors claimed that the BN classier without applying any feature

In the present review, the most recent works relevant to cancer prediction/prognosis by means of ML techniques are presented. After a
brief description of the ML branch and the concepts of the data preprocessing methods, the feature selection techniques and the classication
algorithms being used, we outlined three specic case studies regarding
the prediction of cancer susceptibility, cancer recurrence and cancer
survival based on popular ML tools. Obviously, there is a large amount

In [26] a predictive model is developed for the evaluation of survival
in women that have been diagnosed with breast cancer, while they addressed the importance of robustness under the model's parameter variation. They compared three classication models namely SVM, ANN
and SSL based on the SEER cancer database [64]. The dataset is composed of 162,500 records with 16 key features. A class variable was
also considered, namely survivability, referring to patients that had
not survived and those that had survived. Among the most informative
features are (i) the tumor size, (ii) the number of nodes and (iii) the age
at diagnosis. By comparing the best performance of each of the three
models they found that the calculated accuracy for ANN, SVM and SSL
was 65%, 51% and 71% respectively. Five-fold cross validation was used
for evaluating the performance of the predictive models. Concerning
those ndings the authors proposed the SSL model as a good candidate
for survival analysis by the clinical experts. We should note that no preprocessing steps were mentioned by the authors regarding the collection of the most informative features. They proceeded with the entire
SEER datasets and the box-whisper-plot was used for estimating the
performance variation across 25 combinations of model parameters. A
small box area of a specic model indicates more robustness and stability under parameter combination. The small boxes of the SSL model revealed its better accuracy than the other models. A relevant study was
published the next year which attempts to assess the survival prediction
of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients through the use of ANNs
[50]. Their dataset consists of NSCLC patients' gene expression raw data
and clinical data obtained from the NCI caArray database [65]. After the
preprocessing steps in their approach, the authors selected the most informative survival-associated gene signatures; LCK and ERBB2 genes,
which were then used for training the ANN network. Four clinical variables, namely sex, age, T_stage and N_stage were also considered as
input variables in the ANN model. They also performed several types
of ANN architectures in order to nd the optimal one for the prediction
of cancer survival. An overall accuracy of 83% was provided regarding
the predictive performance of the classication scheme. Furthermore,
their results revealed that all patients were classied in different groups
regarding their treatment protocol while 50% of them had not survived.
The evaluation of the model outcomes was done based on the Kaplan
Meier survival analysis. They estimated the survival of patients for the
training set, the test set and the validation set with p-value b 0.00001,
while they showed that the patients in the high-risk group exhibited a
lower median overall survival in comparison to low-risk patients. Compared to other studies in the literature relevant to NSCLC survival prediction, this work provided more stable results. However, existing
limitations of the current article are related to the fact that the impact
of other variables related to death (such as blood clots) is not considered, which may have led to misclassication results. Furthermore, the
authors claim that their model could not be applied to other cancer
types except NSCLC. This assumption is considered as a major limitation
in studies that the predictive models may not generalize to different
cancer types.

Meier analysis and Cox regression were applied which resulted in 7
variables as most informative. These features were then entered as
input to the SVM and ANN classiers as well as to the Cox regression statistical model. In order to evaluate the performance of the models, the
authors employed the hold-out method, which splits the data sample
into two sub-sets, namely training and testing set. As in most studies
in the literature, accuracy, sensitivity and specicity were calculated
for a reliable estimation of the models. Based on these metrics, the authors claimed that BCRSVM outperformed the ANN and Cox regression
models with accuracy 84.6%, 81.4% and 72.6%, respectively. Comparison
among the performance of other previously established recurrence prediction models revealed that BCRSVM has superior performance. It
should be noted that this study estimated also the importance of prognostic factors by means of normalized mutual information index (NMI)
[61]. Based on these calculations for each of the three predictive models,
they suggest that the most signicant factor regarding the prediction of
breast cancer recurrence was the local invasion of tumor. However, if
someone reviews this work would certainly mention some major limitations. As the authors noted, the exclusion of a large number of patients
(n = 808) due to the lack of clinical data in the research registry, inuenced the performance of their models. Furthermore, the fact that the
authors used only their clinical knowledge to select 14 out of 193 variables may have resulted in signicant bias, thus giving no robust results.
Apart from this limitation, the authors could also improve the performance of their proposed model, namely BCRSVM, by validating it with
external datasets from other sources. Among the initial list of publications resulted from our literature survey, we noticed a growing trend
the last years regarding the prediction of cancer disease by means of
SSL learning. So, we believed it would be of interest to present the
most recent study that makes use of this type of ML techniques for the
analysis of breast cancer recurrence [48]. The proposed algorithm is
based on the use of SSL for the construction of a graph model while it
integrates gene expression data with gene network information in
order to predict cancer recurrence. Based on biological knowledge, the
authors selected gene pairs that indicate strong biological interactions.
The sub-gene network identied by the proposed method is constituted
of the BRCA1, CCND1, STAT1 and CCNB1 genes. Their methodology is
divided in three sections including: (i) the determination of gene pairs
for building the graph model with only labeled samples, (ii) the development of sample graphs based on informative genes and (iii) the regularization of the graph resulting in nding the labels of unlabeled
samples. The dataset used through this study consists of gene expression proles found in the GEO repository [62] as well as of PPIs derived
from the I2D database [63]. Specically, ve gene expression datasets
were downloaded from GEO including 125, 145, 181, 249 and 111
labeled samples. These samples were classied into three groups:
(i) recurrence, (ii) non-recurrence and (iii) unlabeled samples and referred to cancer types like breast and colon cancer. Additionally, they
downloaded from the I2D database a sample of human PPIs composed
of 194.988 known, experimental and predicted interactions. After
removing the duplicated PPIs and the interactions that do not contain
proteins mapped to a gene they resulted in an amount of 108,544 interactions. Based on the results of this study, the authors showed that the
gene networks derived from the SSL learning method include many important genes related to cancer recurrence. They also claimed that their
approach outperforms other existing methods in the case of breast cancer recurrence prediction. The estimated performance of the proposed
method compared to other known methods that make use of PPIs for
the identication of informative genes showed an accuracy of 80.7%
and 76.7% in the breast and colon cancer samples, respectively.
Ten-fold cross validation was used for estimating the experimental results. Although this type of ML methods differs considerably from
these of supervised and unsupervised learning on the algorithms that
they employ, it is clear that it provides more advantages relevant to
the collection of datasets and their sizes. Unlabeled data are cheap and
can be easier extracted. On the contrary, labeled samples may require

In this review, we discussed the concepts of ML while we outlined
their application in cancer prediction/prognosis. Most of the studies
that have been proposed the last years and focus on the development
of predictive models using supervised ML methods and classication
algorithms aiming to predict valid disease outcomes. Based on the analysis of their results, it is evident that the integration of multidimensional
heterogeneous data, combined with the application of different techniques for feature selection and classication can provide promising
tools for inference in the cancer domain.

[71] reveal the extensive work done for improving treatment based on
the incorporation of different features.
Among the most common applied ML algorithms relevant to the
prediction outcomes of cancer patients, we found that SVM and ANN
classiers were widely used. As mentioned to our introductory section,
ANNs have been used extensively for nearly 30 years [30]. In addition,
SVMs constitute a more recent approach in the cancer prediction/
prognosis and have been used widely due to its accurate predictive
performance. However, the choice of the most appropriate algorithm
depends on many parameters including the types of data collected,
the size of the data samples, the time limitations as well as the type of
prediction outcomes.
Concerning the future of cancer modeling new methods should be
studied for overcoming the limitations discussed above. A better statistical analysis of the heterogeneous datasets used would provide more
accurate results and would give reasoning to disease outcomes. Further
research is required based on the construction of more public databases
that would collect valid cancer dataset of all patients that have been
diagnosed with the disease. Their exploitation by the researchers
would facilitate their modeling studies resulting in more valid results
and integrated clinical decision making.

of ML studies published in the last decade that provide accurate results
concerning the specic predictive cancer outcomes. However, the identication of potential drawbacks including the experimental design, the
collection of appropriate data samples and the validation of the classied results, is critical for the extraction of clinical decisions.
Moreover, it should be mentioned that in spite of the claims that
these ML classication techniques can result in adequate and effective
decision making, very few have actually penetrated the clinical practice.
Recent advances in omics technologies paved the way to further improve our understanding of a variety of diseases; however more accurate validation results are needed before gene expression signatures
can be useful in the clinics.
A growing trend was noted in the studies published the last 2 years
that applied semi-supervised ML techniques for modeling cancer survival. This type of algorithms employs labeled and unlabeled data for
their predictions while it has been proven that they improved the estimated performance compared to existing supervised techniques [26].
SSL can be though as a great alternative to the other two types of ML
methods (i.e. supervised learning and unsupervised learning) that use,
in general, only a few labeled samples.
One of the most common limitations noted in the studies surveyed
in this review is the small amount of data samples. A basic requirement
when using classication schemes for modeling a disease is the size of
the training datasets that needs to be sufciently large. A relatively
large dataset allows the sufcient partitioning into training and testing
sets, thus leading to reasonable validation of the estimators. A small
sized training sample, compared to data dimensionality, can result in
misclassications while the estimators may produce unstable and
biased models. It is obvious that a richer set of patients used for their
survival prediction can enhance the generalizability of the predictive
model.
Except the data size, the dataset quality as well as the careful feature
selection schemes are of great importance for effective ML and subsequently for accurate cancer predictions. Choosing the most informative
feature subset for training a model, by means of feature selection
methods, could result in robust models. Additionally, feature sets that
consist of histological or pathological assessments are characterized by
reproducible values. Due to the lack of static entities when dealing
with clinical variables it is important for a ML technique to be adjusted
to different feature sets over time.
It should be noted that almost all of the works presented here, performed validation tests for estimating the performance of their learning
algorithms. They employed well-known evaluation techniques that
split the initial datasets into subsets. As mentioned above, in order to
obtain accurate results for their predictive models, the authors should
select large and independent features that could result in better validation. Internal and external validation was performed in these studies
that would enable the extraction of more accurate and reliable predictions while it would minimize any bias [47].
A key point to several studies, regarding their promising results, was
the fact that several ML techniques were employed as an aim to nd the
most optimal one [34]. Apart from this, the combination of multiple data
types that would be fed as input to the models is also a trend. Looking
back to the previous decade, only molecular and clinical information
was exploited for making predictions of cancer outcomes. With the
rapid development of HTTs, including genomic, proteomic and imaging
technologies, new types of input parameters have been collected. We
found that almost all the predictions was made by integrating either
genomic, clinical, histological, imaging, demographic, epidemiological
data and proteomic data or different combinations of these types
[24,26,48,50,53].
Additionally, there has been considerable activity regarding the integration of different types of data in the eld of breast cancer [66,67]. In
the DREAM project [68], several attempts to combine clinical treatment
scores with signatures based on immunohistochemistry [69] as well as
expression-based signatures such as PAM50 [70] and Oncotype DX
