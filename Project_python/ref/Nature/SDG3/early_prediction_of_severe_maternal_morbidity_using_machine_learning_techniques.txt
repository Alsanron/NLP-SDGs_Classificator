Abstract. Severe Maternal Morbidity is a public health issue. It may
occur during pregnancy, delivery, or puerperium due to conditions
(hypertensive disorders, hemorrhages, infections and others) that put
in risk the womens or babys life. These conditions are really dicult
to detect at an early stage. In response to the above, this work proposes
using several machine learning techniques, which are considered most
relevant in a bio-medical setting, in order to predict the risk level for
Severe Maternal Morbidity in patients during pregnancy. The population
studied correspond to pregnant women receiving prenatal care and final
attention at E.S.E Clnica de Maternidad Rafael Calvo in Cartagena,
Colombia. This paper presents the preliminary results of an ongoing
project, as well as methods and materials considered for the construction of the learning models.

Introduction

The term Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM) includes a set of complications that
can have a severe adverse eect on women and baby health, and happen during pregnancy, delivery, or puerperium. When any of these appear, it is necessary to provide the patient with immediate attention, in order to avoid death [10].
Although maternal health outcomes have shown positive variation, complications
of pregnancy still are an important public health issue. Each year around 585.000
women die during pregnancy, delivery or puerperium worldwide [5], and annually
close to 50 million complications in maternal health are registered, and approximately 300 million women suer from short and long-term illnesses and injuries
related to pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum [10]. Currently, there is an epidemiological surveillance strategy which consists in identifying SMM cases, reporting them to the public surveillance system (SIVIGILA) [16], and following them

up. This allows to characterize SMM and have a better understanding about the
main factors of risk in the population and devise policies to help lower incidence.
However, the number of SMM cases continue to be very high.
Studies conducted to identify causes of SMM show that this condition is
related with hypertensive disorder, hemorrhage, and infections. The main risk
factors associated with occurrence of SMM are black race, obesity, multi parity
and backgrounds of previous cesarean sections and presence of co-morbidities
[3,6,7,14].
The development of adequately sensitive and specific predictive tests for these
outcomes has received significant focus in perinatal research. According to the
literature, machine learning approaches are used frequently to identify patterns
and make predictions. Specially in medicine, logistic regression [11,13], support
vector machines [1], neural networks [9] have been used successfully.
The World Health Organization and PanAmerican Health Organization during the last decades have tried to reduce mortality and Severe Maternal Morbidity. For this, the action plan of 20122017 was proposed [3]. It consists in
strengthening information systems and monitoring of maternal health in the
countries of the region. The reduction of maternal mortality is a millennium
goal and a national purpose. Actions, as epidemiological surveillance, the availability of statistical data, and the identification of risk factors related to these
events, have contributed to its decrease.
Institutions and doctors strive to avoid SMM, because it is not easy to detect
and prevent such situations. Especially, when the volume of pregnant women is
quite high in a day, or when novice doctors do not have enough experience. Even
with the implementation of the above actions, failure to meet the stated goal
persist. Because of that it is necessary to implement new mechanisms for early
warning and monitoring of SMM cases.
This paper proposes the use of machine learning techniques to build a risk
classifier for SMM. With this, we expect to have early detection of morbidity cases, providing support for medical sta in decision-making, to enable a
timely intervention of patients. This would help reduce the risk the mother and
baby may have during this stage, and in turn to reduce social and economic
repercussions.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work. Section 3
shows the methods and materials used in our approach. Section 4 shows the preliminary results of our on-going research. Finally, Sect. 5 states the conclusions
of this paper.

Related Work

Every time, it is more frequent to find the use of machine learning in medicine,
especially for classification problems. Some studies of prediction of at least one
of the major diseases associated with SMM are mentioned below.
In Poon et al. [13], authors show work about early prediction of hypertensive disorders during first-trimester pregnancy, in the population of London, UK.

Logistic regression was used and a detection rate around 90 % for early preeclampsia was obtained, and a false-positive rate of 5 %.
In Park et al. [11], authors present an algorithm based on multiple logistic
regression to predict the risk of preeclampsia in an Australian population. The
algorithm correctly predicted preeclampsia in 95 % of women with a 10 % false
positive rate.
In Nanda et al. [8], authors present a model for prediction of gestational
diabetes mellitus in the first-trimester of pregnancy, based on bio markers and
some maternal features. The use of logistic regression gave them a 74.1 % of
correct predictions, with 20 % false positive rate.
In Farran et al. [4], authors implemented logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours (k-NN), multifactor dimensionality reduction and support vector machines
for predicting diabetes, hypertension and comorbidity. The techniques were satisfactory implemented and similar results were obtained.
According to the reviewed literature there is evidence that the results
obtained from the implementation of machine learning for classification problems in medicine are quite satisfactory. The authors of this paper have not been
able to find similar studies or proposals, using machine learning as a tool to help
to avoid or mitigate the risk of SSM.

Methods and Materials
Participants

A retrospective cohort study was done through clinical histories of prenatal
controls obtained between 2014 and 2015. The population selected for this study
include patients with ages between 12 and 45 years who had at least one control
at E.S.E Clnica de Maternidad Rafael Calvo and whose labor was cared for in
this institution.
Cohort patients were classified according SMM outcome, in two groups:
patients who did not present SMM, and patients which presented SMM (which
also were reported to the public healthcare surveillance system). For the first
group, we used random sampling, and for the second group, we used convenience
sampling. This method is known as mixed sampling [2].
3.2

Data Set

The construction of the machine learning model was based on features or
risk factors. These factors were selected according to the risk factor characterization described by Latin American Center of Perinatology (Centro Latino
Americano de Perinatologa, CLAP), compared to the 2015 SMM protocol from
the Colombia Ministry of Health and Social Protection (Ministerio de Salud y
de Proteccion Social) [3]. The selected predictor set was then supplemented with
socio demographic data and the gynecological and obstetrical history for each
patient, Tables 1 and 2.

The selected population included treated patients in gynecological antenatal
consultations at the ESE clinic during pregnancy, and whose labor was cared
for, between years 2014 and 2015.
For the data set construction we used Google Forms. Two forms were
designed, the first one to record Obstetrics Gynecology (OBGYN) and sociodemographic background data, and the second one to record diagnoses for each
gestational week, using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)
codification [15].
The data set is being built with help of sixth year medicine students. They
were trained on SMM, review of medical records and filling out Google forms.
The manual review of prenatal medical records of each patient is necessary,
because the information is sometimes scattered and not totally centralized on
the hospital information system. To perform preliminar training and validation,
two patient groups were generated according to outcomes (SMM and not SMM).
First group was sub-sampled in order to reduce class imbalance, given that the
number of patients that exhibited SMM is lower than the non SMM group. The
collection process is still underway, and subsequent validation will be carried to
monitor progress and performance of the predictive models.
3.3

Statistical Data Analysis

The filtering features allow to select the set of variables that represent variability
in the occurrence of SMM. Once the variables are defined, and the database
constructed, we proceeds to do an analysis statistical to obtain a database only
with the information of the variables that we considered predictors for the model.
We use descriptive statistics to identify the frequency with which diagnoses are
presented, and multi-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine which
variables are more likely to be considered predictive for the model that we want
to implement. It was tested with dierent levels of confidence for the group of
variables most likely had to influence the behavior of the response variable.

Learning Models

This section lists some of the machine learning techniques most commonly used
for classification or pattern recognition.
Logistic Regression. The logistic regression has been historical an important
tool for data analysis in medical investigation and epidemiology. This allows
dierentiating between some classes, in terms of a set of numerical variables, as
a predictor. The basic goals of a logistic regression model are:
 Get an unbiased or adjusted estimate of the relationship between variable
dependent (or result) and an independent variable.
 Simultaneously evaluate several factors that are allegedly related somehow (or
not) with the dependent variable.
 Build a model and get a hypothesis prediction purpose or calculating risk.

Fig. 1. Sigmoid function

Logistic Regression is a linear classification algorithm widely used in medicine
where a logistic sigmoid function is coupled to a linear regression model. The
Sigmoid function used to make the prediction algorithm is shown in Fig. 1.
Results can be interpreted as the probability for the input to belong to the
positive class, p(Y = 1|x; ). In this study, Logistic Regression was trained with
Cross-Entropy loss. A L2 regularization penalty was introduced to account for
model complexity and avoid over-fitting:

It is possible to increase its capabilities by applying a polynomial transform
to the input, in which case the decision boundary can be non-linear and handle
more dicult problems.
In this work, we used L2 Regularized Logistic Regression with polynomial
transform of 2nd degree. The model was implemented using the Scikit-Learn
Python Machine Learning Library, version 2.7.11. [12]
The model was trained with Stratified K-Folds cross validation iterator. The
algorithm was probe in a server in a High Performance Computing Laboratory
through a batch system to run tasks (HTCondor).

Results
Statistical Analysis

This paper presents preliminary results of the project that is still ongoing.
Achieving determine the variables set related to the occurrence of extreme maternal morbidity. The entire population is 1838 patients. 72 belong to the first group,
and the remain 1766 belong to the second group. For a 95 % confidence level with
a confidence interval of 4.5, we obtained a total sample of 377 patients. Once
the system is trained, we will validate the obtained data in 145 patients. Initially, we performed a descriptive data frequency analysis of the patients who
developed SMM.
We perform an analysis of frequency of the diagnosis. As we can see in Fig. 2,
the amount of diagnostics is very large and the graph of frequency showed a
data distribution dispersed and dicult to interpret. It was decided to group
them according to the ICD-10 , leaving a moderate amount of variables. The
new results are shown in the Table 3.
Followed by this, we did the frequency analysis by trimester. In the first
trimester only the diagnostic group Z30-Z39 had high frequency. For the second
trimester, the results show that the most frequent group are Z30-Z39, O30-O48,
O20-O29, E65-E68, and N70-N77. In the third trimester is obtained that the
diagnostic groups most frequently are Z30-Z39, O30-O48, O10-O16, N70-N77,
O95-O99, D50-D64, and O60-O75.

Complications of labour and delivery

After having a notion of the data trend, we decided to carry out an analysis
of variance ANOVA to the data of the patients with SMM and not SMM. It
was organized per trimester. Similarly, the diagnostics were grouped according
to SMM. The analysis of the first trimester was done initially with levels of
confidence of 95 %, 90 % and finally 85 %. The results indicate that none of the
variables have a high probability of being connected with the SMM. It notes
that the diagnosis Z30-Z39 shows more likely to have any connection with the
response variable, but it is the default diagnostic.
The analysis of the data obtained for the second trimester was tested with
the 90 %, 80 % and 75 % confidence levels, and the results are shown in Table 4.

Fig. 3. SMM prediction model ROC

Logistic Regression to control the model complexity. To attack the problem of
the disparity of the classes is it penalizes classifier 10 times for each error in the
positive kind. The process of training takes 20 min in a server using one processor
core. Figure 3 show the result for a Logistic Regression classifier with the selected
predictors. The subsets are represented by a Receiver Operation Characteristic
Score Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC). It is a graphical representation of the
sensitivity vs. (1 - specificity).
To interpret the curve ROC is recommended to analyze the following
intervals: [0.5  0.6] Bad test, [0.6  0.75] Regular test [0.75  0.9] Good test,
[0.9  0.97] Very Good test, [0.97  1] Excellent test.
In the Fig. 3, the ROC shows that the average area under the curve is 0.66.
Then, the results are considerate Regular. To improve it, we suggest to try the
following options:
1. Take the original data set and to use Recursive Feature Elimination for logistic
regression, in this way obtain the best predictors to the model.
2. To Prove with polynomial transform higher than 2nd degree.
3. If the above options fail, we need to try a vector support machine.
4. After, we need to compare the results of ROC graphics for polynomial transform and support vector machine and select the model that shows the best
especificity and sensibility.

this. The problem lies in the early identification of risk patients who have finished
in SMM. In response to the above mentioned, this paper presents the usage of
the logistic regression for SMM detection. It is a pattern recognition technique
commonly used in the medical field to solve problems of classification, prediction
and identification of patterns. By the using of this technique, it is expected to
build a tool for risk identification or risk classification of a patient having SMM.
The goal is to provide a timely and adequate attention to each patient depending
on the risk level to be determined.
With the implemented logistic regression model, we obtained regular results,
for this, we to continue to proving others techniques of machine learning from
to obtain a model with best results.
