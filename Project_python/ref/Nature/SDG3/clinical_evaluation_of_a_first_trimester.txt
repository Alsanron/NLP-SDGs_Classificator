Background: The aim of this study is to validate the Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF) multiple logistic regression
algorithm for prediction of risk of pre-eclampsia in an Australian population. This model, which predicts risk using the
population rate of pre-eclampsia, a variety of demographic factors, mean maternal arterial blood pressure (MAP), uterine
artery PI (UtA PI) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), has been shown to predict early-onset preeclampsia (delivery prior to 34 weeks) in 95% of women at a 10% false-positive rate.
Methods: All women who attended rst trimester screening at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital had their body mass
index (BMI), MAP and UtA PI assessed in addition to factors traditionally used to assess aneuploidy (including PAPP-A
MoM). After delivery, risks of early-onset (delivery prior to 34 weeks) pre-eclampsia, late pre-eclampsia and gestational
hypertension were calculated using the FMF risk algorithm.
Results: A total of 3099 women were screened and delivered locally. 3066 (98.9%) women had all data to perform preeclampsia screening available. This included 3014 (98.3%) women with a live birth, where risks of early pre-eclampsia
were calculated. Twelve women were delivered before 34 weeks because of early pre-eclampsia with a prevalence of early
pre-eclampsia of 1 in 256 pregnancies. Risks generated through the use of maternal history, MAP, UtA PI and PAPP-A
detected 41.7 and 91.7% of early pre-eclampsia at a false-positive rate of 5 and 10%, respectively.
Conclusions: This study shows that the FMF early pre-eclampsia algorithm is effective in an Australian population.
Key words: rst trimester screening, mean arterial pressure, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A,

Introduction
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are common and are
responsible for signicant maternal and perinatal morbidity
and mortality.14 Traditionally, chronic and gestational
hypertensions are dened in relation to gestation at
diagnosis: being before or after 20 weeks gestation.1,2 These
conditions affect approximately 2 and 10% of pregnancies,
respectively.2 Pre-eclampsia, dened as proteinuric
hypertension specic to pregnancy, affects approximately
3% of women and is more common in those women found
to have chronic hypertension during early pregnancy.1,2,5

Identication of women who develop pre-eclampsia is made
difcult by the fact that the onset and severity of disease are
unpredictable. It is therefore normal practice to review
women antenatally with increasing frequency so that
hypertension and pre-eclampsia can be recognised in a
timely manner.2
Although many demographic, biophysical and
biochemical risk factors for pre-eclampsia have been
recognised, individually they perform poorly from a
screening perspective.6,7 Screening is only of value if there
is a therapeutic intervention that can improve outcome.
The prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin for the prevention
of pre-eclampsia has been a focus of research for over thirty
years. The initial observation that nulliparous women who
had taken aspirin regularly during pregnancy were less
likely to have pre-eclampsia than those who did not was
subsequently examined in >50 trials.8 A meta-analysis of
these studies reported only a marginal (10%) benet of
low-dose aspirin in high-risk pregnancies.9 Most studies
reported onset of treatment >16 weeks gestation. A recent

meta-analysis focusing on treatment 16 weeks or earlier
shows a signicant reduction in the relative risk (RR) for
pre-eclampsia (0.47, 95% condence interval (CI) 0.34 
0.65), whereas aspirin started >16 weeks had no
signicant benet (RR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.631.03).10 The
most recent meta-analysis that has been published further
demonstrates that low-dose aspirin started 16 weeks
gestation was particularly effective in preventing preterm
pre-eclampsia rather than term pre-eclampsia (RR: 0.11,
95% CI: 0.040.33 vs RR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.422.33).11
Successful implementation of this intervention is therefore
dependent on being able to screen effectively in early
pregnancy.
At present, clinicians evaluate the risk of pre-eclampsia by
taking a medical history at the booking visit. This identies
approximately 30% of cases destined to develop early preeclampsia for a false-positive rate of 5%.12 Recently, Poon
et al. 13 suggested that when these demographic factors were
analysed mathematically together with other biophysical and
biochemical parameters, 95% of fetuses requiring delivery
before 34 weeks gestation due to severe pre-eclampsia could
be recognised at the time of the 1113+6 week scan at a
false-positive rate of 10%. This study reports the
effectiveness of the multivariate screening algorithm
reported by Poon et al. when applied to a population of
Australian women attending for routine rst trimester
screening.

Materials and Methods
This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected
cohort of singleton pregnancies screened for chromosomal
abnormality at 1113+6 weeks gestation. First trimester
aneuploidy screening is offered to all patients booking for
antenatal care within our unit. The study is based on an
unselected cohort who opted for rst trimester screening
between 16th April 2010 and 9th March 2012
(23 months) and delivered at either Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital or Canterbury Hospital. Women who presented
with multiple pregnancies were excluded. Ethics approval
was obtained from RPA Human Research Ethics
Committee (HREC/11/RPAH/472).
Women were asked to complete a questionnaire
identifying ethnicity, mode of conception, obstetric, past
medical and family history, and smoking. They were
specically asked about hypertension, hypertension in a
previous pregnancy and whether they had a family history
of pre-eclampsia (affecting either their mother or sister).
Women were not excluded on the basis of taking antihypertensive drugs, aspirin or any other medications that
may affect the prevalence of pre-eclampsia. Maternal height
and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) was
calculated. Maternal blood pressure was measured
following a period of maternal rest for at least 10 min; this
involved being seated and making two measurements at the
level of the heart of systolic and diastolic blood pressure for
each arm, and mean arterial pressure was then calculated.14
Maternal blood pressure was recorded by trained staff using
2

an automated devise (3BTO-A2; Microlife, Taipei,
Taiwan) with an appropriately sized cuff. The Microlife
3BTO-A2 was chosen as it was the only automated device
validated for use both in pregnancy and pre-eclampsia.15,16
Calibration of the machine was performed at regular
intervals during the study.
An ultrasound was performed as part of screening for
aneuploidy in the rst trimester. Gestational age was
derived from the fetal crown-rump length (CRL). The fetal
nuchal translucency, fetal heart rate and anatomic survey
were completed. The uterine arteries were demonstrated by
dening the cervix in the midline, then tilting the probe
towards the lateral margin of the cervix and using colour
Doppler to visualise the uterine artery ascending at the level
of the internal cervical os.17,18 Once a consistent uterine
artery waveform was recorded, right and left uterine artery
pulsatility indices were measured (over three cycles) and
recorded.
Maternal serum PAPP-A was measured as part of the
rst trimester screening programme for aneuploidy. The
samples were taken at the time of the rst trimester
ultrasound visit and analysed using a Siemens Immulite
assay (Immulite XPi; Diagnostic products Corporation,
Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostic, Tarrytown, NY,
USA). The raw data were converted to a Multiple of
Median (MoM) value accounting for gestation (based on
CRL) and maternal weight within the Department
of Endocrinology (Using Prisca 4 software; Typolog
Software Ltd & Co KG, Tomesch, Germany). The MoM
values were then entered into the FMF software
(Viewpoint Version 5.6.9.483; GE Healthcare, Sydney,
NSW, Australia) for aneuploidy risk calculation.
Pregnancy outcome data were collated from the hospital
records. Sources of data included the midwifery birth
registry and the maternal and neonatal discharge
summaries, which are all available electronically. The data
were collated by three of the investigators (FP, CL and
SR), initially working together to ensure uniformity in
assessment. In addition, hospital records related to all
obstetric admissions were reviewed when a diagnosis of a
hypertensive disorder had been made to ensure that
hypertension was appropriately categorised as pre-existing
hypertension, gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia.
Gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia were dened
according to the criteria of the International Society for the
Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy.19 Hypertension in
pregnancy is dened by a systolic BP >140 mgHg and/or
diastolic BP >90 mmHg on two occasions more than four
hours apart. Chronic hypertension is dened by a history
of hypertension prior to conception or that is diagnosed
<20 weeks gestation. Gestational hypertension is dened
as de novo hypertension, with no evidence of proteinuria,
arising after 20 weeks gestation and returning to
normal postpartum. Pre-eclampsia is dened as de novo
hypertension arising after 20 weeks gestation, returning to
normal postpartum, with proteinuria (24 h urine 300 mg
or spot urine protein/creatinine ratio 30 mg protein/mmol
creatinine).19 Each woman was categorised at delivery as

having either no hypertensive disease of pregnancy,
gestational hypertension, early pre-eclampsia (requiring
delivery <34 weeks gestation) or late pre-eclampsia
(requiring delivery 34 weeks). Women with chronic
hypertension were not categorised as hypertensive disease
of pregnancy unless they developed superimposed
pre-eclampsia. Birth data, including gestation, mode of
delivery and birth weight, were recorded.
The measured MAP and lowest UtAPI were converted
to multiples of the expected normal median (MoM)
corrected for fetal CRL, maternal age, BMI, smoking and
racial origin.20 The Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF)
risk algorithm was used to predict the development of
early pre-eclampsia, late pre-eclampsia and gestational
hypertension from rst trimester parameters.13,17,2123 The
algorithm was applied retrospectively to our study
population and patient-specic risks of early preeclampsia, late pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension
generated, so this information was not reported to
referring clinicians at the time of the rst trimester scan.
The algorithm used to dene the risk of pre-eclampsia was
Odds/(1 + odds) where odds = eY and where Y =
0.154 + 2.546 9 log ( 3.657 + 1.592 9 log maternal risk
factor + 31.396 9 log MAP MoM + 13.322 9 log UtA
L-PI MoM)  2.603 9 log PAPP-A MoM. The maternal
risk factor was 5.674 + (1.267 if African, 0 if other
racial origin) + (2.193 if history of chronic hypertension, 0
if not) + ( 1.184 if parous without previous PE, 1.362 if
parous with previous PE, 0 if nulliparous) + (1.537 if
conceived with ovulation induction, 0 if other method of
conception). The categorisation of pregnancy outcome
occurred prior to calculation of risk of hypertension in
pregnancy.
The predictive performance of the algorithm was
examined using the sensitivity and specicity of the test as
well as the positive and negative predictive value in our
population. Performance of screening was further
examined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve analysis. The expected number of cases of earlyand late-onset pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension
was calculated as sums of risks of individual algorithm.
Comparison between outcome groups by MannWhitney
U-test with post hoc Bonferronis correction and v2-test or
Fishers exact test for categorical variables (adjusted
signicance level P < 0.0167). The statistical software
package SPSS 20.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows,
Version 20.0. IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) and
Medcalc (Medcalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium) were
used for all data analyses.

cases, data were incomplete due to missing demographic
history, maternal serum biochemistry (PAPP-A), maternal
mean arterial pressure or uterine artery Doppler
measurement. 3014 (98.3%) of the 3066 women who
were screened had a live birth. This included 83 (2.8%)
that developed pre-eclampsia; 12 (0.4%) that required
delivery before 34 weeks (early pre-eclampsia) and 71
(2.4%) with late pre-eclampsia. 119 (3.9%) women
developed gestational hypertension, whilst 2,812 (93.3%)
cases were unaffected by either pre-eclampsia or
gestational hypertension. 23 (0.8%) fetuses died in utero,
27 (0.9%) women had a termination of pregnancy, and
two neonates died at early gestations (22 and 24 weeks) as
the result of prematurity (Table 1).
Of 42 (4.0%) parous women reported a history of preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy; 142 (6.4%) women
reported a maternal history of pre-eclampsia and 28
(1.3%) women had a history of pre-existing hypertension.
The maternal and pregnancy characteristics of the
hypertensive groups are compared with the normotensive
group in Table 2. In the early pre-eclampsia group, when
compared with the control group, there was a higher
prevalence of women with chronic hypertension, the
MAP MoM and UtAPI MoM were higher, the gestational
age at delivery was earlier, and the neonatal birth weight
was smaller. In the late pre-eclampsia group, when
compared with the control group, there was a higher
prevalence of nulliparous women and women with
chronic hypertension, the BMI was higher, the MAP
MoM was higher, the PAPP-A MoM was lower, the
gestational age at delivery was earlier, and the neonatal
birth weight was smaller. In the gestational hypertension
group, when compared with the control group, there was
a higher prevalence of Caucasian women and women
with chronic hypertension and prior history of preeclampsia, the BMI was higher, the MAP MoM was
higher, the PAPP-A MoM was lower, and the gestational
age at delivery was earlier.
The performance of the FMF algorithm in predicting
early- and late-onset pre-eclampsia and gestational
hypertension is described in Table 3. Using all

demographic, biophysical and biochemical factors,
screening at xed 5 and 10% false-positive rates, the
detection rates of early pre-eclampsia were 41.7% (95% CI
15.372.2) and 91.7% (95% CI 61.598.6), respectively.
Using demographic and biophysical factors, screening at
xed 5 and 10% false-positive rates, the detection rates of
late pre-eclampsia were 18.3% (95% CI 10.129.3) and
35.2% (95% CI 24.247.5), respectively. The respective
detection rates for gestational hypertension were 27.6%
(95% CI 27.636.2) and 37.8% (95% CI 29.346.8).
Accuracy was measured by examining the area under
the ROC curve (AUROC), with an area of 1 representing
a perfect test and an area of 0.5 representing a worthless
test. The AUROC for early pre-eclampsia calculated
for the combined algorithm was 0.926 (95% CI 0.916
0.936) indicating good performance (Tables 3 and 4;
Fig. 1).

Discussion
This study has demonstrated that the FMF algorithm that
has been designed to predict early-onset pre-eclampsia is
4

effective in an Australian population. The test had a
sensitivity of 91.7% for 90% specicity. If this algorithm
was applied to our population prospectively at
1113+6 weeks gestation, we would anticipate positive and
negative predictive values of 3.6 and 99.9%, respectively.
The high negative predictive value means the test could be
used to dene a group of women at very low risk of earlyonset pre-eclampsia who could be managed within a lowrisk care model. The positive predictive value remains
relatively low, meaning that one in every 28 women placed
in a high-risk group would actually develop early-onset
pre-eclampsia and this would need to be taken under
consideration when planning interventions for this group.
The ndings of this study are similar to the data
reported by Poon et al.13on the effectiveness of this
multivariate screening algorithm. Poon et al. completed
their study in a tertiary institution in the UK where there
was a signicant difference in ethnicity of women being
examined, which included a large African population and
few Asian women. Given these differences, it was
important to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm
in a cohort of Australian women. Poon et al.13reported that

95% of early pre-eclampsia can be predicted through rst
trimester screening (at a 10% false-positive rate) which is
comparable with the 91.7% detection rate that we have
reported. It is interesting to note that in our population,
inclusion of the serum measure of PAPP-A did not
improve the predictive ability of the algorithm above what
is achieved by the use of a combination of maternal
factors, MAP and uterine artery PI. This is not the case
for the study reported by Poon et al.13 Possible
explanations for this difference include the different
patient population and the use of a different platform for

measuring PAPP-A. The sample size was also smaller in
this study and may not, therefore, have shown the small
improvement previously reported with PAPP-A.
One limitation of this study is that despite recruiting
>3000 pregnancies, only a small number of women
developed early pre-eclampsia (n = 12). Consequently,
condence intervals describing test performance remain
broad. A further limitation is that whilst the study
population were unselected, they do represent a cohort of
women who chose to have rst trimester screening for
aneuploidy. Also, the ethnic and socio-economic
composition of this inner city population does not reect
that found in all Australian centres. Nevertheless, we have
demonstrated that an algorithm developed in the UK
appears to be sufciently robust to be used in Australia.
The principle of rst trimester screening is well
established for the identication of pregnancies at
increased risk of aneuploidy. First trimester screening
could be expanded to include screening for hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy, although systems need to be
developed to ensure accurate recording of added
demographic data, accurate measurement of weight and
height, and accurate measurement of maternal blood
pressure. Sonographers also need to be trained in the
technique used for assessment of the uterine artery
waveform, which is different to that traditionally described

in the second trimester of pregnancy. Attributes of a good
screening test for pre-eclampsia include a test that is
simple, rapid, non-invasive, inexpensive, easy to perform
and does not expose patients to risk of signicant
discomfort.24 We have found implementation of the
additional parameters required for pre-eclampsia screening
at 1113+6 weeks to be straightforward although we would
emphasise the need for appropriate training in uterine
artery Doppler measurement and the need for ongoing
quality assurance.
Screening is only of value if there is a therapeutic
intervention that can improve outcome. Low-dose aspirin
given to women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia has
been examined extensively. Large reviews report a small
but signicant reduction in risk of pre-eclampsia with lowdose aspirin.9,25 A recent meta-analysis that examined the
effectiveness of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia showed a 50% reduction in prevalence at all,
and 90% reduction in prevalence at early (<34 weeks)
gestations in high-risk women.10 These improvements
were reliant on aspirin therapy being started <16 weeks
gestation  this requires early screening. These data
have conrmed that screening for pre-eclampsia at
1113+6 weeks is highly predictive of early-onset disease.
If 1 in 28 women who are high risk would have an
affected pregnancy and there is a 90% reduction through
early intervention with low-dose aspirin, then we would
anticipate that 31 women would need to be treated to
prevent one case of pre-eclampsia requiring delivery
<34 weeks. As low-dose aspirin has been shown to be safe
for the fetus, this seems to be an acceptable treatment for
high-risk women.26 We recognise that women who screen
positive may experience concern and anxiety about their
pregnancy outcome.27 We anticipate that this can be
minimised with pre- and post-test counselling and
the implementation of a plan of monitoring during the
pregnancy for women who screen positive, although this
requires further evaluation. We also recognise that women
should be given an opportunity to decline screening.

Each measurement used in calculating an individual
womans risk of the development of pre-eclampsia
required training, implementation and review of the
accuracy of the measurement for quality assurance of the
risk calculation generated. This was particularly relevant
for uterine artery Doppler measurement. The importance
of this principle is well understood for aneuploidy risk
assessment in the rst trimester with nuchal translucency
measurement requiring annual audit for clinicians to
maintain their accreditation, ensuring that the performance
of this screening test remains high. Quality assurance of
risk components, including uterine artery Doppler
assessment, needs to be considered. Although the data for
risk assessment were collected prospectively in this study,
risks were not calculated until the pregnancy was
complete, avoiding any bias that may have been
introduced through changes in clinician management of
these pregnancies.
The performance of the multivariate screening
algorithm may be further improved. Akolekar et al. 28 have
published an algorithm, including an additional
biochemical marker that reduced the false-positive rate to
5% while maintaining detection rate at 91% for early-onset
pre-eclampsia. Whilst this algorithm is predictive of lateonset pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, it is less
sensitive for these conditions. The difference in predictive
performance for early- and late-onset disease may reect
differences in the underlying pathologies. There is a
evidence that suggests that the morphological changes seen
in the placenta in early-/severe- or late-onset pre-eclampsia
are signicantly different.29,30 An alternative screening
strategy for late-onset disease may involve two step
screening, using either the same markers in a multiple
measures model or additional markers indicative of risk of
pre-eclampsia.3133
This study supports the multivariate screening algorithm
published by the Maternal Fetal Medicine Foundation for
the prediction of pre-eclampsia between 11 and
13+6 weeks when applied to an Australian population.

Predicting risk of early PET

While a full cost-benet analysis needs to be undertaken,
the introduction of routine rst trimester screening for
severe pre-eclampsia, which can be performed at the same
time as dening risks of aneuploidy, merits further
consideration.
