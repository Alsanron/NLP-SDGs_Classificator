Pregnancy
First-Trimester Prediction of Hypertensive Disorders
in Pregnancy

AbstractThis study aimed to establish a method of screening for pregnancy hypertension by a combination of maternal
variables, including mean arterial pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, and
placental growth factor in early pregnancy. The base-cohort population constituted of 7797 singleton pregnancies,
including 34 case subjects who developed preeclampsia (PE) requiring delivery before 34 weeks (early PE) and 123 with
late PE, 136 with gestational hypertension, and 7504 cases subjects (96.3%) who were unaffected by PE or gestational
hypertension. Maternal history, uterine artery pulsatility index, mean arterial pressure, and pregnancy-associated plasma
protein-A were recorded in all of the cases in the base cohort, but placental growth factor was measured only in the
case-control population of 209 cases who developed hypertensive disorders and 418 controls. In each case the measured
mean arterial pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, and placental growth
factor were converted to a multiple of the expected median (MoM) after correction for maternal characteristics found
to affect the measurements in the unaffected group. Early PE and late PE were associated with increased mean arterial
pressure (1.15 MoM and 1.08 MoM) and uterine artery pulsatility index (1.53 MoM and 1.23 MoM) and decreased
pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (0.53 MoM and 0.93 MoM) and placental growth factor (0.61 MoM and 0.83
MoM). Logistic regression analysis was used to derive algorithms for the prediction of hypertensive disorders. It was
estimated that, with the algorithm for early PE, 93.1%, 35.7%, and 18.3% of early PE, late PE, and gestational
hypertension, respectively, could be detected with a 5% false-positive rate and that 1 in 5 pregnancies classified as being
screen positive would develop pregnancy hypertension. This method of screening is far superior to the traditional
approach, which relies entirely on maternal history. (Hypertension. 2009;53:812-818.)

reeclampsia (PE), which affects 2% of pregnancies, is
a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and
mortality.1 4 In the United Kingdom, the National Institute
for Clinical Excellence has issued guidelines on routine
prenatal care recommending that at the first prenatal visit a
womans level of risk for PE should be evaluated so that a
plan for her schedule of prenatal visits can be formulated.5
There is no proven effective method for the prevention of PE.
Nevertheless, routine prenatal care in the last 50 years has
evolved with the aim of early identification of women at
high-risk for PE, which could potentially improve pregnancy
outcome. Intensive maternal and fetal monitoring in such
patients would lead to an earlier diagnosis of the clinical signs
of the disease and the associated fetal growth restriction and
avoid the development of serious complications through such
interventions as the administration of antihypertensive medication and early delivery. Early identification of the high-risk
group for the development of PE is also important for future
studies investigating the potential role of pharmacological

P

interventions starting from the first trimester to improve
placentation and reduce the prevalence of the disease.
The traditional method of screening for PE is maternal
history. The likelihood of developing PE is increased in
black compared with white women, in nulliparous compared with parous women, in those with a high body mass
index (BMI), and in those with a previous or family history
of PE.6 However, screening on the basis of such history
would identify 30% of cases destined to develop early
PE, requiring delivery before 34 weeks of gestation, and
20% of late PE, for a false-positive rate of 5%.7 There is
evidence that, in a high proportion of pregnancies destined
to develop PE at 11 to 13 weeks of gestation, the maternal
mean arterial pressure (MAP) and uterine artery pulsatility
index (PI) are increased, and the maternal serum concentration of the placental factors pregnancy-associated plasma
protein-A (PAPP-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are
reduced.8 11
The aims of this study are to derive specific algorithms for
the calculation of patient-specific risks for early PE, late PE,

and gestational hypertension (GH), based on a combination of
factors in the maternal history, the measurements of MAP and
uterine artery PI, and maternal serum levels of PAPP-A and
PlGF at 11 to 13 weeks of gestation, as well as to examine the
performance of each of the 3 algorithms in the early detection
of pregnancy hypertension.

Methods
Study Population
This was a prospective screening study for hypertensive complications of pregnancy in women attending for their routine first hospital
visit in pregnancy. In this visit, which is held at 11 to 13 weeks of
gestation, all of the women have an ultrasound scan for the following
reasons: (1) to confirm gestational age from the measurement of the
fetal crown-rump length (CRL); (2) to diagnose any major fetal
abnormalities; and (3) to measure fetal nuchal translucency thickness
as part of the screening for chromosomal abnormalities. In addition,
the maternal serum PAPP-A and free -human chorionic gonadotropin are determined, and the results are combined with the fetal
nuchal translucency to calculate the patient-specific risk for trisomy
21.12,13 We recorded maternal characteristics and medical history,
measured the uterine artery PI by transabdominal color Doppler,9
measured MAP by automated devices,8 and stored serum at 80C
for subsequent biochemical analysis. Written informed consent was
obtained from the women agreeing to participate in the study, which
was approved by Kings College Hospital Ethics Committee.
We prospectively examined 8481 singleton pregnancies between
March 2006 and August 2007. We excluded 684 (8.1%) because they
had missing outcome data (n417), there was a fetal major defect
(n43) or fetal aneuploidy (n50), the pregnancies resulted in fetal
death or miscarriage before 24 weeks of gestation (n130), the
pregnancies were terminated for social reasons (n17), or when
there was 1 episode of hypertension, but on the basis of the available
data, it was not possible to determine whether the diagnosis was PE
(n27). In the remaining 7797 cases (base-cohort population), there
were 157 (2.0%) who developed PE, including 34 who required delivery
before 34 weeks (early PE) and 123 with late PE, 136 with GH, and
7504 (96.3%) cases who were unaffected by PE or GH.
In this study, maternal history, uterine artery PI, MAP, and
PAPP-A were recorded in all of the cases in the base-cohort
population (n7797). In addition, maternal serum PlGF was measured in a case-control population of 29 cases with early PE, 98 with
late PE, 82 with GH, and 418 controls from pregnancies that did not
develop any complications and resulted in the live birth of phenotypically normal neonates. The selection of the specific samples from
each group of hypertensive disorders was simply based on availability. For each case of hypertensive disorders, we selected 2 cases of
controls matched for length of storage of their samples. The analyses
were performed in October 2007 and February 2008. None of the
samples were previously thawed and refrozen. This study is part of
a research program on the early prediction of pregnancy complications, and the data from some of the patients on individual components of the present study were published previously.8 11

Maternal History
Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire on maternal age,
racial origin (white, black, Indian or Pakistani, Chinese or Japanese,
and Mixed), cigarette smoking during pregnancy (yes or no), method
of conception (spontaneous or assisted), medical history (including
chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, antiphospholipid syndrome,
thrombophilia, and sickle cell disease), medication (including antihypertensive, antidepressant, antiepileptic, aspirin, steroids, betamimetic, insulin, and thyroxin), parity (parous or nulliparous if no delivery
beyond 23 weeks), obstetric history (including previous pregnancy with
PE), and family history of PE (mother). The questionnaire was then
reviewed by a doctor together with the patient. The maternal weight and
height were measured, and the BMI was calculated in kilograms per
meter squared.

Outcome Measures
The definitions of PE and GH were those of the International Society
for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy.14 In GH, the diastolic
blood pressure should be 90 mm Hg on 2 occasions 4 hours apart
developing after 20 weeks of gestation in previously normotensive
women in the absence of significant proteinuria, and in PE there
should be GH with proteinuria of 300 mg in 24 hours or 2 readings
of 2 pluses on dipstick analysis of midstream or catheter urine
specimens if no 24-hour collection is available. In PE superimposed
on chronic hypertension, significant proteinuria (as defined above)
should develop after 20 weeks of gestation in women with known
chronic hypertension (history of hypertension before conception or
the presence of hypertension at the booking visit before 20 weeks of
gestation in the absence of trophoblastic disease).

Sample Analysis
A duplicate serum sample of 100 L was used to measure PlGF
concentration by a quantitative ELISA technique using Quantikine
human PlGF immunoassay (R&D Systems Europe Ltd). The assays
were performed on an automated ELISA processor (Dade-Behring
BEP 2000). Absorbance readings were taken on a VICTOR3 plate
reader (PerkinElmer Life and Analytic Sciences), and PlGF concentrations were determined using MultiCalc software (PerkinElmer
Life and Analytic Sciences). The lower limit of detection of the assay
was 7 pg/mL, and the between-batch imprecision was 8.3% at a PlGF
concentration of 48 pg/mL, 5.6% at 342 pg/mL, and 5.1% at 722
pg/mL. All of the samples were analyzed in duplicate, and those with
a coefficient of variation 15% were reanalyzed.
Maternal serum PAPP-A was measured using the DELFIA XPRESS
analyzer (PerkinElmer Life and Analytic Sciences). The variation of
the DELFIA XPRESS PAPP-A assay was determined in 20 runs
with 2 replicates using this DELFIA XPRESS system. The calibration curve of the first run was used as a reference curve during the
14-day period. The intra-assay and interassay variations were 1.2%
and 2.1%, respectively, at a PAPP-A concentration of 462 mU/L,
1.4% and 2.3% at 2124 mU/L, and 1.3% and 2.5% at 5543 mU/L.

Statistical Analysis
Maternal history, uterine artery PI, MAP, and PAPP-A were recorded in all of the cases in the base cohort, but PlGF was measured
only in the case-control population.
Comparisons between base-cohort and case-control populations
was by 2 or Fishers exact test for categorical variables and by
MannWhitney test for continuous variables. Comparisons between
outcome groups in the case-control study were by 2 or Fishers
exact test for categorical variables and by Kruskal-Wallis test and
Dunns procedure for continuous variables.
The following steps were taken to develop a specific algorithm for
the calculation of patient-specific risk of early PE, late PE, and GH.
First, the distributions of uterine artery PI, MAP, PAPP-A, and PlGF
were made Gaussian after logarithmic transformation. Second, multiple regression analysis was used to determine which of the factors
among the maternal characteristics, medical and obstetric history,
and gestation were significant predictors of log uterine artery PI and
log MAP in the unaffected group of the base-cohort population and
of log PlGF in the unaffected group of the case-control population.
Then, the distribution of log uterine artery PI, log MAP, and log
PlGF expressed as multiples of the median (MoM) of the unaffected
group, were determined in the PE and GH groups of the case-control
population. Fourth, the measured PAPP-A was converted into MoM
after adjustment for gestation, maternal age, racial origin, weight,
parity, cigarette smoking status, and method of conception, as
described previously.15 Fifth, logistic regression analysis was used to
determine which of the factors among the maternal characteristics,
log uterine artery PI MoM, log MAP MoM, log PlGF MoM, and log
PAPP-A MoM, had a significant contribution in predicting early PE,
late PE, and GH. Sixth, the detection and false-positive rates were
calculated as the respective proportions of PE or GH (detection rate)
and unaffected pregnancies (false-positive rate) with MoM values

APS indicates antiphospholipid syndrome.
Comparisons between base-cohort and case-control populations showed no significant difference.
Comparisons between outcome groups in the case-control study (2 or Fishers exact test for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunns procedure for continuous variables): *P0.05, P0.01,
P0.0001.
By definition, there were no cases of chronic hypertension in women who developed GH.

above the given cutoffs. The statistical software package SPSS 15.0
(SPSS Inc) was used for all of the data analyses.

Results
The maternal characteristics of each of the outcome groups in
the base-cohort and case-control populations are compared in
Table 1. There were no significant differences in any of the
maternal characteristics between each of the outcome groups
in these populations. In the case-control population, in the
early PE and late-PE groups compared with controls, the BMI
was significantly higher, there were more black women, more
women had PE in their previous pregnancies, and more
women were chronic hypertensives on antihypertensive medication. In addition, in the early PE group compared with
controls, more women conceived with assisted conception; in
the GH group compared with controls, the BMI was significantly higher, there were fewer Indian or Pakistani women,
and more women had PE in their previous pregnancies.

Unaffected Group
Multiple regression analysis in the unaffected group of the
base-cohort population demonstrated that, for log uterine
artery PI, significant independent contributions were provided by fetal CRL, maternal BMI, age, and racial origin
(Table 2; R20.030; P0.0001). In the case of log MAP,
significant independent contributions were provided by
fetal CRL, maternal BMI, age, smoking, parity, and racial
origin (Table 2; R20.116; P0.0001). Multiple regression analysis in the unaffected group of the case-control
population demonstrated that, for log PlGF, significant
independent contributions were provided by fetal CRL,
maternal weight, smoking, and racial origin (Table 2;
R20.254; P0.0001).
In each patient, we used these formulas to derive the
expected log uterine artery PI, log MAP, and log PlGF and
then expressed the observed value as an MoM (Table 3).

Similarly, we used a previously derived formula for PAPP-A15
to calculate the respective MoM value for this metabolite.

Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that, in the prediction of early PE, there were significant contributions from

As shown in Table 3, the MAP was significantly higher in
early PE, late PE, and GH than in the controls (P0.0001); in
early PE than in late PE (P0.02); and in early PE than in GH
(P0.01). Uterine artery PI was higher in early PE than in
controls (P0.0001), in late PE than in controls (P0.0002),
in early PE than in late PE (P0.001), and in early PE than
in GH (P0.0001). Serum PAPP-A was lower in early PE
than in controls (P0.0001), in late PE than in controls
(P0.03), in early PE than in late PE (P0.005), and in early
PE than in GH (P0.001). Serum PlGF was lower in early PE
and late PE than in controls (P0.0001), in early PE than in
GH (P0.0001), and in late PE than in GH (P0.02).

Patient-Specific Risks for PE and GH
The patient-specific risks for PE and GH (%) were calculated
from the formula: odds/(1odds), where oddseY. Y was
derived from logistic regression analysis.

Performance of Screening
The Figure showed the performance of screening for early PE,
late PE, and GH using each of the algorithms for early PE, late
PE, and GH. At a 5% false-positive rate, the estimated respective
detection rates of early PE, late PE, and GH were 93.1%, 35.7%,
and 18.3% using the algorithm for early PE; 82.8%, 44.9%, and
23.2% using the algorithm for late PE; and 41.4%, 40.8%, and
34.1% using the algorithm for GH.
Screening for hypertensive disorders using the algorithm
for early PE in our base-cohort population of 7797 cases
would have potentially classified as screen-positive a total of
476 pregnancies including 375 (5% of the 7504) with no
hypertensive disorders, 32 (93.1% of the 34) with early PE,
44 (35.7% of the 123) with late PE, and 25 (18.3% of the 136)
with GH. Therefore, 21.2% of the pregnancies classified as
screen-positive would develop hypertensive disorders.

Discussion
The findings of this study confirm that, in women who
develop hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, the MAP
and uterine artery PI are increased, and the serum concentrations of PAPP-A and PlGF are decreased at 11 to 13 weeks of
gestation.8 11 Furthermore, the patient-specific risk for the
development of these complications can be derived by algorithms combining maternal racial origin, BMI, and personal
or family history of PE with the measurements of MAP,
uterine artery PI, PAPP-A, and PlGF.
We chose 11 to 13 weeks as the gestation for screening,
because this is emerging as the first hospital visit of pregnant
women at which combined sonographic and biochemical
testing for chromosomal and other major defects is carried
out.12,13 At this visit, first, a record is made of maternal
characteristics; second, an ultrasound scan is carried out to
determine the number of fetuses, confirm the gestation from

the fetal CRL, exclude major defects, and measure the nuchal
translucency thickness and other first-trimester markers of
chromosomal defects; and, third, maternal blood is taken for
measurement of free -human chorionic gonadotropin and
PAPP-A.13 Recent evidence suggests that improved firsttrimester screening for chromosomal defects may be provided
by the inclusion of serum PlGF.16 There is also evidence that,
because low PAPP-A is observed in both chromosomal
abnormalities and early PE, but uterine artery PI is normal in
the former and high in the latter, inclusion of uterine artery PI
could also improve first-trimester screening for chromosomal
defects.17 Consequently, women attending their first hospital
visit could have a series of biophysical and biochemical
measurements that will then be used to estimate their patientspecific risk for both chromosomal defects and hypertensive
disorders.
In the unaffected group, which did not develop PE or GH,
the measured values of MAP, uterine artery PI, serum
PAPP-A, and serum PlGF changed with fetal CRL and,
therefore, gestational age, maternal BMI, and racial origin,
and, in addition, some of the variables were affected by
maternal age, smoking, and parity. Consequently, the measured values were adjusted for these variables before comparing results with pathological pregnancies.
PlGF is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor
subfamily, it is expressed by trophoblast cells, and has both
vasculogenetic and angiogenetic functions. Its angiogenetic
abilities have been speculated to play a role in normal
pregnancy, and changes in the levels of PlGF or its inhibitory
receptor have been implicated in the development of PE.18 21
PAPP-A is a syncytiotrophoblast-derived metalloproteinase
that enhances the mitogenic function of the insulin-like growth
factors by cleaving the complex formed between such growth
factors and their binding proteins.22,23 Because the insulin-like
growth factor system is believed to play a significant role in
trophoblast invasion, it is not surprising that low-serum PAPP-A
is associated with a higher incidence of PE.24
In both early PE and late PE, but not in GH, there were
significant differences from the unaffected group in uterine

Poon et al
artery PI and serum PAPP-A and PlGF, and the values in
early PE were substantially different from those developing
late PE. In contrast, MAP was increased in all types of
hypertensive disorders, with the values being higher in those
developing early PE and similar between late PE and GH.
Early screening for hypertensive disorders by a combination
of maternal factors, MAP, uterine artery PI, PAPP-A, and
PlGF is particularly effective in identifying severe early onset
PE than late PE or GH with respective detection rates of
90%, 35%, and 20%. The detection rate of 90% for early
PE, at a false-positive rate of 5%, by the suggested combination of biophysical and biochemical parameters in this
study, is substantially higher than the 60% in screening by
history, uterine artery PI, and PAPP-A or the 40% in
screening by history and MAP.8,10
The high detection rate for early PE is important because it
is this rather than late PE or GH that is associated with
increased risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity and both
short-term and long-term maternal complications.2528 The
underlying mechanism for PE is thought to be impaired
trophoblastic invasion of the maternal spiral arteries and their
conversion from narrow muscular vessels to wide nonmuscular channels.29,30 It is, therefore, possible that the difference
in the performance of screening between early and late PE
may simply reflect that there is a wide spectrum in such
impaired placentation and consequent clinical presentation of
the disease. Alternatively, this difference may support emerging evidence that PE may be a common clinical expression of
distinct pathophysiological processes. Recent studies on placental pathology have suggested that early onset disease is
more likely to be associated with abnormal villous and
vascular morphology, whereas in late onset disease, the
placental morphology and histology are not dissimilar to
those in controls.30,31 On the contrary, there is evidence that
late onset compared with early onset disease is more likely to
be related to impaired glucose metabolism 32 and a
hyperdynamic-low peripheral resistance (as opposed to a
low-cardiac output-vasoconstricted) maternal cardiovascular
profile,33,34 a profile that resembles the one found in nonpregnant obese patients with subclinical glucose intolerance.3537
Our model includes variables that are either reflective of
placental function (PAPP-A and PlGF) or depict increased
resistance in the uteroplacental circulation (uterine artery PI).
If, therefore, late PE is a disease not associated with impaired
placentation, it is not surprising that PAPP-A and PlGF do not
perform as well as in early disease. In addition, our previous
work that showed a positive correlation between maternal
peripheral resistance and uterine artery PI38 explains why
uterine artery PI would not perform as well in a group of
patients who are more likely to have a low-peripheral
resistance hemodynamic profile.33,34,39
First-trimester screening can identify a high proportion of
pregnancies destined to develop hypertensive disorders, and it
was estimated that 1 in 5 pregnancies classified as being
screen-positive would develop such disorders. Such high
detection rates and positive predictive values cannot be
achieved by the traditional approach of screening, which
relies entirely on maternal history. Consequently, if our
results are confirmed by further prospective studies, the

proposed combined approach to screening could be incorporated into routine care for early assessment of patient-specific
risk for hypertensive disorders.5 Such an approach would
rationalize the frequency and type of prenatal visits for
pregnant women according to estimated risk, as recommended by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence in the
United Kingdom.5 It is aimed that the care of low-risk
pregnancies is decentralized to local, 1-stop settings or at
home, whereas high-risk pregnancies are cared for in specialized centers.40 In the academic setting, centralized care of
pregnancies at high risk for PE would lead to a more effective
concentration of research activity in an attempt to improve
the understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of
the condition.

Perspectives
The traditional approach to screening for PE, which is based
on maternal demographic characteristics and medical history,
identifies 30% of cases destined to develop early PE for a
false-positive rate of 5%.7 This study proposes a new screening
method by a combination of factors in the maternal history,
MAP, uterine artery PI, and serum PAPP-A and PlGF at 11 to 13
weeks of gestation, which, for the same false-positive rate of 5%,
could identify 90% of cases of early PE.
