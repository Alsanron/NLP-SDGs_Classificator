AbstractSocial media such as Twitter can provide urgently
needed drug abuse intelligence to support the campaign of
fighting against the national drug abuse crisis. We employed a
targeted tweet collection approach and a two-staged annotation
strategy that combines conventional annotation with
crowdsourced annotation to produce annotated training
dataset. In this demo, we share deep learning models trained in
a boosting manner using the data from the two-staged
annotation method and unlabeled data collection to detect drug
abuse risk behavior in tweets.

Limited availability of annotated tweet data for training
machine learning models.
This paper addresses these challenging issues and achieves
three objectives: (1) Build a system that can effectively collect
drug abuse-related tweets at a large-scale; (2) Design an
annotation strategy (drug abuse vs. non-drug abuse) that
enables creating datasets at a much lower cost than traditional
methods; and (3) Develop a deep learning model that can
accurately classify tweets into drug abuse risk behaviorpositive or negative tweets to support drug abuse monitoring.

II. METHODS
We first collected over 3 million raw tweets using the
Twitter Streaming API during January 2017. To keep a
balance between coverage and quality of the collected tweets,
we used three types of keywords as filters: (1) Prescription and
illicit drug names, e.g. marijuana, oxycontin, heroin, LSD,
etc.; (2) Slang drug terms, e.g. barbs, crack, blunt, etc.; and (3)
Drug abuse-related activities, behaviors, and syndromes, e.g.
high, stoned, dizziness, etc. Over 800 keywords were used.
A set of 1,794 human-annotated tweets, jointly annotated
by two professors and three students, were used as seed
dataset. The seed dataset was used to train an SVM classifier,
which was then applied to unlabeled tweets to derive 4,985
positively predicted tweets. These 4,985 tweets were reviewed
and annotated through Amazon Mechanical Turk.
For classification, raw tweets were first tokenized and
stemmed, then each word was vectorized into 300-dimension
vectors using the pre-trained GoogleNews Word2vec
model. Then, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
[9] model was trained with our boosting training scheme that
repeatedly classifies unlabeled tweets and selects highconfidence labels to extend the human-labeled training
dataset. It was found that this improves the validation
performance.

I. INTRODUCTION
A Public Health Emergency has been declared [1] with the
rising trend of drug abuse in the US in recent years. The most
recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) [2]
reported that an estimated 10.6% of the total population aged
12 and above misused illicit drugs within one month prior to
the interview in 2016. In the same year, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [3] reported 42,249
deaths due to opioid drugs, which outnumbered the deaths by
motor vehicle accidents, suicides and homicides. On top of
that, heroin alone caused more deaths than firearms did in
2015 and the number is rising.
In 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) announced a new Opioid Strategy [5], where
strengthening public health surveillance was among its five
priorities. In contrast with surveillance methods based on
clinical records from hospitals and traditional surveys, social
media monitoring can provide more real-time surveillance
capabilities to improve public health awareness. Twitter has
been shown to be an excellent data source in many healthrelated projects [6-8]. The goal of our ongoing research is to
develop an automated machine learning system to detect
tweets related to drug abuse risk behavior in near real-time.
However, it is a challenging task to detect and classify tweets
mentioning drug abuse risk behaviors due to: (1) Sparsity of
drug abuse-related tweets among the 500 million daily tweets;
(2) The short and ungrammatical nature of tweets; and (3)

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Our strategy produced a balanced and reliable dataset with
3,102 positive and 3,677 negative tweets in total. We tested
and compared our boosted deep learning models with boosted
traditional and state-of-the-art machine learning approaches.

Our model achieved 86.53% accuracy, 88.6% recall, and an
86.63% F1-score using Monte Carlo Cross Validation.

IV. CONCLUSION
We have presented three key components of a drug abuse
tweet surveillance system: a large-scale data collection and
annotation component, our boosting deep learning model that
detects drug abuse tweets, and the geospatial and semantic
analytics component. Our deep learning classification model
achieved the state-of-the-art performance with a two-staged
tweet annotation method for labeling more tweets at a lower
cost without sacrificing quality. The semantic analysis of
identified positive drug abuse behaviors uncovers many drug
terms to be used for ontology refinement, and our geospatial
analysis allows hotspot identification.

Figure 3 Count of potential drug names and slang terms, grouped by
drug categories, in over 100,000 drug abuse-positive tweets.

Figures 1 and 2 show the top mentioned potential drug
names and slang terms in drug abuse-positive and negative
tweets, respectively. The word distributions are vastly
different between the two classes. When we further group
synonymous slang terms into drug categories and show them
in log-scale (Figure 3), we can see that our approach detects
many types of drugs and their slang terms. In fact, Twitter
users use slang terms more often than the clinical names.
For example: heroin: 134 (skunk: 180; thunder: 57; junk: 147;
etc.); cocaine: 129 (coke: 782; candy: 334; snow: 409; etc.)
Comparing with related works, our method allowed us to
identify terms in a much wider scope and is more
comprehensive. We are further analyzing the patterns that the
drug names and slang words are used in, to enrich a drug abuse
ontology, and even discover new and evolving slanguages
for drug terms.
Figure 4 shows the geographical distribution of over
100,000 positive tweets from January 2017 across the US. The
areas with biggest drug abuse indications are: R1: MidAtlantic and New England; R2: Great Lakes; R3: Pacific; R4:
