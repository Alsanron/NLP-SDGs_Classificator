Abstract
The rate of depression is growing at an alarming rate.
A study found that people are more likely to open up to
a talking computer than a human. The aim of this paper
is to motivate a person going through low phase of his life
and to avoid ill-effects of depression. We propose a chatbot
that can enable positivity boosting conversation with the
user. The chatbot will personalize its replies as per user
to keep the conversation engaging. It is made emotionally
supportive by training it over a motivating dialogue corpus. The corpus is extended with the users historical chat
data from social media platforms. Tensorflow framework
and high power GPU is required by server for training. The
advantage of such a system is that instead of reaching a
phase requiring a visit to a psychiatrist, an online free service will reach many people, will mediate ill-effects of depression and contribute to the betterment of society.

Introduction

A lot of research has been done to make machines identify human
emotions by using complex artificial intelligence systems. There are
different types of systems used for different purposes like making
decisions, robotics, expert systems, etc. The models are trained using deep learning techniques like recurrent neural network, convolutional neural network, attention network and so on. Some systems
combine various classification models using hybrid models. Nowadays, hybrid methods and adaptive methods are also adopted to
understand human natural language. Such systems can learn for
themselves over a period of time by accessing all the data available
online. They provide positive results for emotion recognition and a
human user can ask questions to these systems in the same way as
one would to another human[1].
Some of the currently available chat bots for assistance are Apple Siri, Google Allo, Microsoft Cortana, etc. These services serve
to user queries and provide useful answers but they use only Natural
Language Processing(NLP) and cannot react to emotional questions. Some of the chats bots available in market which provide
emotional assistance are Woebot, Pepper.ai, Wysa, Joy, Evei. In
this paper, an online chat bot called Bot - Autonomous Emotional
Support(BAES) is introduced which will help to uplift the mental
state of depressed people. An advantage of BAES over other chat
bots is that it will be open source and identify with users way of
replying over a period of time. BAES will match the input from
user with the data gathered about that user from various social
networking websites. As it is an adaptive chat bot, the replies will
get better as more data is collected. BAES can understand English
and Hindi-English languages which makes it easier for Indian public
to use.
Lately, many people are undergoing depression without them
realizing it. Any mental condition is still not considered as an illness
in various parts of the world and often goes unattended. People
do not even understand that they are going through depression

since it is somewhat of a taboo to talk about mental illness and so,
people end up committing suicide. Also, the cost of counseling from
experts like psychiatrists, psychologists is very high[2]. To provide
a cheap and effective way to treat this, open source chat bots need
to be encouraged. People might start feeling lonely and isolated,
and this is when they can easily access chat bot for comfort and
counseling when they have no other person to go to. Thus, we
have provided a solution which will tend to the mental state of
the user and which will assist each one personally depending on
the data of user. BAES will try to remind a depressed person of
his/her achievements, which have been shared on social media or
given directly to the bot, to pacify him/her and try to make him/her
feel better about himself/herself. This will lead to improved mental
health and mental satisfaction of the user and will provide a support
whenever needed.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes
the previous work that has been done in this particular domain.
Section 3 discusses about the methodology and approach proposed
in this paper to help people get over depression. Section 4 throws
a light on the setup required to build and use this application and
provides results of the partial work done. Section 5 gives an idea
of this bot with its partial implementation. Finally, the paper is
wrapped up with the benefits of BAES over other chat bots and its
future scope for actual implementation.

Literature Survey

Bayu Setiaji, Ferry Wahyu Wibowo have proposed in [1] that their
chatbot would match the input sentence from the speaker or user
with pattern that has existed on the knowledge database. Each
pattern is paired with the knowledge of chatbot which is taken
from various sources. When connecting chat application to the
database, it can miss in defining a sentence and how to respond
to it. So knowledge representation in the database tables and implementation of structured query language (SQL) in the patternmatching operation are very needed. Data which has been modeled on the pattern of the conversation would be tested using a
series of scenarios. The results of conversation with the chatbot

would be crosschecked with the basic pattern. A natural language
processing (NLP) gives capability to computer to allow communication to happen between user-to-computer or human-to-machine and
computer-to-computer or machine-to-machine using human natural
languages. There are three analyses to understand natural language
: parsing, semantic interpretation, and knowledge-based structures.
In [3], the authors have proposed an approach to machine translation based purely on neural networks showing promising results
compared to the existing approaches such as phrase- based statistical machine translation known as neural machine translation.
There is a major limitation in NMT in which the number of target words must be limited because the complexity of training the
model and using NMT model increases as the number of target
words increases. Sebastien Jean, Kyunghyun Cho, Roland Memisevic,and Yoshua Bengio introduced a method based on importance
sampling that enables us to use a huge target dataset without increasing training complexity.
The approach of a novel neural network model called RNN EncoderDecoder that consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN)
is proposed by Kyunghyun Cho et al. in [4]. One RNN encodes a
sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation, and
the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the model are trained together to
maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence when a
source sequence is given. The qualitative analysis shows that it can
capture the spoken input data and its regularities and explain the
quantitative improvements in the overall performance. The further
analysis of the model reveals that the RNN EncoderDecoder learns
a continuous space representation of a phrase that preserves both
the semantic and syntactic structure of the phrase.
The conversational service can provide personalized counseling
service to individuals head-to-head. It is important to resolve the
isolation of the patients who have a mental disorder such as depression and lethargy. One-to-one conversation can resolve the isolation
effectively. Personal dialogues can also operate efficiently when a
user needs urgent interventions. In the early study[5], Kyo-Joong
Oh et al. developed simple chat bot that provide interventions
about subsequent behavior change for young adults alcohol risk.
They give the interventions based on three item questionnaires

about drinking habits via alcohol consumption level and frequency
of drinking by internationally well-known as AUDIT-C. They proposed an application of counseling chatbot, which provides conversational service for mental health care based on emotion recognition
methods and the chat assistant platform.

Proposed Methodology

Chatbots tend to fail when encountered with an unknown statement. This can be solved by manually typing responses for all the
possible statements. However, this would make the database bulky
and its impossible to think of every possible statement. This gets
solved by tensorflow Seq2Seq model which tries to generate response
for every statement. The network architecture of tensorflow model
is a standard encoder/decoder with 3 LSTM layers (hidden size of
256) [6]. The network is trained using ADAM. The maximum sentence length is set to 10 words, but can be increased. This makes
generating response for unknown statements fast and easy. It is also
less bulky and faster than previous approach. However, the model
cannot be trained to fixate a response for certain statements. The
responses based on tensorflow are heavily dependent on the dataset
it is trained on. This enabled us to integrate a users chat history
data from his/her social platforms. It provides our chatbot a flavor
of the users personality and makes the responses more interesting
to the user.
Our approach has integrated both, tensorflow based responses
and database based responses through ChatterBot library [7]. This
enables our chatbot to be prepared for certain statements of a depressed person, remind user of his self-told achievements, deal with
out of context statements as well as map responses to users way of
chatting. The figure 1 depicts the architectural diagram of proposed
work.

Figure 1: Block Diagram of proposed work
As you can see in figure 1, the logic adapter does 2 things: (1)
Selects a known statement from database that most closely matches
to input statement, (2) Returns a known response to the selected
match and a confidence value based on the matching. The low
confidence filter has a set threshold of about 0.65 which decides to
output the response based on database or forward it to tensorflow.

Experimental Setup

Hardware requirements are minimal for user. However, hardware
requirements for server are higher end. Hardware Requirement
(Server): CPU: Intel i5 or better, RAM: 4 GB or better, OS: Windows 7 or better, VIDEO CARD: NVIDIA Graphics Card with
minimum 1 GB memory, FREE DISK SPACE: 3 GB.
Software Requirement for user would involve only a browser but
the requirements for server are mentioned as follows: Python 3.5.2,
CUDA Toolkit 8.0, Chrome Webdriver, PhantomJS.
Following libraries in python: setuptools, requests, django debug toolbar, Django, pack-aging, selenium, ChatterBot, django
braces, beautifulsoup4, django model utils, uvloop, websockets,
wheel, tensorflow, tensorflow-gpu, numpy, nltk, tqd.
With the above requirements, the current setup starts with user
being navigated to django local server URL. The homepage contains

a login screen and if its first time login then user is asked if he/she
wants to use his/her social media chat history data for BAES. If
provided, the raw chat data is converted to sequence of question
and answer format. Currently, whatsapp & facebook chat history
data is used.

Implementation

The server starts learning with the inclusion of users chat data in
its existing base dataset as shown in figure 2

Figure 2: Training Snapshot
It takes 3-4 hours to achieve a considerable learning growth with
Tensorflow Seq2Seq Model parameters as shown in figure 3 Once the
training is complete, the model is ready for testing. However, this
model is utilized to generate a response only when the statement
provided by the user is unknown. If a known statement is provided
as per the statement response documents stored in MongoDB, then
the response is fetched. A sample of MongoDB document stored is
shown in figure 4.
This database is indexed on text key for faster searching of
database. The statement provided and texts stored in database

is compared using levenshtein distance algorithm. Levenshtein distance (LD) is a measure of the similarity between two strings, which
we will refer to as the source string (s) and the target string (t) [8].

The distance is the number of deletions, insertions, or substitutions required to transform s into t. A low confidence threshold
is set to decide whether a statement is known or unknown. An
un-known statement is processed by Tensorflow model to generate
a response. The implementation results can be seen in figure 5.
An obvious statement containing depressed or similar words is responded with responses from database. However, an unprecedented
statement is replied by tensorflow model such as that in regional
language of user.

Benefits

With technological advancements, depression rates are increasing at
a faster pace. Depression is not accepted as a normal disease over
the world. According to World Health Organization, 121 million
people are affected by depression worldwide. Developed countries
like US top this list[9]. In India, over 5 crore people are suffering from depression whereas the count of psychiatrists in India is
terrible. It is almost half of the number which should be actually
present[10]. According to a survey, humans are more likely to open
up before machines rather than humans. With our proposed idea,
we are trying to create a virtual model of psychiatrist. We are developing a chatbot system which will act as a minimal psychiatrist
reaching out to an upset person.
The benefits of this system include: a lonely person having a
smart phone can reach out and share their emotional state, anytime

& anywhere, with the bot. It will be free of cost which will attract
anyone to at least give it a try. The chat bot wont judge a person
on the basis of his failures. A chat bot can make it easy for a person
to lift a weight off his/her heart. The chat bot will have an implicit
NDA and keep the chat log in database. It will help to remind a
person for his/her own worth by revisiting some of the achievements
of the user. It would be able to talk like the user based on provided
chat history of user which would make it friendly & interesting.

Conclusion

Now-a-days chat bots are looked at from an assisting approach.
This makes them unable to establish any friendly connection with
the user. Also, purely AI chat bots do not have set responses for
set statements. Our approach will provide a response based on
users way of chatting as well as based on positively prepared responses. A study introduced a personalization framework using
long-term memory[11]. Another study used word2vec to generate
natural sounding phrases[12]. This will help establish a friendly
connection with the user as well as provide positive thoughts to
user. If the user keeps giving negative response over time, the chat
bot can have a functionality to alert the users close ones.
