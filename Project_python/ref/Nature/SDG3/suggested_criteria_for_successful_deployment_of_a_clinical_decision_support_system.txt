AbstractThree criteria are suggested to help design a Clinical
Decision Support System (CDSS) that would have a better chance
of being successfully deployed in a clinical environment. These
criteria have been successfully applied to a CDSS designed to
estimate outcomes for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)
patients. The CDSS was deployed in a pilot study at the
Childrens Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO)s NICU. The
results of the study showed that the accuracy was deemed
acceptable by the physicians and the CDSS would meet their
expectations when ready for deployment in a clinical
environment.

INTRODUCTION

Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been used
for several decades and have the potential to significantly
improve patient care and patient safety [1]. Despite this
potential, their successful deployment has been limited and in
some cases has resulted in conflict between physicians and
hospital administrators [2]. When developing a new CDSS,
several factors need to be considered to increase the likelihood
that it will be integrated into health care delivery. These factors
need to be applied at all stages of the development life cycle of
the CDSS.
II.

METHOD

A literature survey was conducted to determine the most
important factors affecting the successful deployment of a
CDSS. We discuss how these factors were applied to the
development of a CDSS in the neonatal intensive care unit
(NICU) at the Childrens Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO).
This particular CDSS is intended to estimate a number of
important clinical outcomes such as mortality, and predict
resource utilisation such as expected duration of concentrated
nursing care and duration of artificial ventilation. This
development is described as a case study in the latter part of the
article.
The criteria for a successful deployment of a CDSS can be
divided into three main areas: (i) The data entry and the

978-1-4244-6290-2/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE

decision algorithms; (ii) the human-computer interaction,
including the data acquisition, and the manner in which
information is requested from the system; (iii) the output of
the CDSS, including the format and type of information
supplied.
A. Suggested criteria for successful deployment of a CDSS
(i) Input to the CDSS
The data and information entry into the CDSS is one of the
leading causes of failed CDSSs [2, 3]. It is important that a
system require the least amount of physician time and be able
to update itself [4].
Some systems require users to enter patient data manually,
which is very time consuming and disruptive to the delivery of
patient care. Manual data entry can be minimized by
integrating the CDSS with the hospital information system and
electronic health records. A successful CDSS will be able to
extract data with limited user interaction. Minimizing the time
physicians spend entering data manually will lead to greater
satisfaction with the system they are using and will help to
ensure time is not being taken from the provision of patient
care. Alternatively, if manual data entry is required, system
implementation will be more successful if physicians are not
expected to input this data. [5].
Another major issue is keeping the CDSS decision
algorithm up to date. Since patient management changes from
time to time, the CDSS can easily become obsolete. An issue
that has been encountered in the past is that CDSSs are often
created with soft funding. When the funding runs out, keeping
the system up to date is a major challenge, so it is critical that
systems be designed to have automated updating features. One
way to do this is to have the CDSS retrain itself periodically
and automatically [5, 6].
(ii)

Human-Computer Interaction

The human-computer interaction is a critical component of
a successful CDSS; access to the system should be easy while
being secure. Clinicians are busy and have many diverse tasks
to perform. According to Bates et. al, speed is of utmost

importance for physicians, therefore, the decision support
system should be designed to use the least amount of physician
time possible; this includes time to logon to the system and
time to acquire the information desired [5]. It is known that the
time a CDSS adds to a patient consultation affects a physicians
intention to use it. In a study of an Internet health application
which aimed to help physicians determine if a patient requires a
referral to a secondary care center, 70 % of doctors intended to
use the system if it lengthened patient consultations by 2
minutes compared to only 23 % if the time added was 5
minutes [7].
Moreover, it is more convenient for physicians if the
information can be obtained from a mobile CDSS, or one with
many terminals, rather than from a single terminal that may be
located far away [5]. Another important aspect of the humancomputer interaction is the user-interface. The CDSS must be
user-friendly, intuitive and provide easy access to information.
It has been shown that a CDSS interface works best using a
single screen format [4].
(iii) Output
A CDSS should be of clinical value to physicians, improve
the quality of care and decrease costs of health care delivery.
The CDSS must fit into the physicians workflow and provide
them with useful information. The system output format and
type are dependent on what physicians need. Each clinician has
different work habits and thus may have different requirements
for this function. This makes the development of an effective
CDSS more complicated, but this is important for a successful
deployment. The manner in which the information is provided
should be simple and effective [4], [5].
To achieve the goal of deployment with physicians using
the system as part of their workflow, designers of CDSSs must
work closely with the users at every step. Without this close
partnership, it is more likely that a new system will not be used
by physicians. Usability testing is also essential at every critical
stage of development. Desirable attributes of CDSSs include
smart information and smart alerts. When it comes to clinical
decision alerts, there needs to be a balance between too many
and too few. Without a sufficient number of alerts, it may be
difficult to achieve the clinical and economic benefit of having
the CDSS. However, too many alerts cause interruptions to
physicians, which is undesirable especially if the alerts have a
low specificity (high rate of false alarms). Some doctors prefer
more alerts while others only desire to be notified for the most
critical ones. This again emphasizes the need for close work
with users during development [7].
Many of the failures of early CDSSs were due to the fact
that the user had to filter the information and discard erroneous
or useless information. This required a lot of user time and the
user had to actively interact with the system rather than just be
a passive recipient of the output [5], [7]. It is important that the
CDSS be able to anticipate the need for information and deliver
it in real time without clinicians needing to explicitly ask for it
[7].

A CASE STUDY: A CDSS FOR NEONATAL INTENSIVE
CARE

Premature births are defined as those occurring at less than
37 weeks of gestation. These newborn infants frequently have
serious health problems and make up 75% of the population in
neonatal intensive care units [8]. The incidence of premature
births has increased in the past 20 years, reaching 7.7% in 2003
[9]. This is largely attributed to the rise of in-vitro fertilization
which often results in multiple births, obstetrical interventions,
higher registration of extremely early-gestation births, ultrasound based estimates of gestational age, and the sophistication
of technology in general. However, the incidence of morbidity
in these survivors has not been decreasing, and a trend towards
increasingly aggressive intensive care is cited as the reason for
the increased number of survivors.
Our research group has developed a CDSS that estimates
mortality, common complications such as bronchopulmonary
Dysplasia (BPD) which is a chronic lung disorder; severe
Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH, grade III or IV, that is
bleeding in the brain associated with long-term disability;
Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC), which is a serious intestinal
illness; and resource utilisation outcomes such as length of stay
and duration of artificial ventilation. The project was conducted
with CHEO neonatologists, followed by a pilot test in the
NICU [10], [11].
We are developing a Clinical Data Repository (CDR) that
automatically collects data from NICU patients in real time
and stores the data in a manner that can be easily retrieved for
analysis; the data consists of vital signs from bedside monitors,
ventilators, pulse oximeters, and laboratory results [12], [13].
The next step will be to train our CDSS to estimate outcomes
using real time data. This will allow warnings and alerts to be
generated for situations that need attention from physicians and
caregivers.
Our CDSS is a feedforward backpropagation artificial
neural network with the weight-elimination algorithm, and
hyperbolic tangent transfer function; it has one hidden layer
with an optimal number of nodes. ANNs have the potential to
model complex interactions between variables and the
advantage over conventional statistics is that they can be
trained to predict outcomes on any database, with multiple
input parameters and possible outcomes [14]. They can
estimate outcomes for a single patient, whereas statistical tools
typically estimate outcomes for a group of patients. First
designed in 1993 using Matlabs Neural Ware tool, we have
programmed many features into our ANN; for example, when
one of the outcomes has a low prevalence (less than 15 % of
the total population being studied), we resample from this
population randomly, using one third of the database, until we
reach an artificial prevalence of 20% to train the ANN [15]. We
test the ANN with the true a priori distribution from another
third of patient cases unseen previously. This optimizes the
sensitivity (true positive cases such as predicting death) and
decreases the specificity slightly (estimation of patients who
survive). The third dataset is created by sampling ten times
from the unseen cases. We also calculate the weights at the

input nodes of the ANN at optimal performance in order to
identify variables which have the most impact on estimating
the particular outcome of interest. The entire process of finding
the optimum performance and best ANN structure (number of
hidden nodes) has been automated; our computers
automatically adjust nine parameters that maximise the correct
classification for the various outcomes of interest [16].
The database used in this work was collected by the
Canadian Neonatal Network (CNN), a group of multidisciplinary Canadian researchers focusing on neonatal and
perinatal care. Data collected by the CNN between January
1996 and October 1997 contains information from 17 NICUs,
which represents 75% of all tertiary-level beds in Canada [17].
The database contains 20,488 admissions during the 22 month
period, for which data was collected on day 1 (admission), day
3, 14 and 28 (or discharge). Although not recently collected,
the data has been revalidated in recent publications [18].
IV.

RESULTS

The neonatal CDSS system under development by our
research group meets the requirements outlined by the three
criteria for a successful CDSS. The first condition states that
data input should require the least amount of physician time
possible and that the system should be self updating to ensure
the decision algorithm does not become out of date. The next
version of our neonatal CDSS will use data automatically
collected from patient monitors and ventilators, and
automatically access laboratory and imaging tests; this will
significantly decrease the time to input data into the CDSS. The
majority of the data will be collected automatically in real time
without manual input; however some manual input will still be
required such as patient name, bed location, patient weight,
gestational age, and Apgar 5 results. This data can be entered
by the nurses or ward clerks. Additionally, we will ensure that
the CDSS does not become obsolete by using an ANN that is
able to self-train with new data being acquired.
The second condition regarding human-computer
interaction requires that the user-interface be simple and
provide quick access to data. Our CDSS interface was designed
to be simple, and easy to use, with minimal training. The CDSS
is easy to navigate and users are able to get important
information in a timely manner.
For the third condition, regarding output format, we are
working closely with the physicians to determine the best way
to present the information they require. One improvement we
made was the presentation of a risk level (low, medium, or
high) of the outcome of interest, rather than presenting
physicians with a percentage number, as was the case with our
first model.
The first prototype of the neonatal CDSS was tested on 60
patient cases at the CHEO NICU that had a mortality rate of
18.33%. The CDSS presented results as high, moderate, and
low risk categories as requested by the neonatologists. Table 1
shows the results of the CDSSs ability to predict. Note that
this system used admission data collected within 12 hours after

the birth of the infant (CNN database) and was not yet
connected to real time data collection which is currently under
development. We expect these initial results to be improved
with the acquisition of data in real time.

From Table 1, it can be seen that the majority of mortalities
were classified by our CDSS as moderate risk (46%), and 63 %
of the true mortality cases were labeled either as high or
moderate risk. The vast majority of survivors were classified as
low risk (88%).
The pilot study also included a short usability test with the
neonatologists who used the system. The results showed that
the system was easy to use, provided information in a timely
manner, was thought to be useful. There was a high interest in
the further development and deployment of the system among
the participating neonatologists [10], [11].
V.

CONCLUSION

In this work, we suggested criteria to enhance the
probability that a CDSS will be deployed and used by health
care personnel. In applying these criteria to the design of a
CDSS for NICU patients, we conclude that they proved to be
useful as our physician partners are very interested in the
development and potential deployment of the system at the
CHEO NICU in Ottawa and plan to use it when it is ready for a
clinical environment. Quoting our physician partner at CHEO:
This work is so important and is the way that all of medicine
(adult and pediatric) is heading.  Dr. Erika Bariciak,
Neonatologist.
In our future work we will continue to add features to our
CDSS that will help with the integration of this tool into the
real clinical environment according to the three criteria for
successful deployment. Work will be done to ensure that the
CDSS will train itself periodically, especially when several
new patient cases are added to the database. We will also be
focusing on automating as much of the data collection, retrieval
and analysis as possible.
