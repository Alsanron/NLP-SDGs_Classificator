Abstract
The reduction of environmental pollution and the conservation and recycling of natural resources are signicant social and
environmental concerns. As valuable means for pollution control, minimization and mitigation remain attractive approaches.
However, interactive, dynamic and uncertain features are associated with these processes, resulting in difculties in their
management and control. Articial intelligence (AI) is an effective approach for tackling these complexities. In this study, the recent
advancements of AI-based technologies for management and control of pollution minimization and mitigation processes are
examined. Literature relevant to the area of application of AI to control and management of pollution minimization and mitigation
processes is investigated. Especially, technologies of expert systems, fuzzy logic, and neural networks, which emerge as the most
frequently employed approaches for realizing process control, are highlighted. The results not only provide an overview of the
updated progress in the study eld but also, more importantly, reveal perspectives of research for more effective environmental
process control through the AI-aided measures. Several demanding areas for enhanced research efforts are discussed, including
issues of data availability and reliability, methodology validity, and system complexity.

1. Introduction
Most of environmental engineering problems are
related to a number of factors with multi-source,
multi-layer, multi-stage, and multi-objective characteristics. Effective reection of these complexities is
currently an important issue emphasized by many
public-sector decision-makers and private industries
for sound management and control of pollution minimization and mitigation processes. Previously, many
modeling tools have been developed for simulating
processes in water/wastewater treatment plants, solid
waste incinerators and air pollution control facilities.
However, the uncertain, interactive and dynamic features of these processes often lead to difculties in
obtaining desired system performance. Integrated consideration that incorporates a number of uncertain and
dynamic components in the study systems within a

general framework rather than examining them in
isolation is needed for potential improvement (Rynk,
1992).
Articial intelligence (AI) is an effective approach for
tackling the above complexities. For example, the
complicated interrelationships among a number of
system factors and activities can be explicated through
the process of knowledge acquisition. Also, the gap
between result generated from detailed modeling efforts
and applicability of that result to a practical situation
can be lled by building an automated system, allowing
incorporation of implicit, and often qualitative considerations deemed crucial by engineers and/or operators. A knowledge-based system can perform trade-off
analysis to compare the costs/benets of economic
versus environmental concerns. Besides, the modeling
result usually does not satisfactorily address specic
issues concerning impacts of a control action. An
automated system can investigate the key variables in
greater detail and provide more insight into the specic
implications of a generalized solution. For effective realtime control, an expert system can provide more insight

76

into the specic implications of a generalized solution
and can complement or rene a simulation program
(Liang, 2001).
Recently, some applications of AI to real-time control
of pollution minimization and mitigation processes have
been reported. They demonstrate an emerging area for
more extensive studies. The objective of this paper is to
examine the recent advancements of AI-based technologies for management and control of pollution minimization and mitigation processes. Literature relevant
to the area of application of AI to control and
management of pollution minimization and mitigation
processes will be investigated. Especially, technologies of
expert systems, fuzzy logic, and neural networks, which
emerge as the most frequently employed approaches
underlying AI for realizing process control, will be
highlighted.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides
an overview of the related technologies for environmental process control. This is followed by a review of
works on the development of expert systems and
decision support systems that are critical to process
control. Section 4 describes neural networks and their
applications to the area of pollution minimization and
mitigation; and Section 5 presents works that adopt a
hybrid approach to system development and integrate
expert systems, neural networks, and fuzzy logic.
Section 6 concludes this review study.

2. Overview of AI-based technologies for environmental
process control
Application of AI for controlling an environmental
process involves a number of subprocesses that need to
be managed or automated. For example, in a pollution
mitigationplant environment, there are several levels at
which to address the problem of management and
control. At the lowest level, there are instruments that
monitor, sense, and manipulate process variables. The
instruments are often connected to a control structure
that is capable of implementing a control law. The next
level is the supervisory host computer that is usually
connected to some control hardware by network
communications. The supervisory host computer maintains the applications that are one level above the
primary control functions such as the database. The
supervisory host computer may in turn be connected to
a plant-wide and then the corporate-wide computer
systems (Rynk, 1992).
In the most general terms, AI is the use of computers
to emulate the reasoning and decision-making processes
of humans (Walker, 1993). There are many opportunities for applying AI and expert systems into process
control and management. These opportunities are most
often realized by implementing functionality on the

supervisory host computer, and can include applications
such as computer-aided instruction and training, maintenance, conguration, plant planning and optimization, scheduling, alarm management, and operator
decision support (Stock, 1989). Most studies on
application of AI to the process industries involve the
technologies of expert systems, fuzzy logic, and neural
networks.
Expert systems can emulate human problem solving
by representing the expertise in its knowledge base. An
expert system usually consists of three major components: a knowledge base, an inference engine, and a
working memory. The knowledge base contains facts
and heuristics associated with the application domain.
The inference engine searches the knowledge base for
applicable rules, and applies the rules for solving the
problem. The working memory is the repository to store
the new information generated as the inference engine
searches and selects rules. In addition to the three
components, an expert system typically contains other
components such as a user interface and explanation
facility.
Fuzzy logic has emerged as an alternative to classical
or binary valued logic in application areas ranging from
industrial process control to consumer products to
aerospace and bioengineering (Langari and Yen,
1995). The role that fuzzy logic plays in the diverse
applications is to bridge the gap between symbolic
processing and numerical computation in shaping a
suitable rule-based and linguistic control strategy. In
bridging the gap, fuzzy logic has expanded the domain
of application of control engineering to those that have
traditionally fallen outside its realm if a strictly binary
valued logic has been applied. Hence, fuzzy logic forms
the basis for implementation of control strategies in the
wide sense to enable decision-making or supervisory
control. The major distinctions between fuzzy logic
and expert systems are the use of linguistic rather
than numeric variables, and the use of fuzzy conditional
statements rather than exact expressions. Rules that
incorporate linguistic and inexact data can be manipulated as a useful tool for reasoning about difcult
process management and control situations (Walker,
1993).
Neural networks are a computational paradigm
modeled on the human brain. The three important
similarities to the brains capabilities are the ability to
lter out essential data from a larger set of data
containing irrelevant information, the ability to learn
from experience, and the ability to generalize from
previous experience to predict new outcomes (Walker,
1993). An articial neural network (ANN) model is
made of input and output connections, which simulates
the human mental processes. This paradigm has become
increasingly popular for two main reasons. Neural
networks are inherently parallel machines. They can be

C.W. Chan, G.H. Huang / Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 16 (2003) 7590

manufactured directly in VLSI hardware and provide
the potential for relatively inexpensive massive parallelism and faster problem-solving capabilities. Neural
networks also have the ability to learn or to adapt to
different tasks by selection of numerical weights
(Montana, 1995).
In terms of application to the process industries, both
expert systems and fuzzy logic attempt to duplicate the
reasoning process of one and several experts in a
particular eld, while neural networks try to emulate
organization of the human brain and its reasoning
mechanism. Expert systems can make a signicant
contribution to processes where knowledge can be
expressed linguistically in a set of ifthen rules that
are denable. Fuzzy logic is applied in the process
industries to control a process that is intrinsically nonlinear and multi-variabled, while neural networks are
useful for making sense out of data. Whenever knowledge is felt to be lacking, a neural network can be
applied to extract from the data the relationships that
are inherent (Rynk, 1992).

3. Expert systems
Complexities in pollution minimization and mitigation processes pose particular challenges in control, as
they are non-linear, time varying, and often difcult to
model. Alternative approaches to traditional control
methods have yielded promising results, and expert
system is one of these alternatives. Applications of
expert systems to diverse elds have been well documented (Durkin, 2002). The predominance of medical
expert systems gave way to wider adoption of this
technology in the business and industrial sectors in the
1990s. A 1986 survey conducted by Waterman (1986)
showed that 30% of the applications of expert system
technology were in the eld of medicine. By the 1990s,
medical applications of expert systems decreased to
account for only 10%, while business and industrial
applications grew to account for 60% of the applications. Applications of expert systems to the environmental sector accounted for 5% of all the applications
(Durkin, 2002).
Chowdhury and Canter (1998) discussed expert
systems in general and the process of developing the
systems. In the paper, they outlined 39 expert systems
developed for the domain of ground water management,
and discussed in detail nine among them: (i) The RPI
Site Assessment System was developed for inactive
hazardous waste site investigations using CPS5 and the
CLISP language; it can be used to determine Hazard
Ranking System (HRS) scores for site-based soil
permeability levels and risk-based scores for the ground
water ow direction. (ii) The DEMOTOX Expert
System assesses the potential risk that organic chemicals

77

pose for ground water contamination; the risk is
calculated based on a mobility and degradation index
(MDI), and a condence adjusted MDI for ranking. (iii)
The Hazardous Wastes and Management Expert System
assisted site planners, managers, and other decisionmakers in determining hazardous waste site cleanup
procedures; the system contains ve interactive modules:
a knowledge base of facts and rules, an environmental
and site description module, an inference module, a data
bank module, and a risk/decision analysis module. (iv)
The Defense Priority Model (DPM) evaluates the
relative risk of hazardous waste sites to human health
and the environment based on the Hazard Assessment
Rating Methodology. (v) The Wellhead Area Source
Evaluation System (WASES) aids users in prioritizing
potential or actual sources of ground water contamination in wellhead protection areas; the system has a
hierarchical structure with three layers: the rst level
considers four general factors, the second level adds
health effects, and the third level focuses on evaluating
the likelihood of contamination reaching a specic well.
(vi) The Expert System for Pesticide Regulatory
Evaluations and Simulations (EXPRES) assesses the
potential risk that pesticides pose for ground water; the
system uses three solute transport models to determine
pesticide leaching and the consequences of subsurface
transport processes. (vii) The Environmental Sampling
Expert System (ESES) aims to help users increase the
accuracy, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness of eld
sampling, chemical analyses, and analytical data validation within the Superfund program; the system has two
versions: ESES-SM supports designing a sampling plan
for determining the extent of metal pollution in soil, and
ESES-GW helps the user to decide on the appropriate
ground water sampling pumps and devices. (viii) The
Cost of Remedial Action Model (CORA) provides
remediation recommendations and determines remedial
action costs. The system contains four knowledge bases
and is capable of handling uncertainty. (ix) The SEPIC
Expert System uses location, eld data, size calculations
and user type as primary variables to evaluate permit
applications, and makes a recommendation on whether
a permit for private sewage facilities should be issued.
In (Rynk, 1992), capability of an expert system to help
control and manage a composting process was explored.
An expert system-assisted computer control program
was developed for an aerated static pile composting
system, assuming a process control system with multiple
sensors and control devices. The control program
developed for this system integrates two expert system
programs with a conventional data acquisition system
(DAS) and several basic computer programs. The DAS
performs the essential monitoring and control functions.
The expert systems and other programs provide
supporting information. The rst expert system evaluates the composting raw materials and initial conditions.

78

C.W. Chan, G.H. Huang / Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 16 (2003) 7590

It assists the operator in setting control parameters for
the DAS and established criteria for evaluating process
data. The second expert system assesses the status of the
process from the data returned by the DAS. It does this
at 3-h intervals and more thoroughly at 24-h intervals. It
produces a report which summarizes the process status
and lists any potential or apparent problems. At the 24h evaluation stage, it automatically adjusts control
parameters as necessary.
The basic programs perform tasks which are cumbersome for the expert system such as obtaining numerical
information, performing calculations, and accessing
data les. The control program was tested by supplying
it with process data from the computer keyboard and
from an electronic instrument panel, which simulates the
sensors of the control system. The data were intended to
produce predictable results, which could be compared to
the control programs results. In nearly all cases, the
control program produces results consistent with those
expected. Its performance was satisfactory in that all
components of the system were activated properly and
information was successfully transferred among the
programs. Based on the performance and capability of
the control program, it was indicated that expert
systems could potentially play a benecial role in
control systems for composting processes. Their utility
for this purpose depends on the specic needs of each
composting facility. Large facilities with inexperienced
staff and a reliance on a high level of technology are
most likely to benet from an expert system.
Betts (1998) described an Expert Process Advisory
System (EPAS), which is an advisory system that
supports designers in pollution prevention by informing
them about environmental ramications of their designs. The EPAS system ranks the alternative designs
based on how they rate on the ve factors of technical
adequacy, health and safety, environmental ramications, regulatory requirements, and cost. The system
consists of information on the environmental, regulatory, health and safety, and cost factors of a design. The
EPAS improved upon the software packages available
at Boeing, which provided users with primarily descriptive information about a products potential environmental impacts. The EPAS, on the other hand, provided
more analytical solutions.
Chen et al. (1999) described a decision support system
that assists decision-makers in determining optimal
daily loads of various pollutants in order to satisfy
water quality requirements in a water basin. There can
be multiple water quality limited sections (WQLS) in a
river basin. For each section from the most upstream to
the most downstream, the total maximum daily loads
(TMDLs) need to be calculated. There can be many
combinations of point source and non-point source
loads that can meet the water quality criteria, and the
many feasible solutions provide an opportunity for the

stakeholders to determine the optimal TMDLs. The
decision support system for total maximum daily load
can calculate the total maximum daily loads of various
pollutants for the WQLS. The system includes a
watershed simulation model, a database, a consensusbuilding module, and a TMDL module that provides a
worksheet for the calculations. The system can generate
multiple combinations of point-source and non-pointsource allocations to meet the water quality criteria for
the intended uses of the WQLS. Based on the various
possible solutions suggested by the system, the regulatory agency and local stakeholders can negotiate an
option most agreeable to all parties.
Jankowski and ZumBrunnen (1993) presented a
modeling support system (MSS) for simulation of water
quality. The objective of the system is to provide
modeling support to the user in deriving and simulating
a water quality model to predict changes in water
quality for a given aquatic system. The MSS provides a
single software environment for modeling, and is
composed of three parts: the knowledge base, the model
base and the simulation engine. It is implemented
through representation and manipulation of modeling
constructs, called atomic models, which describe the
dynamic behavior of structural components of an
aquatic system. A knowledge representation scheme
called the system entity structure (SES) is employed to
express three relationships. The rst relationship is that
of decomposition. That is, how the system is hierarchically decomposed into components. The second relationship is that of taxonomy, that is, how admissible
variants of the components can be classied. The third
relationship is that of coupling, that is, how these
components can be linked to reconstitute the original
system.
The MSS for simulation of water quality consists of
two kinds of knowledge stored in the knowledge base:
structural modeling knowledge and procedural modeling knowledge. The model base includes the atomic
models and coupled models. The simulation engine for
the MSS functions as follows. A user initiates the model
simulation by sending a message to the coordinator,
which triggers the simulation. The coordinator sends a
message to the simulation controller, generator, and
coupled models and their components or atomic models.
The input values are stored in a le in the generator and
can represent, for example, various conditions of water
quality. The input values are sequentially transmitted
from the coordinator through the input/output ports to
the coupled model. The outputs are sent from the
coupled model to the co-ordinator, which simultaneously transmits them to a log-le as well as sends a
message to the simulation controller to update the
simulation clock. The MSS is built on the SES, which
serves as a generative framework for model representation, retrieval, and manipulation. A modeler provides

C.W. Chan, G.H. Huang / Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 16 (2003) 7590

the system with information regarding the specic
problems of the site such as physical and biochemical
aspects of the aquatic system. The information is
matched with the production rules in the rule base,
and recommendations about the proper selection of
entities from the entity structure tree are generated. The
modeler uses these recommendations during pruning of
the entity structure tree. The basic structural elements or
atomic models are the primitives. When the retrieved
atomic models are linked into a model instance, it is
called a coupling process. A coupled model is subsequently simulated after initialization of the input data.
Kao and Liebman (1991) described the use of a
computer-aided system to support decision-making in
groundwater resources management (GRM), which
involves multiple objectives to (i) allocate ground-water
resources among competing water demands, (ii) control
ground-water quality, (iii) prevent undesirable overdraft
of the ground-water basin, (iv) analyze the impact of
hydraulic and other characteristics of ground water, and
(v) maximize the benets of the available resources. Due
to the complexity of the problem, a single-objective
approach is insufcient to address the inter-relationships
among these issues, and a multi-criteria technique is
adopted. To support this difcult decision-making
process, the decision support system makes use of
several mathematical techniques such as a nite-element
method for ground-water simulation modeling, linear
programming, multi-criteria optimization, and a modeling-to-generate-alternatives (MGA) approach for generating potential alternatives. In addition, the system
includes a modeling language to represent the mathematical models in a human-understandable form, and a
graphic interface that can support presentation of
comparisons among the different solution options.
Patry and Barnett (1992) presented an integrated
modeling system for water resource management. The
principal component of the integrated system is the
General Purpose Simulator (GPS), which is a comprehensive software package for simulation, analysis and
control of wastewater treatment plants. The software
has been applied to several large-scale wastewater
treatment plants in North America and elsewhere. The
other components in the integrated modeling system
include a knowledge-based expert system that has been
implemented as a model-based reasoning system complemented with object-oriented programming. The
knowledge-based expert system includes a model that
describes effects propagating among objects representing system components to establish causal chains. The
linguistic model also has the advantage of being able to
represent incomplete and qualitative knowledge. ANN
are also considered in the paper and they were found to
be useful for real-time control because of their adaptive
characteristics. Each of these techniques in isolation
may not be sufcient for making the system robust.

79

However, working together as components of an
integrated system, they can combine to make an
effective system for operational control of wastewater
treatment.
Gilbert (1999) discussed how an organization should
tackle the task of selecting and implementing an
environmental management information system. The
paper indicated that environment, health and safety
management is a natural candidate for automation
because of the extensive documentation needed to
demonstrate compliance. However, there are substantial
challenges in successfully implementing such a system.
Therefore, an organization needs to carefully evaluate
the situation before deciding to embark on a project on
developing an environmental management information
system (EMIS). The paper suggested that an organization needs to ask the three basic questions: (1) What is
an EMIS. (2) Why implement such a system. (3) How to
select and implement a system. The last question can be
further rened into ten considerations: (i) What are the
overall objectives of the organization? (ii) How ready is
the organization? (iii) What type of high-level functionality is desired? (iv) Will the EMIS be integrated or
interfaced with other systems? (v) Who is the user
community and what are their specic needs? (vi) What
are the organizations technical requirements? (vii) How
much customization is needed to achieve project goals?
(viii) What is the desired timing of the project? (ix) What
are the resources needed to implement the system? (x)
What is the justication for the system? These issues
were raised in the paper to caution organizations on the
need for careful assessment on whether an EMIS is
necessary and right for them.

4. Neural networks
A number of researchers have been working on
modeling of various environmental processes for supporting further process control studies. A model is a
useful engineering tool if it is able to predict reaction
conditions and rates (Steven, 1998). Simplifying assumptions associated with the modeling efforts may lead to
loss of relevant information and thus affect the
simulation accuracy. Techniques of neural networks
are alternatives for mitigating such deciencies.
Neural computing is one of the fastest growing areas
of AI. There are two key differences between neural
computers and digital computers. First, neural networks
are inherently parallel machines and as a result they can
solve problems much faster than a serial digital
computer. Secondly, many neural nets have the ability
to learn. The most frequently used algorithm for
neural networks is back propagation. According to Bhat
and McAvoy (1990), back propagation is an example of
a mapping neural net that develops an approximation to

80

C.W. Chan, G.H. Huang / Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 16 (2003) 7590

the function y  f x from sample x; y pairs. Back
propagation is distinctive because of its ability to
identify non-linear relationships and utilize parallel
processing. This algorithm has been applied to a wide
variety of practical problems and has been proven
successful in its ability to model non-linear relationships. The traditional models are equivalent to twolayered linear back-propagation networks, and as such,
they are more limited in their ability than the complete
back-propagation algorithm. Sometimes a momentum
term is adapted to a modied gradient rule so that
oscillation is avoided in the convergence process (Reich
et al., 1999). Applications of back-propagation neural
network (BPNN) can be found in Bhat and McAvoy
(1990), De Veaux et al. (1999), Melas et al. (2000), and
Reich et al. (1999).
Kavchak and Budman (1999) used another type of
neural networks called radial basis function. The
accuracy of a model is strongly affected by the choice
of the basis function dilation. The paper presents two
algorithms. The rst one allows the network to adapt to
dilation. Because the dilation enters into reconstruction
of the function in a non-linear fashion, a Lyapunov
stability proof requires the imposition of hard constraints on the adapted parameters. For a function with
a known optimal dilation, convergence was demonstrated, but the actual speed of dilation adaptation was
necessarily slow. Since the use of a single dilation may
not be optimal for any given function, the second
algorithm with a different strategy was proposed. It uses
a multi-resolution neural network representation. This
structure uses a collection of wavelets of different
dilations, which allows the estimator to account for
multiple dominant frequencies in the function being
estimated. Two sets of adaptation laws were proposed
for this multi-resolution network, for which stability is
better guaranteed. The rst bases the adaptation of the
multi-resolution network coefcients on a separate error
for each layer of the network, and the second adapts by
means of an overall prediction error. The latter
approach has the advantage that the Lyapunov stability
proof does not require imposition of hard constraints on
the coefcients. However, using the overall error
also slows down the adaptation process as compared
to the adaptation process based on the error at each
layer.
The neural networks that involve back propagation,
recurrent or radial basis functions often result in long
training time, local minima and lack of self-tuning
ability in on-line applications. Due to these reasons, Ye
et al. (1998) adopted a BayesianGaussian neural
network (BGNN) for predicting dynamic behavior of
a non-linear single-input single-output system and for
predicting the static performance and dynamic behavior
of circulating uidized bed boilers. A comparison of the
performance of BayesianGaussian BGNN versus

BPNN in terms of both the static performance and
dynamic behavior predictions of the two circulating
uidized bed (CFB) boilers is given in the paper. On the
positive side, BGNN gives reasonably good predictions
and takes less training time than the BPNN. On the
negative side, BGNN requires longer execution time
than the BPNN does, possibly due to the large topology
of BGNN. One disadvantage of BGNN is that problems
can occur when the training data set is large, because
this network stores all the training data into its topology
from the beginning. By contrast, the BPNNs compress
the training data set into the connection weights and
thresholds. When new training data are introduced, the
topology of the BGNN does not grow because of its selftuning ability. On the other hand, when new samples are
available to retrain the BPNNs, they must be carefully
screened to select the ones that contain innovative
information. If a large amount of new samples containing little innovative information were used in retraining,
the new samples may overwhelm the existing ones that
are smaller in number but which represent crucial
characteristics of some aspects of the process, thereby
attenuating prediction ability of these networks.
Neural networks have been frequently applied for
environmental process modeling and control. Melas
et al. (2000) presented a BPNN model developed for
24-h prediction of photochemical pollutant levels. The
model relates peak pollutant concentrations to meteorological and emission variables and indices, as well as
maximum hourly pollutant concentrations during the
three previous days of the week. An experiment was
used to investigate sensitivity of model predictions to
uncertainty in the input data. The experiment shows an
agreement between observed and predicted concentrations. However, the results of the BPNN model were
only marginally better than those obtained by regression
models in the literature, possibly due to inadequacy of
input parameters (i.e. some important predictors were
either not included in the analysis because they were
unavailable or under-represented) and inadequate representation of the data used (i.e. only local measurements of some data were obtained and they may not be
representative of a larger area).
Reich et al. (1999) proposed a BPNN with momentum to identify the apportionment of a small number of
sources from a data set of ambient concentrations of a
given pollutant. The trained network was able to
identify the most likely emission parameters of an
unknown source, and hence, to determine the relative
allocation of the point sources involved. The real case is
a noisy generation with a higher uncertainty than the
given examples. The neural network was able to solve
the inverse sourcereceptor problem in the presence of
noisy or ambiguous data. However, it was unable to
adapt to data outside the validation region of the
selected set of examples.

C.W. Chan, G.H. Huang / Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 16 (2003) 7590

Kavchak and Budman (1999) reported on an adaptive
controller for a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR).
The controller was implemented with adaptive radial
basis function neural networks based on dilation
adaptation with a multi-resolution network structure
using an overall prediction error. The controller outperformed the original controller that used a xed
dilation. The improvement obtained with the dilation
adaptation technique as compared to the original
technique is marginal in most situations tested in the
case study. On the other hand, the controller that used
the multi-resolution network structure most closely
resembled the inputoutput linearizing controller, and
the improvement in accuracy with respect to the original
Cannons method is signicant.
De Veaux et al. (1999) proposed a model that includes
both rst principle differential equations and an ANN
to forecast and control biological treatment for water
contamination. ANN modeling of the growth rate of the
biomass is used in conjunction with the assumed known
part of the model. The neural network estimates the
unobservable kinetics parameters from the state at time
t: This information plus the estimated kinetics parameters at time t is then fed into the known model to
obtain the state at time t  1: The hybrid neural network
can be trained with fewer data and extrapolate better
than pure neural networks.
Bhat and McAvoy (1990) and Zhang and Stanley
(1999) introduced model-based process control systems.
Bhat and McAvoy (1990) modeled a pH CSTR with
pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) input, while
Zhang and Stanley (1999) proposed a system for the
coagulation, occulation, and sedimentation processes.
Both systems consist of (1) a process model to predict
the effect of the manipulated variables on the output
and (2) an inverse model to compute future values of the
manipulated variables. The internal model control
(IMC) model-based control system introduced in Zhang
and Stanley (1999) also includes a lter to control the
feedback into the inverse model. The IMC with neural
network is divided into direct, indirect, and hybrid IMC.
In the direct IMC, the inverse model of the process is
replaced by a neural network model, which drives the
system to a target state given current state. In the
indirect IMC, the process model is replaced by a neural
network, which predicts the process output given a set of
input parameters. If both the forward and inverse
models are replaced with neural networks, the control
system is called a hybrid IMC system. In Zhang and
Stanley (1999), the rst neural network is trained using
both good operation cases and cases in which underdose or overdose occurred. The second neural network
is trained with good cases only. Both models converge
and generalize well. The plant reference model is far less
accurate than the inverse model because it is trained
with both good and poor operational conditions.

Hussain (1999) provided an extensive review of the
various applications of neural networks for chemical
process control, which shows that the technique has
been used in both simulation and online implementations. The majority of the neural networks adopted are
of the multi-layered feed-forward type, and three major
control schemes are implemented in these applications:
(i) Neural networks for model-predictive control: Using
neural networks for model-predictive control is the
most commonly found control technique. In this
scheme, the controller determines a variable prole
that optimizes open-loop performance during a
specic time interval. The objective of the controller
is to minimize future output deviations from the set
point while taking into consideration the constraints as well as the control sequence necessary
to achieve the objective.
(ii) Neural networks for inverse-model-based techniques: Two approaches using neural networks in the
inverse-model-based strategy are the direct inverse
control and the IMC techniques. In the direct
inverse control technique, the controller is implemented as a neural network model and works in
parallel with the system under control. The
controller has to learn to supply the appropriate
values for the control parameters. A more robust
and stable strategy is the non-linear IMC technique.
(iii) Neural network in adaptive control techniques:
Neural networks can also be adopted in the
conventional adaptive control structures of nonlinear dynamic systems. These conventional adaptive methods can belong to either the direct
adaptive or indirect adaptive schemes.
Neural-network-based control strategies are also
adopted for online applications. The majority of these
utilize the multi-layered feed forward network with
sigmoidal or hyperbolic activation functions. However,
while many online chemical process control applications
have been reported in the literature, they are mostly for
miniature laboratory-scale equipment only.
Psichogios and Ungar (1991) reported on ANN that
are used in model-based control, both as process models
and as controllers. In process control applications,
neural networks can be incorporated into the controllers
using either direct or indirect control methods. In the
direct method, a neural network is trained with observed
inputoutput data from the system so that the neural
network models the inverse dynamics of the system. The
resulting neural network model can then be used as a
feed forward controller. In the indirect method, the
neural network is trained with inputoutput data from
the dynamic system so that the neural network model
represents the forward dynamics of the system. The
process model can then be used by the control algorithm
to calculate the control action. This paper discussed

control of the output concentration of a non-linear
chemical reactor using the direct control approach. The
behavior of the controller and useful features of the
control architecture were discussed. This paper shows
that when only historical inputoutput data are available and model equations are not known, neural
networks can work as a feasible alternative that provides
good non-linear control.
Syu and Chen (1998) discussed implementation of an
online estimation and control system undertaken as part
of a response to the environmental regulations introduced in Taiwan in 1998. The system implements a
BPNN adaptive controller on a continuous wastewater
treatment process. The BPNN adaptive controller
regulates pump rates for addition of hydrogen peroxide
H2 O2  and ferrous chloride to treat the chemical
oxygen demands (COD) of the process. After completion of the oxidation process, an anion resin was added
to coagulate and settle the suspended particles. The pH
value was a major factor for determining the coagulation condition of the suspended particles and a value of
5.0 was considered the best pH for coagulation. An online control system was used to provide the minimum
amount of reagents to reach the required COD.
The neural network structure consisted of seven input
nodes, four hidden nodes and one output node, and
was of a time-delayed type. The seven input nodes
are CODt; CODt  3; CODit  3; CODit  2;
CODit  1; H2 O2 t  1 and H2 O2 t  2; and the only
output node was the predicted amount of H2 O2 that
should be added at current control time. The backpropagation network learns by calculating an error
between desired and actual output and propagating this
error information back to each node in the network. The
neural network was trained in a dynamic mode. For
each learning cycle, a moving window of learning data
with a xed size was provided. An analysis of the
reaction time, the pH value and concentrations of
reagents reveal that a network structure of 7-4-1 and
a data window size of 15 gives the best control
performance.
Boger (1992) presented a survey of applications of
neural networks to industrial plants operation, especially water and wastewater treatment plant operations.
Compared with other AI techniques such as expert
systems and fuzzy logic, neural networks offer the
advantage of being able to learn from historical data on
the plant. Hence, neither a human expert nor an
explicitly developed process model are needed. The
resulting neural network developed from the data is
robust against process noise or instrument bias and
models plant-specic behavior.
A review of several applications of neural networks in
waste water treatment plants reveal that the process
begins with modeling of process variables or the control
actions. Boger (1992) modeled the behavior of the

Shafdan wastewater treatment plant by training a neural
network from a database that contained weekly
averages of 106 variables from the rst 2 years of
operation. Once the neural network is trained, the rules
describing system behavior can be extracted through
neural network analysis.
Internal checks are necessary in the neural network
system to compensate for erroneous inputs. This can be
implemented as a modular neural network system which
checks inputs against measured values, or as an external
program that compares input values against the range of
input values in the training data set. If a signicant
deviation from the range of learning data is detected, a
ag is raised. A retraining schedule can be established as
a periodic check on validity of the neural network.
Sener (1997) reviewed neural network applications
for environmental control of greenhouse gas, and
discussed four salient points:
(i) Greenhouse gas modeling with neural networks:
Traditional greenhouse gas models are based on
energy and mass balances, such as quasi-steadystate energy-balance models. While the traditional
model is sufcient for design purposes, it has
substantial residual error because it oversimplies
the actual system. To address the inadequacy of the
traditional model, Sener (1997) proposed greenhouse gas modeling using neural networks for two
purposes: rst, a more accurate modeling of existing
greenhouses gas phenomena for environmental
control; and secondly, a benchmark for development of improved physical models.
(ii) Input reduction methods: Reducing the number of
inputs to a neural network without adversely
affecting the result can decrease estimation errors
due to unchecked extrapolations. However, this
reduction process is not desirable because it only
serves to lessen future measurement efforts. The
same effect can be achieved with elimination of
weaker inputs. Among the input variables that
cannot be eliminated, the weights of the trained
neural networks can sometimes provide clues to
their relative importance. The importance of a
variable is measured by the loss of goodness of t
when it is eliminated from the input. Sener (1997)
presented his experience on deciding the weights for
the input variables of a greenhouse gas control
model.
(iii) Model reduction with neural networks: Models based
on a large state vector need to be reduced especially
in optimal control problems, where a complete
solution for a large-scale model requires prohibitively signicant computing effort. In greenhouse
gas control problems, the crop model may contain a
large number of state variables, many of which are
inter-correlated under normal conditions. Sener

C.W. Chan, G.H. Huang / Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 16 (2003) 7590

(1997) presented two general approaches for reducing the statespace: (a) by understanding the
system, reduction is achieved by aggregating variables, and (b) statistical reduction that satises
some optimization criterion results in new variables
which are combinations of the old ones.
(iv) Optimal control applications: A control algorithm
that recommends control actions can be either
model-based or rule-based. The control algorithm
can also be mimicked by a neural network, which
requires considerably less computing effort in realtime operations. Sener (1997) suggested that
mimicking expert decision-making with neural network modeling requires large amounts of data
which may be difcult to obtain. But if the data are
available, a neural network approach can extract
policy decisions which are likely to be more
objective than those obtained by means of traditional or manual knowledge acquisition approaches. In this context, a signicant advantage
of neural networks is that they have the exibility to
adapt to non-linear and non-physical data. But a
major disadvantage is that proper training of neural
networks requires large multi-dimensional sets of
data to reduce possible errors due to extrapolation.
Therefore, it is important if possible to reduce
dimensionality of the problem.
Tendulkar et.al. (1998) developed an ANN model for
non-linear identication and variable prediction for the
phenol hydroxylation process. The experimental objective of the phenol hydroxylation reaction was to
optimize conditions with respect to formation of
dihydroxybenzen isomers. Catechol and hydroquinone
are two of the many phenolic derivatives of high value.
Hydroxylation of phenol using a hydrogen peroxide
oxidant and titanium to ve catechol and hydroquinone
has been extensively studied. Within this context, the
ow rate of phenol and the reactor temperature
constitute the manipulated and controlled variables of
the experiment.
The dynamic error back-propagation network (EBPN)
model was used with a total of 123 data points acquired
at 5-min intervals. The data were collected and separated
into the training set and the test set. The former was used
to update the network weights, the latter was used to
evaluate the generalization ability of the network model.
The input layer of EBPN consisted of four nodes
representing the current and lagged values of the process
input and output. The process model was used and tested
within the framework of neural model prediction control
(NMPC). The advantage of the NMPC methodology is
that all the control computations are performed in the
domain of a single network working as a forward process
model, thereby avoiding the need to train a separate
neural network to act as a controller.

83

More recently, Liang (2001) examined the effects of
the environmental variables (temperature and moisture
content) and time on microbial activity during biosolids
composting, and quanties the relationships among
environmental variables and time and microbial activity
during biosolids composting by developing ANN
models. Controlled composting experiments were conducted using 2-factor factorial design with six temperature levels (22 C; 29 C; 36 C; 43 C; 50 C; and 57 C)
and ve moisture contents (30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and
70%). The ANN models are then used to estimate the
dynamic microbial activities over time during biosolids
composting. These models are further incorporated
within a decision support system for composting
management, and are used for optimizing the composting process and reducing operation costs.

5. Fuzzy set theory
Systems involving fuzzy logic are distinct from nonfuzzy expert systems in that the former typically
involve (1) linguistic rather than numeric variables and
(2) fuzzy conditional statements rather than exact
expressions. Rules that incorporate linguistic and
inexact data can be manipulated as a useful tool for
reasoning about difcult industrial process control
situations.
The fuzzy logic controller is pre-programmed with a
exible set of rules and can adapt to changing
conditions. It is made up of three basic elements: a
fuzzier, an inference engine, and a de-fuzzier. The
fuzzier and de-fuzzier translate the literal language of
sensors into linguistic terms understandable by the
inference engine, where the control decisions are made.
The most interesting use of fuzzy logic in the process
industries is to control a process that is non-linear and
multi-variable in its makeup.
Enbutsu et al. (1991) combined fuzzy logic with
neural networks and obtained more detailed expert
rules. Dynamic forecasting was also studied in the
chemical industry where a moving window of process
variables is used to train a neural network from past
records to predict the value of a variable in the
immediate future.
Bastian (1995) proposed a exible fuzzy controller
based on the concept of a exibly dened linguistic
variable. That is, the meaning of variables in the rule
base can be changed according to predetermined
conditions. A simulation study showed that this
controller can support easy modication and simplication of the comprehensive rule base.
Tay and Zhang (1999) adopted advanced neural fuzzy
technology to develop a conceptual adaptive model for
anaerobic treatment systems. Modeling anaerobic biological wastewater treatment systems is difcult because

84

C.W. Chan, G.H. Huang / Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 16 (2003) 7590

their performance is complex and highly dependent on
the congurations of the different reactors, inuent
characteristics, and operational conditions. Instead of
conventional kinetic modeling, the model developed by
Tay and Zhang combines the robustness of fuzzy
systems with the learning ability of neural networks,
and can adapt to various situations. The advantage of
combined neural fuzzy systems is that fuzzy systems are
enhanced with the automatic tuning abilities of neural
networks. However, a weakness in the neural fuzzy
model is that its performance is highly dependent on the
quality of training data.
An anaerobic biological wastewater treatment system
consists of the three phases of biological, liquid and gas
treatment. Different substances are exchanged among
the three phases, and products of the microbial
conversion process are carried away by the efuent
discharge gas. To avoid conducting the difcult analysis
that such a complex system would require, the system is
often treated as a black box. The proposed model
consists of several key components, including inputs and
outputs, database and pre-processor, a fuzzy system
generator, a fuzzy inference system, and an adaptive
neural network representing the fuzzy system. Since it is
difcult to manually pre-process the redundant and
conicting data, a fuzzy clustering method is utilized to
automatically carry out the task.
More recently, Chang et al. (2001) and Chen et al.
(2001) proposed a fuzzy controller for managing
industrial wastewater treatment processes. In these
studies, the authors employed techniques of fuzzy set
theory, optimization and genetic algorithm for dealing
with uncertainty and non-linearity in such control
systems. The results indicate that, with the consideration
of uncertainties through the fuzzy set approaches, more
effective process control could be realized. The authors
also applied the similar concepts to the control of
municipal incinerators (Chang and Chen, 2000; Chang
et al., 2002).

6. Hybrid intelligent systems
Many environmental systems are complex, nonlinear, and uncertain, leading to difculties in simulating
and controlling them through a single methodology.
Often, hybrid technologies are desired to enhance
robustness of the decision support. For example, both
expert system and fuzzy logic try to emulate the
reasoning process of an expert, or a set of experts, in a
particular eld. However, implementing fuzzy logic
control as a set of rules in a knowledge base represents
a signicant investment in time and resources. On the
other hand, neural networks can be an excellent tool for
making sense out of data. Whenever knowledge is felt to
be lacking, a neural network can be applied to extract

from the data the inherent relationships. Therefore, in
many industrial applications, expert systems, fuzzy logic
and neural networks are integrated in a system to
support optimized process control and management. In
this section, some applications that adopt a hybrid
approach to developing intelligent systems in the process
industries are discussed.
De la Rosa et al. (1999) described modeling of soil
erosion by water, which is an important environmental
problem in southern Spain. The objective of the study
was to relate soil erosion vulnerability to biophysical
factors and agricultural management practices. The
paper discusses formulation, calibration, sensitivity
and validation analysis of a hybrid model of expert
decision trees and ANN to evaluate the soil erosion
process. The hybrid model is called ImpelERO, which
captures relationships among land and management
qualities and their associated characteristics using expert
decision trees. To capture the interactions among the
qualities affecting the erosion vulnerability index, an
ANN was developed. The ImpelERO consists of two
parts. The rst part of the model considers the land
qualities, land characteristics, management qualities and
management characteristics and these factors form
the decision trees. ANN analysis was used to develop
the second part of the ImpelERO model which predicts
the actual eld vulnerability. In order to train the ANN,
the Cascase-correlation algorithm was used. According
to the sensitivity and validation analysis, ImpelERO was
able to recognize the main interrelationships of the input
parameters, and reproduce the soil erosion vulnerability
accurately. In addition to prediction of soil loss by water
erosion, this system can be used as an optimization tool
for selecting the land use and management practices that
satisfy optimum environmental protection such as
reduction of soil loss.
Abuelgasim et al. (1999) proposed a method to assess
the environmental effects of the Gulf War on the desert
surface of Kuwait using a change detection method that
combines a neural network classication architecture
with fuzzy logic. Field data were collected from January
to February 1993. The data for each test site include
information on the soil type, vegetation cover and its
density, degree of oil pollutants, presence of oil lakes,
sand dunes, or mobilized sand sheets. The data preprocessing involved the three phases of geometric
registration, radiometric normalization, and data
scaling.
To assess the environmental impact of the Gulf War,
a system for change detection was implemented which
can identify two types of categorical changes: (i) a new
landcover class that has emerged and (ii) changes
between known classes. The change detection adaptive
fuzzy (CDAF) network can be used to rst derive a set
of category representations that could be successfully
employed to detect changes between known landcover

C.W. Chan, G.H. Huang / Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 16 (2003) 7590

classes. Secondly, the network can establish new
category representations for unknown landcover classes,
and then, it provides quantitative measures of the
probability of changes in terms of category likelihood,
as well as of the magnitude of changes in terms of
intensity.
The application of the CDAF network to assess
change resulting from the Gulf War involves the
following procedure: (i) training, i.e. the network is
trained with spectral data for each pixel in the training
set from the 1989 image along with the corresponding
land cover class; (ii) classification, i.e. the trained neural
network produced in step 1 was used in three ways,
where the performance of the trained neural network is
validated using an independent unseen test data set,
the trained network was used to classify the entire 1989
image, and the trained network of 1989 was used to
classify the 1991 image; (iii) change detection, i.e. fuzzy
membership values for each land class for each pixel are
obtained for both 1989 and 1991 classications and are
used in the detection of change. The results showed that
this neural network approach gave good results
compared to analysis using other methods.
Huang and Fan (1993) developed a hybrid intelligent
system called HIDEN to synthesize material and energy
recovery processes (MERPs) for minimizing hazardous
or toxic waste streams and recovering waste energy in a
process plant. The system HIDEN consists of three
subsystems: a knowledge-based subsystem KBDEN, a
fuzzy logic subsystem FLDEN, and a neural network
subsystem NNDEN. The subsystem KBDEN is the core
of HIDEN. This subsystem accepts the process data on
the material and energy recovery processes or MERPs,
and the data are divided into the two classes of data and
imprecise data. The subsystems FKDEN and NNDEN
are designed to provide a series of recommendations on
critical stream matching derived from the second class of
data. To demonstrate the applicability of the HIDEN
system, two design problems, one for material recovery
and the other for energy recovery, are described.
The hierarchical expert system is structured into the
lower and upper layers, with the former consisting of a
number of rule bases. To perform the task of scheduling,
both deep and shallow knowledge are included in the
knowledge base. The deep knowledge includes the rst
principles of reaction kinetics, thermodynamics, and
mass and energy balances, as well as process models
derived from rst principles. The process models can
evaluate process operations. The shallow knowledge is
expressed as heuristic rules and functions. Since the
available information is imprecise, the heuristic rules are
fuzzy in nature and are called fuzzy heuristic rules or
simply fuzzy rules.
Scheduling decisions are made in two stages. First,
each subsystem in the lower layer makes a locally
optimal decision. Secondly, by coordinating the sub-

85

systems, the local decisions are modied to satisfy the
criterion of global optimality. The rules in the rule base
at the lower layer are weighted. By co-ordinating and
balancing trade-offs among the local decisions according to a number of constraints, a set of globally optimal
decisions is made. The constraints include scheduling
criteria, the minimum total idle time of process units in a
day, satisfaction of a production plan, and waste
minimization.
The expert system PS-BATCH is developed for the
scheduling of the batch chemical process. PS-BATCH is
a questionanswer system which poses a set of questions
on the operating conditions of each process unit to the
user. Among the variety of wastes generated in the metal
nishing industry, the waste solution of electroplating
plants consists of cyanide and is of particular concern
because it is highly toxic. In a typical electroplating
process, each work piece is cleansed to remove dirt and
oil prior to plating or stripping. This involves electrocleaning, alkaline cleaning, acid cleaning and rinsing. A
fuzzy expert system has been constructed to facilitate the
source reduction of cyanide-waste solutions and to train
plant operators in the techniques of cyanide minimization. The knowledge base of the system includes the
detailed cyanide minimization strategies, which are
expressed as both fuzzy and crisp (i.e. non-fuzzy) rules.
The fuzzy expert system MIN-CYANIDE evaluates
and prioritizes the minimization options, which include
drag-out minimization, bath-life extension, rinse water
reduction, replacement with a non-cyanide solution, use
of an alternative plating technique, and improvement of
the operating procedure. Based on the ranking, the
system makes a recommendation on the most effective
minimization strategy.
Simutis et al. (1997) described a hybrid or integrated
system approach used in biochemical engineering to
increase the costbenet ratio of model-supported
optimization and control. A comparison between
classical and hybrid modeling approaches clearly
indicates that the latter performs better than the former
for process optimization and control. The advantage lies
in the amount of a priori knowledge incorporated into
the hybrid model as compared to the mathematical
model. The hybrid models enables direct use of knowledge as it becomes available and avoids loss of
information in the transformation process. Also adopting the hybrid approach is more effective in terms of
development time, and hence cost.
Since hybrid models take advantage of the combination of knowledge and information from different
sources, they are more complex than classical models.
This may cause problems with classical optimization
procedures, like dynamic programming or the application of Pontryagins maximum principle for process
optimization. These difculties might in practice reduce
the applicability of the model and consequently its

86

benet. The HYBNET software package is a development system for hybrid structure denition and optimization. HYBNET can combine differential equation
systems, analytical mathematical relations, ANN, fuzzy
expert systems or fuzzy neural networks and their
variants. These become individual components in a
modular model which is organized in a network
structure. The novelty of HYBNET is that the entire
model assumes a network structure, which implies ideas
of network training developed for simple ANN can be
applied at a higher level. From a practical point of view,
the advantage of HYBNET is that it supports exibility
in arranging partial process models so that they can
work together in solving a particular problem.
The paper emphasizes that the costbenet ratio is a
key determinant in the acceptance of model-supported
process supervision, optimization and control in industrial scale production processes. Combining ANN,
fuzzy rule systems and classical model approaches in a
hybrid model can usually enhance its performance. An
additional reason that hybrid modeling is particularly
suited for production process automation is that in this
application, there is usually enough data to conduct
data analysis in combination with classical mathematical modeling.
Efstathiou (1993) presented a survey of the evolving
system architectures that apply AI techniques to process
control. There are altogether three architectures
presented:
(i) Blackboard and layered architectures: The blackboard architecture permits several components of a
knowledge-based system to communicate by means
of a shared space in memory known as the
blackboard. The blackboard architecture could be
augmented by addition of a manager that controls
the data written to the blackboard and the order in
which expert modules use scarce resources to
perform their tasks. The layered architectural
design species the tasks of the expert system to
be layered according to the time-scale at which
events occur.
(ii) Coping with real time interruption: Coping with realtime processes can be difcult. While there are a few
strategies that can be adopted to improve real-time
performance, none of them can guarantee adequacy
of the performance. To do so, it is necessary to
investigate performance proles of the reasoning
processes, to determine how much the results of the
reasoning can be improved with allocating more
processing time.
(iii) Distributed architectures: In a distributed architecture, the blackboard or layered architectures would
distribute the knowledge sources to different
processors, with each one managing its own data
exchange. This in fact describes the multi-agent

architecture that consists of several, possibly
physically distributed expert modules, each of
which is capable of some control over its communication and decision-making. In a process control
system, these agents would likely have the same
goal, namely the safe and efcient production of
some manufactured goods. However, at a lower
level, it is possible that conicts would arise among
the agents.

In these three types of architectures, a variety of AI
methods can be incorporated. One of the earliest
successes in the application of AI to process control
involved the use of a fuzzy rule-based expert system.
Many knowledge-based systems for process control use
rule-based inference or fuzzy logic to cope with at least
part of their control strategy. In addition, the neural
network approach has recently emerged as a process
control method. Current work in Japan and the United
States is seeking to combine fuzzy control with neural
networks.
De Veaux et al. (1999) presented work on integrating
differential equations based on rst principle with an
ANN to forecast and control an environmental process.
This approach overcomes the problem of unavailability
of some important parameters required by a mathematical model of some process control system. The hybrid
model substantially improves upon reliability of the
model predictions.
For the biological treatment process for contaminated
water, some knowledge about the inherent biochemistry
of the process is usually available, either in the form of
energy balances or other equations describing development of the process. However, these equations often
involve variables that are not quantiable. Therefore, a
feed-forward neural network is used in conjunction with
the speciable part of the model. The neural network
estimates the unobservable kinetic parameters from the
state at time t: This information plus the estimated
kinetic parameters at time t is then fed into the known
model to obtain the state at time t  1: Hybrid neural
networks, sometimes called gray box models, can be
trained with fewer data and extrapolate better than pure
neural networks.
The experiments demonstrated the potential for using
a hybrid model for forecast and simulation of an
environmental process. When sufciently large training
sets of data are available, pure neural networks give an
accurate model of the process. However, when limited
data are available, as frequently happens in real life, the
hybrid model gives signicantly better accuracy, particularly on extrapolation. The part of the model that is
assumed known acts as a constraint on the estimation,
producing extrapolation far more reliable than
those generated using a purely empirical model.

C.W. Chan, G.H. Huang / Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 16 (2003) 7590

Adding more constraints to the model is generally
benecial.
Lippmann et al. (1997) described a software package
called LNKnet that simplies the task of applying
neural network, statistical, and machine-learning pattern-classication algorithms in new application areas.
The purpose of a pattern classier is to assign every
input pattern to one of a small number of discrete
classes or groups. There are three major approaches to
developing pattern classiers: the probability-densityfunction (PDF), posterior-probability, and boundaryforming strategies.
The ve most common types of neural network
classiers are PDF, global and local neural network,
nearest neighbor and rule forming. PDF classiers
provide good performance when the PDF of the input
features are known and when there is sufcient training
data. Global and local neural network classiers are
both suitable for applications in which probabilistic
outputs are desired. Nearest-neighbor classiers are best
suited for problems in which fast training and adaptation are essential. Finally, rule-based classiers and
decision trees are most suitable when a minimal-sized
classier is desired and when simple explanations for
classier decisions are desired.
LNKnet integrates all of these methods. The software
can be used at any of the three levels described as
follows. The point-and-click graphical user interface can
facilitate rapid experimentation and interaction with the
various classiers on new databases. Users who want to
execute long batch jobs can edit and run the shell scripts
produced by the point-and-click interface. Finally, users
with knowledge of C programming can work at the
source-code level. At this level, C source code of
LNKnet can be embedded in a user application
program. LNKnet contains more than 20 neural network, pattern-classication, and feature-selection algorithms. The algorithms can be trained and tested on
separate data or tested with automatic cross-validation.
The software is written in C and runs under the UNIX
operating system. A number of research laboratories
including the Lincoln Laboratory of Massachussettes
Institute of Technology have used LNKnet successfully
for many diverse applications, including talker identication, talkergender classication, hand-printed character recognition, underwater and environmental sound
classication, image spotting, seismic-signal classication, medical diagnosis, galaxy classication, and fault
detection.
More recently, Rodrigo et al. (1999) described a fuzzy
proportion-integral-differential (PID) controller for a
non-linear sludge aeration process developed based on
expert knowledge. The controller incorporated fuzzy
neural networks that were applied to modify the fuzzy
functions and fuzzy rules in the controllers. Molina et al.
(2000) used expert systems and neural networks to

87

construct a predictive maintenance system for a hydroelectric power plant. The expert system was built based
on a rule-based diagnostic model, and a neural network
predictive model was developed based on historical data
to produce process predictions.
Neural network models are often considered black
boxes due to their inability to provide explanations. To
compensate for this weakness, De Veaux et al. (1999)
proposed a hybrid system of neural network and rst
principle differential equation. This combination is
sometimes called a grey box. The inclusion of rst
principle knowledge in this hybrid model is shown to
improve substantially the stability of the model predictions. When sufciently large training sets of data are
available, pure neural networks give an accurate model
of the process. However, when only limited data are
available, as typically is the case in real life, the
hybrid model gives signicantly better accuracy, particularly on extrapolation. The part of the model that is
assumed known acts as a constraint on the estimation,
producing extrapolation far more reliable than those
generated using a purely empirical model of neural
networks.

7. Research perspectives on AI-aided process control
Process control for environmental systems is an
interdisciplinary concept, involving a variety of factors
with multi-component, multi-phase, multi-period, and
multi-criterion characteristics. The goal is to obtain
desired environmental targets with minimized capital
and operating costs. However, the possibility for
accomplishing this goal could be affected by many
constraints, limitations and complexities that exist in the
pollution control systems. Facing these challenges, it is
essential to identify effective approaches for realizing the
desired targets. In the following, the detailed perspectives will be discussed.
(1) Data availability: The insufciency of information
about pollution sources, minimization and mitigation
measures, water quality records and economic data
often hinder the development of effective models or
expert systems. In many situations, information of
scaled and eld works was insufcient for supporting
the AI-aided process modeling and control studies.
Thus, researchers have to work within limited scopes
where the required data are available, constraining the
adoption of techniques of comprehensive analysis,
integrated modeling, global optimization, and systematic consideration. It is suggested that improvement in
data availability and quality is pre-requisite for useful
process control studies.
(2) Data reliability: Many environmental data are

are direct opposites of each other. That is, high
reliability usually corresponds to low uncertainty, but
it is, in fact, difcult to achieve both high reliability and
low uncertainty at the same time. However, it is well
recognized that high uncertainty means high system
complexity, and low reliability could be worse than no
data. To obtain improved reliability and certainty, solid
works on validation of input data before they are used
for further AI-related studies are desired.
(3) Validity of methodology: A variety of techniques
have been developed for supporting missions of
environmental process management and control. However, problems of reliability and suitability exist. In
process simulation and prediction, due to the existence
of uncertainties and the lack of quantied economic
information, most of neural network models can only
reect part of the impact factors. These affect accuracy
of the prediction. Therefore, when neural network
models are used for providing decision support, the
researchers have to conduct solid on-site works to gain
as much insight of the study system as the process
managers before claiming that they are wiser and can do
better jobs. Simply staying in ofces and conducting
modeling computations and theoretical imaginations
based on documented reports and data will not
work.
(4) System complexity: Environmental processes generally have interactive, dynamic and uncertain features.
Complexities exist in determination of system parameters, reection of interactive relationships, formulation of AI-aided modeling approaches, interpretation of
research outputs, and implementation of recommended
activities. Often, to quantify and control such systems, a
number of simplications were made by adopting, for
example linear, continuous, static, and/or deterministic
assumptions. These simplications, however, are subject
to risks of system errors and failures. How to effectively
reect these complexities without taking these risks has
been a challenging question facing the modeling
researchers. Obviously, using any single technique to
solve such problems could be subject to risks. Therefore,
whenever possible, it is recommended to use an
integration of more than one tool to tackle different
aspects of these complexities. This paper has presented
some hybrid approaches that incorporate diverse
techniques. These can be more exibly adopted to
address more open-ended investigations. For example,
the ANN technique can be integrated with fuzzy logic to
tackle more complex problems. The ability of fuzzy logic
to model qualitative knowledge and represent knowledge in a logical form can compensate for the weakness
in ANN of embedding knowledge implicitly in their
structural parameters (Zhou, 2002). Applications of the
hybrid approaches to pollution minimization and
mitigation processes would be a fruitful direction of
future research.

8. Conclusions
Several demanding areas for enhanced research
efforts are discussed, including issues of data availability
and reliability, methodology validity, and system complexity. In general, expert systems and AI techniques can
be categorized according to problem solving or task
types. Along this dimension, the majority of AI
applications for pollution mitigation and minimization
fall into four broad task groups: (i) process control, (ii)
prediction or estimation, (iii) process modeling or
simulation, and (iv) process management that involves
some comparison and evaluation of costbenet ratios
of different solution scenarios. Among these, the most
frequently tackled tasks are process control, prescription, and prediction. When sufcient data are available,
the neural network technique often generates good
results for system prediction. On the other hand, expert
systems are often used for the task of prescription and
control which involve process modeling and optimization. However, many environmental processes are
complex with interactive, dynamic and uncertain features, leading to difculties in using a single technique to
solve such problems. Therefore, integrated or hybrid
approaches are desired for reecting such complexities
and accomplishing the desired targets.
Problems of environmental pollution have caused
severe stress on the human society and economic
progress. Pollution abatement through minimization and mitigation measures is an important approach
for addressing such a challenge, where effective
process control would be essential for obtaining
desired efciencies. Recently, AI technologies have been
found to excel in environmental systems that are
complex, non-linear, and uncertain. This study investigates and analyzes some recent advancement of
these technologies. In particular, technologies of
expert systems, fuzzy logic, and neural networks
have emerged as the most frequently employed approaches for realizing process control. The results
not only provide an overview of progress in the study
eld but also, more importantly, reveal opportunities
for research in order to realize more effective environmental process control through incorporation of AI
technologies.
