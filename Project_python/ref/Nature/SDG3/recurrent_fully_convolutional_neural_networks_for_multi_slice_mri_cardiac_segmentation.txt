Abstract. In cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, fully-automatic segmentation of the heart enables precise structural and functional measurements to be taken, e.g. from short-axis MR images of the left-ventricle.
In this work we propose a recurrent fully-convolutional network (RFCN)
that learns image representations from the full stack of 2D slices and has
the ability to leverage inter-slice spatial dependences through internal
memory units. RFCN combines anatomical detection and segmentation
into a single architecture that is trained end-to-end thus signicantly
reducing computational time, simplifying the segmentation pipeline, and
potentially enabling real-time applications. We report on an investigation
of RFCN using two datasets, including the publicly available MICCAI
2009 Challenge dataset. Comparisons have been carried out between fully
convolutional networks and deep restricted Boltzmann machines, including a recurrent version that leverages inter-slice spatial correlation. Our
studies suggest that RFCN produces state-of-the-art results and can substantially improve the delineation of contours near the apex of the heart.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease is one of the major causes of death in the world. Physicians use imaging technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
estimate structural (e.g. volume) and functional (e.g. ejection fraction) cardiac
parameters for both diagnosis and disease management. Fully-automated estimation of such parameters can facilitate early diagnosis of the disease and has
the potential to remove the more mechanistic aspects of a radiologists assessment. As such, lately there has been increasing interest in machine learning algorithms for fully automatic left-ventricle (LV) segmentation [1,8,10,12,17]. This
is a challenging task due to the variability of LV shape across slices, cardiac
phases, patients and scanning machines as well as weak boundaries of LV due
to the presence of blood ow, papillary muscles and trabeculations. A review of
LV segmentation methods in short-axis cardiac MR images can be found in [20].

The main image analysis approaches to LV segmentation can be grouped into
three broad categories: active contour models, machine learning models, and
hybrid versions that combine elements of the two approaches. Active contour
models with either explicit [13] or implicit [15] contour representations minimize
an energy function composed of internal and external constraints. The internal
constraints represent continuity and smoothness of the contour and external constraints represent appearance and shape of the target object. However, designing
appropriate energy functions that can handle all sources of variability is challenging. Also, the quality of the segmentations produced by these methods typically depends on the region-of-interest (ROI) used to initialise the algorithms.
Machine learning approaches have been proposed to circumvent some of these
issues [1,9,17,18] at the expense of collecting large training datasets with a sufcient number of examples. Investigating hybrid methods that combine some
elements of both approaches is an active research area [4]. Current state-of-theart LV segmentation approaches rely on deep articial neural networks [1,17,18].
Typically, these solutions consists of three distinct stages carried out sequentially.
Initially, the LV is localised within each two-dimensional slice; then the LV is
segmented, and nally the segmentation is further rened to improve its quality. For instance, a pipeline consisting of Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) for both
localisation and segmentation, followed by a level-set methodology, has shown
to generate high-quality segmentations [17]. In more recent work, a dierent
pipeline has been proposed that consists of convolutional neural networks for
initial LV detection, followed by a segmentation step deploying stacked autoencoders, and a ne-tuning strategy also based on level-sets methodology [1]. The
latter approach has been proved to produce state-of-the-art results on the MICCAI 2009 LV segmentation challenge [21]. Both approaches share a number of
common features. First, the segmentation is carried out using two-dimensional
patches that are independently extracted from each MRI slice. Second, they use
a separate architecture for the two tasks, localization and segmentation. Third,
dierent neural network architectures are trained for cardiac MR slices containing the base and apex of the heart, due to the observed heterogeneity in local
shape variability.
In this work we investigate a neural network architecture, trained end-to-end,
that learns to detect and segment the LV jointly from the entire stack of shortaxis images rather than operating on individual slices. Recently, fully convolutional networks (FCN) have been proposed for the segmentation of 2D images
[16]. They take arbitrarily sized input images, and use feature pooling coupled
with an upsampling step to produce same size outputs delivering the segmentation. Compared to more traditional sliding-window approaches, FCNs are more
ecient. They have received increasing interest lately as they unify object localization and segmentation in a single process by extracting both global and local
context eectively [16,22]. Applications of FCNs to medical imaging segmentation problems have also started to appear, for instance for the identication of
neuronal structures in electron microscopic recordings [22]. In independent work,
Valipour et al. [25] have recently adapted recurrent fully convolutional networks
for video segmentation.

Here we propose an extension of FCNs, called Recurrent Fully-Convolutional
Networks (RFCN), to directly address the segmentation problem in multi-slice
MR images. We are motivated by the desire to exploit the spatial dependences
that are observed across adjacent slices and learn image features that capture the
global anatomical structure of the heart from the full image stack. We investigate
whether exploiting this information is benecial for accurate anatomical segmentation, especially for cardiac regions with weak boundaries, e.g. poor structural
contrast due to the presence of blood ow, papillary muscles and trabeculations.

Datasets

Our experiments are based on two independent datasets consisting of short-axis
cardiac MR images for which the endocardium has been manually segmented by
expert radiologists in each axial slice. Further details are provided below.
2.1

MICCAI Dataset

The MICCAI 2009 LV Segmentation Challenge [21] dataset was made publicly
available by the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center (Canada) and has been
extensively used to compare a number of LV segmentation algorithms [1,8,10,12,
17,18]. It consists of 45 CINE MRI images from a number of dierent pathologies.
The individual exams have been pre-grouped into training, validation and online
testing subsets. Each subset contains 15 cases of which 4 heart failure with
infarction (HF-I), 4 heart failure without infarction (HF), 4 LV hypertrophy
(HYP) and 3 healthy subjects. However, the clinical information has not been
used by any of the algorithms discussed here and in our experiments. All the
images were obtained during breath-hold sessions lasting 1015 s with a temporal
resolution of 20 cardiac phases over the heart cycle. A typical phase, end diastole
(ED) or end systole (ES), contains 612 short-axis slices obtained from the base
to apex. In all the images, the slice thickness is 8 mm, the inter-slice gap is 8 mm,
the eld of view is 320 mm  320 mm and the pixel size is 256 256. In all 45
samples, LV endocardial contours were drawn by an experienced cardiologist
by taking 2D slices at both the end-systolic and end-diastolic phases, and then
independently conrmed by a second reader. The manual segmentations were
used as ground truth for the evaluation of the proposed models. Each set consists
of 30 sequences (15 samples for each one of the two cardiac phases) with an
average sequence length 8.94 slices.
2.2

PRETERM Dataset

A second and larger dataset was used for an independent evaluation of all the cardiac segmentation algorithms. The dataset consists of 234 subjects used to study
perinatal factors modifying the left ventricular parameter [14]. All the individuals
are between 20 to 39 years of age. Of these, 102 were followed prospectively since
preterm birth, and are characterised by an average gestational age of 30.3  2.5

weeks and a birth weight of 1.30.3 kg. The remaining 132 subjects were born at
term to uncomplicated pregnancies. Short-axis CINE MRI stacks were acquired
with a 1.5-T Siemens Sonata scanner. All images have a 7 mm slice thickness and
3 mm inter-slice gap, the in-plane resolution is 1.43  0.29 mm (min. 0.57, max.
2.17). All cardiovascular MRI was prospectively ECG gated and acquired during
end-expiration breath holding. LV slices and endocardial masks were resampled
into a homogeneous in-plane resolution of 2 mm, which yield slice pixel size of
212  212. Left ventricular short-axis endocardial borders were manually contoured by an expert reader at ES and ED using Siemens analytic software (Argus,
Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany). The dataset was randomly divided into
training, validation and testing sets of sizes 194, 20 and 20, respectively.

Recurrent Fully-Convolutional Networks

The proposed recurrent fully-convolutional network (RFCN) is an extension of
the architecture originally introduced in [16] for predicting pixel-wise, dense outputs from arbitrarily-sized inputs. The main idea underlying FCNs is to extend a
contracting path, in which a sequence of pooling operators progressively reduces
the size of the network, by adding successive layers where pooling operators are
replaced by upsampling operators. In this respect, our architecture is similar to
U-net [22] where the expanding path is characterised by a large number of feature channels allowing the network to propagate context information to higher
resolution layers.

dependences learned through GRU. (Color gure online)

Our purpose is to model the full stack of short-axis images extracted from
cardiac MRI and improve the segmentation of the left ventricle in each slice by
leveraging inter-slice spatial dependences. The input is the entire sequence of
S slices obtained at a particular cardiac phase (ED or ES) and the output is
the sequence of corresponding (manually produced) left-ventricular masks. Each
input and output image is assumed to have equal size. A schematic illustration
is given in Fig. 1. As can be seen there, slices around the base of the heart (at the
top) cover larger LV regions and show relatively clear boundaries whereas slices
around the apex (at the bottom) cover smaller LV regions and present more
blurred boundaries. Learning the typical shape deformations that are observed
as we move from the base towards the apex is expected to improve the overall
quality of the segmentation in challenging regions around the apex.
Three main building blocks characterise the proposed RFCN as illustrated in
Fig. 2: a feature-extraction (contracting) path, a global-feature component and
an upsampling (expanding) path. The feature-extraction component, which is
independently applied to each image in the stack, deploys successive convolution and max-pooling operations to learn higher level features and remove local
redundancy. In our architecture, this component consists of a repeated block of

88

R.P.K. Poudel et al.

two (3  3) convolutional layers (with stride of 1) followed by a rectied linear
unit (ReLU) and a (2  2) max pooling layer (with stride of 2). We doubled the
number of feature channels c after each max pooling layer to maintain enough
context, i.e. each block takes an input of size (c  h  w) and generates output
feature maps of size (2c  h/2  w/2).
At the end of this contracting path the network has extracted the most
compressed features carrying global context. The global feature component starts
here with a (3  3) convolutional layer (with stride of 1) followed by a ReLU.
We denote es the output of this layer where s indicates the slice index, i.e.
s  {1, . . . , S}. This output consists of (256  30  30) feature maps. In an
attempt to extract global features that capture the spatial changes observed
when moving from the base to the apex of the heart, we introduce a recurrent
mechanism mapping es into a new set of features, hs = (hs1 , es ), where ()
is a non-linear function, and the size of hs is the same as the size of es . Another
(3  3) convolutional layer (with stride of 1) followed by a ReLU is then applied
to complete the global-feature extraction block.
Given that training recurrent architectures is particularly dicult due to
the well-document vanishing gradient problem, several options were considered
for the implementation of recurrent function , including a Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) [7] and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) module [2]. GRUs in
particular have been shown to achieve a performance comparable to LSTM on a
number of tasks involving sequential data whilst requiring fewer parameters and
less memory [3]. Here we have chosen to use a convolutional variant of GRU so
that the local correlation of the input images are preserved whilst achieving a
notable reduction in the number of parameters compared to its non-convolutional
counter part.
For every slice, the dense feature maps that have been learned by the convolutional GRU module are then upsampled to compensate for the input size reduction caused by the max-pooling operations. The upsampled features are concatenated with a high resolution parallel layer aligned to the feature-extraction
component, similarly to the U-net architecture [22]. Our upsampling component
consists of a repeated block of a convolutional layer (with a fractional stride
of 1/2), a feature map concatenation module and two 3  3 convolutional layers (with stride of 1) followed by ReLU. The feature map concatenation module combines the outputs of the upsample layer and parallel feature-extraction
block. Each block of the upsampling component takes a three-dimensional input
c  h  w and output c/2  2h  2w dimensional tensor. A convolutional operation with fractional stride is employed to compensate the reduction in input
size due to the max pooling operation. Even though the upsampling procedure
smooths out the boundaries of the object to be segmented, the concatenation
of up-sampled feature maps with high-resolution feature maps helps mitigate
this smoothing problem by providing better local and boundary information.
The nal segmentation is obtained by using a 1  1 convolutional layer, which

maps the output of the upsampling component onto the two classes, i.e. LV and
background. The probability for each class is given by a softmax function across
all pixel locations.

Other Architectures and Model Training

Recently, deep belief networks (DBNs) have been proposed for automatic LV
detection and segmentation using short-axis MR images [17,18]. A DBN was rst
used to detect the region of interest containing the LV. Anatomical segmentation
was then carried out using distance-regularised level sets, which were modied
to leverage prior shape information inferred by a separate DBN. In these models,
as in FCNs, each slice in the short-axis stack is segmented independently of all
the others. The main building block of a DBN model is a restricted Boltzmann
machine (RBM), typically trained using the contrast divergence algorithm [5].
In some of our experiments, we have assessed the performance of DBNs for LV
segmentation comparably to FCNs and the proposed RFCNs.
In order to further investigate whether modelling the dependence across slices
typically yields improved performance, and motivated by the existing body of
work on DBNs, we have also assessed the performance of a recurrent version
of restricted Boltzmann machines (RRBM), originally proposed to learn human
body motion [23], but never used for LV segmentation. RRBMs are stacked
together to form what we call a recurrent deep belief network (RDBN). Similarly
to the proposed RFCN, RDBN takes the entire sequence of short-axis slices as
input and leverages the spatial correlations through additional bias units. For
further information, we refer the reader to the original work [23].
The two convolutional architectures, FCN and RFCN, were trained by minimizing the cross-entropy objective function. FCN was trained using a stochastic
gradient descent algorithm with momentum whereas RFCN was trained using
a stochastic gradient descent algorithm with RMSProp [24]. Back-propagation
was used to compute the gradient of the cross-entropy objective function with
respect to all parameters of the model, including the GRU component in the
case of RFCN. We also learned h0 as required by the rst slice of the sequence.
In each block, batch normalization [11] was added after each convolutional layer,
i.e. just before the max-pooling and upsampling layers. All reported results refer
to the best out of 5 experiments in which the models were initialised with random parameters. RFCN was initialised using weights obtained from FCN, which
reduces the training time and provided the good initial weights. Both the DBN
and RDBN architectures were trained using the contrast divergence algorithm
[5]. Dropout [6] was found to improve their overall performance. For all these
models, best results were achieved using a learning rate of 0.01 with constant
decay of 3% after each epoch, a momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of 0.00005. At
the training phase, both the MICCAI and PRETERM datasets were augmented

90

by generating additional articial training images to prevent model overtting.
During training, we performed translation (16 pixels) and rotation (40 ) data
augmentation, which was found to yield better performance.

Experimental Results

This section presents an empirical evaluation of several LV endocardium segmentation algorithms using three performance metrics: good contours (GC) [1],
Dice index, and average perpendicular distance (APD) between manually drawn
and predicted contours [21]. In order to make our experimental results comparable with published studies on MICCAI dataset, all models were validated using
the online set, and we report on results obtained on the validation set. Table 1
summarises the experimental results. On the MICCAI dataset, the DBN-based
results presented in [17] include a Dice index of 0.88, a GC of 95.71% and an
APD of 2.34 mm whereas the pipeline described in [1] results in a Dice index
of 0.90, a GC of 90% and an APD of 2.84 mm (before further post-processing).
A comparable Dice index is obtained by both FCN and RFCN, which yield
higher GC and smaller ADP. Here RFCN outperforms FCN with a substantially
improved ADP of 2.05 mm.
The PRETERM dataset was modelled using the same architectures, without
further customisation. The results of this application are also summarised in
Table 1. For this dataset, we compared the performance of four dierent architectures: FCN, RFCN, DBN and RDBN. The latter two models were given as
input a region of interest containing the LV thus conferring them an advantage compared to FCN and RFCN. On this dataset we were not able to test
the recently proposed pipeline described in [1], which relies on multiple stages.
As in the MICCAI dataset, the fully convolutional architectures have achieved
superior performance. RFCN has outperformed all other architectures in terms
of Dice index and APD, which was found to be as small as 1.56 mm. In comparison, DBN with known LV location yields an APD of 2.05 mm. RDBN yields
higher GC and lower APD compared to DBN thus providing additional evidence
that performance gains can be obtained by modelling intra-slice dependences.
In order to shed insights into the regional improvements introduced by
RFCN, the Dice index was computed separately for dierent local regions of
the LV, and the results are summarised in Table 2. Here, Base-1, Base-2 and
Base-3 indicates that 1, 2 and 3 slices were taken starting from the base of
the heart and moving towards the middle, and analogously for the apex. All
the remaining slices contributed towards the Central class. In all cases, the Dice
index is calculated using all the samples at once to reect overall pixels accuracy.
In both datasets, RFCN outperforms FCN around the central slices and around
the apex, as expected. However, in the MICCAI dataset, FCN yields better performance around the base of the heart. On the PRETERM dataset, both DBN

MICCAI dataset, for completeness we also report on published results after a postprocessing stage based on level-sets. The DBN and RDBN models only performed
endocardium segmentation, not detection, i.e. they were applied to focused regions of
interest centered around the left-ventricle. All other architectures performed LV detection and endocardium segmentation from full short-axis slices.

Conclusions

In this paper we have investigated whether a single neural network architecture,
trained end-to-end, can deliver a fully-automated and accurate segmentation of
the left ventricle using a stack of MR short-axis images. The proposed architecture, RFCN, learns image features that are important for the localisation of the
LV in a sequential manner, going from the base to the apex of the heart, through
a recurrent modication of fully convolutional networks.
Experimental ndings obtained from two independent applications demonstrate that propagating information from adjacent slices can help extract
improved context information with positive eect on the resulting segmentation quality. The hypothetical value of the large inter-slice correlation has been
further tested by introducing a recurrent version of deep belief networks, and
veried with our results showing that RDBNs generally outperform DBNs on
the segmentation task, assuming the LV has already been localised. As expected,
notable improvements can be seen in the delineation of cardiac contours around
the apex, which are notoriously more dicult to identify.
One surprising nding was to note that performance of RFCN in apical slices
was better for MICCAI than for PRETERM cohort (0.85 vs. 0.76 Dice index in
the most apical slice, see Table 2), when one could expect the opposite: a regular
and homogeneous cohort, PRETERM, should lead to a better performance when
leveraging the inter-slice spatial dependence. This aspect will warrant further
investigations.

Compared to other models, RFCN has the advantage of carrying out both
LV detection and segmentation in a single architecture with clear computational benets and the potential for real-time application. In future work, we are
planning to investigate alternatives operations that can capture inter-slice correlations, such as 3D convolutions, and further extend RFCN by incorporating
a bi-directional mechanism for the inclusion of an inverse path (from the apex
to the base of the heart) as well as a temporal extension to handle all cardiac
phases at once.
