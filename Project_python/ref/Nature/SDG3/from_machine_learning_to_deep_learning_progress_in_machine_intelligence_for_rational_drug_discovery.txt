Machine intelligence, which is normally presented as artificial intelligence, refers to the intelligence
exhibited by computers. In the history of rational drug discovery, various machine intelligence
approaches have been applied to guide traditional experiments, which are expensive and timeconsuming. Over the past several decades, machine-learning tools, such as quantitative structure
activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, were developed that can identify potential biological active
molecules from millions of candidate compounds quickly and cheaply. However, when drug discovery
moved into the era of big data, machine learning approaches evolved into deep learning approaches,
which are a more powerful and efficient way to deal with the massive amounts of data generated from
modern drug discovery approaches. Here, we summarize the history of machine learning and provide
insight into recently developed deep learning approaches and their applications in rational drug
discovery. We suggest that this evolution of machine intelligence now provides a guide for early-stage
drug design and discovery in the current big data era.

Introduction
Computational tools have been developed and applied to drug
discovery as cost-effective alternatives to traditional experiment
protocols. The accurate identification of new hits from large
chemical libraries by computational models is desirable for the
pharmaceutical industry because it can reduce the costs and time
associated with experiments needed to obtain new drug candidates with optimized pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic
(PK/PD) properties [1]. Virtual screening (VS), which is a standard
computational approach, is widely used to guide rational drug
discovery [2]. Historically, machine-learning approaches, which
are one of the most important components of machine intelligence, have been used to generate various QSAR models for VS
over the past few decades [3]. The resulting models are based on
molecular structures and target activities, such as physicochemical

properties, therapeutic activities, and PK properties [4], which can
vary in the different stages of drug discovery.
The QSAR modeling procedure has been standardized across
rational drug discovery processes [5]. Given the improvements in
modeling approaches and the generation of descriptors, QSAR is
widely applied at all stages of preclinical studies. The original
hypothesis of QSAR (similar compounds have similar activities)
remains the foundation of all QSAR models developed so far.
However, although different types of descriptor and different
machine-learning methods used for QSAR modeling have their
own pros and cons, the resulting models still suffer same issues,
such as overfitting and active cliffs, which leads to the failure of
predicting new compounds, especially those with chemical structures that different compared with those in the training sets used
to develop QSAR models. Thus, new efforts are underway to make
QSAR more applicable for drug discovery by integrating new
modeling techniques. For example, currently the application of
an applicability domain is a necessary step in QSAR modeling and

the use of combinatorial QSAR avoids the potential problems
caused by using an individual approach [6].
Over the past decade, rapid advances in high-throughput
screening (HTS) techniques and relevant data-sharing protocols
have moved modern drug discovery into the big data era. In
addition, improvements in computational power resulting from
the development of computer science hardware make big data
modeling possible. The need for novel techniques, including data
mining/generation, curation, storage, management, and modeling, results in both new challenges in, and opportunities for, the
use of machine intelligence. Traditional QSAR approaches are not
suitable for use with big data, which are characterized by volume
(scale of data), velocity (growth of data), variety (diversity of
sources), and veracity (uncertainty of data). Compared with machine learning, deep learning approaches that explain the vanishing effects of gradients [7] are more suitable to use with raw highdimensional data. Therefore, as the result of data-driven and
computational power-driven studies, machine intelligence has
moved to a new position in drug discovery (Fig. 1). Here, we
review current state-of-the-art deep-learning studies in the context
of drug discovery and provide a brief summary of their advantages
and future perspectives.

QSAR approaches
QSAR approaches used in drug discovery can be classified as linear
and nonlinear techniques. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), for
example, introduced by Belhumeur in 1996 for pattern recognition and artificial intelligence [8], is a supervised machine-learning
method that is suitable for dealing with small data sets. LDA is a
classifier that considers a linear equation to maximize the

REVIEWS

between-class distance and minimize the within-class distance.
LDA has been used to predict drugdrug interactions [9], identify
new compounds [10], and detect adverse drug events [11], among
others. Although LDA is a simple approach, the combination of
LDA and novel descriptors is still considered a powerful modeling
method. For example, Marrero et al. used a LDA algorithm combined with topologic, 3D-chiral, topographic, and geometric
descriptors [10] to predict the antifungal activity of drugs and
yielded a higher accuracy compared with other nonlinear
approaches.
Support vector machines (SVMs) were proposed by Vapnik and
colleagues [12] for their ability to deal with high-dimensional
variables in small data sets. For linear problems, the SVM model
separates different categories by mapping points in space to maximize the margin between different classes of point [13]. For
nonlinear problems, SVMs use kernel mapping and transform
nonlinear data sets into a high-dimension feature space for linear
classification purposes. SVM has been widely applied for various
modeling purposes in drug discovery [14]. For example, Poorinmohammad et al. [13] combined the SVM approach with pseudo
amino acid composition descriptors to classify anti-HIV peptides,
with a prediction accuracy of 96.76%.
Decision trees (DTs) are a transparent and interpretable machine-learning approach. Generally, there are two essential steps
for the construction of decision trees: selecting attributes and
pruning. First, molecule attributes are selected as a test on a
molecule (e.g., whether the partition coefficient of the molecule
is >5). The selected attributes are viewed as internal nodes (including the root node and nonleaf nodes); the branch represents
the outcome of the test and the leaf node represents a classifica-

tion label. Second, to avoid overfitting and to decrease the complexity of the tree, pruning algorithms are used to trim the
generated tree. Recently, DTs were used to model absorption,
distribution, and metabolism properties [15] of drugs as well as
their toxicity [16]. For example, to evaluate the toxicity of volatile
organic compounds, Gupta and co-workers [16] used DT forest and
DT boost algorithms to model the sensory irritation potency of
volatile organic compounds. The former algorithm combined DTs
with the bagging technique, whereas the latter integrated DTs with
a gradient boosting algorithm; both models showed improvement
over standard DTs.
Random forest (RF) is an ensemble modeling approach that
operates by constructing multiple DTs as base learners. By introducing a random selection of features and the bagging idea [17],
each base learner further increases the test nodes and is trained by
random sampled subsets instead of by the original data set. The
final outcome is a consensus score from all individual DT outputs.
Compared with DTs, RF is less likely to overfit the data. RF has been
widely used for bioactivity classification [18], toxicity modeling
[19], proteinligand binding affinity prediction [20], and drug
target identification [21], among others. For example, Mistry
et al. [19] used RF and DTs to model the drugvehicle toxicity
relationship for the first time. Their data set included 227 093
potential drug candidates and 39 potential vehicles. The resulted
model predicted the toxicity relief of drugs by specific vehicles.
Wang et al. [20] used thee RF method to model the proteinligand
binding affinity between 170 complexes of HIV-1 proteases, 110
complexes of trypsin, and 126 complexes of carbonic anhydrase.
Furthermore, Kumari et al. improved RF by integrating bootstrap
and rotation feature matrix components and successfully discriminated human drug targets from nondrug targets [21].
The k nearest neighbor (kNN) is an unsupervised algorithm for
classification and regression [22]. In most cases, kNN is used for
classifications that operate by counting the class of k nearest
neighbors in the feature space. Thus, the kNN algorithm is one
of the most simple and easy to perform of all machine-learning
algorithms, and is normally integrated with other feature-selection algorithms. To identify antiviral drugs, Weidlich et al. [23]
applied kNN integrated with a simulated annealing method and
RF for 679 drug-like molecules. Their results showed that this
improved kNN model outperformed the RF models. Meanwhile,
the kNN approach was also applied to predict other bioactivities of
drug-like molecules [24].
Artificial neural networks (ANN), which simulate brain function, are an attractive and powerful modeling approach widely
used in recent drug discovery research. Based on their topological
structure, ANN approaches can be classified into four types: forward, backward, random, and self-organized networks. Among
these architectures, back propagation neural networks (BPNNs)
are one of the most popular ANN methods. BPNN, proposed by
Rumelhart and MeClelland, is a forward neural network with
multilayered perception [25]. It is a gradient-descendent method
that minimizes the mean-square errors of the difference between
the network outputs and the experimental data in the training set.
BPNN is characterized by robustness, superior fault tolerance,
parallel co-processing, self-organizing, and self-learning abilities.
BPNN has been applied not only in QSAR studies [26], but also in
chemometric analysis [27].

Combinatorial QSAR and hybrid QSAR
Although QSAR approaches have been developed for decades,
common issues remain that have not been solved by using any
existing approaches. For example, most traditional QSAR studies
have used a single modeling approach to develop a single model
based on one type of descriptor. In other cases, when multiple
QSAR models have been available, the model selection has always
been performed based on statistics obtained from training sets
(e.g., cross-validation). However, previous studies have shown that
model performance based on training sets has a poor correlation
with the external predictions of new compounds [28]. Thus,
traditional QSARs that aim to develop a single model and/or select
a single model based on training set performance for prediction
purpose are questionable.
Compared with traditional QSAR modeling procedures (e.g.,
modeling by using one statistical tool and one type of descriptors),
recent modeling studies in drug discovery have focused on predictions based on a combination of various types of model (by
using different statistical tools and different types of chemical
descriptor). Normally for a data set containing enormous and
diverse compounds, an individual model would only cover part
of its chemical and/or biological diversity. Consensus modeling
based on a combinatorial QSAR (combi-QSAR) workflow take
advantages of the output information obtained from various
available individual models and fully explores the diverse chemical and/or biological information provided by a large training set.
The combi-QSAR strategy has been applied to model various
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties [29], the toxicity of drug molecules [30], and to select and
design new drug candidates [31]. As a tradeoff, combi-QSAR
modeling is more time-consuming than the development of a
single model.
Another common issue related to QSAR modeling is the existence of active cliffs [32]. QSAR modeling cannot deal with the
situation whereby two compounds have similar structures but
different activities, because it is against the basic hypothesis that
similar compounds have similar activities. In some early QSAR
studies, additional physicochemical properties, such as partition
coefficients (logP) [33], water solubility [34], and melting point
[35], were used successfully to augment computed chemical
descriptors and improve the predictive power of QSAR models.
These studies suggest that experimental results obtained from lowcost experimental testing can be used as extra biological descriptors in QSAR modeling to help resolve the active cliffs issue. Over
the past decade, the rapidly expanding HTS data sets available for
large and diverse chemical libraries make it possible to extend the
scope of conventional chemical descriptors in QSAR modeling to
new hybrid descriptors, including both chemical descriptors and
biological descriptors. Therefore, in recent drug discovery studies,
models were generated based on new hybrid descriptors. For
example, Kim et al. and Wang et al. showed that the oral bioavailability and bloodbrain barrier (BBB) models can be improved by
including biological descriptors of membrane transportations
[36,37]. In this new modeling strategy, the target properties of
modeling are still biological activities in drug discovery, but the
content and interpretation of descriptors and the resulting models are different. This modeling focuses on the prediction of the
same target property from different (chemical, biological, and

Drug Discovery Today  Volume 22, Number 11  November 2017

genomic) characteristics of drugs and provides a unique opportunity to take advantage of both chemical and biological information relating to drug molecules.

Advances in rational drug discovery resulting from
deep learning
In the current era of big data and combined with the development
of advanced screening protocols (e.g., HTS) and large chemical
libraries, the amount of biological data is increasing dramatically.
The availability of large data sets and their processing using
graphics processing units (GPU) have promoted the development
of new modeling approaches. In 2006, Hinton et al. introduced the
deep belief networks that made it possible to construct nets with
many hidden layers [7]. This resulted in a new theory and caught
the attention of many researchers and leading pharmaceutical
companies. The concept of deep learning originated from the
ANN approach, in which feedforward neural networks combined
with many hidden layers are thought of as deep neural networks
[38]. Deep learning comprises simple but nonlinear processing
units that each transform the representations or features at one
level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher,
more representative level [39]. Thus, the deep learning approach is
a representation-learning method that results in learning multiple
levels of representations from low- to high-level features. For
example, to recognize images, deep learning networks can learn
color information from raw pixel inputs in the first layer and then
transform color information to edges of objects in the next layer.
Without manually selecting the molecular descriptors, deep learning methods automatically select representations from raw, highdimension, and heterogeneous data, which is exactly what big
data modeling requires [40]. Thus, this is likely to result in deep
learning being widely used in various aspects of research, such as
image recognition, speech recognition, video games, as well as
model development in drug discovery [41]. The most commonly
used networks are convolutional neural networks (CNN), stacked
autoencoders, deep belief networks (DBN), and restricted Boltzmann machines. As a relatively new approach, its applications in
drug discovery can be summarized as follows: (i) new drug molecule identification; (ii) protein engineering; (iii) gene expression
data analysis; and (iv) pharmacodynamics modeling.

New drug molecule identification
Identifying new drug candidates from large chemical libraries with
computational models (e.g., VS) is an effective and feasible way to
facilitate the drug discovery process. Generally, deep learning

methods can also be used in this approach [42,43] to perform
VS [4446]. For example, Pereira et al. introduced a novel deep
learning-based VS method, called DeepVS [44]. They performed
docking with 40 receptors and 2950 ligands, and compared the
results with 95 316 decoys. The docking outputs were used to train
deep CNN that could rank the list of ligands for each receptor. The
results showed that DeepVS achieved the best performance
reported for the VS of these 40 receptors. Similarly, deep learning
can also be used to generate focused molecule libraries [47] or new
molecular fingerprints [48] and to model PK properties of potential
drugs [49].

Protein engineering
Protein engineering involves developing and simulating proteins
using computers. Recently, researchers used deep learning
approaches to explore and discover protein structures and functions. To uncover protein functions, many efforts have been
made to simulate interactions between proteins and other biological molecules (e.g., DNA). For example, Hassanzadeh et al.
used a recurrent convolutional network to predict the binding
specificity of proteins to different DNA loci. They utilized data
from in vitro high-throughput experiments to evaluate their
modeling. This modeling approach was shown to be the most
accurate for detecting the binding preference between two proteins and individual DNA subregions [50]. Deep learning methods can also be used to predict biological functions of proteins
directly from their raw 3D electron density and electrostatic
potential fields [51].

Gene expression data analysis
With the emergence of next-generation sequencing technology,
massive amounts of heterogeneous genomics data can fit well with
the requirements of deep learning methods. Thus, deep learning
methods have been used in precision medicine development [52],
sequence specification prediction [53], and genomics modeling for
drug repurposing [54]. For example, Aliper et al. [54] used transcriptional response data to predict the therapeutic categories of
drugs. In their study, they used gene-level data of 26 420 drug
perturbation samples belonging to 12 therapeutic categories
across three cell lines. They integrated the gene expression profiles
and pathway activation scores as new features into a deep
neural network (DNN) modeling approach, which generated the
highest classification accuracy compared with other traditional
approaches. They also showed that DNN can accurately predict
the category of drugs with different PK and PD conditions.

PD modeling is vital to determine the interactions between drugs
and their associated targets. Given the diversity of drug molecules
and their targets, the potential drugprotein interactions are also
complex and have many potential conformations. Recently, deep
learning methods were used to predict the interactions of different
complexes, such as drugprotein [55] and homogenous complexes
[56]. In a recent report, Wen et al. [55] used DBN to predict drug
target interactions. To identify new drugtarget interaction pairs,
they used 2 146 240 drugprotein interaction pairs that contained
approved drugs and targets without separating them into different
classes. The resulted recall (predicted positive pairs/number of
samples) obtained by DBN and RF were 13.6% and 1.1%, respectively, which highlighted the improved potential of deep learning
methods in finding new drugtarget interactions compared with
QSAR approaches.

Concluding remarks and future perspectives
Machine intelligence has been applied in the drug discovery field
for decades. Traditional machine-learning modeling has evolved
into a variety of new methods, such as combi-QSAR and hybrid
QSAR, and remains a popular approach to study various drugrelated topics. There are various drugs on the market and/or in
clinical trials that have been designed by machine-learning or
other computational methods (Table 1) [5760].
Despite the advantages and popularity of using machine-learning approaches (e.g., QSAR) in modeling studies, machine intelligence has, in some instances, been replaced by deep learning in
recent years. The development of deep learning methods is driven
by the accumulation of massive amounts of biomedical data and

Drug Discovery Today  Volume 22, Number 11  November 2017

the powerful parallel computing capacity of GPUs. Importantly,
deep learning methods can deal with complex tasks based on large,
heterogeneous, and high-dimensional data sets without the need
for human input. These methods have been shown to be useful in
many practical and commercial applications, including drug discovery studies.
Although deep learning is a promising new technique in
machine intelligence, deep learning methods and their related
studies still have some limitations. First, the availability of a large
amount of high-quality data will affect the performance and
reliability of deep learning modeling. The massive amounts of
biomedical data generated by pharmaceutical companies are
normally not available to the public but are kept as expensive
private commercial assets. Second, a lack of rational interpretations of associated biological mechanisms is another limitation of
models generated by deep learning methods. Although they have
been shown to have high prediction accuracies, deep learning
models still perform as black boxes that are difficult to use to
reveal the biological mechanisms integrated in the data used for
modeling.
Overall, as a newly developed machine intelligence technique,
deep learning has demonstrated the potential for use in the new
big data era of drug discovery. With more data becoming available
and new approaches being developed, deep learning methods will
become a major computer-aided drug design (CADD) approach in
the near future.
