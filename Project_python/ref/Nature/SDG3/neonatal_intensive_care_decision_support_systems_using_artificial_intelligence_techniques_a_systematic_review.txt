Abstract A neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) provides critical services to preterm and
high-risk infants. Over the years, many tools and techniques have been introduced to support
the clinical decisions made by specialists in the NICU. This study systematically reviewed
the different technologies used in neonatal decision support systems (DSS), including cognitive analysis, artificial neural networks, data mining techniques, multi-agent systems, and
highlighted their role in patient diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and healthcare management. Articles on NICU DSS were surveyed, Searches were based on the PubMed, Science
Direct, and IEEE databases and only English articles published after 1990 were included.
The overall search strategy was to retrieve articles that included terms that were related to
NICU Decision Support Systems or Artificial Intelligence and Neonatal. Different
methods and artificial intelligence techniques used in NICU decision support systems were
assessed and related outcomes, variables, methods and performance measures was reported
and discussed. Because of the dynamic, heterogeneous, and real-time environment of the
NICU, the processes and medical rules that are followed within a NICU are complicated,
and the data records that are produced are complex and frequent. Therefore, a single tool or
technology could not cover all the needs of a NICU. However, it is important to examine and
deploy new temporal data mining approaches and system architectures, such as multi-agent
systems, services, and sensors, to provide integrated real-time solutions for NICU.

1 Introduction
The first month is the most important period for a childs survival. According to WHO (World
Health Organization), 45% of deaths that occur in children less than 5 years old happen in the
first 28 days of life. Over the past 25 years, the percentage of neonatal deaths has increased
in all WHO regions. In recent years, there have been great improvements in the development
and use of new tools, technologies, and neonatal monitoring techniques. These advances have
caused the neonatal mortality rate to decrease, although statistics have shown no reduction
in the mortality rate for preterm, low weight, and neonates born after labor complications
(Frize et al. 2003).
In a NICU, treatment decision-making is a very complicated and critical task, as healthcare providers are concerned with allocating medical resources and treatment according to a
patients medical condition (Frize et al. 2011). Information technology has been widely used
in medical diagnosis and treatment as a decision-making tool. Using artificial intelligence
and data mining tools can increase the patients quality of care by providing early warnings
for high-risk neonates (Frize et al. 2001, 2003). NICU decision support systems have been
designed for two main reasons: to predict the risk of mortality and to measure the performance
of medical services. Multi-agent systems are intelligent, autonomous, and collaborative system components that can be used to negotiate, manage, and improve healthcare processes.
They are considered to be part of the distributed problem-solving solution and collaborate
to achieve a common goal. Over the years, multi-agent systems have been widely used in
healthcare modeling, process management, and DSS (Santos et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2009).
They have also been applied in intensive care units (ICUs) (Foster et al. 2005).
The main research question on this study is: what are the current state-of-the-art artificial
intelligence techniques used in NICU. Addressing this question would help designing and
developing new tools and solutions for neonatal care at NICU. In this paper, articles that
discussed the methods and technologies used in NICU DSS were reviewed. These methods
included cognitive analysis, artificial neural networks (ANNs), data mining classification
techniques, fuzzy Logic and biosensors (as DSS input media). A review of multi-agent
systems, as a new approach for NICU DSS, was also performed.

2 Method
In this study, articles on NICU DSS were examined. Searches were performed in the PubMed,
ScienceDirect, and IEEE databases. Only English articles published after 1990 were included.
The overall search strategy was to retrieve articles that included terms related to NICU DSS
or Neonatal Decision Support Systems in the title or abstract. PubMed articles published
within the past 10 years included the terms Artificial Intelligence and NICU in the title
or abstract were also included.
We categorized the resulting articles based on the main method and technology employed
in the NICU DSS, which included cognitive analysis, ANN, classification techniques, multiagent systems, fuzzy logic, and biosensors. A search for relevant articles in each category
was then performed to enrich the discussion. A total of 90 articles were found in the initial
database search of which 24 articles were excluded after a title review; 10 articles were
excluded after their abstracts were read. Relevant articles in each category were then added.
Articles were excluded if they concentrated on medical aspects without using information
technology, studied metabolic modeling, used mechanical tools in the NICU, or used text

Neonatal intensive care decision support systems using

Different artificial intelligence methods and technologies used in the NICU DSS were
assessed. Cognitive analysis, with the main goal of improving system usability, was applied to
NICU DSS, while an ANN was used as an evidence-based medical tool that used knowledge
from past medical outcomes to make predictions about neonatal mortality, length of stay,
and artificial ventilation duration. Data warehouse technology was used to create a multidimensional neonatal data repository of heterogeneous databases that could be used with
a data mining platform. The real time, modular, proactive, and complicated nature of the
NICU environment requires the use of new technologies and software solutions, such as
service-oriented architecture (SOA) and multi-agent systems. Providing data analysis in a
service-oriented fashion and the real-time monitoring of infants in the NICU were also
addressed in some articles (Frize et al. 2001; Khazaei et al. 2015a, b).

4 Discussion
4.1 Cognitive analysis in NICU DSS
Designing medical systems that represent knowledge require cognitive analysis to model
a representation of a users mental information and their attitude toward computer-based
systems (Frize et al. 2011). One of the main goals of using cognitive analysis in a clinical DSS
is to fill the gap between a users mental attitude in a particular context with one presented by
the DSS. Hence, cognitive analysis is used to integrate and adopt clinical decision systems into
NICUs. However, as newly designed systems might not be accepted by healthcare providers
and users, it is important to assess the usability of a system (Baxter et al. 2005).
Cognitive task analysis (CTA) was used to integrate a fuzzy logic based respiratory expert
system (FLORENCE), into NICU workflow (Baxter et al. 2005). Using CTA, factors affecting
the systems adoption and usefulness were obtained. CTA included analyzing the NICU
workflow specifications and the users tasks. System alarms had to be clear and understandable
to users and the system had to have explanatory abilities so that it was reliable and acted as
expected.
The critical decision method (CDM) was used in CTA for knowledge elicitation and for
deriving user decision-making steps. The CDM was based on naturalistic decision-making
and was used for case-based reasoning. For example, CDM was used to develop training
materials for identifying neonatal sepsis (Hoffman et al. 1998; Patel eta l. 2001). Using
CTA involved an analysis of the physical and social work using a light-weight rich picture
representation to demonstrate the roles and responsibilities of people working with the system
(Baxter et al. 2005). The final step involved observations, which provided further insight for
the project.
Cognitive analysis was also used in the DSS for ordering antibiotics (Sheehan et al. 2012).
The analysis was made using Normans theory of action. The distance between the users
goal and the actions provided by the system was calculated in terms of semantic distance,
articulatory distance, and issue distance. The cognitive study design involved two methods: a
cognitive walkthrough and a think-aloud protocol. In order to identify the usability problems
during the cognitive walkthrough, Nielsens ten usability heuristics were applied.
Natural language processing (NLP) was applied on patient notes in order to identify a
discharge cohort in the NICU. The results showed that combining classification algorithms
with NLP improved the discharge prediction model (Temple et al. 2016).

J. S. Malak et al.

The NICU workflows vary between hospitals. Cognitive analysis can reduce the conflict
between what healthcare providers expect to see and what they actually see. One of the
problems identified during DSS cognitive analysis was the availability of information while
it was required by a healthcare provider. Another problem occurred when the system recommendations were not clear and understandable. Users must have enough skills, knowledge,
and training to use the system to its full advantage.

4.2 Classification techniques in NICU DSS
An ANN gains knowledge through a learning process and stores that knowledge by updating
the neuron interconnection weights. It learns the input/output relationship patterns from
existing data and evolves by learning new available data. ANNs model existing data and
predict outcomes based on new data (Walker and Frize 2004). A trained ANN is considered
to be the knowledge base in DSS. ANNs can be applied to evidence-based medicine because
they base their predictions on previous data (Mueller et al. 2004). ANNs are widely used in
ICUs and in the field of neonatal care; they are mainly used to predict infant mortality and the
length of stay in the NICU (Frize et al. 2001, 2010). An ANN can also be used in the ICU to
predict medical outcomes. For example, the mortality, duration of artificial ventilation, and
length of stay were predicted for adults using the back-propagation algorithm. Although it is
a popular classification algorithm and is considered to be easy to use, the back-propagation
algorithm has the problem of overfitting data. To overcome this problem, weight-elimination,
adaptive parameters, and momentum have been used.
The Medical Information Technology Group developed risk models of illness and complications and integrated these models for neonates, adults, and preterm births (Frize et al.
2005). The group introduced a multi-layer perceptron neural network to predict mortality,
length of stay, and duration of ventilation. An interactive decision-making tool was also proposed to allow parents and specialists to be involved using a conceptual framework for NICU
knowledge management (Frize et al. 2005). The outcome estimation was implemented using
an ANN in an evidence-based estimation block; the correlation between the indicators and
outcomes was analyzed using an ANN with diagnostic data to predict mortality, length of stay,
and artificial ventilation. Information about the patients condition, healthcare specialist, and
parent perception was stored in a knowledge repository and enhanced the decision-making
process by interacting with the parents. Design options for a NICU DSS with physicianparent involvement were discussed (Frize et al. 2011) and implemented (Frize et al. 2005), which
resulted in a more complete web-based user interface and mobile-based interface. Drupal was
used as an open source extensible tool for content management. Patient medical data were
stored in a clinical data repository (CDR), which managed the admission/discharge and transfer of data, lab results, and medical measurements from patient monitors. The International
Patient Decision Aids Standard (IPADS) was applied to the web-based DSS questionnaire
to ensure that the DSS did not replace expert consultation. A physician and parent decision
support tool (PPADS) was developed, which enabled the physician to view the patients
condition and the parents allowed to view neonate information activated by the physicians
(Weyand et al. 2011). The tool improved decision-making efficiency in ethically conflicting
situations and provided better family-centered care and usability (Frize et al. 2013).
An extubation DSS was introduced to predict extubation outcomes using an ANN (Mueller
et al. 2004). The performance of the ANN was compared with statistical modeling using
multivariate logistic regression (MLP) and with the clinicians expertise. The accuracy of the
models was compared using ROC curves. In this model, a multilayer feed-forward neural
network was used. Another study applied an ANN model to predict the effect of palivizumab

123

on neonatal mortality, days of supplemental oxygen, and length of NICU stay during an
outbreak of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Saadah et al. 2014).
As the complexity of an ANN increases, it is important to reduce training, to increase
performance, and to prevent the network from overfitting. The impact of misprediction must
be considered when using ANNs to forecast clinical outcomes, for example, the impact of a
misprediction of mortality is different from one about the length of stay in an NICU. Outcome
predictions that involve patients lives are more critical than those dealing with managerial
issues.
One study classified the health condition of neonates and their vital parameters using
SVM (Agarwal and Pandey 2012). In the research, a physiological data warehouse model
was presented and utilized using data mining techniques. The data warehouse was built
using a star schema with seven dimensions: systolic blood pressure (SBP), arterial blood
oxygen tension (Pa O2 ), cardiac pulse rate, scenography monitor data (CMD), ventilation
data for the respiration rate and body temperature. Data preprocessing, which included signal
preprocessing and feature preprocessing, and data fusion techniques were applied before
loading the data to the warehouse.
A neonatal prediction model was developed using C5.0 algorithm to build a decision trees
(Gilchrist et al. 2011). This model applied a probabilistic algorithm to handle the missing
values. To predict mortality, 18 SNAP (Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology) attributes
were selected. The results of this research showed that using data collected within 48 h of the
patients admission to the NICU produced the best results, while the use of large data sets
with 12-h time segments had less specificity.
Classification techniques using a SVM classifier have been applied in neonatal seizure
detection systems (Ansari et al. 2015; Temko et al. 2015b). The classifier was trained on normalized data and the output was converted to posterior probabilities and filtered with a moving
average filter (MAF) (Temko et al. 2011a). In another study (Thomas et al. 2008), basic gradient descent (BGD), least mean squares (LMS), and Newton least mean squares (NLMS)
were used to detect seizures, achieving 84.51, 84.72, and 84.02% accuracy respectively. Other
studies used a combination of patient-dependent and patient-independent classifiers to detect
seizures using SVM and Gaussian mixture models (Ahmed et al. 2012; Temko et al. 2017). A
patient-independent system has no prior knowledge of the data from the patient being tested,
while patient-dependent models use portions of the patient data for training. The blended
adaptive model achieved 97.03% AUC.
SVM was also applied in a multimodal predictor of neurodevelopmental outcome in newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (Temko et al. 2015a) and an accuracy of 84%
was reported. The severity of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy was predicted based on the
electroencephalography (EEG) of neonates using SVM and achieved an accuracy of 87%
(Ahmed et al. 2016). Kernel-based SVM methods were also applied for the classification of
neonatal sleep states (Koolen et al. 2017). Random forest (RF) classification achieved the
highest accuracy in amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) classification for
monitoring the functional state of the brain (Koolen et al. 2017). One study examined nine
machine learning classification techniques for detecting late-onset neonatal sepsis, including
SVM, nave Bayes (NB), tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN), averaged one-dependence estimators (AODE), k-nearest neighbor, classification and regression trees (CART), RF, logistic
regression (LR), and lazy bayesian rules (LBR) (Mani et al. 2014). The model used laboratory, clinical, and microbiological data and the AODE algorithms achieved the highest
sensitivity (88%).
Old knowledge extraction methods takes advantage of the rule-based expert systems, In
this way, an infants clinical data can be captured and the necessary intervention is suggested

123

with the help of the rule-based DSS (Heermann and Thompson 1997) or parental nutrition
solutions can be prescribed for an infant in the NICU (Foster et al. 2005; Khazaei et al.
2015a).
Decision trees and some basic classification algorithms are not able to handle multiple time
segmented data sets associated with one patient and, thus, it is hard to distinguish high-risk
patient data from normal data. Other prediction techniques, such as an ANN, can overcome
these barriers. Different classification techniques have been applied to detect neonatal seizures
and it is believed that each classifier, if properly used by skilled practitioners, may reach
similar levels of performance (Temko and Lightbody 2016).

4.3 Multi-agent systems in NICU DSS
Multi-agent systems are a subdomain of artificial intelligence; they are composed of agents
that collaborate and negotiate with each other to solve a problem or achieve a goal. Multiagent systems are used in two areas in ICU DSS: clinical management and clinical research
(Foster et al. 2005). Clinical management multi-agent systems are used to identify specific
medical conditions, diagnostics, and patient treatments, while clinical research-based multiagent systems extract data, relationships, patterns, and trends. However, only a few proposed
multi-agent systems are used in the NICU.
Multi-agent technology can be used for real-time warnings and alerts in the case of an
abnormality in a wide range of neonatal data. An agent-based intelligent DSS was developed
for a NICU (Foster and McGregor 2006), physiological data were analyzed and new trends
were detected through an agent server architecture, which provided agent communication
by passing requests between the service consumers and providers and validating the communication. The FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) Agent Communication
Language (ACL) and the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML) standards
were used. Access to multiple databases was managed by the agent server through a web
service that acted as a database server in collecting and converting the data. The proposed
architecture could be extended to support other ICUs.

4.4 Fuzzy logic in NICU DSS
Fuzzy logic has been widely applied to deal with the vagueness and uncertainty of medical
data. Fuzzy logic has also been used to assess the risk of neonatal mortality (Nascimento and
Ortega 2002; Nascimento et al. 2009; Safdari et al. 2016; Shimomura et al. 1994). In one
study, a fuzzy expert computing model was designed to predict the risk of neonatal mortality;
the model achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 83 and 97%, respectively (Safdari et al.
2016). In another studythe authors introduced a fuzzy model to estimate the possibility of
mortality using few variables, including birth weight, gestational age, Apgar score, and report
of stillbirth (Nascimento et al. 2009); the model had a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity
of 98%. The fuzzy model used in (Nascimento and Ortega 2002) avoided the variability of
parameters in the analysis of a newborns condition and the model was compared with an
expert opinion and there was a strong correlation between the results (r  0.96).
A fuzzy linguistic model was also proposed to predict neonatal death, the model was tested
using 100 cases and resulted in 81% accuracy, which was less than the accuracy obtained
using other well-known neonatal severity scoring systems, such as CRIB and SNAP-PE,
which had an accuracy of 90% (Chaves and Nascimento 2014). An expert system was built
by applying fuzzy theory to Apgar scoring system (Shimomura et al. 1994); the system used

123

Neonatal intensive care decision support systems using

three groups of knowledge (inexperienced, expert, and expert neonatologist) and the highest
sensitivity belonged to the expert neonatologist knowledge base.
Fuzzy models are very simple and have a low computing cost, which makes them a
good option for development of a prediction model (Nascimento et al. 2009). The inference
method used in most fuzzy models is minimum of mamdanies. Mamdani fuzzy models are
based on expert experience (Nascimento and Ortega 2002). One of the barriers to using
fuzzy models is that the number of fuzzy rules grows exponentially, which affects the performance of the expert system. Another barrier is that the model outcome may change by
adding variables. However, this approach has provided promising results in several medical
applications.

4.5 Biosensors in NICU DSS
The NICU is a dynamically changing environment in which heterogeneous technologies
interact with each other. Biosensors are widely employed in neonatal monitoring systems;
multiple parameters of neonates are monitored in the NICU and are considered to be input
data for DSS. These parameters include ECG, heart rate, respiratory blood pressure, blood
oxygen saturation (O2Sat), body temperature, and cerebral function monitoring (CFM). The
vital signs and physiological data of the patients are gathered through the interoperability
of medical devices, personal health devices, and neonatal applications to make the clinical
data available for medical decisions (Chen 2012). Thus, sensors, tools, and services need to
interact with each other in a distributed environment, and these technologies must be able
to provide integrated NICU solutions. One study introduced a new monitoring approach
in which the NICU was considered to be an assembly of services and devices that had
the ability to respond to the specific requirements of the setting (Piccini et al. 2008). The
researchers developed a prototype platform that included a BioBelt, which was made
of embedded sensors to monitor the heart rate, body movement, and temperature. They
also introduced a graphical interface called Assembly Browser that allowed doctors to
compare different parameters from different devices to obtain more accurate monitoring
results.
A prototype application, called BioAssembly, was proposed in another study and consisted of a BioBelt prototype developed within the project (Grnvall et al. 2007). The
prototype system relied on the SOA, which built up the system by self-contained units that
solved tasks through interconnections. The open architecture was integrated with other standard medical devices for monitoring newborns.
Medical device data should be integrated and sharable with other health information
systems in the NICU, and standard data formats should be defined for CDSS input and
outputs. An XML schema with the capabilities of defining, detecting, and generating clinical
alerts for NICU has been proposed (Catley et al. 2003). Sensor systems that evaluated and
calibrated neonatal incubators were made using ANNs (de Arajo et al. 2013). The presented
proposal reduces number of sensors, and the calibration necessity can be diagnosed in real
time without the presence of technical professionals.
The ISO/IEEE 11073 family of medical/health device communication standards was proposed to provide device interoperability. The main architecture of this standard was divided
into three models. The domain information model (DIM) embedded information inside the
device agent by describing an abstract model composed of a set of objects that could be
referenced in a communication. The service model (SM) provided methods to access data
that were shared between agents and managed the interchange of the DIM data. The com-

123

J. S. Malak et al.

munication model (CM) described the network architecture in which agents communicated
via a point-to-point connection (Chen 2012).

5 Conclusion
Neonatal technologies can save premature infants and infants with a low birth weight. Treatments for infants are normally based on an estimation of their health condition. In this study,
a review of technologies that were used in neonatal NICU DSS was performed. These technologies included cognitive analysis, ANNs, and data mining techniques. There was also an
emphasis on the use of multi-agent systems as a new approach for NICU DSS.
An ANN uses machine-learning techniques that are inspired by the natural nervous system;
learning from past data makes ANN a great tool for evidence-based medicine. However, ANN
may underperform statistical methods in comparison with other applications (Mueller et al.
2004).
Neonatal medical records at a NICU may consist of large paper files containing abnormal
variations in measured parameters and medical data that may not be recorded in the notes.
Currently, many NICU devices have the ability to output physiological parameters, such
as vital signs and EEG signals, as high frequency multidimensional data streams, as the
frequency and complexity of these data streams increase, it becomes more difficult to identify
patterns and trends (Christina Catley et al. 2008; Moskovitch and Shahar 2005). Temporal
abstraction (TA) is considered crucial for monitoring and performing diagnostic tasks, such as
medical time-stamped NICU data analysis. NICU time series data features could be extracted
as high-level abstract data views using expert rules or data mining approaches, such as hidden
Markov models and SVMs with sequential kernels, to capture patterns (Ahmed et al. 2017;
Temko and Lightbody 2016). The big data characteristic of medical data and the requirement
of real-time data analysis in the NICU call for cloud-based analysis solutions and providing
data analysis and live monitoring in a service-oriented fashion (Khazaei et al. 2015a, b).
Neonatal healthcare providers need to access guidelines and clinical DSS and, thus, there
is a great predilection to use and adapt modern technologies. However, while there is a fear
that CDSS is complicated and needs more working time, it is important to consider these
barriers when designing neonatal CDSS.
Assessing healthcare outcomes, costs, and effectiveness can be performed using DSS that
are based on scoring systems, such as the patient classification system (PCS) and the Acuity
Index Method (AIM). In one study, the cost-related elements of care in the NICU were
evaluated and the results showed that the PCS score was highly correlated with the length of
stay, resource utilization, and hospital charges (Kotagal et al. 1995).
Predictions of medical outcomes and resource utilization can be made using case-based
reasoning techniques in which the closest matching case to the newly admitted patient is
selected. In one study, a case-based reasoning algorithm was adopted for a NICU and the
results indicated that the inference engine selected the closest pattern at the case base to the
new admitted infant (Frize and Walker 2000).
The differences between the outcome measures in the NICU should be considered, for
example, prediction of the neonatal length of stay is used for economic and organization reasons, while predictions of neonatal mortality and duration of ventilation deal with a patients
life (Frize et al. 2001; Townsend and Frize 2008). Some DSS systems are not designed for
real-time decision-making (Cerqueira et al. 2014), but can be used for the analysis and correlation of parameters and to determine how outcomes are influenced by the parameters.

Neonatal intensive care decision support systems using

It is difficult to compare neonatal decision support algorithms when there are no publicly
available data sets and algorithms (Temko and Lightbody 2016).
The environment in a NICU is complicated and the data records that are produce are
complex and frequent. Therefore, a single tool or technology could not cover all the needs of
a NICU. It is important to examine and develop new temporal data mining approaches and
system architectures, such as multi-agent systems, services, and sensors, to provide integrated
real-time NICU solutions.
