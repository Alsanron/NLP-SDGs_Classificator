Despite extensive research demonstrating the benets of applying cost-effective conservation techniques, such
as optimization, a large gap remains between the evidence from research and the actions of professions as
they design and implement conservation programs. This study examines this gap through an international survey of conservation professionals who are familiar with cost-effective conservation techniques. The primary results of this study, replicate previous results from a smaller sample of agricultural preservation professionals, and
show that the vast majority of survey respondents viewed cost-effectiveness as a virtue, but ultimately do not
consider it as important as other program design criteria. These results reinforce the idea that advocates of
cost-effective conservation need to address concerns about fairness and transparency and remedy gaps in the
knowledge and expertise of professionals involved. Finally, the lack of incentive to conservation professionals
to change their practices is a challenge that calls for public pressure and encouragement for experimentation
and evidence-based policy to improve the cost effectiveness of conservation.

1. Introduction
Research has consistently shown that organizations with the most
severely limited budgets have the most to gain from adopting cost-effective conservation (CEC). CEC is a project-selection process that incorporates both benets and costs to maximize the conservation outcomes
generated by available funds (see for instance, Underhill, 1994; Babcock
et al., 1997; Balmford et al., 2000; Polasky et al., 2001, Naidoo et al.,
2006; Sarkar et al., 2006). Over the past couple of decades, a substantial
literature has developed that advocates for applying CEC techniques,
such as optimization through mathematical programming, to enable
conservation professionals to select a set of projects that maximizes
the organizations objectives for a given budget (see for instance,
Babcock et al., 1997; Polasky et al., 2001; Ferraro, 2003; Wu et al.,
2001). Despite the many studies that have identied the benets of
CEC, conservation professionals remain wary (Arponen et al., 2010;
Gowdy et al., 2010) and its application is limited. This lack of application
is perplexing to economics, which has a core principal of studying the
behavior given limited resources. Previous work by Messer et al.
(2016a) suggests that part of the problem is that conservation professionals do not consider cost effectiveness a priority and lack incentives
to adopt new practices that could improve the cost effectiveness of conservation efforts. This research seeks to replicate the approach used by

Messer et al. (2016a) by expanding the sample to an international
group of professionals engaged in a variety of conservation activities.
This research thus addresses the question of why conservation practitioners, who have dedicated their professional lives to environmental
conservation, have not adopted cost effective selection techniques that
would enable limited budgets to be further stretched to achieve greater
environmental benets.
In general, CEC methods consider both the benets and the costs associated with each potential project and identify a set of projects that
provides the greatest aggregate benet possible (the most bang for
the buck). Optimization delivers CEC by using a set of mathematical
programming algorithms adopted from operations research, including
binary linear programming (BLP) and goal programming, to systematically address complexities (see for instance, Underhill, 1994; Babcock et
al., 1997; Balmford et al., 2000; Polasky et al., 2001; Naidoo et al., 2006;
Sarkar et al., 2006). Despite extensive research demonstrating the advantages of applying optimization techniques and efforts to acquaint
conservation organizations with them, conservation professionals generally have not adopted cost-effective methods of project selection.
Currently, conservation programs throughout the world rely mostly
on benet-targeting (BT), also referred to as rank-based method
(Babcock et al., 1997, Messer and Borchers, 2015). BT involve constructing an index of potential benets and associated weights from offered
projects. For example, US federal conservation efforts have typically
used BTsuch as the selections for acquisition to the national parks system and for forest preservation (Babcock et al., 1997, Wu et al., 2017).

140

BT ranks each project according to the environmental benets provided
and sequentially selects the highest-ranking projects until the budget is
exhausted (Ferraro, 2003). BT performs best when the benets of various projects vary more than the costs of those projects (Babcock et al.,
1997). This benet-only method is not cost-effective because it ignores
cost as a selection criterion. BT can result in budgets quickly being
exhausted by a few high-ranking but relatively expensive projects.
While optimization through mathematical programming will always achieve the highest aggregate benets for a given budget (assuming that the benets are measured accurately), another CEC technique is
benet-cost targeting (BCT) which selects projects with the largest benet-cost ratio until the budget is exhausted. BCT computes the greatest
benet per dollar and achieves greater cost-effectiveness than BT
(Babcock et al., 1997; Ferraro, 2003; Duke et al., 2015). In most cases,
CEC and BCT will yield identical selection sets, except in cases involving
large budget remainders (Duke et al., 2013; Messer, 2006). For instance
in the context of farmland conservation, Wang and Swallow, 2016
found that BCT and optimization yielded very similar outcomes when
focusing on associated benets and costs, parcel numbers, and number
of acres. These authors note that when a government or agency wants to
achieve more specic goals optimization is usually better than BCT. A
handful of conservation programs at the state level (Messer et al.,
2016b) and the federal level (Wu et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2001) have
used variants of BCT to achieve CEC.
This research seeks to understand why CEC does not have widespread use by conservation professionals. Researchers have pointed
out several obstacles for CEC. For instance, Sullivan et al. (2004) identied political process and perceptions of fairness by various groups as
major obstacles. Gardner (1977) argued for the importance of accurately measuring the external benets when designing conservation policies while other researchers have raised a variety of concerns about
the difculty in accurately capturing and quantifying these environmental amenities in the context of CEC (Arponen et al., 2010; Bryan,
2010; Gowdy et al., 2010; Bryan et al., 2011). Conservation professionals
may resist adopting CEC methods because they are not familiar with the
mathematics used in optimization or lack computer and software tools
needed to implement them (Ferraro and Pattanayak, 2006). Pullin et al.
(2004) pointed out that there exists a knowledge gap as conservation
professionals do not have access to easily understandable scientic information. Pullin et al. (2004) also noted that conservation professionals
often resist change and prefer to plan as they have in the past instead of
incorporating further information into their decision making process.
Prendergast et al. (1999) identied the lack of awareness of optimization methods and lack of understanding of how they function as major
obstacles to adoption.
Messer et al. (2016a) surveyed agricultural land professionals in
Maryland and found that conservation professionals value transparency
and fairness more than cost-effectiveness. This study seeks to replicate
this earlier research by expanding the sample by surveying conservation professionals from organizations that have a variety of conservation
objectives, not just agricultural preservation. Additionally, this study includes a broader sample of geographic regions including conservational
professionals who work in international contexts. This research also
helps address the so-called replication crisis in behavioral and social
sciences. A growing number of scholars have expressed concerns that
published results in the behavioral sciences, including economics, are
frequently false (Ioannidis and Doucouliagos, 2013). Replication is a
cornerstone of science (Moonesinghe et al., 2007) and is something
that needs to occur more often in peer-reviewed articles (Hamermesh,
2007). Replication is particularly important in the context of research
that has policy implications.
This study also contributes to the literature about the gap between
the practices of conservation professionals and the recommendations
of researchers interested in CEC. Importantly, this research studies the
attitudes of conservation professionals who have been educated about
CEC techniques, yet still generally do not use them in their work. Thus,

this research provides important insights beyond the basic knowledge
gap arguments and suggests that other factors need to be overcome before CEC will occur on a widespread basis. We designed this study to address three primary objectives:
1. Evaluate attitudes of conservation professionals about CEC.
2. Evaluate whether these attitudes varied by the type of conservation
activity.
3. Identify barriers that discourage conservation professionals from
adopting CEC and determine what, if anything, can be done to overcome them.
The results of this study demonstrate that the vast majority of survey
respondents viewed cost-effectiveness as a virtue in program design but
did not consider it as important as other program design criteria. In particular, respondents emphasize the important of fairness and transparency of the selection process. A major obstacle for adoption CEC is the
lack of incentives to change existing programs as respondents seem to
receive little public pressure to be cost-effective nor receive additional
recognition or nancial award in their work for making their conservation programs more cost-effective. Finally, respondents indicated that
their likelihood of adoption of cost-effective conservation would increase if they can receive additional training and software to facilitate
adoption of CEC.
2. Research Methods
We developed the survey using the Qualtrics software (Qualtrics,
Provo, UT). We identied valid email addresses for 246 conservation
professionals from around the world who had attended lectures on
CEC techniques presented by the study co-authors. This list of participants (see Appendix A for the organizations represented by the participants) was derived from attendance lists of 47 presentations that
were made at the National Conservation Training Center, the Land
Trust Alliance Rally, the American Farmland Trust conference, and ofces of nonprot and government agencies.1.
Since the sample population came from people who had previously
attended lectures on CEC techniques, this sample is certainly not a representative sample of all conservation professionals worldwide. Instead,
we selected this sample because it helps address the question of why,
even once educated about the virtues and techniques of cost effective,
conservation professionals are not adopting these approaches. Consequently, this research can move beyond the simple explanation that
conservation professionals are not adopting these approaches because
they are do not know they exist, but can instead dig deeper about
what organizational and attitudinal barriers continue to exist to CEC.
The recruitment process consisted of emailing a survey that
consisted of 43 questions to 246 individuals. To encourage people to respond to the survey, we incentivized participation in the form of a rafe
of one $250 Amazon gift cards and four $50 Amazon gift cards. Recipients of the gift cards were to be chosen randomly after the survey had
been completed. All respondents were also offered the opportunity to
donate the money to a nonprot organization of their choice, this option
was made available as we anticipated that some government employees
would not be able to receive direct nancial payment, but might still be
motivated to participate by donating the money.
We based the survey structure on Dillman's (1978) Total Design
Method, which focuses on follow-up reminders. One week after the initial email, we sent a reminder email to anyone who had not yet
responded and included the 43-question survey (Appendix B). The following week, we sent a second reminder email to all non-responders
again asking them to participate in the full-length survey. The versions
of the survey were attached to that reminder. One week after that, we

sent a nal reminder email to all non-responders. For people who did
not respond to the longer survey after several attempts, we sent a
shorter version of the survey (Appendix C). This version covered the
main questions of our research and focused on how willing conservation professionals were to adopting optimization and what obstacles inhibit them from adopting this technique.
Twenty-four of the original email addresses proved to be nonfunctional, reducing the number of professionals contacted to 246. The
rate of response to the initial survey request was 26.4%. After completion of all of the follow-up emails, we had obtained responses from 85
individuals, representing a nal response rate of 34.6%. The 85 responses consist of 65 from the long survey and 20 from the short survey.
3. Results
At the beginning of the survey, respondents were asked to rate their
knowledge of their own conservation programs on a scale of 1 (not
knowledgeable) to 5 (expert). All of the respondents reported having
expert or near expert knowledge with an average rating of 4.52. In
terms of familiarity with optimization generally, which was rated on a
scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very well), the average response was 3.14. Respondents who had heard a presentation on optimization rated their retention of the material presented fairly highan average of 3.58 on a
scale of 1 (remember nothing) to 5 (remember most of the information). Similarly, respondents who had read information on optimization
techniques reported an average retention rating of 3.32.
A very high percentage of respondents viewed optimization as a
good idea (91%). However, only 55.4% thought it was applicable to
their organizations, while 39% said that they did not know whether optimization would be applicable to their organization. Respondents were
asked to rate the importance of ve criteria on a scale of 1 (not important) to 5 (very important) in their project selection processes:
(1) Knowledge (knowledge of the staff in how to use the selection
process to identify good projects);
(2) Fairness (fairness to applicants);
(3) Transparency (ease of explanation to public, advisory board, potential applicants, etc.);
(4) Cost-effectiveness (achieve the largest possible social benet for
a relatively low price), and
(5) Ease (ease of administration).
As shown in Fig. 1, fairness to applicants was the most important criterion (average score of 4.23). The second most important criterion (average score of 4.14) was transparency, which was described in the
survey as the ease of explaining the process to various interest groups.
Knowledge of staff ranked third (average score of 4.07). Interestingly,
the cost-effectiveness of the process (described as achieving the largest
possible total benet for a relatively low price), while considered an important criterion, was ranked lowest (average score of 3.92) despite
most conservation programs' limited budgets. We performed a twotailed paired t-test for differences in the means between the criteria.

The results showed statistically signicant differences between fairness
and cost-effectiveness (p = 0.021). In addition, there are statistical signicant differences between transparency and cost-effectiveness (p =
0.014). Other differences in means between the criteria were found to
not be statistical signicant.
Several survey questions sought to evaluate the degree of difculty
of the challenges that have been associated with adopting optimization:
Respondents rated the difculty of each on a scale from 1 (not difcult)
to 5 (very difcult) and the results are shown in Table 1. The lack of an
incentive to justify a change in the method used was seen as the biggest
obstacle to adopting optimization (average rating of 3.55), followed by
the initial cost of technical resources (3.46). Lack of previous experience
with optimization was rated as least challenging (2.72). A two-tailed
paired t-test was used to evaluate the difference in the means of lack
of incentive and lack of previous experience. This difference was statistically signicant at the 1% level.
The survey also asked questions designed to measure how planners'
willingness to adopt optimization would be inuenced by the availability of additional resources, such as user-friendly software and training.
From an initial willingness of 2.95 (on a scale of 1 to 5), access to software raised average willingness to adopt to 3.34, a 13% increase, and access to both software and training raised willingness to adopt an
additional 9% to 3.63 (Table 2). This result demonstrates an important
avenue by which adoption of optimization techniques could be increased, allowing conservation organizations to be more cost-effective.2
Results of two tailed paired t-tests, showed statistically signicant increases in willingness to adopt in response to access to such resources.
There was no statistical signicance between an Excel-based platform
or an internet- based optimization platform (p = 1.0). We found that
all types of resources were signicantly different from willingness to
adopt with no resources. Furthermore, we nd there are statistically signicant differences between access to training and software (Training
Access) and only given access to an Excel based platform (Excel Access)
(p = 0.003). In addition, we found that there is a statistical signicant
difference between Training Access and access to an web based platform (Web Access) (p b 0.001). Lastly, we also nd there are statistical
signicant differences between given only access to software (Software
Access) and being given access to software and training (Training Access) (p b 0.001).
We also conducted an analysis of factors that inuence conservation
professionals' willingness to adopt optimization as their primary selection process. Ordered probit models were used to analyze the relationships between willingness to adopt optimization and independent
variables. As shown in Table 3, we conducted two models, Model 1
looks at the willingness to adopt optimization and eight independent
variables. Model 2 includes variables related to the difculty in measuring benets, organizational variables, and the likelihood of adoption the
Logic Scoring of Preferences (LSP) to help quantify benets.
LSP is a technique originally developed in computer science to help
develop project selection criteria and corresponding weightings. LSP incorporates fundamental properties of human reasoning and seeks to develop a means for measuring project benets in a way that corresponds
to the intent of decision makers (Dujmovi, 2007, Allen et al., 2011).
Since questions about organization type, LSP and benet measures
were not included in the short survey, Model 2 has a smaller sample
size. The data set for the analysis consisted of observations, from respondents who had some previous knowledge of optimization.
In Model 1, we estimate the impact of eight independent variables
on conservation professionals' willingness to adopt optimization. The
independent variables in Model 1 are Understand Optimization, Lack Incentives, Lack Experience, Initial Cost, Staff knowledge, Fairness Importance, Transparency Importance, and Forgo Best Project. The
Understand Optimization variable is the response to the question that

asked respondents to rate their understanding of optimization from 1
(not at all) to 5 (very well). We included these independent variables
in the model, because we expected them to have an impact on conservation professionals' willingness to adopt optimization. For instance,
as the understanding of optimization increases (Understand Optimization), we would expect to observe a greater willingness to adopt
optimization.
All seven other independent variables included in the model came
from a survey question asking respondents to rate each item on a
scale of 1 (not difcult/not very important) to 5 (very difcult/very important). The Lack Incentives variable addresses the perceived difculty
of changing the project selection process to optimization due to a lack of
incentive to justify this switch. We expect that having a lack of incentive
to change will be common in government organizations and will decrease the likelihood of adopting optimization. The Lack Experience variable addresses the perceived difculty of adopting optimization due to
lack of previous experience using this method. Similarly, we expect if
lack of experience is a large obstacle, than there will be less willingness
to adopt optimization. The Initial Cost variable addresses the potential
that participants perceive CEC optimization as being more expensive
for the organization due to the costs of staff training and related software. We expect to see initial cost of technical resources to be a signicant reason why conservation professionals are not adopting
optimization. The Staff Knowledge Importance variable addresses how
important it is that the staff understand how to use the selection process. The Fairness Importance variable addresses how important fairness to applicants is for selection process. We expect willingness of
adoption to increase if fairness is an important criterion to many conservation professionals. The Transparency Importance variable addresses
how important transparency is for selection process. The concept of
transparency was explained to the survey respondents as the ease of explanation to the public, advisory board, and potential applicants. Since
optimization generally does not take into count transparency, we expect willingness of adoption to decrease if transparency is an important
criterion. The Forgo Best Project variable addresses the perceived difculty of adopting optimization since, unlike Benet Targeting,

optimization can frequently forgo the highest scoring conservation project, especially when those projects have relatively high costs. We expect that conservation professionals will be reluctant to forgo high
costs, especially those facing imminent development (Messer and
Borchers, 2015), therefore this would be an obstacle for adopting CEC.
As shown in Model 1 in Table 3, six of the independent variables
were signicant at the 5% level. Four independent variables positively
affect willingness to adopt optimization, while two have a negative impact. We will begin discussing the variables with positive coefcients.
First, willingness to adopt optimization (Understand Optimization)
increases with respondents understanding of optimization. Recall that
the respondents had a generally good understanding of optimization
(the average rating of understanding was 3.14), which is not surprising
considering our international sample of professionals had all been exposed to information about the value of CEC techniques relative to BT.
Second, respondents who emphasized staff knowledge of the selection process (Staff Knowledge Importance) are more willing to adopt
optimization. In the survey, the average rating of staff knowledge importance was 4.07. Thus, respondents seemed to be relatively condent
that their organizations could easily learn to incorporate optimization
by teaching their staff about the selection process.
Third, respondents who emphasized a fair process as important
(Fairness Importance) (average rating was 4.23) were more willing to
adopt optimization. In this context, fairness to applicants can be dened
as the organization showing no bias and have the conservation project
given the same consideration to each project and applicant. It makes
sense that individuals who want to be fair are more likely to use optimization, which eliminates political considerations and biases and analyzes each potential project using the same mathematical method.
Fourth, a surprising positive coefcient was the coefcient related to
the relative difculty of foregoing the highest-ranking projects (Forgo
Best Project). This suggests a rather contradictory idea that the less willing they were to forego the best available projects, the more likely respondents were to adopt optimization. The average rating of the
difculty of this obstacle was 3.22 (representing somewhat difcult).
A possible explanation for this result is that respondents may have

already been passing on the highest-ranking projects due to political
pressures and thought that switching to CEC might make the process
less political and thus better outcomes would result. As noted in Duke
et al. (2013, p. 128), nongovernmental organizations may win political
favors or improve fundraising by, at times, focusing on high-prole projects, even if they come at a relatively high cost.
The coefcients of the independent variables for the lack of incentives (Lack Incentives) to switch and transparency of the process
(Transparency Importance) are signicant and negative. Lack of incentives was rated as most challenging of the obstacles listed (average rating of 3.55). This could be because the organizations, the public, and/or
their donors are not demanding that these programs be more cost-effective. Alternatively, the program administrators may be reecting
the incentive structures common to most government agencies and
non-governmental organizations that do not reward staff for being
more cost-effective. When asked to evaluate how cost-effective their
organization's current selection processes, the average rating was 3.76
out of 5 (somewhat cost-effective); therefore, many of the respondents
viewed their current processes as less cost-effective than they could be.
Change tends to be difcult and thus is unlikely to occur without some
kind of incentive provided to the staff involved with implementing CEC.
The coefcient for transparency in the selection process was negative so willingness to adopt optimization declined with the importance
of having a transparent process. Recall that this criterion had a relatively
high average rating of 4.14. This result may be related to the perceived
complexity of optimization methods, which could be viewed as confusing by the organization's staff and thus difcult to explain to stakeholders. These concerns might be alleviated by using BCT, since it only
uses simple ratios of benets and costs, instead of mathematical programming as a means of achieving CEC.
The results of Model 1 show that the lack of experience and the initial cost of implementing optimization were not signicant. These results are particularly interesting since conservation programs often
have limited budgets. Since all of the respondents in this data set had
been exposed to at least one presentation on optimization, their awareness of the method and availability of free or inexpensive software
packages may have reduced their concerns about cost.
Table 3 also reports on a second model that includes variables related
to the difculty in measuring benets, organizational type, and the likelihood of adoption LSP to help quantify benets. Several of the results of
Model 2 are similar to those shown in Model 1; and the overall explanatory power of Model 2 rose by 14% compared to Model 1. In Model 2, the
coefcient for the variable related to the difculty of measuring benets

143

was statistical signicant and negative at the 5% level. This indicates
that respondents who view benet measurement as challenging are
less likely to adopt optimization. This result makes sense because optimization requires that numeric values be assigned to all benets. If conservation professionals already nd it difcult to capture measures of
benets, they are unlikely to use a method that makes this a requirement.
The coefcient for willingness to adopt LSP was positive and statistically
signicant at the 5% level. This suggests that the more willing respondents
are to adopt LSP, the more willing they are to adopt optimization which
makes sense as LSP is designed to help make various benet measures
more quantiable (Dujmovi and Allen, 2011; Allen et al., 2011). In
Model 2, the variables related to staff knowledge and the importance of
fairness are no longer statistically signicant. Finally, the coefcient for
Non-Prot was negative and signicant at the 1% level. This suggests professionals who work for non-prot organizations are less likely to adopt
optimization, likely due to the fact that non-prot organizations tend to
be donation driven and do not have the pools of yearly funds available
to select amongst a variety of available projects.
4. Conclusion
Despite extensive research demonstrating the advantages of applying
cost-effective conservation (CEC) techniques, such as optimization, conservation organizations generally have not adopted such methods and
continue to use less cost-effective techniques such as benet targeting
(BT). This lack of application is perplexing to economics, which has a
core principal of studying the behavior given limited resources. In response to this situation, researchers have identied a number of potential
obstacles to adoption including concerns about the fairness and transparency of such methods, political considerations, challenges of measuring
environmental benets, adverse incentives within public bureaucracies,
and lack of awareness and understanding of optimization.
This research surveyed conservation professionals who had been educated about CEC. The advantage of this sample is that it enabled the research to focus on a group of education conservation professionals that
has otherwise not been studied; however, this sample does limit the
generalizability of the results to the broader conservation professionals
who have not attended trainings. Future research on this broader population and what is inhibiting these professionals from adopting cost effective conservation is warranted.
Similar to the results found in Messer et al. (2016a), in this study
while the vast majority of the survey respondents indicate that cost-effectiveness is a virtue in conservation programs, they do not consider it
as important as other program design criteria. The results point not to
one particular barrier that predominantly impedes adoption, but to a
handful of signicant issues that need to be addressed. We nd that
concerns about fairness and transparency of the process, a lack of condence in the organization's ability to understand and use optimization,
and a lack of incentives to change the method currently used to a
more cost-effective approach all have an impact on willingness to
adopt optimization. These results also replicate the ndings of Messer
et al. (2016a) that suggest that expanding training efforts to introduce
optimization to conservation professionals and providing user-friendly
software are likely to be crucial in promoting CEC methods. The replication of the results of the earlier study, suggests that these ndings are
robust and that philanthropic foundations and government agencies
should consider investing in trainings and software development.
These results also suggest that public pressure may need to be applied to conservation professionals to make them more responsive to
concerns about cost effectiveness. Interestingly, this pressure could
come from either side of the political spectrum as environmental advocates want to see more on-the-ground conservation given the limited
funds available and good governance advocates want to see taxpayer
money used as effectively as possible. Since some of the statutes that
created government conservation programs call for the efforts to be
conducted in a way that maximizes conservation benets, the

144

continued failure of some of these groups to use CEC methods may
make them vulnerable to legal challenges. Finally, given recent federal
efforts to encourage federal agencies to develop evidence-based policy
and programs, efforts should be undertaken to use randomized controlled trials to test various selection methods and see how best to overcome the identied obstacles currently inhibiting the adoption of cost
effective conservation.
