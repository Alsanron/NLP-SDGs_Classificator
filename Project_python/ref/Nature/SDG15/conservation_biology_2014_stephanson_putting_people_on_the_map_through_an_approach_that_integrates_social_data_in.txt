Abstract: Conservation planning is integral to strategic and effective operations of conservation organizations. Drawing upon biological sciences, conservation planning has historically made limited use of
social data. We offer an approach for integrating data on social well-being into conservation planning
that captures and places into context the spatial patterns and trends in human needs and capacities. This
hierarchical approach provides a nested framework for characterizing and mapping data on social well-being
in 5 domains: economic well-being, health, political empowerment, education, and culture. These 5 domains
each have multiple attributes; each attribute may be characterized by one or more indicators. Through
existing or novel data that display spatial and temporal heterogeneity in social well-being, conservation
scientists, planners, and decision makers may measure, benchmark, map, and integrate these data within
conservation planning processes. Selecting indicators and integrating these data into conservation planning
is an iterative, participatory process tailored to the local context and planning goals. Social well-being data
complement biophysical and threat-oriented social data within conservation planning processes to inform
decisions regarding where and how to conserve biodiversity, provide a structure for exploring socioecological
relationships, and to foster adaptive management. Building upon existing conservation planning methods
and insights from multiple disciplines, this approach to putting people on the map can readily merge with
current planning practices to facilitate more rigorous decision making.

Poner a la Gente en el Mapa por Medio de una Estrategia que Integra Informacion Social en la Planeacion de la
Conservacion

Resumen: La planeacion de la conservacion es integral para la operacion estrategica y efectiva de las organizaciones conservadoras. Al partir de las ciencias biologicas, la planeacion de la conservacion historicamente
ha utilizado de manera limitada la informacion social. Ofrecemos una estrategia para integrar informacion
sobre el bienestar social en la planeacion de la conservacion. Esta estrategia captura y ubica en contexto los
patrones espaciales y las tendencias en las necesidades y las capacidades humanas. Esta estrategia jerarquica
proporciona un marco de trabajo nidificado para caracterizar y mapear datos sobre el bienestar social en
cinco dominios: bienestar economico, salud, fortalecimiento poltico, educacion y cultura. Cada uno de estos
cinco dominios tiene multiples atributos; cada atributo puede ser caracterizado por uno o mas indicadores. A
traves de datos existentes o nuevos que muestran heterogeneidad espacial y temporal en el bienestar social, los
cientficos conservadores, los planificadores y quienes toman las decisiones pueden medir, comparar, mapear
e integrar esta informacion dentro de procesos de planeacion de la conservacion. Seleccionar indicadores e
integrar esta informacion en la planeacion de la conservacion es un proceso participativo e iterativo hecho
para el contexto local y las metas de la planeacion. La informacion sobre el bienestar social complementa los
datos sociales biofsicos y orientados hacia las amenazas dentro de los procesos de planeacion conservadora
para as poder informar a las decisiones con respecto a donde y como conservar la biodiversidad, proporcionar
una estructura para explorar las relaciones socio-ecologicas y fomentar el manejo adaptativo. Al construir

Introduction
Conservation planning is integral to strategic and effective operations of governmental and nongovernmental
conservation organizations. Spatial and strategic conservation planning provide direction regarding which elements of biodiversity to protect and how to do so, allowing conservation organizations to set priorities and
allocate scarce resources more efficiently (OConnor
et al. 2003; Pressey & Bottrill 2008). (We use the term
conservation planning broadly, referring to discrete decision making processes designed to identify options
and to set priorities among them in pursuit of specific
conservation objectives.) The goals of conservation planning are to protect the most important areas of biodiversity (Margules & Pressey 2000), maximize returns on
conservation investments (Brooks et al. 2006), and promote effective conservation interventions (Knight et al.
2006).
The field of conservation planning draws heavily upon
biological sciences. Researchers and practitioners have
developed sophisticated methods to identify global and
regional conservation priorities (Brooks et al. 2006; Moilanen et al. 2009; Pressey & Bottrill 2009). Once these priorities have been delineated, methods to select biodiversity
targets (i.e., focal species, habitats, ecological processes),
assess their viability (i.e., likelihood of persistence), and
identify threats further narrow the geographic and thematic focus of future conservation interventions (Salafsky et al. 2002; Parrish et al. 2003). Finally, operational
planning guidelines (e.g., Knight et al. 2006; CMP 2007)
and standard conservation strategies (Salafsky et al. 2008)
provide guidance for protection of prioritized biodiversity targets.
Less attention in conservation planning has been paid
to the social factors that influence (and are influenced by)
an organizations choice of strategic action (OConnor
et al. 2003; Cowling & Wilhelm-Rechmann 2007), though
the need to incorporate sophisticated and diverse social
data into conservation planning is increasingly recognized (Knight & Cowling 2007; Polasky 2008; Pressey
& Bottrill 2008). Given that social variables (e.g., values, norms, institutions, human well-being) underpin
most opportunities and constraints for effective conservation action (Cowling & Wilhelm-Rechmann 2007), understanding social phenomena that affect conservation
action and biodiversity targets is fundamental to conservation success (Cowling et al. 2004; Sheil et al. 2006;
Polasky 2008).

Traditionally, social data in conservation planning have
focused upon direct and indirect threats to biodiversity.
These direct and indirect threats are represented by direct measures of human resource use, proxies for human
behavior (e.g., population density), and by indicators of
human impacts (e.g., tons of fish harvested) (Gorenflo &
Brandon 2006; CMP 2007; Salafsky et al. 2008). Novel approaches that rely on a wider range of social data and analyses include incorporating spatially explicit information
about the equity (Halpern et al. 2013) and economic costs
of conservation (Naidoo et al. 2006; Wilson et al. 2007);
mapping social assets (del Campo & Wali 2007) and local concerns and preferences (Sheil et al. 2006; Knight
et al. 2010) as foundations for conservation action; predicting conservation return on investment based on social
and ecological factors (OConnor et al. 2003; Wilson et
al. 2007); and integrating data on social institutions and
governance structures in conservation planning (Pressey
& Bottrill 2008).
We extended this recent work by devising a framework and process for integrating data on social wellbeing into conservation planning. This approach, which
we termed Putting People on the Map (P-MAP), captures and places into context the patterns and trends
in human needs and capacities and, thus, complements
other biophysical and social data used in conservation
planning. The P-MAP approach builds upon in-country
collaboration with conservation practitioners at 7 landscape conservation programs in 8 countries (20062009)
(Morrison et al. 2009). We introduce the P-MAP approach
and highlight 4 key questions that can be addressed by
integrating data on social well-being into conservation
planning processes. (For detailed technical guidance, see
Stephanson & Mascia 2009a, 2009b.) Though we draw
upon existing social monitoring frameworks and conservation planning approaches, P-MAP is a novel and
robust approach intended for use in any conservation
planning process that would benefit from a richer understanding of social well-being as 1 component of social
context.

Measuring Social Well-Being
The P-MAP approach enhances decision makers understandings of the social dimensions of conservation planning, action, and impacts. To develop P-MAP, we drew
upon conservation practice and best practices in other
sectors. We defined social well-being and its constituent

components by comparing and identifying emergent concepts from approaches developed by Sen (1999), the
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) (2005), and a
review of social indicators used to monitor protected
areas (A. Khurshid & M.B.M., unpublished data). Sens
capabilities approach, which defines well-being based on
human capabilities to lead the kinds of lives that they
have reason to value . . .  (1999), was the first to extend
the definition of poverty beyond simplistic measures of
gross domestic product or per capita income (Sen 1999),
a perspective now institutionalized in the UN Human
Development Index (UNDP 2007) and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (UN Millennium Project 2005).
The MDGs and associated indicators provide a commonly
accepted framework for measuring human development.
The MEA (2005) explored the relationships between
ecosystem services, direct and indirect drivers of change,
and human well-being. The comprehensive review of social indicators used to monitor protected area impacts
provided a snapshot of conservation monitoring practices (A. Khurshid & M.B.M., unpublished data).
Despite their disparate origins, Sen, MEA, and the social indicators review coalesce around a similar definition of social well-being as the human capabilities and
conditions associated with a productive, fulfilling life
(MEA 2005; CMEPSP 2009). Given that social well-being
inherently comprises multiple components (Table 1),
we derived a hierarchical framework for P-MAP with 5
primary domains: economic well-being, health, political
empowerment, education, and culture. Economic wellbeing represents the resources people use to meet basic
needs and access other sources of well-being (Sen 1999).
Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social
well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity
(WHO 1946). Political empowerment refers to peoples
ability to participate in and influence decision making
processes that affect their lives (UNDP et al. 2005). Education refers to formal and informal structures, systems,
and practices used to transfer knowledge and skills in a society. Culture refers to the distinctive spiritual, material,
intellectual and emotional features of society or a social
group, . . . encompass[ing] . . . lifestyles, ways of living
together, value systems, traditions and beliefs (UNESCO
2002).
Framework for Measuring Social Well-Being
To operationalize this framework within P-MAP, we
looked to conservation practice for inspiration
particularly the flexible approach developed by the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP). The Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation (CMP 2007,
2013), an operational model of conservation planning,
outlines a participatory process for identifying conceptual relationships among elements relevant for place-

based or thematically oriented conservation activities.
Two key components of the Open Standards guided our
work: processes used to define biodiversity targets and
assess the viability of targets in a given conservation area
(Table 2) (Parrish et al. 2003; CMP 2007, 2013). We developed loosely analogous systems in P-MAP for measuring
elements of social well-being most relevant for conservation planning. Our goal was to establish a rigorous,
replicable, and robust approach (i.e., framework and process) that could be adopted by users of diverse strategic
(e.g., Open Standards, Miradi), systematic (e.g., Marxan,
Zonation), and asset-based conservation planning tools
(e.g., social-asset mapping).
Similar to the Open Standards and UN Human Development Index (UNDP 2007), we used a hierarchical structure to categorize and quantify social well-being in P-MAP.
In this structure, the domain represents a broad component of social well-being. Each domain contains numerous social attributes. Each attribute can be measured
with 1 or more social indicators (Table 3). For example,
to incorporate health (social domain) into conservation
planning, one might use data regarding nutrition (health
attribute), such as prevalence of underweight children
(indicator).
Through P-MAP, we examined indicators that represent the well-being of local residents (i.e., construct validity), which is a fundamental component of the social
context of conservation. Social well-being is tightly linked
to biodiversity conservation through complex and reciprocal relationships, both as variables that influence
human interactions with the environment and as a manifestation of conservation interventions. Contextual variables such as degree of water security (health attribute)
and strength of resource tenure (political empowerment
attribute), for example, may influence resource use patterns (e.g., harvest rates, locations). A village without
secure access to water might dam a river, whereas residents with secure hunting rights might guard wildlife
against poaching. Conversely, conservation interventions
may (a) directly impact social well-being; (b) directly impact the flow of ecosystem services, with indirect effects
on social well-being; or, (c) by affecting one component
of social well-being, induce secondary impacts on other
attributes. For example, establishment of a marine protected area (conservation intervention) might directly
reshape local residents resource rights (political empowerment attribute); indirectly influence food security
(health attribute) by directly protecting fish populations
for harvest (ecosystem services); and indirectly enhance
educational attainment (education attribute) by enhancing food security and, thus, allowing children to attend
school more regularly (secondary impact). Moreover, the
social equity of conservation plans may influence the likelihood of plan implementation and success (Halpern et al.
2013).

Where appropriate, for efficiency and comparability,
we look to globally accepted indicators to measure social well-being. For example, MDGs (UN DESA 2008)
provide numerous conservation-relevant indicators of
social well-being that are measured by governments
globally.
Social Well-Being Data
The P-MAP approach explicitly recognizes that social
well-being is heterogeneous in space and time. To in-

form conservation planning, social data must reflect this
spatial and temporal heterogeneity at the finest practicable resolution. Commonly available social data sets (e.g.,
government censuses, demographic and health surveys,
and MDG indicator data), which tend to track social
well-being at district-level spatial scales or larger, are
a default source of social well-being data for P-MAP.
Though secondary source data may not always provide
sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to inform conservation planning at extremely local levels or in particularly dynamic social settings, existing data can inform

conservation planning without the costs or complexities
associated with primary data collection. For example,
data on economic activity collected at the scale of village
development committees (VDCs, each roughly analogous
to a municipality) in Nepals Terai region provides information that is useful for planning village-level interventions (Fig. 1a). Spatial heterogeneity apparent at the VDC
level is masked by aggregated district statistics, which
may be appropriate for ecoregional planning (Fig. 1b)
but not more localized planning. These VDC data highlight, for example, opportunities for partners to expand
localized alternative livelihood programs into additional
geographies of high conservation importance and social
concern, in order to reduce long-term threats to livelihoods and biodiversity (B. Gurung and T.P. Gnyawali,
personal communication).
Similarly, trends in the incidence of acute respiratory
infection in Nepal illustrate the spatial and temporal
heterogeneity of social well-being (Fig. 2). Induced by
burning wood for fuel, respiratory infections are a health
indicator tightly linked to human patterns of natural resource use. From 2001 to 2007, acute respiratory infection rates in Bardiya district were nearly twice as high
as in 3 neighboring districts. However, over the 6 years,
infection rates in Banke, Kailali, and Kanchanpur districts
rose by an average of 300%, relative to an 18% increase
in nearby Bardiya. These infection rates highlight the
dynamic nature of social well-being across space and
time as well as the links between natural resource use
and human well-being. An organization seeking positive
synergies among social and ecological outcomes might
focus its conservation investments in districts of highest
or most rapidly increasing infection rates, whereas an
organization seeking the most conducive social contexts
for conservation might view high infection rates as a hin-

drance to environmental stewardship and choose to work
in districts with low infection rates instead.
The disconnect between ecological boundaries (e.g.,
ecoregions, landscapes) and political boundaries commonly associated with social data (e.g., districts,
provinces) presents a challenge to integration of social
and ecological data in conservation planning (Rindfuss
et al. 2004). Ecological and social boundaries often differ (e.g., Terai Arc Landscape, southern Nepal; Fig. 1).
These discrepancies complicate and potentially distort
analyses of socioecological relationships. Given spatial
heterogeneity of social and ecological data, simply cropping disjunct polygons to align with predetermined conservation planning boundaries may result in substantial
inaccuracies. Disaggregation of existing data sets, targeted data collection (Knight et al. 2010), and spatially
explicit modeling (e.g., Ramankutty & Foley 1999) represent more rigorous methods for aligning social and ecological boundaries for conservation planning.
The spatial and temporal scale of conservation planning and management decisions influence the extent and
resolution at which data on social well-being are collected
and analyzed. If one is setting priorities among countries,
national-level data on social well-being may be sufficient;
if allocating resources among districts within a country,
then data at the district scale (or finer) are required. In
practice, as a rule of thumb, conservation planning at
the ecoregion scale necessitates social data at district or
subdistrict levels; landscape-level planning requires subdistrict or community-level data; and community-scale
planning requires social data at the household level. Similarly, iterative conservation planning processes would
benefit from data on social well-being that correspond to
planning timescales (e.g., a 3-year management plan benefits from new data every 3 years). Government agencies

and other actors may not collect data on social well-being
on a cycle that corresponds to conservation planning,
however, complicating decision makers attempts to use
existing data on social well-being. Social well-being data
with high spatial and temporal resolution (e.g., household, village; annual, seasonal) are more powerful and
scalable than low-resolution data, but present trade-offs
in terms of cost and complexity. Weighing these tradeoffs requires site-specific consideration of management
needs, financial and human capacity constraints, and data
costs by decision makers responsible for planning (Morrison et al. 2009).

mortality is relatively high (e.g., Dang, LHD), low (e.g.,
Rupandehi, MHHD), and intermediate (e.g., remaining
12 districts, MLHD) relative to other countries. Similarly,
for country-specific indicators, one may benchmark local
data on social well-being against national or subnational
averages. While commonly collected social indicators can
be benchmarked against national or international levels,
highly localized or infrequently collected social indicators
cannot be benchmarked and must be assessed independently via expert judgment.
Process as Key

Social Data in Context
In conservation practice, biological data are sometimes
rated according to viability criteria that put numbers into
context and provide insights for interpretation (Table 4)
(Parrish et al. 2003; CMP 2007, 2013). To put social wellbeing data into context, we developed a benchmarking
protocol for P-MAP that draws upon the CMP approach
to viability assessment (CMP 2007, 2013) and the UN Human Development Index, the standard system for assessing, classifying, and comparing social well-being among
nations (Table 4) (UNDP 2007).
We benchmark social data in 4 categories along a
continuum ranging from low to high levels of human
development: low human development (LHD), mediumlow human development (MLHD), medium-high human
development (MHHD), or high human development
(HHD). United Nations databases house data on numerous national-level social indicators. These databases can
be used to produce global averages against which one
can benchmark specific social indicators. For example,
applying the benchmarking system to infant mortality
data in 14 Nepali districts (Fig. 3) showed where infant

A framework helps organize data into conceptually distinct categories, but cannot replace processes for selecting representative and locally relevant indicators; determining scales at which to measure indicators; or for applying data in a conservation planning system. Selecting indicators generally benefits from a participatory process, in
which diverse stakeholders with regional expertise (e.g.,
knowledgeable social scientists, government officials, local residents, conservation and development practitioners) determine indicators to describe social well-being
within the conservation planning unit. The process to
define indicators represents an opportunity to explore
relationships between conservation priorities and social
well-being and to begin identifying appropriate conservation interventions. A portfolio of strategically chosen
indicators can represent the multiple dimensions of social
well-being. In some cases, it may be possible to measure a
portfolio of such indicators by drawing upon consistently
available, accessible data (e.g., government statistics, UN
statistics). Drawing upon secondary sources is particularly important for conservation planning at large spatial
scales, where primary data collection is often impractical
or impossible for conservation organizations (Morrison

et al. 2009). Indicator selection is as an iterative process that evolves throughout data collection and analysis;
some initially proposed indicators may prove infeasible
or inappropriate.
The specific steps required to structure and integrate data on social well-being into a conservation planning tool or process depend upon the planning system
itself. In spatially explicit optimization tools such as
Marxan (www.uq.edu.au/marxan/), for example, social
well-being data must be transformed into one or more
cost layers that shape the relative importance (i.e., priority) of a given location for conservation investment. In
strategic conservation planning tools such as the Open
Standards, by contrast, indicators characterizing raw or
benchmarked data on social well-being may be considered targets (i.e., what conservation interventions seek
to achieve), threats or opportunities, enabling conditions
(i.e., macroscale social variables that foster or hinder
intervention effectiveness), or exogenous variables that
simply enrich understanding of the context within which
conservation planning and action occur (CMP 2007,
2013). In asset-based planning (del Campo & Wali 2007),
certain aspects of social well-being may be considered a
type of social asset that is the basis for spatial and temporal priority setting. In each of these planning systems,
participants must decide for themselves how to analyze
the data, weight them relative to other variables, assign
causal relationships, and make decisions based on the
resultant outputs (e.g., based on strict quantitative criteria or informed opportunism [Knight & Cowling 2007;
Pressey & Bottrill 2008]). Methodological challenges and
corresponding scientific uncertainty about these relationships and their implications suggest the necessity of
participatory processes, formal or informal sensitivity
analyses, and scenario planning when using data on social
well-being (Peterson et al. 2003; Rindfuss et al. 2004;
Knight et al. 2006). The robustness and flexibility of
P-MAP foster its use in diverse planning systems but limit
the potential for highly prescriptive guidance (Stephanson & Mascia 2009a).

Improved Conservation Planning
The P-MAP approach can inform conservation decisions
by providing a rigorous yet flexible method for integrating the multiple dimensions of social well-being into
conservation planning. Characterizing social context provides conservation planners with a starting point for addressing 4 sets of key questions:
1. Defining and prioritizing targets (ecological or

Social Data in Conservation Planning

(b) Considering the social context, are there particular places or issues (ecological or social) that conservation strategies should avoid or focus upon?
(c) Are social targets necessary, for either conservation organizations or their partners? If so, what
aspects of social well-being should be targeted?
Where should interventions be targeted?
2. Designing strategies
Given local human capacities and needs, what conservation investmentstargeting whom, employed
whereare most likely to deliver results?
3. Exploring socioecological relationships
Are there synergies between biodiversity conservation and human development? Do trade-offs exist
between these 2 outcomes?
4. Managing adaptively
As social context shifts, what changes to conservation strategy are required?
Defining Targets (Social or Ecological)
Conservationists debate the appropriateness of social targets as legitimate goals for conservation planning and
action (Adams et al. 2004). Some see social targets as
distracting from the ecological objectives of conservation interventions (Terborgh 1999; Salafsky 2011), while
others see social targets as a necessary means to achieving biodiversity conservation ends (Adams et al. 2004;
Berkes 2004). Still others see biodiversity conservation
as a vehicle for advancing human development through
ecosystem services, ecotourism, political empowerment,
and other means (Adams et al. 2004; Sachs et al. 2009). A
trend toward recognizing human societies as an integral
part of complex, adaptive ecosystems (Berkes 2004) and
efforts to incorporate broad swaths of human-dominated
landscapes into targeted conservation areas (Brooks
et al. 2006) highlight the need to explicitly consider the
utility of including social targets in operational conservation plans. The social and ecological implications of
narrowly focusing interventions on biodiversity targets
versus a mix of social and ecological ends are widely
debated among conservation scholars and practitioners
(e.g., Terborgh 1999; Adams et al. 2004).
Regardless of ones perspective on this debate, integration of social well-being data into conservation planning
provides a richer understanding of conservation context.
Examining patterns and trends in social well-being allows decision makers to determine if social issues are
cause for concern, where problems are acute, and how
social dynamics are changing over time. This knowledge
permits conservation organizations to make informed
choices about the social contexts in which they wish to
operate, and the ecological (and possibly social) targets
upon which they wish to focus. All else being equal, some
organizations may be drawn to areas where social wellbeing is a particularly acute concern, while others may

Stephanson & Mascia

choose to avoid places characterized by, for example,
extreme poverty, poor human health, or widespread political disenfranchisement. Conservation plans that assess
and address social equity when siting conservation interventions may increase the likelihood of plan implementation (Halpern et al. 2013). Spatially explicit data on social
well-being do not necessitate action by conservation organizations to enhance human welfare, though some may
choose to do so directly, in partnership, or by sharing
data with organizations better equipped to address social
well-being concerns. These strategic decisions depend
upon, for example, organizational mission, values, and
capacities.

tion planning processes, the problem-oriented and spatially explicit analytic framework of conservation planning can productively structure policy-relevant analyses
of spatial and temporal socioecological relationships. Spatially explicit data on social well-being also permit rigorous analyses of trade-offs or synergies between the ecological coverage and social equity of conservation plans
(Halpern et al. 2013). Scientific understanding of relationships between social well-being and ecological integrity
is limited and fraught with challenges, simultaneously
highlighting the need for further inquiry and for caution
when exploring data and interpreting results (Radeloff
et al. 2000; Rindfuss et al. 2004; Grove et al. 2006).

Designing Strategies

Adaptive Management

Incorporating data on social well-being into conservation
planning can facilitate selection of conservation strategies
that respond to local human capacities and needs, resulting in more sustainable and effective conservation action
(Sheil et al. 2006; Cowling & Wilhelm-Rechmann 2007;
del Campo & Wali 2007). Understanding spatial patterns
and temporal trends in educational attainment (e.g., literacy rates) or material well-being (e.g., percent households owning radios), for example, provides simple yet
powerful insights required for design of environmental
education and communication strategies. Similarly, examining patterns and trends in food security can yield valuable information on the risks associated with crop-raiding
wildlife and other forms of human-wildlife conflict and
suggest conservation strategies local residents are likely
to support. Patterns and trends of land tenure (political
empowerment indicator) may reveal that tenure insecurity is an issue that undermines both conservation and
social well-being, highlighting the potential for mutually
beneficial and reinforcing policy reforms. Analyzing spatial and temporal trends of social well-being can empower
conservation planners to develop strategies that address
the most pivotal issues, take action in the most strategic
locations, and elicit the most effective partnerships.

Incorporating social well-being data in conservation planning provides a foundation for adaptive management in
the face of shifting social contexts. (We use adaptive
management broadly, to mean learning from management experiences andbased on these experiences and
shifting contextsmodifying management activities to
deliver desired outcomes more effectively.) Declining
food security, for example, may increase pressure on
natural resources, requiring shifts in conservation strategies and new partnerships to address local livelihood
concerns. Similarly, spatial and temporal data on land
tenure may highlight areas vulnerable to appropriation
and exploitation by extractive industries (von Braun &
Meinzen-Dick 2009), suggesting the need for conservation strategies that strengthen local land rights and, thus,
prevent industrial exploitation of priority conservation
areas. Equipped with such information, managers can creatively adapt conservation strategies to respond to shifting challenges (Cowling & Wilhelm-Rechmann 2007).

Socioecological Relationships
Integrating social and biological data through conservation planning can facilitate novel analyses that advance
conservation science. Global analyses examining spatial
patterns of linguistic diversity and biological diversity,
for example, reveal sites of high biocultural diversity and
highlight common threats facing endangered species and
indigenous peoples (Stepp et al. 2004; Gorenflo et al.
2012). Similarly, comparing national indicators of taxonomic endangerment and economic prosperity suggests
a complex and multifaceted relationship between social well-being and biodiversity conservation (Naidoo &
Adamowicz 2001). Though socioecological analyses like
these may be conducted independent of formal conserva-

Relation of P-MAP to Conservation Practice
The P-MAP approach builds upon conservation
practice, complementing other protocols for assessing
biological and social context. Similar to the Open
Standards approach (CMP 2007, 2013), P-MAP uses a
hierarchical framework and participatory process to
nest contextually appropriate indicators within broader
conservation-relevant domains. The Open Standards
(CMP 2007) traditionally included social variables only
to the extent that these variables directly or indirectly
represented a threat to biodiversity or (less frequently)
an opportunity for conservation. More recent efforts
create conceptual space for human well-being targets
(i.e., goals and objectives) affected by conservation
interventions through changes in ecosystem services
(CMP 2013). Thus, P-MAP complements the Open
Standards by focusing upon social well-being1 portion
of the broader social context within which threats,

opportunities, and biodiversity are embeddedto build
a more rigorous foundation for priority setting, strategy
design, program evaluation, and adaptive management.
The P-MAP approach provides a systematic way to
characterize social well-being that can be operationalized within the Open Standards as targets, enabling
conditions, or contextual information (CMP 2013).
Despite sharing analogous participatory processes and
hierarchical approaches for conceptualizing data in conservation planning, P-MAP and the Open Standards (CMP
2013) differ in their overall intent, their conceptualization
of social well-being, and use of social data. First, the Open
Standards are a conservation planning tool (CMP 2013),
whereas P-MAP is an approach to characterizing social
well-being and embedding it within diverse conservation
planning tools (including the Open Standards but not limited to them). Second, while the Open Standards are explicitly designed to address planning after geographic priority setting has occurred (CMP 2013), P-MAP is designed
to inform both spatial priority setting among geographies
and strategic planning within priority geographies. Third,
the Open Standards use the MEA framework for categorizing attributes of human well-being (CMP 2013), whereas
P-MAP draws upon MEA (2005), Sen (1999), and conservation practice (A. Khurshid and M.B.M., unpublished
data). Fourth, the Open Standards principally consider
human well-being a target (i.e., desired conservation end)
and secondarily as a factor (i.e., means to a desired conservation end) (CMP 2013:1618, 22, 24). The P-MAP
approach recognizes these 2 conceptual framings for
human well-being and creates space for other conceptualizations (e.g., unintended consequences of conservation, contextual variable that may influence site selection
or strategy selection, etc.) within conservation planning
processes. Fifth, the Open Standards describe changes
in human well-being targets as wholly dependent upon
changes in ecosystem services associated with conservation (CMP 2013:1618). P-MAP recognizes that diverse
mechanisms may influence human well-being, both as
a result of conservation interventions and independent
of such interventions. These mechanisms include broadscale political, social, or ecological contextual changes;
reallocation of property rights associated with conservation interventions; conservation-associated infrastructure, information, and ideas; and shifts in ecosystem
services (L. Glew, M.B.M., and D.C. Miller, unpublished
data). Sixth, the Open Standards do not explicitly highlight spatial and temporal variation (CMP 2013); P-MAP
is designed to capture spatial and temporal variation.
Last, as a planning tool, the Open Standards adopt an
explicitly normative approach (e.g., targets, factors for
conservation) that seeks specific positive changes within
a specified, targeted subset of indicators (CMP 2013).
As a framework for characterizing and operationalizing
data, by contrast, P-MAP seeks to characterize social wellbeing patterns and trendseven for social indicators not
targeted by a conservation intervention. Thus, P-MAP is
Conservation Biology
Volume 28, No. 5, 2014

designed to capture unintended consequences and relationships beyond the program logic, whereas the Open
Standards are not.
Consistent with Sen (1999), UN Human Development
Report (UNDP 2007), and MEA (2005), P-MAP focuses
on the state of social well-being, rather than the means
by which well-being might be attained or the outcomes
of particular interventions. As a result, P-MAP deviates
slightly from more process-oriented methods for characterizing the social context of conservation, which examine the means by which well-being might be attained
or the outcomes of particular interventions. The sustainable livelihoods framework, for example, examines
5 types of livelihood assets (human capital, natural capital, social capital, financial capital, and physical capital)
as the foundation for livelihood strategies and outcomes
(DfID 1999). Similarly, the conservation-oriented Landscape Outcomes Assessment Methodology borrows from
the DfID framework but focuses on livelihood outcomes,
measuring social variables in these 5 categories to assess
the performance of conservation interventions at landscape scales (Sayer et al. 2007). These differences are
modest, however, because P-MAP and the sustainable
livelihoods approaches measure components of social
context within which priorities are identified, strategies
chosen, and outcomes assessed.
Though scientists and practitioners increasingly recognize that every conservation plan and every conservation
action occur within a social context, social data and
social considerations represent a frontier in conservation
planning. With its focus on social well-being, P-MAP
complements other recent innovations in the use of social
data for conservation planning, but many important
aspects of social context remain poorly developed or
unexplored. Arenas ripe for further exploration and operationalizing within conservation planning include equity;
laws and policies; environmental beliefs, values, and
place attachment; social networks; and more systematic,
evidence-based approaches to operationalizing threats
(e.g., direct measures of discrete human behaviors). At
a more fundamental level, the potential of appreciative
inquiry (Cooperrider et al. 2003) and asset-based approaches (del Campo & Wali 2007) within conservation
planning processes remains unexplored. Given the
tremendous challenges facing biodiversity and the
resource-dependent peoples who rely upon it for their
survival, scientists and practitioners must explore diverse
approaches for integrating social data within conservation planning and, thus, lay the foundation for more ecologically and socially sustainable conservation outcomes.
