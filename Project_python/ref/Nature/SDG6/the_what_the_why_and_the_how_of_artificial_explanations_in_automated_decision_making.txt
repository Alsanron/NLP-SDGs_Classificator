Abstract
The increasing incorporation of Artificial Intelligence in the form of automated systems
into decision-making procedures highlights not only the importance of decision theory for
automated systems but also the need for these decision procedures to be explainable to
the people involved in them. Traditional realist accounts of explanation, wherein explanation is a relation that holds (or does not hold) eternally between an explanans and an
explanandum, are not adequate to account for the notion of explanation required for artificial decision procedures. We offer an alternative account of explanation as used in the
context of automated decision-making that makes explanation an epistemic phenomenon,
and one that is dependent on context. This account of explanation better accounts for the
way that we talk about, and use, explanations and derived concepts, such as explanatory
power, and also allows us to differentiate between reasons or causes on the one hand, which
do not need to have an epistemic aspect, and explanations on the other, which do have
such an aspect. Against this theoretical backdrop we then review existing approaches to
explanation in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and suggest desiderata which
truly explainable decision systems should fulfill.

1. Explanations and Decisions
Artificial systems are increasingly used to make decisions in an automatized fashion in
various aspects of human life, including medical decision-making and diagnosis, large-scale
budgeting, financial transactions, etc. The range of possible or actual applications of such
systems is broad and varied, from the assignment of credits and loans, through recommendations for medical treatments or the distribution of donor organs, to more mundane
applications in matchmaking on online dating platforms or the support of healthy or active
lifestyles. As a result, the important role that theories of decision-making in general, as
well as particular implementations via algorithms and decision procedures, play in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) cannot be overstated.
But because these artificial decision systems by their nature interact with human users,
a robust decision theory or algorithm is not, by itself, going to be adequate. It is not
sufficient that we can merely predict what results some system will obtain, reasoning from
first principles of classical decision theory if we do not know why we get those results or
are not able to explain how the results are obtained. There is an important post-decision
epistemic gap that must also be filled, when the decision rendered by the artificial system
is communicated to the human system: The explanatory gap.

When someone asks for an explanation of why they have been denied a loan by the bank,
responding the algorithm outputted a no to your request may be a reason why the loan
application was denied, but this is often not, and in many cases, cannot be an explanation
of why the person was denied; it isnt an explanation any more than Because I said so is
an explanation to a child of why they cannot have a second piece of candy: Because I said
so is a reason why the child cannot have a second piece of candy, but it is not a reason that
gives insight into the mechanisms in play; it is simply an appeal to authority. As Park et
al. note, Explaining decisions is an integral part of human communication, understanding,
and learning (Park, Hendricks, Akata, Schiele, Darrell, & Rohrbach, 2016, p. 1); an answer
that does not produce understanding of why the answer is correct or provide an insight into
how the answer was obtained is not going to satisfy the relevant role that explanations play
in human communication. In a sense, explanation is the flip side of decision: The capacity
to make deliberate decisions brings along with it the need to be able to adequately explain
how and why those decisions are reached.1 Thus, a robust and correct algorithm or decision
procedure is never going to be enough for satisfactory AI-human interaction: Given that
explaining decisions is integral to human communication, it must also be possible to explain
why that algorithm or decision procedure gives the outcome that it does.
The topic of explanation is one that is quite frequently discussed in philosophy, particularly in philosophy of science, where, inter alia, inference to the best explanation plays a
substantial role and the explanatory power of a scientific theory is often cited as a virtue to
be promoted when discriminating between theories (Harman, 1965; Thagard, 1978). Most
of these accounts of explanation are realist in nature, grounding explanation in some factor
or feature of the real world. Such accounts of explanation, however, do not seem to hit
the mark for the purposes of shedding light on the concept of explanation as it is used in
and regarding artificial systems. We address this in 2, introducing prominent accounts of
explanation found in philosophy and explaining (hah!) why they are inadequate for our
current purpose. In 3 we make explicit the epistemic dimension of explanations which
must be addressed in order to have a satisfactory account. We switch gears in 4 to lay
out some relevant AI contexts where an account of explanation is necessary, paving the way
for us to highlight desiderata for an account of explanation in AI in 5, building upon the
account of explanation we gave in 3. We conclude in 6.
Before we begin, however, we first take a brief look at what it is that we wish to
explain, that is, the decisions produced by artificial systems, generally in communication
with or relevant to humans, and the ways in which decision theory is manifest in Artificial
Intelligence.
Classical Decision Theory (CDT)the analysis of the behavior of an individual facing
nonstrategic uncertainty (Gintis, 2008, p. 2)is rooted in classical game theory and operates under many simplifying assumptions such as transitivity of preferences, unbounded
processing capacity, perfect knowledge, and perfect recall. These assumptions allow decision theorists to construct elegant mathematical models, but these models are poor models
of actual human reasoning. Individual experiences are sufficient to show that humans do
1. Many people are good at constructing post-hoc rationalizations of their decisions (especially, but clearly
not exclusively, in the case of intuitive, spontaneous and/or unconscious decisions), but generally we
do not count these rationalizations as adequate explanations.

Artificial Explanations in Automated Decision-Making

not have unbounded processing capacitiesan observation which is by no means new, but
already lies at the heart of, among others, Simons work on bounded rationality (Simon,
1959, 1990)nor do we have perfect knowledge or recall, and experimental evidence also
demonstrates the many ways in which humans fail to be perfect (Weber & Coskunoglu,
1990). This provides fair reason to reject CDT as a plausible (or even just reasonable)
model of human behavior.
It might be thought that CDT fares better in the artificial domain, for many of the
simplifying assumptions that do not apply to humans may apply to artificial systems. However, while CDT might offer a convenient framework guiding the development of decision
capacities in AI systems which are operating by themselves, the situation changes once
systems are required to interact with human users in a significant way. In these cases, the
capacity to not only reason rationally, but rather to emulate human-like reasoning becomes
important (Besold & Uckelman, 2018). This does not only hold in scenarios where close
human-machine collaboration in a bidirectional way is required (Besold, 2013; Besold &
Uckelman, 2018), but also in the setup serving as backdrop to this article, i.e., when human
users are subject to automated decision-making. While in the latter case one can argue
that from a purely rational perspective taking decisions based on a CDT model is advisable (given the well-understood mathematical basis of CDT accounts of decision-making,
and the corresponding adherence with explicit rationality postulates), once one also takes
into account the perspective of the subject of the decisionand their need to not only
rationally understand potentially negative decision outcomes, but also to accept them on
a personal and subjective leveladditional requirements tying more closely into cognitive,
psychological, and cultural aspects of decision-making come into play.
Even models that build on the application of classical game theory to the evaluation
of actual human behavior and reasoning  such as the beliefs, preferences and constraints
or BPC model of behavioral game theory  weaken many of the assumptions made by
classical game theorists, but still adopt problematic axioms. For example, while the BPC
model does not require perfect knowledge or unbounded rationality, it still assumes that
human preferences are consistent, an assumption that human-based disciplines such as
psychology generally reject (Gintis, 2008, p. 3).
These and other shortcomings of CDTwhen thinking about extending its reach beyond a descriptive-explanatory use in understanding economic phenomena, or in supporting
normative economicshave by now been widely recognized (see, for instance, (Beach & Lipshitz, 2017; Einhorn & Hogarth, 1981; Gilboa, 2010)). Still, it is an open question how CDT
would have to be expanded to be usable, for instance, to applications (possibly even predictively) modeling actual human decision-making on a case by case basis. Gilboa notes
that
one may find that refinements of the theory depend on specific applications.
For example, a more general theory, involving more parameters, may be beneficial if the theory is used for theoretical applications in economics. It may
be an extreme disadvantage if these parameters should be estimated for aiding
a patient in making a medical decision. Similarly, axioms might be plausible
for individual decision-making but not for group decisions, and a theory may
be a reasonable approximation for routine choices but a daunting challenge for
deliberative processes (Gilboa, 2010, p. 2).
3

Besold and Uckelman

Modern decision theory has correspondingly developed into a wide and varied field of
partially independent, partially rivaling paradigms and methods with usually fairly wellspecified application domains and contexts, also in this sense having departed from many
CDT approaches and their corresponding claims to generality.
Examples of this new brand of decision-theoretic frameworks include Gilboa and Schmeidlers subject-centric accounts (Gilboa & Schmeidler, 2001), in which the rationality or
irrationality of a decision depends on the decision-makers individual cognitive capacities
and limitations, or their theory of case-based decision-making (Gilboa & Schmeidler, 1995)
which leaves aside beliefs or predictions and judges the desirability of an act exclusively
based on how well it worked on similar problems in the past. Tversky and Kahneman
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) in their heuristics and biases program aimed to explain and
conceptually rebrand what had been considered irrational human behavior as simply adhering to certain patterns and shortcuts common to human reasoning. Following in a similar
vein, behavioral decision theory (Slovic, Fischhoff, & Lichtenstein, 1977) and, more recently, behavioral economics (Camerer, 2011) enhances the repertoire of economics with a
wide range of methods and theories from experimental psychology, neuroscience, cognitive
science, and the social sciences in providing explanations across different conceptual levels
from neurophysiological to cultural for previously unconsidered or dismissed particularities
of human decision behavior.
In all its diversity, modern decision theory acknowledges the need to take into account
the decision-maker who, often, also turns out to be one of the decision subjects. In this way,
modern decision theory shares a basic intuition also driving research into explanations in
decision-support and automated decision-making systems. The decision-maker (in the case
of decision-support systems) and/or the decision subject require understanding of the why
and how a decision has been reached, or a recommendation regarding a decision outcome
has been given. This understanding can either be provided if the decision has been reached
by modes of reasoning familiar to the user (i.e., the initially mentioned emulation of human
reasoning), or by providing explanations of the reasons and the steps which have given rise
to the system output in a way understandable to the user. While, all efforts in decision
theory (modern or otherwise) notwithstanding, the former option still remains largely out
of reach, the latter angle is taken by most current projects in the context of explainable
AI systems for decision-making. But despite the enormous popularity the corresponding
research direction currently enjoys, some fundamental questions hitherto remain unanswered
(and, often, even mostly unaddressed)such as, for example, what is or makes for an
explanation of automated decision-making (and maybe even a good one) in the first place?

2. What are explanations (thought to be)?
Standard philosophical accounts of explanation are robustly realist, taking explanation
to be some metaphysical characteristic of the world. A typical example of this approach
is taken by Nozick, in a chapter entitled Why is there something rather than nothing?
(Nozick, 1983). There he notes that the question about whether everything is explainable
is a different one (Nozick, 1983, p. 116) (emphasis added) from the title question of the
chapter. Nozick stipulates the existence of a relation E which is the relation correctly
4

Artificial Explanations in Automated Decision-Making

explains or is the (or a) correct explanation of  (Nozick, 1983, p. 116), and states that this
relation is irreflexive, asymmetrical, and transitive:
Nothing explains itself; there is no X and Y such that X explains Y and Y
explains X; and for all X, Y , Z, if X explains Y and Y explains Z, then X
explains Z (Nozick, 1983, pp. 116117).
As a result, this relation of explanation strictly partially orders all truths.2 Further, this
ordering is of all explanations, not just those that are known to us (Nozick, 1983, p. 117).
Such an account of explanation is realist in the sense that
if one hopes to explain the occurrence of one event e by appealing to another
event c, the explanation is successful only if there is a genuine relation R between the mentioned events. That is, for such an explanation to be correct and
therefore genuinely explanatory it must actually be the case that c and e stand
in relation R (Campbell, 2008, p. 75).
Unfortunately, this explanation of explanation is almost entirely useless (or at least inapplicable) as an analysis of practical explanations. With this we mean the ordinary phenomena
of explanation that we believe are relevant for use in the context of automated decisionmaking in particular, or even when looking at the notion(s) of explanation as used by people
in their everyday life more generally. We will highlight a number of issues with Nozicks
stipulations, and offer an alternative account.
First, note that Nozick gives no motivation or argument for his account of explanation,
either that it is a relation or that it is a relation of the type that he specifies. He simply
asserts that such a relation exists and that it is what constitutes explanation.3
Second, his definition of explanation is incomplete because it does not specify what the
relata of the relation arefacts? States of affairs? Objects in the world? Propositions?
Something else? It may be the case that that it doesnt matter, and his account works
whatever the relata are, but we have not yet been given any indication that this is the case.
At the very least, Nozick needs to specify what he thinks the relata are, and, even better,
to give us reason to believe that he is right.4
Third, Nozick gives no argument for his claim that the relation of explanationeven
assuming that one exists and that the relata of the relation are well-specifiedis irreflexive,
asymmetrical, and transitive. In fact, there are reasons to think that it is none of these.5
If there are brute facts (a possibility that Nozick himself entertains (Nozick, 1983, pp. 117
118)), then these brute facts are their own explanations, hence the relation of explanation
would be reflexive for brute facts. In the case of equivalent statements, there is no reason to
think that they could not be explanations of each other; for example, the Axiom of Choice
2. A strict partial order is an order that is irreflexive, asymmetric, and transitive.
3. Those who desire an account of why explanation is a relation can look to (Woodward, 2016).
4. Others have attempted to answer this question. For the events and relations in the world , rather than
items in our epistemic corpus (Campbell, 2010, p. 208) answer to the between what? question, see
(Kim, 1994).
5. It might be objected here that the following examples beg the question against Nozicks argument. The
problem is that Nozick gives no argument, so it is impossible for us to beg the question against his
(non-existent) argument. He presents these features of the relation of explanation as if they are obvious;
the putative counterexamples we raise should at least cast some doubt on this.

and the proof to Zorns Lemma can be thought to explain Zorns Lemma, and conversely
Zorns Lemma and the proof to the Axiom of Choice can be thought of as an explanation of
the Axiom of Choice. Which one is taken to explain the other will depend, in part, on which
one the person in question was introduced to first. This highlights one important aspect
of explanations that we will discuss more in the next section: Explanations are context
sensitive. Lastly, as with any transitive relation, it would not be difficult to construct a
sorites wherein X0 explains X1 , X1 explains X2 , and Xi explains Xi+1 for every i up to some
n, but by the time one gets to Xn , X0 is not an explanation of Xn . This again highlights
the importance of context sensitivity.
Fourth, this account of explanation does not provide any room to distinguish explanations from reasons. There are many reasons that can be given why a certain thing is the
case; which of these turns out to be an explanation will depend on context, we argue below.
What we have seen from the preceding is that Nozicks account of explanation entirely
overlooks what we can call the epistemic dimension of explanation. Now, this is not to deny
Nozicks implicit point that some explanations are known to us and some are notin fact,
quite the opposite. For it is precisely the fact that there are explanations that we do not
have that we wish to have that we ask the question Why? But this question is never
asked in isolation, and that is the epistemic dimension we are interested in.

3. The epistemic dimension of explanation
Suppose someone asks you Why is that car red? There are a number of possible answers
you might give:
1. Because it reflects light in wavelengths between approximately 625740 nm.
2. Because someone painted it red.
3. Because no one painted it blue.
4. Because its owners favorite color is red.
5. Because there were no non-red cars at the dealer when the owner bought their car.
All of these can plausibly count as reasons for why the car is red. But which of these
reasons will count as an explanation of why the car is red willas exemplified by the
examples abovedepend on the circumstances in which the asker is asking the question.6
6. For the Why is that car red? example above, these could, for instance, be:
1. In the context of a physics class in school, watching cars drive by on the street.
2. In the context of a police search for a blue car of a certain type with a given number plate, after
finding the targeted car which turns out to be red.
3. In the context of a repainting effort in an autoshop, processing an order to convert red cars into blue
ones.
4. In the context of a car dealership, selling a red version of a usually blue production model.
5. In the context of a conversation about the new car of a person who usually prefers other colors than
red.

6

Artificial Explanations in Automated Decision-Making

These circumstances include the asking agents belief state and knowledge set, as well as
her reason for asking that question, as opposed to another question, and what she hopes to
do with the answer once shes obtained it.
These factors are what make up what we call the epistemic dimension of explanation.
We are not the first to highlight the importance of this dimension; Kim (Kim, 1994) argues
that many existing accounts of explanation. . . neglect the epistemological dimension of explanation by failing to provide an account of understanding (Campbell, 2010, p. 213). And
as McLaughlin says, Only by taking into account the epistemic dimension of explanation
can we capture the idea that explanations provide understanding, answer questions, and
give reasons for belief (McLaughlin, 2012, p. 227). While explanations provide reasons, as
noted above not every reason counts as an explanation, and thus there must be something
more to a reason that makes it an explanation. What that something more is we now
attempt to identify.
First, note that when we talk about the epistemic dimension of explanation, we do
not mean the sort of thing that Campbell is talking about here:
Kims own understanding of the epistemological dimension of explanation does
not actually concern understanding per se, or how it is that an explanation
generates or contributes to understanding; instead it is a question about what
kinds of facts constitute explanatory knowledge (Campbell, 2010, p. 214).
The question of how an explanation generates understanding is a question of epistemology,
not a question of explanation. Similarly, the notion of explanatory knowledge is narrower
than the notion of explanation we are interested in; knowledge implies truth but, as we
argue below, practical explanations need not be truthful in order to count as explanatory.
We argue that there are three things necessary for a particular reason to count as a
practical explanation in a given context: (1) The reason must be relevant to the purpose
of the question; (2) the reason must provide the hearer with the power to act in a more
informed way; (3) the reason need not be true, though it does need to be at least an
approximation of the truth. We treat each of these characteristics in turn.
Ad (1): Irrelevant reasons cannot be explanatory. If you are asking me for an explanation, then you have a particular epistemic need to be filled or epistemic longing to
be satisfied. This need circumscribes the possible acceptable answers. Any answer which
does not (attempt to) satisfy this need will not be relevant and cannot be an explanation.
Further, not only does the epistemic context of the explanation determine (in part) what
reasons are actually explanation, but the type of the explanation matters too, whether
it is a formal explanation, a mechanistic one, a teleological one, etc. As Vasilyeva et al.
point out, Research increasingly supports the idea that (many) representations and judgments are sensitive to contextual factors, including an individuals goals and the task at
hand. . . This raises the possibility that judgments concerning the quality of explanations
are similarly flexible (Vasilyeva, Wilkenfeld, & Lombrozo, 2017, p. 1). Further, empirical evidence demonstrates that the acceptability of teleological explanations relates to
conceptual domains, causal beliefs, and general constraints on explanation (Lombrozo &
Carey, 2006, p. 168), and there is little reason to doubt that the same is true for other types
of explanation. All of this comes together to demonstrate that an account of explanation
7

Besold and Uckelman

that does not take into account the ways in which context determines the relevance of an
explanation will fail to be an account of how explanations actually function.
Ad (2): The reason the type of explanation matters for determining relevance is because
the type of explanation affects what you can do with the explanation afterwards. This brings
us to the second characteristic of explanations, and the question of what makes a reason
relevant in a given context? That is to say, what makes some particular reason satisfy
an epistemic need, but not another? The answer is rooted in the notion of explanatory
powerwhen we say, e.g., that one scientific theory has more explanatory power than
another, we are saying that it gives us (or, at the very least, the scientists involved in
applying the theory) the power to do more things. We can explain other phenomena, we
can make new predictions, we can understand more than we understood before. Thus,
the power of an explanation is rooted in its capacity to allow us to act in a way that we
could not have acted otherwise. Irrelevant reasons do not give us such a power. If you
tell someone who asks you Why is that car red? that it is because it reflects light of
a particular wavelength, but the person who asked for the explanation has no concept of
wavelengths or reflection, or indeed of light as an abstract concept, this answer will not be
explanatory because it does not allow her to act in a more informed way; the answer is,
quite simply, irrelevant because it is uninformative, and it is uninformative because it does
not fit within the epistemic context of the asker. This not to say that such an answer cannot
be explanatory; it can, in another context. From this, it is clear that whether something is
an explanation varies according to context.
Ad (3): This is perhaps the biggest way in which our account of explanation differs from
realist accounts. On a realist account, the relation of explanation either holds or doesnt
hold at all times and only holds (presumably) when there is in fact a genuine connection
between the two events. If the car owners favorite color is green, then saying that the car
is red because red is his favorite color is not an explanation because it is false.
However, truth is an enormously high bar to put on explanation, and in fact explanations
that are later determined not to be true can still have enormous explanatory power (in the
sense of explanatory power that we defined above). In our pursuit of scientific progress,
we do not necessarily replace wrong theories with right ones, but rather look for greater
explanatory power (Niaz, 2009, p. 93). A classic example of this from philosophy of
science are scientific models of the structure of atoms. Over the course of the 20th century,
different models of atomic structure were proposed which continue to provide increasing
explanatory power, such as: Thomson, Rutherford, Bohr, Bohr-Sommerfeld, and wavemechanical, among others (Niaz, 2017, p. 71). It simply doesnt make sense to speak of
increasing explanatory power if you think that there is no explanation going on (which one
must think if one requires all explanations to be strictly truthful). Here it is worth noting
that saying that Theory 2 is adopted to replace Theory 1 because Theory 2 has more
explanatory power than Theory 1 does not commit us to saying that Theory 1 retains any
explanatory power once Theory 2 has taken its place; in fact, our approach to explanation
allows us to strip Theory 1 of all of its explanatory power once its been superceded (though
of course we are not required to: Newtonian mechanics are still explanatory, even if in some
contexts relativistic mechanics are more explanatory).
We do, however, want to encourage truth-seeking in our quest for explanations, and
to prioritize as good explanations those which have a better fit with the set of knowledge
8

Artificial Explanations in Automated Decision-Making

claims relevant for the context (and are thus in at least some sense closer to the truth).
Consider folk-explanations for thunder, whether it be Zeus throwing his thunderbolt, Thor
banging his hammer on an anvil, or Leigong hitting his drum with his mallet. In the right
context, each of these can be relevant to satisfying the hearers epistemic longing; in such
contexts they also provide the hearer with the power to act in a more informed way (for
example, one can then consider whether to sacrifice a virgin to appease the god and make
the thunder stop); however, as an approximation of the truth each of these explanations
all falls quite short. As a result, it is legitimate for us to say that they are not very good
explanations. Thus our account of explanation avoids one potential criticism of non-realist
accounts, namely that anything whatever can count as an explanation, given the right
context. Even if that is the case, we are still able to distinguish good explanations from
bad ones.
The question of how much truth is required is a question of great importance in its own
right, and one that we will set aside for the remainder of this paper.
Weve noted one consequence of this account of explanation above, namely that one and
the same reason can be an explanation in one context and not in another, because of the
individual nature of individual epistemology. A further consequence is that one need not
give up Nozicks account of explanation as a metaphysical relation between things entirely,
of course. As Campbell notes,
The pluralists emphasis on the epistemology of explanation does not render
her position irrealist because the correctness of the explanation of one event
in terms of another is in part a function of the metaphysical relations between
them (Campbell, 2008, p. 91).
Note, though, that the idea of the correctness of an explanation potentially smuggles in
some problematic notionsnot stemming from the correctness but from the. Even the
pluralists approach to explanations requires that there be the correct explanation, and that
this unique explanations correctness is rooted in certain metaphysical facts (see quote from
Campbell earlier in the previous section). If, however, we scrap the notion of there being
the correctness of an explanation, and allow there to be many different ways of grounding
what makes an explanation a good explanation in a given epistemic context, then we can
allow that the existence of some metaphysical relation between events can be sufficient for
possessing an explanation, but it is not necessary (and it is not even always sufficient).
Thus, we allow for the possibility that we can have multiple possible explanations for a
single event or phenomenon, not all of which will be actual explanations in a given context.
In this, our explanatory pluralism differs from Kims, on which it is possible to have
more than one explanation for a given event provided that one has an account of the way
the explanations are related (Campbell, 2008, p. 86) (emphasis added). We can allow that
any of the answers to Why is that car red? above are explanations of the cars being
red, without requiring that we have an account of the way in which these various answers
are related to each other (and indeed, why would we explain there to be any such account?
Particularly of how peoples favorite colors are related to how light at various wavelengths
appears to us.)
A final important consequence of this account is that no one can determine whether
something is an explanation for someone else, because of the private nature of individual
9

Besold and Uckelman

epistemology. This raises interesting issues in the implementation of mechanisms of explanation into decision procedures in artificial systems, for it means that there is no single
answer that the decision procedure can give that can be guaranteed to be explanatory for
all people.
Our conclusion is that explanation is an epistemological activity and explanations are
an epistemological accomplishment (Kim, 1988, p. 225)they satisfy a sort of epistemic
longing, a desire to know something more than we currently know. Not only do they satisfy
this desire to know, they also provide the explanation-seeker a direction of action that they
did not previously have.

4. Explanation in AI
We now shift our focus to how our conception of practical explanation plays out in the
context of AIboth in terms of how it compares to previous accounts of explanation and
how well it can play the role needed in AI. The purpose of this section is primarily historical,
outlining what has been said previously as well as the current discussions, before we move
on to more normative matters in the next section.
Such a historical discussion is not straightforward: Not only is there no unified or uniform concept of explanation that is used in AI contexts, quite often the term is neither
defined nor explained. It is outside the scope of this paper to give a complete history;
instead, we focus on two important contexts in which explanations play an important role:
explanations in what is called Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence or GOFAI (4.1)
and explanations in machine learning (4.2), and then specific challenges concerning explanations that arise in the context of automated decision-making (4.3).
4.1 Explanation in GOFAI
Discussions concerning (the need for) explanations of the reasoning and behavior of AI
systems are not a new phenomenon, but already started during the time GOFAI (Haugeland,
1985), and more precisely in the context of expert and decision support systems. Clancey
(Clancey, 1983) questioned whether uniform, weakly-structured sets of if/then associations
(i.e., simple inference rules of the form IF precondition1 and precondition2 and . . . and
preconditionn THEN consequence) as used in the MYCIN medical expert system for the
abductive diagnostics of bacterial infections (Shortliffe, 1974) are suitable for instance in a
teaching setup, i.e., with the intent to support active learning. This engendered significant
interest in explainable expert systems (see, e.g., (Chandrasekaran, Tanner, & Josephson,
1989; Wick & Thompson, 1992)), with much work targeting the representation formalisms
used in the respective systems (Gaines, 1996). It also caused the development of proposals
to conceptually split the task that a computational system has to solve into two functional
components, a problem-solving one and a communication one (see, e.g., (Van Someren,
1995; Askira-Gelman, 1998)).
In a more recent effort originating from the cognitive systems lines of research, Forbus
emphasized the importance of the human comprehensibility of the behavior and the output
of AI systems in the context of his software social organisms (Forbus, 2016). In his view,
participation in human society requires effective and efficient communication. In order to
10

Artificial Explanations in Automated Decision-Making

have both effective and efficient communication, AI systems must have adequate explanation
capabilities and capacities.
4.2 Explanation in Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) methods have seen impressive successes over the last few years.
ML-based systems have consequently been introduced into more and more complex application domains, with a significant share of efforts targeting decision support and automated
decision-making systems. In the wake of these developments, questions of how to interpret
or explain the applied methods and systems have become important. Taking stock of the
current variety of ways explanations and related notions are treated within ML as a field,
Lipton points out that the term interpretability holds no agreed upon meaning, and yet
machine learning conferences frequently publish papers which wield the term in a quasimathematical way (Lipton, 2016, p.7). He calls for further formulations of problems and
their definitions, hoping to provide a more systematic conceptual basis on which to advance
research and development of the corresponding types of systems. Doran et al. (Doran,
Schulz, & Besold, 2018) responded to that call with an initial proposal for a general typology of explainable ML and AI methods and systems. In their account, there are three
general types of AI/ML systems:
 Opaque systems where the mechanisms mapping inputs to outputs are invisible to
the user. This basically converts the system into an oracle making predictions over
an input, without indicating how and why predictions are made.
 Interpretable systems where a user can not only see, but also study and (given potentially required expertise, resources, or tools) understand how inputs are mathematically mapped to outputs.
 Comprehensible systems which emit symbols along with their outputs, allowing the
user to relate properties of the input to the output.7
When comparing the notions of interpretable and comprehensible systems, it is important
to note that while interpretable systems are pushing towards becoming white boxes (in
contrast with the black box nature of opaque systems), a comprehensible system can
well remain a black box concerning its inner workings, but is required to provide the
user with symbolic output suitable to serve as basis for subsequent reasoning and action
(possibly resulting in a communicating black box. Against the backdrop of these three
types of AI/ML systems, Doran et al. require that any definition or characterization of
explanation must involve the presence of a line of reasoning that explains the decisionmaking process of a model using human-understandable features of the input data (Doran
et al., 2018, p.7). We now see how this plays out in existing ML approaches.
Argument-Based Machine Learning (ABML) (Mozina, Zabkar, & Bratko, 2007) applies
methods from argumentation in combination with a rule-learning approach. Explanations
provided by domain experts concerning positive or negative arguments are included in
the learning data and serve to enrich selected examples. Still, although ABML adds the
7. The definition of the comprehensible systems category echoes the same intuitions underlying Michies
(much older) notions of strong and ultra-strong machine learning (Michie, 1988), cf. 5.

corresponding information to the system output (and, in doing so, likely enhances the
general degree of explanation) compared to most standard ML approaches, there is no
built-in check or guarantee that users fully comprehend the learned hypotheses.
Explanation-Based Learning (EBL) (e.g., (Mitchell, Keller, & Kedar-Cabelli, 1986))
uses background knowledge in a mainly deductive inference mechanism to explain how
each training example is an instance of the target concept. The deductive proof of an
examplein some cases augmented by newly added features not explicit in the training
examples (Kedar-Cabelli & McCarty, 1987)yields a specialization of the given domain
theory leading to the generation of a special-purpose sub-theory described in a user-defined
operational language. Even so, the generated syntactic explanations can still be far from
human-comprehensible explanations in any relevant semantic sense (causal, mechanistic,
etc.).
In the context of artificial neural networks and related statistical approaches, regression
models (Schielzeth, 2010) or generalized additive models (Lou, Caruana, & Gehrke, 2012)
often serve as prime examples for interpretable methods and systems. In these cases, however, interpretability refers almost exclusively to a mathematical property of the models
(Rudin, 2014; Vellido, Martn-Guerrero, & Lisboa, 2012), allowing for a certain degree of
knowledge extraction from the model and subsequent interpretation by domain experts,
but clearly lacking a general explanatory component accessible to the end user. This is
not always problematic; for internal purposes, this notion of interpretability may suffice.
However, once these systems begin to interact with humans, an explanatory component
becomes necessary.
Finally, a somewhat popular explanation strategy is to create a more comprehensible
representation of the learned model, which in most cases necessitates a trade-off between fidelity and comprehensibility (Van de Merckt & Decaestecker, 1995). Here, examples include
the simplification of decision trees via pruning (Bohanec & Bratko, 1994), or the extraction
(distilling) of decision trees (Frosst & Hinton, 2017), or M -of-N rules8 (Odense & dAvila
Garcez, 2017) as more explanatory models from neural networks. What is common to all
methods and systems following this route to explanation is that the respective approaches
are purely intended to illustrate the systems behavior to the end user while abstracting
away from the actual details of the underlying algorithm. This presupposes an application
scenario and/or intended user base which afford this restriction on the accuracy of the explanation regarding the actual inner workings of the system, including the potential challenges
this might pose, for example, in the context of legal liability and responsibility considerations. Also, while the resulting representations are intended to be more comprehensible
than the learned model in its original form, they very often still remain quite technical in
appearance and (once again) presuppose a fairly high degree of expertise on the side of the
user to actually be understood.

8. An M -of-N rule is a classification rule of the form IF (M of the following N antecedents are true)
THEN . . . ELSE . . . (Towell & Shavlik, 1993). M -of-N rules offer a way to succinctly express, for
instance, parity problems like the XOR classification problem: IF (exactly 1 of the 2 inputs is true)
THEN odd parity ELSE even parity.

Artificial Explanations in Automated Decision-Making

4.3 Explanation and automated decision-making
Having looked at AI/ML in terms of technical approaches to explainable or interpretable
methods and systems, in this section we focus on the specific conceptual role and challenges
regarding explainability arising from the use of AI/ML methods in systems for decisionsupport and, even more importantly, automated decision-making. As noted in the introduction, these systems are used across a wide range of applications. What is common to the
vast majority of such systems is their partial or complete reliance on statisticaland, as
such, necessarily data-drivenapproaches to solving the respective task. This central role
of large amounts of data as key input element, processed using complex statistical methods
without the explicit generation of interpretable knowledge along the way, gives rise to a
certain form of opacity from the users perspective. They are opaque in the sense that if
one is a recipient of the output of the algorithm (the classification decision), rarely does
one have any concrete sense of how or why a particular classification has been arrived at
from inputs. Additionally, the inputs themselves may be entirely unknown or known only
partially (Burrell, 2016, p. 1). This opacity is in problematic tension with the goal of
having explanations for the outcomes of the decision-making system.
This perceived opacity can go back to at least one of three roots (Burrell, 2016): (1)
A system has been designed to be opaque as a consequence of intentional corporate or
state secrecy, aiming at self-protection and concealment and, along with it, introducing the
possibility for knowing deception. (2) The system is opaque due to technical illiteracy, since
reading and writing codewhich might be required in an attempt to analyze the systemis
a specialist skill. (3) The opacity arises due to the way the respective algorithms operate
at application scale, rooting in the mismatch between mathematical optimization in highdimensionality on the one hand, and the limitations on human-scale reasoning and the
corresponding styles of semantic interpretation on the other.
On the one hand, intentional secrecy can be hard to solve; and in some cases, a solution might not even be desired. On the other hand, opacity due to technical illiteracy and
opacity due to processing differences between AI/ML algorithms and human reasoning
while very different in the nature and quality of underlying ailmentcan both be addressed
by equipping decision systems with explanation capacities. Wachter et al. point out that
in a systems context, these explanations can operate on one of two levels, either operating on the level of the decision mechanism itself (i.e., targeting the system functionality in
terms of the logic, significance, envisaged consequences and general functionality of an automated decision-making system), or on an instance level (i.e., targeting individual decisions
in terms of the particular rationale, reasons, and individual circumstances of a specific automated decision) (Wachter, Mittelstadt, & Floridi, 2017, Sect. 2). This distinction between
mechanism- and instance-based explanation of an automated decision also becomes relevant
when thinking about the timing of the explanation relative to the explained decision-making
process. If an ex ante explanation is required prior to the automated decision-making process, the resulting explanation necessarily can only address the mechanism level.9 An ex
post explanation after the decision process has terminated can take both levels into ac9. As also noted by Wachter et al. (Wachter et al., 2017), a small qualification is in place here: If sufficiently
simple, pre-defined models are used and are completely specified and known a priori, predictions about
the rationale of a specific decision become possible in principle already prior to the actual automated
decision-making process.

13

Besold and Uckelman

count, potentially addressing aspects of the system functionality as well as the rationale of
the specific decision.
Putting these conceptual considerations into the context of actual AI systems as currently (and likely in the short to midterm) deployed for automated decision-making, in the
vast majority of cases a divergence between a systems level of explainability and its performance levels has to be noted. At the moment, Deep Learning (DL) approaches (LeCun,
Bengio, & Hinton, 2015) frequently solve tasks which had previously been considered far out
of the reach of contemporary AI systems, and raise the bar on most technical benchmarks to
which some of the corresponding methods can be applied. Still, this class of ML techniques
is almost exclusively made up by methods which even on the level of individual decision
instances are hardly interpretable, and whichfor reasons tying into the very nature of
the corresponding approaches as methods learning their own internal representations10 
generally cannot by themselves provide comprehensibility queues. Thus, while not being
completely opaque in that an instance-based interpretation of a decision process might in
principle be possible, the actual level of insight into the reasons and the process underlying
a decision offered in practice is low. Better interpretable (or even explainable) approaches
such as, for instance, the ones discussed in 4.2 in general fall short of the performance
levels exhibited by DL methods, requiring the systems architect to exchange increased
interpretability or explainability for (often significant) losses in terms of the systems effectiveness and efficiency, possibly up to a level where a task could not satisfactorily be
solved anymore. Concerning potential practical implications of this trade-off, in absence of
regulatory requirements or market-relevant incentives to the contrary, providers of AI systems for automated decision-making in a competitive economic environment are likely to
prioritize performance over other considerationsproducing oracle-like systems, with very
high statistical certainty returning correct (as compared to some externally defined taskand/or domain-specific criteria) decision outcomes but not providing actually informative
insight into why and how the decision was reached.
In the context of current initiatives on the side of the regulatory authorities on different
levels (such as, e.g., the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679) and societal
discussions regarding a desire for transparency and corresponding accountability of automated decision systems, work on better interpretable or explainable methods and systems
in AI and ML is ongoing. It is against this backdrop, combined with our considerations
concerning the nature and virtues of practical explanations, that we want to have a look
at what are desirable properties of explanations provided by AI systems in the following
section. The resulting list of desiderata can then help to guide the further development of
methods and systems towards the goal of providing actual explanations to the subjects of
automated decision-making.

10. An important factor in the success of DL approaches to ML is the capacity of the artificial neural networks
to learn their own internal representations for relevant input features, making use of the numerous degrees
of freedom offered by the high number of network layers. Still, at the moment there is no method
assuring that the content of these internal representations refers to anything humans would recognize as
meaningful in their conceptualization of the world. Claimed correspondences between the representation
layers of deep networks and human conceptualizations are either accidental or misleading.

Artificial Explanations in Automated Decision-Making

5. Desiderata for explanations in AI
In the early days of ML, Michie (Michie, 1988) introduced a three-class categorization of
learning systems, which has been given new relevance by the current discussion concerning
the explainability of AI/ML systems. In Michies view, ML systems can be categorized by
adherence to the following three (increasingly demanding) criteria:
 Weak machine learning: The systems predictive performance improves with increasing amounts of data.
 Strong machine learning: In addition to meeting the weak criterion, the system provides its learned hypotheses in symbolic form.
 Ultra-strong machine learning: In addition to meeting the strong criterion, the presentation of the hypotheses has to be communicatively effective in that the user is
made to understand the hypotheses and their consequences, subsequently improving
the joint performance to a level beyond that of a user studying only the training data.
Whilst most modern ML systems meet the first, weak, criterion, it is the third (i.e., ultrastrong) demand that resonates most strongly with our discussion of explanation in 2 and 3.
From a pragmatic point of view, it seems necessary for an explanation to be communicatively
effective. In an applied scenario, an explanation only counts as an explanation if it also
fulfills an explanatory function.
A similar intuition, though augmented by a second communicative direction back from
the user to the systemconverting the previously one-dimensional communicative situation
into a real two-way interaction also in terms of information transfer, and not only in joint
behaviorunderlies the account given by Stumpf:
First, the systems explanations of why it has made a prediction must be usable
and useful to the user. Second, the users explanation of what was wrong (or
right) about the systems reasoning must be usable and useful to the system.
Both directions of communication must be viable for production/processing by
both the system and the user (Stumpf, Rajaram, Li, Wong, Burnett, Dietterich,
Sullivan, & Herlocker, 2009, p.2).
The demand for effective communication in the direction from the user to the system in
our account goes beyond the requirements a system would have to meet to be considered
explainable. Still, one of the underlying theoretical requirements for such an exchange to be
possible in the first place is worth to be noted: It must be possible for the user to process
the explanation provided by the system in such a way as to be able to point out where the
systems reasoning in producing the prediction and the subsequent explanation was right
or wrong. This goes beyond the mere requirement of the explanation being usable and
useful, but poses a stronger demand in terms of content, structure, and presentation of the
explanation.
Several of these aspects also resonate, for instance, in Bohanec and Bratkos observation that in the context of explainable AI, simple, though possibly not perfectly accurate
definitions of concepts (demanding for the definition to correspond to the concept in a sufficient rather than a perfect manner) may well be more useful than completely accurate,
15

Besold and Uckelman

but complex and very detailed ones (Bohanec & Bratko, 1994). Regarding the technical
realization of these and similar ideas in an AI systems architecture, Van de Merckt and
Decaestecker (Van de Merckt & Decaestecker, 1995) suggest conceptualizing systems as
two-layered, with a deep knowledge level optimized for the actual task the system is supposed to solve, and a shallow knowledge level optimized for comprehensibility, addressing
a description task targeting the deep knowledge levels output. Both levels are connected
by an interpretation function from the deep to the shallow knowledge level, allowing one to
build an approximately correct but comprehensible description.
Doran et al. (Doran et al., 2018) discuss external demands which often are brought
forward regarding properties for explainable AI systems, including confidence, trust, safety,
ethicality, and fairness. Still, as pointed out in their paper, requirements such as to instill
confidence and trust that a systems output is accurate are deemed problematic due to their
subjective nature, either depending on users internal attitudes towards AI systems, previous experiences when using these systems, or on cultural and societal norms and standards.
Finally, they also also dismiss completeness of explanations as a required traitand even
question the desirability of complete explanations in many scenariospointing to the example of a doctor presenting an incomplete explanation to a patient, either taking into account
the patients limited knowledge of potentially complex biological processes, or sparing her
worrisome but ultimately irrelevant details (Doran et al., 2018).
Summarizing the current literature, we find at least two main desiderata regarding explanations in the context of AI and automated decision-making. Each of them constitutes
a necessary criterion regarding the status of a systems output as explanation, though none
of them is sufficient by itself. First, the explanations a system provides for its reasoning
and behavior have to be communicatively effective relative to the systems user, both in
content as well as in presentation (communicative effectiveness). Users must be capable
to understand both the presented explanation, as well as its ramifications, in such a way as
to be empowered to subsequently adapt their interactions with the system in a beneficial
way. Second, the explanations a system provides must be sufficiently accurate (as opposed
to perfectly accurate) relative to the explanans and to the context of the system and its user
(accuracy sufficiency). It might be worth trading off some accuracy for improved comprehensibility of the resulting explanation for the user, supporting the communicative efficiency
of the explanation. Based on our previous analysis of what makes a practical explanation,
we add another two necessary criteria to the list. Third, the explanations a system provides
must be sufficiently truthful (as opposed to perfectly truthful) (truth sufficiency). On
the one hand, a trade-off similar to the accuracy vs. comprehensibility consideration might
be required or even desirable, while on the other hand considerations akin to the doctor
example from the previous paragraph also might warrant to opt for a not perfectly truthful
explanation. Fourth, the explanations a system provides must quit the respective users
subjective epistemic longing (epistemic satisfaction). It is not fully sufficient to meet a
users epistemic needs (which are mostly addressed by the conjunction between the initial
two desiderata), but the user also must indeed be under the impression that her search for
an explanation has been completed successfully. Taking all four desiderata together, the
combination between communicative effectiveness, accuracy sufficiency, truth sufficiency,
and epistemic satisfaction of the users for us provides a sufficient characterization of what
is needed for an AI systems output to constitute an effective explanation to its users.

Artificial Explanations in Automated Decision-Making

6. Conclusion
Any discussion of the implementation of decision theory into artificial systems or AI research
cannot overlook the importance of the role that explanations play in automated decisionmaking. Due to the imperfect nature of human beings when held to the normative
standards set by classical models of decision-making, the latter are inadequate for providing decisions which can be explained in real-life contexts. A second factor that contributes
to this difficulty is that practical explanation iscontra what many more metaphysicallyoriented philosophers have arguedbest understood not as an abstract relationship that
always holds or never holds between two events or facts, but rather has an epistemic dimension that means what counts as an explanation varies by context. Many things constitute
this epistemic dimension, including the knowledge of the person requesting the explanation,
the notion of epistemic longing, and the need for explanations to provide the receiver with
the power to act in a way that she would not have otherwise been able to act. Keeping
the importance of this epistemic dimension in mind, and looking at previous approaches to
constructing explainable AI systems, it turns out that current methods are not sufficient
yet. Many efforts have been and are being undertaken to increase the explainability of
automated decision systems, with different techniques focusing on different aspects of what
constitutes a practical explanation. Still, what is hitherto lacking are clear criteria for explainable AI systems which are conceived in a way so that they can serve as guiding beacons
for the corresponding developments in AI theory and engineering. with this article we aim
to contribute to closing this gap by putting four candidate desiderata up for discussion:
communicative efficiency of the system relative to its users, a sufficient degree of accuracy
and a sufficient degree of truthfulness of the provided explanations, and the need to quit a
users epistemic longing.
