Improved understanding of geographical variation and inequity in health status,
wealth and access to resources within countries is increasingly being recognized
as central to meeting development goals. Development and health indicators
assessed at national or subnational scale can often conceal important inequities,
with the rural poor often least well represented. The ability to target limited
resources is fundamental, especially in an international context where funding
for health and development comes under pressure. This has recently prompted
the exploration of the potential of spatial interpolation methods based on geolocated clusters from national household survey data for the high-resolution
mapping of features such as population age structures, vaccination coverage
and access to sanitation. It remains unclear, however, how predictable these different factors are across different settings, variables and between demographic
groups. Here we test the accuracy of spatial interpolation methods in producing
gender-disaggregated high-resolution maps of the rates of literacy, stunting and
the use of modern contraceptive methods from a combination of geolocated
demographic and health surveys cluster data and geospatial covariates. Bayesian
geostatistical and machine learning modelling methods were tested across four
low-income countries and varying gridded environmental and socio-economic
covariate datasets to build 11 km spatial resolution maps with uncertainty estimates. Results show the potential of the approach in producing high-resolution
maps of key gender-disaggregated socio-economic indicators, with explained
variance through cross-validation being as high as 7475% for female literacy
in Nigeria and Kenya, and in the 5070% range for many other variables. However, substantial variations by both country and variable were seen, with many
variables showing poor mapping accuracies in the range of 230% explained variance using both geostatistical and machine learning approaches. The analyses
offer a robust basis for the construction of timely maps with levels of detail that
support geographically stratified decision-making and the monitoring of progress
towards development goals. However, the great variability in results between
countries and variables highlights the challenges in applying these interpolation
methods universally across multiple countries, and the importance of validation
and quantifying uncertainty if this is undertaken.

2. Material and methods
The study focused on three countries in sub-Saharan Africa
(Nigeria, Kenya and Tanzania) and one country in south Asia
(Bangladesh). Development indicators that underlie key SDGs,
and for which significant gender differences often exist, were
chosen for testing: literacy, stunting and the use of modern
contraceptive methods.
Empirical estimates of literacy levels at national level among
women of childbearing age are low in all four countries [18  21]
with marked differences between men and women. For example,
around 14% of Kenyan women age 15  49 cannot read at all,
compared with 7% of men in the same age interval. Estimates
from latest surveys show that children whose mother has no education are more than twice as likely to be short for their age
(stunted) when compared with children of mothers who have
completed secondary or higher education [20].
In Nigeria, Kenya and Bangladesh a relatively high proportion of children under the age of five (35  41%) are stunted.
Even in Kenya where the rate of illiteracy is relatively low, the
numbers of malnourished children remain high (35% of children
under five are stunted with a 14% of severely stunted) [18].
In Nigeria, only 11% of the women aged 15  49 reported
using a modern method of contraception [19], and just 24%
in Tanzania [21].

2.1. Geolocated household surveys
The gender-disaggregated indicators investigated in these
analyses were collected through the DHS programme, which
collects and analyses data on populations through more than
300 surveys in over 90 countries. DHS household surveys
adopt a multistage cluster sampling design [17 21]. Sampling clusters are usually the primary sampling units, which are
pre-existing geographical areas known as census enumeration
areas (EAs).
The boundaries of the EAs are defined by the countrys
census bureau, as are the urban and rural status of each cluster.
The georeferenced datasets can be linked to individual and
household records in DHS household surveys through unique
cluster identifiers. To protect the confidentiality of respondents,
cluster locations are displaced up to 5 km in rural areas and up
to 2 km in urban areas at the processing stage. A further 1% of
the rural clusters can be displaced up to 10 km [22 24]. Because
displacement affects the physical location of the data, it is necessary to account for displacement when undertaking spatial
modelling with DHS surveys [10].
Gender-disaggregated maps of stunting, literacy and use of
modern contraceptive methods were constructed, with a subset
of these indicators analysed in each country (with the exception
of Nigeria, where all indicators were modelled). These indicators
are clearly defined by the DHS programme and were constructed
following their instructions contained in individual country final
reports [1821] as well as in [25]. Details of each are outlined below.

2.1.1. Stunting in children
Indicators of nutritional status in children from DHS surveys are
calculated using growth standards published by WHO [26] in
2006. Stunting is a measure of chronic malnutrition, and in some
countries may be environmentally linked where the combination
of poverty and low agricultural productivity limit calorific intake
in children [27]. Using DHS data, children whose height-for-age
Z-score was below minus two standard deviations (22 s.d.) from

uncertainty estimates, and tested through validation.

education, and building resilience to natural disasters and climate change. A particular focus across the goals and targets is
achievement everywhere, ensuring that no one gets left
behind and that progress is monitored at subnational levels to
avoid national-level statistics masking local heterogeneities.
This requires consistent, comparable evaluation and monitoring of key SDG indicators at high levels of subnational detail
across the 20152030 period of the goals.
The increasing focus on subnational assessments for the
SDGs, as well as for efficient targeting of resources, and the
improvement in accuracy for health and development metrics
has prompted an emphasis on subnational data collection and
the continued development of mapping approaches. Principal
among these approaches is small area estimation [24]
whereby survey data on the variable of interest mapped at
coarse spatial scales are integrated with census data at fine
spatial scales to infer fine resolution mapping of key development metrics. This approach has seen widest application in
the field of poverty mapping [5,6], but it is limited due to its
reliance on census data. With national population censuses
undertaken typically only every 10 years, and sometimes
longer in many low-income countries [7], this makes the application of such small area estimation approaches challenging
for the ongoing monitoring of SDG indicators.
National household surveys are undertaken in low- and
middle-income countries more regularly than censuses,
typically every 35 years, with the Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS) (http://dhsprogram.com), Living Standard
Measurement Surveys (LSMS) [8,9] and Multiple Indicator
Cluster Surveys (MICS) (http://mics.unicef.org) being the largest international programmes. These are vital for providing
SDG, policy and operational relevant metrics; however,
the data are typically only summarized at national or large
subnational areas, which can be inappropriate for identifying
the significant heterogeneities that need to be captured for
the leave no one behind agenda. The increasing use of
global positioning systems (GPS) for recording the locations
of survey clusters and the increasing availability of these
data provide more fine-grained information [10]. However,
these cluster-level data are drawn from small sample sizes
and only represent samples of small areas. Spatial interpolation approaches that exploit spatial relationships between
cluster-located survey data and geospatial covariates have,
therefore, been explored recently [11,12], with applications
seen in mapping age structures [13], malaria prevalence [14],
vaccination coverage [15] and poverty [16] among others.
Moreover, the DHS programme is now routinely providing
modelled surfaces with each new country survey produced
through spatial interpolation (http://spatialdata.dhspro
gram.com/modeled-surfaces/) [17].
While spatial interpolation approaches are growing in
popularity, due to advantages over small area estimation in
their ability to produce high spatial resolution maps in the
absence of census data, it remains unclear, however, how predictable different SDG-related variables are across different
settings and between demographic groups. Here we test the
accuracy of several spatial interpolation methods through
quantification of uncertainty and model fit by combining
DHS cluster data and geospatial covariates through a set of
case studies, producing gender-disaggregated maps of literacy
rates, stunting and the use of modern contraceptive methods.
Bayesian geostatistical (BGS) and machine learning modelling
methods were implemented across four low-income countries

slept in the household the night before the survey was extracted
for the countries of interest using height-for-age Z-scores.
The cluster-level proportions of stunted children disaggregated
by gender were used in the analyses.

2.1.2. Literacy
In the DHS surveys, literacy status is determined by assessing the
respondents ability to read a sentence during the interview,
when surveyors ask respondents to read sentences written in
their native language or English. Those who attended at least secondary school or were able to read at least part of a sentence
were defined as literate. In Bangladesh, the female literacy rate
regards only ever married women. Cluster-level proportions of
literate people aged 15  49 were used, disaggregated by gender.

2.1.3. Use of modern contraception methods
Within the DHS surveys, all women aged between 15 and 49
years old were asked about their use of family planning at the
time of the survey. Information about the current use of any
modern method of contraception (defined in the DHS as being,
e.g. pill, male condom and sterilization) was reported for each
women interviewed. In Bangladesh, this information was only
collected from ever married women. Cluster-level proportions
of women using a modern method of contraception were derived
and used in these analyses.

2.2. Defining a suite of covariates for predicting health
and demographic indicators at fine spatial
resolution
Many indices of population health and well-being are correlated with variables describing the surrounding environmental,
geographical, socio-economic and infrastructure conditions.
Spatial interpolation approaches have been developed to
exploit these correlative relationships, along with the spatial

autocorrelation present [13,14,28] to predict the indicators at
locations where survey data are not available. Key to this
approach is the availability of high-resolution geographical
data that can be used to describe conditions at survey locations,
as well as to predict across the rest of the area of interest.
Following previous work [13 16], a suite of physical (topography, climate, land cover, etc.) and some social ( population density,
ethnicity) covariate grids were selected from existing publicly
available libraries and assembled, focusing on factors that have
previously been shown to correlate with the modelled indicators
and completely covering the selected countries (table 1). For
each country, differing sets of covariate data were available, and
due to the different spatial resolution, projection system, format
and extent of the datasets, algorithms were developed and applied
for converting all the layers to common 1  1 km gridded datasets
suitable to be used in map production. Further information is
available in the electronic supplementary material.
Owing to the displacement affecting DHS data, the mean
value of each variable in a buffer of 2 km from the cluster
location for urban areas and 5 km for rural areas was used,
following published recommendations [10], in applying a
linear modelling approach. For nonlinear modelling architectures
(e.g. artificial neural networks (ANNs)), the values came from a
Monte Carlo analysis on the same buffers. Further details of
modelling methods are provided below.

2.3. Selection of geospatial covariates
Selecting an optimal set of covariates is fundamental to maximize the predictive accuracy of a model. Including too few
informative covariates could result in loss of explanatory
power, while the inclusion of too many could cause the resulting
high-dimensional multivariate model to overfit the data,
especially when an ANN is applied. In statistical modelling,
selection of the better performing covariates within the chosen
modelling architecture is a common, widely accepted, exercise
[29]. For obtaining the most appropriate combination of covariates to predict high-resolution maps for each of the modelled
indicators, a sensitivity analysis using a jackknife approach [30]
was carried out.

The BGS [34,35], generalized linear models [36] (simple or with
mixed effect) and machine learning (ANN in this case) [37,38]
techniques based on geolocated surveys and gridded spatial
covariate layers were applied and tested to construct highresolution gender-disaggregated maps of stunting, literacy and
use of modern contraceptive methods. The applied modelling
architecture has its basis in the geospatial semantic array
programming paradigm (GeoSemAP) [39,40] with efforts
focused towards computational reproducibility and semantic
modularization of the many data-transformation components.
A data-transformation module (D-TM) may be considered as
a handy portable formulation for applying a mathematical
function to a set of input data and parameters.
GeoSemAP is the geospatial application of the semantic array
programming (SemAP) paradigm [41,42]. SemAP allows the
multidimensional structure of a mathematical and computational
model to be exploited. The modelling architecture relies on a
modular structure where each D-TM is subject to semantic consistency checks in order for the input/output processed
information to be compliant with the semantics underpinning
the variables manipulated within the module. In an effort
towards increasing reproducibility in geostatistical modelling,
free scientific software tools and libraries, and freely available
datasets were used, and reproducible techniques for applying
the models and sub-models that are part of the modelling architecture were developed. Owing to the generally better
performance we observed for BGS and ANN compared with
generalized linear models in preliminary tests, all of the maps
produced were based on these modelling architectures.

2.4.1. Artificial neural networks
An ANN is a D-TM able to derive from a set of input data a
corresponding set of outputs. Neural networks resemble the
human brain because of knowledge acquisition through learning,
and storage of acquired knowledge within inter-neuron connection strengths. An ANN is implemented through a system of
interconnected nodes. Information propagates through nodes, transforming the inputs in intermediate derived signals up to generate the
final outputs. The internal nodes are called neurons and define the
ANN hidden layers. Each of the processing neurons calculates the
weighted sum of all interconnected signals from the previous layer
plus a bias term and then produces an output through the activation
function. The effective incoming signal sj to node j is
Sj 

n0
X

Wij xi  bj ,

i0

where Wij is the connection weight, xi is the input to the network and
bj is the bias term.
The activation function associating individual nodes typically has a sigmoid shape. The sigmoid function most often
used for ANNs is the logistic function:

in which sj can vary in the range +1 but y is bounded between

The power and main advantage of using ANNs lie in their
capacity to model both linear and nonlinear relationships and
to learn these relations directly from the data. Because many
complex problems are characterized by their intrinsic nonlinear
behaviour, traditional linear models are often inadequate.
Two different feed-forward neural networks were selected
among the main network architectures. In a feed-forward
network, the information moves in only one direction, from the
input nodes to the output nodes without cycles or loops.
The first was created using the R language according to the structure established by the AMORE package (A MORE flexible
neural network) [43] of the GNU R [44] free software. The
second is a feed-forward ANN implemented in Matlab language
using the Neural Network Package [45] available in GNU
Octave [46]. Additional information is available in the electronic
supplementary material.
The setting of the parameters for running the applied ANNs
comes from a repeated random sub-sampling validation using
70% of the DHS data, keeping the remaining 30% for the final
validation of the models.

2.4.2. Bayesian generalized linear models
A Bayesian modelling approach is a statistical technique that uses
the Bayesian method [47,48] to estimate the parameters of the posterior distribution. Because it incorporates a hierarchical analysis in
the observation data model, prior distributions and data likelihood
with associated uncertainty for parameters specified [48], the Bayesian approach is a valid contribution for modelling large datasets
that also include spatial information. Bayesian predictions are
accompanied by measures of uncertainty and these have been
used in many applications focused on the spatial modelling of
development and health indicators [14,49].
The integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA)
approach, available as package implemented in GNU R, was
applied here [50]. It is a powerful and computationally effective
alternative to classic simulation methods such as the Markov
chain Monte Carlo, that can become computationally intensive
for large datasets. This is an approach to statistical inference
for latent Gaussian Markov random field models as described
in [50]. Latent Gaussian models are a wide, flexible class of
models that include (generalized) linear, mixed, spatial and
spatio-temporal models. Combined with the stochastic partial
differential equation approach (SPDE) [51], it is possible to
model all kinds of geographically referenced data.
To produce continuous maps of the estimated proportion
of gender-disaggregated literacy, stunting and use of modern
contraception methods, Bayesian hierarchical spatial models,
implemented through a SPDE approach, were created using
the R INLA package.
A summarized form of these models can be represented as

and BGS) for calculating the proportions of literate ever married women in

Another challenge to modelling is multicollinearity, which
can have significant impact on the quality and stability of a
model. There are a number of methods for detecting multicollinearity [31]. The approach selected here was to compute the variance
inflation factor (VIF)the larger the VIF, the bigger is the multicollinearity. Multicollinearity was tested here among independent
variables. Though some authors suggest excluding variables with
a VIF greater than 4 [32] or 5 [33], here it was decided to safely
keep only variables with a VIF lower than 3. Further information
is available in the electronic supplementary material.

where (k 2 2 D)a /2 is a differential operator, k is a scaling
parameter, D is the Laplacian, a controls the smoothness of realization, t controls the variance and x(s) is the spatial field/domain
for s (s1, . . . , sn) locations.
Because of the time necessary to properly calibrate the
applied models, after an initial test where the results of many
different modelling architectures were compared, the decision
was made to initially apply only the models implemented in
INLA. These models are considerably less time demanding
than ANNs but have a similar predictive capacity (table 2).
ANNs were additionally tested against the BGS models only
when poor results in prediction were obtained and, in particular,
to overcome the problem of unusual data distributions.

2.5. Model validation
Both the ANN models and those implemented in INLA use a crossvalidation (repeated random sub-sampling) to set the model parameters. Owing to the size of the Nigeria datasets, here we split
the data into training, validation and test sets, using the validation
dataset (20% of the data) for building the final model.
The validation process was implemented in two steps. First,
the cross-validation approach (with the exception of Nigeria) was
applied to the training dataset for selecting the best model for
each of the applied modelling architectures (ANN, BGS). The
relationship between predicted and observed values (the accuracy of the model) was quantified using the root mean square
error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE). Although
some authors suggest inter-comparisons of average model
performance should be based on MAE [52], RMSE was also
calculated here because of its greater sensitivity to occasional
large error compared to other measures. The remaining 30% of
the data (20% in Nigeria) were used for measuring the modelling
performance by calculating MAE, RMSE and the explained
variance of the model (expressed in proportional terms).
The model with the highest explained variance and lowest
RMSE and MAE was selected to be applied for producing
the final map at 1  1 km resolution. For calculating the
explained variance the pseudo-R 2 reported in equation (2.1)
was used:
pseudo-R2  1 

MSE
,
varobs

2:1

where var(obs) is the variance of the observed data and MSE
is the mean square error.

A comparison of RMSE and MAE of different models based
on different datasets may only capture part of the relevant statistical information. For example, both RMSE and MAE indices
cannot directly preserve the information concerning the sign of
the modelling errors. In particular, a model with given RMSE
and MAE may locally display errors both negative (underestimation) and positive (overestimation) so as for the overall bias to be
mitigated by the compensating local under/over-estimations.
Another model with the same RMSE and MAE may instead
systematically underestimate the modelled quantity. In order
for these modelling situations to be better discriminated, we
introduced a new parameter for calculating the general bias of
the models (equation (2.2)):
general bias 

jobs  predj
,
sobs

2:2

where sobs and obs are the standard deviation and mean of
observed data and pred is the mean of predicted values.

3. Results
The following sections document the performance of the
applied modelling architectures in each of the investigated
countries. Example maps and graphs for selected indicators
are presented, with further results provided in the electronic
supplementary material information. The results highlight
that relatively accurate high-resolution maps of key genderdisaggregated socio-economic indicators can be produced,
with explained variance through validation being as high
as 74 75% for female literacy in Nigeria and Kenya, and in
the 50 70% range for many other variables. However, substantial variations between countries and variables were
seen, with many variables showing poor mapping accuracies in the range of 230% explained variance using both
geostatistical and machine learning approaches.
Both Bayesian modelling techniques and ANNs were able
to extract the information present within the available covariates to predict development indicators in different areas. Midinfrared reflectance (the surface reflectance in the middle
infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum), elevation,
accessibility, the distance to settlements and roads and the
distance to conflicts (Nigeria) emerged as important covariates for mapping different indicators. For example, the
mid-infrared reflectance shows a correlation of 0.58, 0.63
and 0.7 with stunting of females in Nigeria and female
literacy in Kenya and Nigeria, respectively. However, not
all countries and not all modelling outputs produced such
a high correlation between the dependent variable and available covariates. Modelling the proportion of stunted girls
under the age of 5 in Kenya, the distance to roads was
found to have the highest correlation, but this was only 0.13.

maps for female literacy and stunting in boys, with substantial
geographical heterogeneity present and relatively consistent
and low levels of uncertainty in the predictions across the
country. For example, in the female literacy map more than
73% of the pixels have a standard deviation lower than 0.1
and less than 0.1% of the cells show a value higher than 0.2.
Key covariates across the different variables modelled
were the distance from conflicts, the mid-infrared reflectance
values, the gross cell product and elevation.

Table 5 shows the statistics produced for all the models applied
in Tanzania, with a medium-to-low proportion of explained
variance ranging from 0.1 to 0.42. Figure 4 shows input data,
scatterplots and output maps related to the use of modern contraception methods in women, with low levels of uncertainty in
the predictions across the country. Key covariates across the
different variables modelled were the distance from roads,
accessibility, aridity index and precipitation.

3.2. Kenya
Table 4 presents the statistics related to all the models applied
in Kenya. The results are heterogeneous with high levels of
explained variance in modelling female literacy (0.75) and
low levels for all other indicators. Figure 3 shows input data,
scatterplots and output maps for female literacy. The related
standard deviation is always lower than 0.3 with more than
80% of the pixels having a value of less than 0.2. Key covariates
across the different variables modelled were the distance from
settlements and roads, the accessibility, the mid-infrared index
values and the potential evapotranspiration.

3.4. Bangladesh
Table 6 shows the statistics related to all the models applied
in Bangladesh. The level of variance explained by the
models is low, with some of the models having performance
similar to a trivial model based on the mean of the data.
Figure 5 shows input data, scatterplots and output maps
related to female literacy. Some of the key covariates across
the different variables modelled were the distance from
waterways, and the accessibility and urbanization of the area.

4. Discussion
The focus of the SDGs on reaching the furthest behind first
creates a need for approaches that can identify who and
where these people are to be able to reach them. Moreover,
regular updates to such information are required to be able

to track progress towards meeting the goals. Traditional data
sources, such as census data on their own or integrated with
survey data, can provide detailed data on some indicators for
specific snapshots in time, but are limited by the irregularity
of population censuses. Here we have explored the potential
of spatial interpolation methods built on geolocated survey
data, which are growing in popularity and application [13 
17] to meet these needs through a series of case studies.
The results show the potential of the approaches, and also
reveal challenges in constructing consistently accurate layers
across regions and variables.
The results highlight clearly that producing highresolution maps of development indicators using spatial
interpolation approaches is a challenge in some cases. There
are many obstacles, starting from the lack of input data and
the difficulty in selecting and setting the most appropriate

modelling architecture, to the difficulties in selecting the
right modelling proxy. Here we modelled 16 different indicators in four countries. In six of the 16 maps we produced,
the value of the variance explained by the model was around
0.6 or higher (tables 36), but other models did not perform
well, with values of explained variance around 0.1 or lower.
In some countries very different results were produced
in modelling the same gender-disaggregated indicator.
In modelling literacy (figures 1, 3 and 5), the predictive
capacity of our models was lower for males than for females
(tables 36). For Nigeria, the proportion of variance explained
by the model for male literacy was satisfactory (0.57), but in
Kenya even the best of the models explained only 0.32 of the
variance, whereas 0.75 was achieved for female literacy. Comparison of the results of ANN and BGS when used to model
the same indicators shows they have similar performance.

The ANN results were better for modelling female literacy
in Bangladesh, and male literacy in Tanzania, but in modelling modern use of contraception methods in Tanzania, the
Bayesian architecture performed better (tables 5 and 6).
If the distribution of the modelled variable is substantially
different from Gaussian, the ANN approach generally appears
to perform slightly better than BGS.
A number of factors underlie the differences seen in modelling performance between countries and variables, principally
driven by the amount and spatial scale of variation displayed
by each indicator, and the extent to which the indictor was
associated with and/or driven by the available geospatial
covariates. If limited or no information is present within the
covariates, the models unsurprisingly fail to predict the
phenomena well, but good performance was obtained where

strong correlations existed. Some covariates showed strong correlations with the development indicators being modelled. For
example, the correlation of travel times with literacy in Kenya
was between 0.5 and 0.6 for males and females; however, this
was only between 0.2 and 0.27 in Nigeria. By contrast, middle
infrared reflectance in Nigeria showed a high correlation
with both female stunting and literacy, but showed a correlation
of only 0.1 for stunting in girls in Kenya. In some cases, therefore,
the covariates likely did not relate to the driving factors
behind the spatial heterogeneity seen, and additional geospatial
covariates that encompass factors relating to socio-economic
differences are required to capture these country-specific
sociological dynamics in the models.
Precipitation, temperature and vegetation cover [53,54]
have been found to be important correlates of malnutrition.

Temperature, for example, is directly linked to aridity, which
in turn has an impact on malnutrition [54], and the enhanced
vegetation index (EVI) was found to be a significant common
factor in describing rates of stunting [54]. Other examples of
biophysical and geographical factors often cited in the literature include evapotranspiration, productivity of agricultural
lands, distance to urban areas, topography and access to markets through road networks [55,56]. Unfortunately, the
literature on this subject remains sparse because survey
data rarely include metrics of these factors [56].
Correlations between literacy and urbanization have been
shown previously [57], and use of contraception methods is
also known to be strongly associated with levels of education,

socio-economic status and access to health facilities [58,59].
In some previous work [60], it has been also shown that
there exists a possible correlation between road networks
and literacy, which is likely related to ease of access to schools
and market. Other covariates have been tested to explore
their possible indirect links with the selected health and
development indicators. For example, middle infrared reflectance has previously been used to exploit its link with
vegetation (vegetation spectral signatures are characterized
by low reflectance in middle infrared). Nevertheless, our
study shows that the same covariates can have different behaviours in different countries and occasionally also within the
same country. For example, literacy rates in Nigeria have a

relatively high correlation with urbanization (0.53 and 0.42
for female and male literacy, respectively), whereas female literacy rate in Kenya, despite good modelling performance,
shows urbanization and literacy to be poorly correlated
(0.17). Many reasons are likely behind this and further studies
are necessary to better understand these differences.
Even when model performance was satisfactory here,
some sources of errors contributed to the uncertainty of the
model. The introduction of cluster location random displacement for protecting the anonymity of the respondent
population can introduce further uncertainty to the modelled
relationships [12,22]. This potential error was mitigated by

extracting mean values through a defined buffer around the
survey points [10]. The extent of the impact of the displacement can vary between indicators and different survey
datasets but, in general, its impact on modelling performance
should be modest [12]. In addition to the displacement issues,
in urban areas the covariates used do not capture well the
local spatial scales of variation. In general, urban areas
were predicted with the same homogeneous values, not capturing any intra-city variation. Upcoming datasets (e.g. the
global human settlement layer [61] and global urban footprint [62]) could lead to a future better representation of
within-city variation [12].

covariates within advanced modelling architectures, and
such approaches are growing in popularity and impact
[13 16] with provision of surfaces now being a regular
output accompanying new surveys [17]. However, limitations
and warnings about extending such approaches across varying
geographies and indicators are clear. The variability in model
performance between countries and variables highlights the
need for tailored approaches and robust methods with full
quantification of model uncertainty to communicate where
poor model fits exist. With geolocated household surveys
being undertaken regularly, the potential exists for the continuous update and monitoring of SDG-relevant indicators across
wide areas, but results here highlight that caution is needed.

rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org

The work presented should be considered as a preliminary
study to test the strength and limits of spatial interpolation
approaches. Future work should, therefore, focus on refinements of methods. This may, for example, include updating
accessibility layers to include more recent and detailed road
networks and settlement layers. Moreover, it could also
involve modelling key driving factors of the phenomena
under study, such as poverty or access to sanitation, and then
using these as covariates themselves. The effect that a
country-specific focus, tailored as much as possible to a specific
indicator, can have on mapping accuracies rather than using
globally consistent covariates should be explored. In addition,
many socio-economic factors, not captured by the suite of
covariates we used, and often available at aggregate levels
such as administrative units, could be obtained and their ability to improve mapping accuracy tested. A challenging, but
potentially very fruitful next step, could also come from
integrating community based household surveys (e.g. DHS),
data from governmental monitoring systems and data
from different civic systems (schools, health facilities) and
comparing different predictive surfaces.
The rising international focus on inequalities in the SDG era
requires a detailed and strong evidence base with an explicit
quantification of uncertainties. Some of the maps produced in
this study have a sufficiently accurate prediction capacity to
be summarized to a level of administrative unit that is relevant
for policy-making and the allocation of resources. In particular,
the maps of female literacy in Nigeria and Kenya, use of modern
contraception methods in Nigeria or male and female stunting
in Nigeria have reasonable levels of accuracy to be used for
planning purposes.
The work undertaken here shows the value of combining data from geolocated household surveys with spatial
