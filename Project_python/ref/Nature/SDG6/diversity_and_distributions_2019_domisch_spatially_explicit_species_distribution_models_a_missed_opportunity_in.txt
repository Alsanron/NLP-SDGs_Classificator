Abstract
Aim: Systematic conservation planning is vital for allocating protected areas given
the spatial distribution of conservation features, such as species. Due to incomplete
species inventories, species distribution models (SDMs) are often used for predicting
species habitat suitability and species probability of occurrence. Currently, SDMs
mostly ignore spatial dependencies in species and predictor data. Here, we provide a
comparative evaluation of how accounting for spatial dependencies, that is, autocor
relation, affects the delineation of optimized protected areas.
Location: Southeast Australia, Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf, Danube River Basin.
Methods: We employ Bayesian spatially explicit and nonspatial SDMs for terrestrial,
marine and freshwater species, using realmspecific planning unit shapes (grid, hexa
gon and subcatchment, respectively). We then apply the software gurobi to optimize
conservation plans based on species targets derived from spatial and nonspatial
SDMs (10%50% each to analyse sensitivity), and compare the delineation of the
plans.
Results: Across realms and irrespective of the planning unit shape, spatially explicit
SDMs (a) produce on average more accurate predictions in terms of AUC, TSS, sensi
tivity and specificity, along with a higher species detection probability. All spatial
optimizations meet the species conservation targets. Spatial conservation plans that
use predictions from spatially explicit SDMs (b) are spatially substantially different
compared to those that use nonspatial SDM predictions, but (c) encompass a similar
amount of planning units. The overlap in the selection of planning units is smallest for
conservation plans based on the lowest targets and vice versa.
Main conclusions: Species distribution models are core tools in conservation plan
ning. Not surprisingly, accounting for the spatial characteristics in SDMs has drastic
impacts on the delineation of optimized conservation plans. We therefore encourage
practitioners to consider spatial dependencies in conservation features to improve
the spatial representation of future protected areas.

ity of observation given the species presence in a planning unit,
where we assume that, if the species was observed at least once
during multiple visits in a given planning unit, the habitat is suitable
and the absence of the species during other visits in the planning
unit is due to imperfect detection. For instance, a given species
was observed once in planning units A and B. Planning unit A was
visited once, yielding a detection probability of 1, whereas B was
visited 10 times (yielding a detection probability of 1/10 = 0.1).
In combination with the suitability process (i.e., environmental
conditions) and the spatial autocorrelation (i.e., the spatial neigh
bourhood information), the observability information yields more
robust estimates in unsampled locations, that is, whether a species
actually occurs there but was not detected, or if it is actually not
present (and hence not detected). The probability of observing the

Sami Domisch is an aquatic ecologist who is interested in fresh
water biodiversity and biogeography. His research is based on
spatial freshwater biodiversity science and biodiversity informat
ics, and how these tools can be further developed to yield robust
estimates regarding freshwater biodiversity and conservation
planning. The authors consist of a multidisciplinary team with a
wide range of research interests, such as freshwater biodiversity,
spatial modelling, river restoration, floodplain ecology and sys
tematic conservation planning.
Author contributions: SD, MF, SCJ and SDL designed the study;
SD performed the modelling and spatial prioritization; and SD,
MF and SDL analysed output data. TH, FP and AW collected and
prepared data. SD, MF and SDL wrote the first draft of the manu
script, and all authors contributed substantially to revisions.
