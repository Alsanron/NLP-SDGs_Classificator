Abstract: This study aims to project future variability of reference evapotranspiration (ET0 ) using
artificial intelligence methods, constructed with an extreme-learning machine (ELM) and support
vector regression (SVR) in a mountainous inland watershed in north-west China. Eight global climate
model (GCM) outputs retrieved from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)
were employed to downscale monthly ET0 for the historical period 19602005 as a validation approach
and for the future period 20102099 as a projection of ET0 under the Representative Concentration
Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The following conclusions can be drawn: the ELM and SVR
methods demonstrate a very good performance in estimating Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO)-56 PenmanMonteith ET0 . Variation in future ET0 mainly occurs in the spring and autumn
seasons, while the summer and winter ET0 changes are moderately small. Annually, the ET0 values
were shown to increase at a rate of approximately 7.5 mm, 7.5 mm, 0.0 mm (8.2 mm, 15.0 mm, 15.0 mm)
decade1 , respectively, for the near-term projection (20102039), mid-term projection (20402069),
and long-term projection (20702099) under the RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) scenario. Compared to the historical
period, the relative changes in ET0 were found to be approximately 2%, 5% and 6% (2%, 7% and
13%), during the near, mid- and long-term periods, respectively, under the RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) warming
scenarios. In accordance with the analyses, we aver that the opportunity to downscale monthly ET0
with artificial intelligence is useful in practice for water-management policies.

1. Introduction
Reference evapotranspiration (ET0 ) is a significant parameter for agriculture, ecosystems and
hydrological modeling [1,2]. ET0 is one of the most important indicators of global climate change and
hydrological regime changes [3]. Therefore, the estimation and projection of trends in ET0 can be very
important for water-resource management, precision agriculture, irrigation planning, and hydrological
modeling studies [46]. In the last few decades, many different models, including water budget-based,
mass transfer-based, temperature-based, radiation-based and combination approaches, have been used
to estimate ET0 [79]. Based on a significantly large number of existing research studies, the FAO-56

PenmanMonteith (PM) equation is considered to be the most precise and widely used approach for
estimating ET0 and for providing the validation standard for the other predictive models [3,1013].
Many studies have regarded the ET0 values estimated by the FAO-56 PM method as reference values
for the other methods [14,15].
Other than the utilization of traditional ET0 estimation methods, artificial intelligence (AI) based
approaches have also been tested to estimate ET0 , as well as other real-life case studies [1621].
For instance, Kumar et al. [22] first investigated the ability of AI-based models in ET0 estimation,
where artificial neural network (ANN) models were validated for this purpose. A number of other
researchers have also paid considerable attention to the use of AI-based methods in estimating ET0
where ANN, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector regression (SVR), general
neuro-fuzzy models, gene-expression programming, M5 Model Tree (M5Tree), extreme-learning
machines (ELM), and so on, have been applied [4,5,2333]. Among these AI-based methods, the SVR
model is considered to be one of the novel models to have been widely applied in ET0 estimation
studies. Wen et al. [34] evaluated the potential utility of SVR to model the daily ET0 with limited
climatic data in an extremely arid region. The results indicated that the SVR-based ET0 was in
good agreement with the FAO-56 PM based ET0 calculations. Furthermore, the use of SVR, ANFIS-,
regression- and climate-based models for ET0 estimation in a semi-arid highland environment were
also investigated by Tabari et al. [35], whose results revealed that the SVR model was considerably
better than those attained by applying the regression- and climate-based models. In another study,
the results from Yin et al. [36] obtained in a semi-arid mountain area showed that the SVR model was
much better than the ANN model applied for estimating the daily ET0 data. In fact, Kisi [37] found
that the least square SVR models were considerably superior to the ANN models for the estimation of
ET0 data. Given the superiority of the SVR model in estimating ET0 , this method has been proven to
possess good stability with relatively high prediction accuracy in many locations.
Recently, an extreme-learning machine (ELM), regarded as an AI-based fast and efficient learning
technique, has been introduced and tested in many different fields of research [3847]. A review of
the applications and trends of studies using the ELM model has been performed by Huang et al. [48].
In respect of the use of this method for an estimation of evapotranspiration, Abdullah et al. [5] first
investigated the efficiency of the ELM method for the prediction of FAO-56 PM ET0 data for three
meteorological stations in Iraq, and the results proved that the ELM model was highly efficient in ET0
estimation. Then, Gocic et al. [49] applied the ELM model to estimate monthly ET0 for two weather
stations in Serbia using data for a 31-year period, and the ELM-based ET0 data was compared with
the results of the Hargreaves, PriestleyTaylor, and Turc equations. Evidently, the ELM model was
found to be a better predictive tool than the other models considered for modeling monthly ET0 data.
Although the ELM model is a relatively new AI-based method used for ET0 estimation, the model
has been used rapidly in different locations and has proved to be an efficient and satisfactory tool for
predicting ET0 .
Data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) repositories show that global
average air temperature has increased by 0.85  C from 1880 to 2012, and would further rise by 1.5  C
by the end of the 21st century [50,51]. If so, this can directly or indirectly affect other climatic variables
because of their links to atmospheric circulation [52]. It is notable that, as a result of climatic change,
ET0 has increased or decreased in different regions of the world [5256]. Considering the uncertainty
as to how the ET0 might change and its complex role in moderating climates in different regions,
the projected future trends in ET0 under the background of climate change continues to receive
significant attention.
Future ET0 projections can be performed using physically-based models and statistical methods
(e.g., PenmanMonteith equations) or by AI-based models (e.g., ANN, SVR and ELM models) where
the output climatic variables from global climate models (GCMs) and local-scale, nested systems
such as regional climate models (RCMs) are adopted. Li et al. [57] examined the present and future
characteristics of ET0 on the Loess Plateau of China based on historical weather data in order to

Water 2017, 9, 880

downscale HadCM3 (Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3) outputs. That study showed that
the ET0 values increased significantly during the 19612009 period, whereas the HadCM3 projections
showed a continuous increase in ET0 values into the 21st century. The future ET0 projections on the
Loess Plateau in the study of Gao et al. [58], using CMIP5 data, also demonstrated increasing trends
during the 20012050 period. The future ET0 on the Loess Plateau was also investigated by the study
of Peng et al. [59] where the average annual ET0 was shown to increase by approximately 12.723.9%
from 1961 to 1990 towards the end of the 21st century. Xing et al. [13] conducted an investigation
on present and future changes (i.e., 20112099) in ET0 in the Haihe River Basin of China through the
outputs of climatic variables extracted from the Phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP3). Concluding that the future projection of ET0 is significant in assessing the hydrological
regime change impacted by climate change, the study of Wang et al. [3] selected different approaches
to investigate the differences of future ET0 response to climate change in accordance with HadCM3
outputs for the Hanjiang River Basin. The results showed that the water surplus exhibited a likely
decreasing trend in the period 20112099. Kundu et al. [60] estimated the future change (20112099)
trends of ET0 in central India by downscaling HadCM3 output data.
In accordance with the reviews, it is evident that future ET0 changes has been projected for many
regions of the world based on simulated outputs of GCM. However, current studies have mainly
been based on conventional (i.e., statistical) methods and models (e.g., the Hargreaves equation).
AI-based models that have the ability to integrate historical knowledge (i.e., changes in ET0 ) with
GCM-simulated data in order to perform modeling have seldom been used to estimate future ET0
values. Several studies have applied downscaling techniques based on artificial neural networks
(ANN), multiple linear regressions and other statistical models, owing to their ability to capture
non-linear relationships between ground and GCM-based predictors in respect of the predictands,
such as rainfall, winds, cloud cover, streamflow and temperature (e.g., [6163]).
In this paper, we have adopted two well-established AI techniques, the support vector regression
(SVR) and extreme-learning machine (ELM) algorithms, considering their popularity as robust tools
applied in the area of predictive modeling. Notably, the SVR model is a statistical model based in theory
that utilizes the regularization framework, presenting advancement over conventional artificial neural
network models; whereas the ELM model is a fast and efficient neuro-computational approach offering
an improvement in its design and universal approximation capability compared to conventional ANN
models. The ELM model was shown to perform more accurately than the SVR and ANN models for
drought studies [46] and the simulation of streamflow [47]. To the authors best knowledge, the SVR
and ELM models have not been fully explored for the future projection of ET0 . Serious consideration
should be given to the fact that most of the future ET0 projections have been based on the outputs
of single-simulation climate models (e.g., HadCM3) that have some degree of uncertainty due to
the models internal variability and fidelity. Uncertainties are likely to degrade a models overall
predictive skill [64]. It is thus desirable that climate modelers and climate policy-makers assess more
quantitatively a models fidelity with respect to observed records, addressed by means of multi-model
ensemble projections, in order to reduce uncertainties in the downscaled variables.
Considering the aforementioned review of literature, this study employs two well-established
AI-based models comprising ELM and SVR algorithms to project future changes in ET0 in an inland
mountainous watershed region of China in which data from GCM outputs of CMIP5 are utilized.
In order to reduce the uncertainties of single-simulation GCM models, in this paper we have selected
eight-model ensemble projections (from CMIP5) to analyze the overall future variability of ET0 in
northwest of China. The FAO-56 PM based ET0 has been chosen as the verification standard for the
downscaled data, which is meaningful for agricultural applications. The rest of the paper is structured
as follows. Section 2 details the materials and methods, including a description of the study area,
datasets, methodologies, model development and performance-evaluation measures; Section 3 gives
the details of the results; Section 4 includes the discussion; and Section 4 lists the conclusions of
this research.

humidity (%), precipitation (mm), wind speed (m/s), atmospheric pressure (hPa) and sunlight
duration (h) at 4 weather stations in and around the YLX Watershed were downloaded from the
China Meteorological Administration (http://data.cma.cn/) for the period 19612005. The simulated
historical daily data in the same period for a total of 8 GCMs were acquired from the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) project. The projected future daily data (e.g., daily maximum,
minimum and mean temperature, daily relative humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, etc.) were
acquired for the period 20102099 for two distinct scenarios based on the Representative Concentration
Pathways (RCP4.5 and 8.5) extracted from the simulations of the 8 GCMs. Table 1 shows the details of
the 8 GCM outputs.
In order to downscale ET0 for the mountainous inland watershed region in north-west China,
in this study we have employed two different AI-based techniques where the ELM and SVR algorithms
were used to model ET0 for the historical period (19612005) and the future period (20102099). In this
regard, during the historical simulation period, the observed and simulated historical datasets were
partitioned into two distinct phases; with the first 30 years of data (i.e., 19611990) utilized as a
training set and the remaining 15 years data (i.e., 19912005) utilized as a testing set. The projected
future datasets were also divided into three segments of 30-year forecast horizons, which were denoted
as: 20102039, 20402069, 20702099 to represent the climate change of the near-term, mid-term and
long-term periods, respectively.

2.3. Computational Methodology
2.3.1. FAO-56 PenmanMonteith Equation
ET0 values computed by the FAO-56 PenmanMonteith equation were used in this study to
evaluate the performance of the other prediction methods. Mathematically, the PenmanMonteith
equation is expressed as follows:
ET0 =

900
0.408( Rn  G ) +  Tmean
+273 U2 ( es  e a )

 + (1 + 0.34U2 )

(1)

where ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration (mm day1 );  is the slope of the saturation vapor
pressuretemperature curve (kPa  C1 ); Rn is the net radiation (MJ m2 day1 ); G is the soil heat flux
(MJ m2 day1 );  is the psychrometric constant (kPa  C1 ); Tmean is the average daily air temperature
at 2 m ( C); U2 is the mean daily wind speed at 2 m (m s1 ); es is the saturation vapor pressure (kPa);
and ea is the actual vapor pressure (kPa). The computations from all data required the calculation of
the ET0 following the method and procedures outlined in Chapter 3 of the FAO-56 manual [73].
2.3.2. Extreme-Learning Machine
The extreme-learning machine (ELM) as an AI-based method was first introduced by
Huang et al. [38,74]. The learning speed of the ELM model is relatively faster than the conventional
feed-forward network without the need for too much human intervention, but this model is able

Water 2017, 9, 880

6 of 23

to offer better generalization performance than the conventional ANN model [42,46,47,75]. ELM is
based on single-layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNNs) architecture [5] where there are 3 layers,
including the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. An important distinction and advantage of
ELM as an improved version of the ANN model is that the hidden layer does not need to be tuned
iteratively. Hence, the ELM model is able randomly to screen the input weights, and then analytically
determine the output weights (e.g., feature-analyzed property) of the SLFNNs. Detailed descriptions of
the ELM can be found in Huang et al. [74], Gocic et al. [49], Abdullah et al. [5], and Patil and Deka [33].
For i = 1, 2, . . . , N, the SLFN with L hidden neurons is expressed as:
i= L

 L (x) =

 h i (x)  i = h (x) 

(2)

i =1

where,  [  1 ,  2 ,    ,  L ] T is the output weight matrix computed between the hidden and the output
neurons; h(x) [h1 , h2 ,    , h L ] is the hidden neuron outputs representing the randomized hidden
features of predictor Xi ; and hi (x) is the ith hidden neuron, given as:
hi (x) =  (ai , bi , X) and ai  Rd , bi  R

(3)

The non-linear piecewise-continuous hidden layer activation function hi (x) is defined using
hidden neuron parameters (a, b) and must satisfy the approximation theorem, (ai , bi , X). The models
approximation error is minimized when solving for weights connecting the hidden and output layer
() using a least square method:
min kH  Tk2
(4)
 R Lm

here, kk is the Frobenius norm, and
H is the hidden layer output matrix, given as:

g( x N )
g1 ( a N x N + b1 )

t1T
t11

T= . = .

(6)

An optimal solution is then determined by solving a system of linear equations:
  = H+ T

(7)

and H+ is the MoorePenrose generalized inverse function (+).
2.3.3. Support Vector Regression
Support vector regression (SVR) is an effective forecasting tool developed for solving regression
problems by Vapnik [76]. SVR is a next-generation statistical learning method where data features can
be learned from high-dimensional, and a small number of, training data [77]. SVR is used to describe a
regression-based modeling process where the following linear estimation function could be employed:
f ( x ) =   ( x ) + b

2.3.5. Model Goodness-of-Fit Criteria
To evaluate the effectiveness of the downscaling approaches, four statistical score metrics,
including the coefficient of correlation (R), mean absolute relative error (MAE), root mean square
error (RMSE) and NashSutcliffe efficiency (NSE) [79,80] were selected. In fact, the R value, which is
expressed as the degree of correlation between the FAO-56 PM based ET0 and the downscaled ET0 by
the SVR and ELM models, respectively, measures the covariance in the two datasets. The MAE and
RMSE provide different types of information about the estimation abilities of the AI-based models,
whereby the RMSE (mm/month) is able to evaluate the goodness-of-fit relevant to the peak values and
the MAE (mm/month) is able to generate the performance index of modeled ET0 and the distribution
of the modeling errors. It should be noted that both of these metrics are required in the mode
evaluation phase since they can provide complementary information about the accuracy of modeled
ET0 . In accordance with the literature [79], the RMSE is a more appropriate metric when the error
distribution is found to be Gaussian, whereas RMSE (due its squaring effects) should be used to assess
the errors that are not normally distributed. Mathematically, the R value is expressed as:


iN=1 ET0PM,i  ET0PM,i ET0AI,i  ET0AI,i
R= q
2
2
iN=1 ET0PM,i  ET0PM,i iN=1 ET0AI,i  ET0AI,i

(12)

The MAE value is expressed as:
MAE =

1 N
|( ET0AI,i  ET0PM,i )|
N  i =1

The RMSE value can be calculated as:
r
1 N
RMSE =
( ET0AI,i  ET0PM,i )2
N  i =1
The NSE value can be calculated as:
#

iN=1 ( ET0PM,i  ET0AI,i )
NSE = 1 
2 ,   NSE  1
iN=1 ET0PM,i  ET0PM,i

(13)

(14)

(15)

In the above equations, N is the number of input test samples; ET0PM and ET0AI are the FAO-56
PM ET0 and modeled ith ET0 value; and ET0PM and ET0AI are the average of the FAO-56 PM value
and modeled value of the ET0 . The best performances for the SVR and ELM models are expected to
yield R = 1, MAE = 0, RMSE = 0 and NSE = 1, respectively.
3. Results
3.1. Model Verification and Comparison
The FAO-56 PM based ET0 was calculated by deriving the historically observed meteorological
variables (i.e., maximum and minimum air temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, sunlight
duration and wind speed at 2 m height) for the period 1961 to 2005. The eight selected GCM outputs
were extracted to compute ET0 using ELM and SVR-based downscaling approaches. Figure 3 shows
the correlation of these data with the FAO-56 PM based ET0 . Generally, it is evident that the GCM
outputs-derived ET0 exhibited a very good correlation in respect to the FAO-56 PM based ET0 when
the results for both ELM and SVR based methods were analyzed. This suggests that the GCM-derived
ET0 values are good representatives of the FAO-56 PM based ET0 in this particular study region.
The performance metrics for the GCM-derived ET0 data in the validation period are shown in Figure 4.
It is noteworthy that all of the ET0 downscaled results revealed relatively good performances with
the NSE values being greater than 0.94; the RMSE/MAE values being lower than 10 mm/month and

Water 2017, 9, 880

9 of 23

8 mm/month, respectively; and the R values being larger than 0.97. It is especially the case that the
downscaled-derived ET0 values from the BBC-CSM1.1(m), CNRM-CM5, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES,
MIROC5 and MRI-CGCM3 models registered acceptably high performance with NSE greater than
0.96; RMSE/MAE lower than 8 mm/month and 6 mm/month, respectively; and R values greater than
0.98. When the ELM and SVR model performances were compared, the results showed that at least
five out of the eight GCM model outputs from the SVR-based calculations were better than those
from the ELM-based calculations, with higher NSE and R values, and lower RMSE and MAE values.
This indicates the SVR model had a better performance compared to the ELM model when used for
downscaling the ET0 data for the mountainous inland watershed region in north-west China.
Boxplots describing the four performance metrics for the ET0 modelling by the ELM and SVR
methods based on eight GCM outputs with different periods are shown in Figure 5. On the basis of
these four performance metrics, the testing period (19912005) revealed a much better performance
with a higher value of NSE and R, and a lower value of RMSE and MAE compared to those of the
training period (19611990). It is important to note that when the entire period (19612005) was
considered, the performance was even worse than that of the training period, indicating that the error
in simulations increased with an increase in the modelling timespan. When compared in terms of the
performances between the ELM and SVR approaches for downscaling the ET0 , it is observable that the
median values of the NSE and R for the SVR model are considerably higher than those of the ELM
model, and the RMSE and MAE values for the SVR model are much lower than those of the ELM
model among the three different periods considered in this paper. This indicates that almost half of
the GCM outputs-derived ET0 calculations based on the SVR model are much better than those of the
ELM model. In order to further verify this phenomenon, we have assessed the model performances at
seasonal scales. Figure 6 shows the seasonal performance of the two AI-based methods, derived from
the GCM outputs. Evidently, the four performance metrics for the SVR model appear to have largely
increased relative to the ELM model in the winter and autumn seasons. This reveals that the SVR
approach demonstrates a very good capacity to estimate the ET0 data compared to the ELM model.
In accordance with this, we can conclude that the SVR-calculated ET0 simulations are more accurate
than the ELM-based ET0 simulations, which is attributable to the better ability of the SVR model to
simulate this parameter in the winter and autumn seasons.

4. Discussion and Summary
In reality, the true reference evapotranspiration (ET0 ) can be obtained experimentally; however,
in many situations there are difficulties carrying out measurements. As a result, the FAO-56
PenmanMonteith formulation for ET0 is often accepted. This paper aimed to downscale monthly
ET0 using two less-explored learning algorithms based on ELM and SVR approaches by developing
and validating the regression relationships between station-based ET0 and large-scale atmospheric
variables from a suite of eight relatively high spatial-resolution GCM outputs. Without considering the
physical relationship between ET0 and the climatic variables, the approaches presented in this paper
were able to successfully downscale local ET0 time series by building on the appropriate statistical
relationships between the observed ET0 (FAO-56 PM ET0 ) with the surfaceatmospheric features,
whereby an ensemble of models was studied in terms of the large-scale and transient changes of
the host GCM models. In this regard, the downscaling approaches applied in the present study,
where a study of future trends in ET0 is based on many GCM selections, simulation methods and
warming scenarios and trajectories, are considered as invaluable tools for advancing the relevance of
hydrological models for more meaningful local-scale applications.
This study has projected the future variability of ET0 by applying the ELM and SVR
approaches in a mountainous inland watershed of north-west China. A total of eight relatively high
spatial-resolution GCM-based model outputs from CMIP5 simulations were employed to downscale
for the historical period (19602005) and the future period (20102099) ET0 under the RCP4.5 and
RCP8.5 warming scenarios.
The AI-based ELM and SVR approaches revealed satisfactory performances in estimating the
ET0 data. Moreover, the performance of the SVR model for ET0 projection is modestly better than
the ELM model. The future variation in ET0 appeared to occur mainly in the spring and autumn
seasons, while in the summer and winter seasons, the ET0 changes were very small. Annually, the rate
of increase in ET0 was found to be approximately 7.5 mm/decade for the near and middle terms,
and nearly close to 0 for the long-term period under the RCP4.5 warming scenario. By contrast,
for RCP8.5, the rate of increase in ET0 for the near term was found to be approximately 8.2 mm/decade,
and 15 mm/decade for the mid-term and long-term periods. Compared to the historical period in this
study (19602005), the relative changes were found to be approximately 2%, 5% and 6% in the near-,
mid- and long-term periods, respectively, under the RCP4.5 warming scenario, whereas they were
approximately 2%, 7% and 13% for the three periods, respectively, under the RCP8.5 warming scenario.
Compared to the uncertainties from the different estimation formulations and different inputs
from atmospheric variables, the uncertainties derived from the different GCM outputs are a prime
source of a models fidelity [81]. Thus, it is necessary to employ multiple GCM outputs to be used as
predictor variables when a local-scale climatic property needs to be projected.
The AI-based methods developed in this case study appear to promise soft-computing approaches
for the future variability of reference evapotranspiration. However, there were some unavoidable
uncertainties; for example, we tested 8 GCM-based model outputs which might not completely
represent future climate change. More GCM-based model outputs should be adopted. Moreover,
future work should test more AI-based methods for investigating ET0 projection.
