Abstract
Problem statement: Recent commercial and residential development have substantially impacted
the fluxes and quality of water that recharge the aquifers and discharges to streams, lakes and
wetlands and, ultimately, is recycled for potable use. Whereas the contaminant sources may be
varied in scope and composition, these issues of urban water sustainability are of public health
concern at all levels of economic development worldwide, and require cheap and innovative
environmental sensing capabilities and interactive monitoring networks, as well as tailored
distributed water treatment technologies. To address this need, a roundtable was organized to
explore the potential role of advances in biotechnology and bioengineering to aid in developing
causative relationships between spatial and temporal changes in urbanization patterns and
groundwater and surface water quality parameters, and to address aspects of socioeconomic
constraints in implementing sustainable exploitation of water resources. Workshop outcomes: An
interactive framework for quantitative analysis of the coupling between human and natural systems
requires integrating information derived from online and offline point measurements with
Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based remote sensing imagery analysis, groundwater

surface water hydrologic fluxes and water quality data to assess the vulnerability of potable water
supplies. Spatially referenced data to inform uncertainty-based dynamic models can be used to rank
watershed-specific stressors and receptors to guide researchers and policymakers in the
development of targeted sensing and monitoring technologies, as well as tailored control measures
for risk mitigation of potable water from microbial and chemical environmental contamination. The
enabling technologies encompass: (i) distributed sensing approaches for microbial and chemical
contamination (e.g. pathogens, endocrine disruptors); (ii) distributed application-specific, and
infrastructure-adaptive water treatment systems; (iii) geostatistical integration of monitoring data
and GIS layers; and (iv) systems analysis of microbial and chemical proliferation in distribution
systems. Impact: This operational framework is aimed at technology implementation while
maximizing economic and public health benefits. The outcomes of the roundtable will further
research agendas in information technology-based monitoring infrastructure development,
integration of processes and spatial analysis, as well as in new educational and training platforms
for students, practitioners and regulators. The potential for technology diffusion to emerging
economies with limited financial resources is substantial.

1. Introduction
The sustainability of groundwater resources in coastal zones bounded by freshwater
and saltwater bodies is affected by human activities as the result of residential,
commercial, agricultural and industrial land use, which has resulted in overuse as well
as microbial and chemical contamination (Francy et al., 2000; Thomas, 2000; Daughton
and Ternes, 1999). The increased urbanization has affected the hydrological cycle in
coastal regions whereby the increase in impervious surfaces has impacted aquifer
recharge, and consequentially the flow of rivers and streams, groundwater surface
water interactions and, ultimately, the chemical and microbial quality of recycled
drinking water (National Research Council, 1998). As a result, several national efforts
have been initiated to quantify the cause-and-effect relationships between human
activities, groundwater and surface water quality, and the recycling of potable water
reserves. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Quality
Assessment Program (NAWQA) has during the last 10 years (Cycle I) investigated
relationships between the occurrence and distribution of water quality constituents to
natural and human factors, and has provided interpreted qualitative information to
policy makers and resource planners (Francy et al., 2000). The Cycle II Program
objectives are to focus on trend assessment and understanding of processes controlling
water quality. The complementary efforts guided by the National Research Council and
the American Chemical Society (ACS) on the recycling of potable water have
highlighted the concerns and needs associated with the detection, treatment and
removal of effluent-derived microbial and chemical contaminants (e.g. NRC, 1998;
Sedlak et al., 2000).
The development of quantitative correlations between population settlement patterns
and potable water quality will require the integration of: (i) a proper description and

P. Adriaens et al. / Biotechnology Advances 22 (2003) 119134

121

definition of the systems boundaries (remote sensing and geostatistics), (ii) approaches to
quantify systems interaction (modeling and trend analysis), (iii) selection of water quality
indicators and sensing strategies, and (iv) appropriate methods for data interpretation,
integration and use.
Interactive frameworks for quantitative analysis of the coupling between human
and natural systems in urban coastal environments, by integrating information
derived from Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based remote sensing imagery
analysis with groundwater surface water hydrologic fluxes and water quality data to
assess the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to the deterioration of potable water
supplies (Fig. 1). The concept incorporates the following elements: (1) online and
offline spatially referenced microbial and chemical point measurements (sensing); (2)
geostatistical integration of point measurements with GIS layers (uncertainty analysis); (3) distributed parameter models to describe the watershed in terms of
connectivity and fluxes; (3) unbiased environmental forensics techniques for source
apportionment (coding); and (4) spatially referenced distributed control technology
networks (management).
By adopting an adaptive modeling approach coupled to geostatistical validation, it is
expected that watershed-specific rankings of stressors and receptors will guide researchers and policymakers in the development of targeted sensing and monitoring technologies, as well as tailored applications for risk mitigation of potable water from microbial
and chemical environmental contamination. Information dissemination on innovative
sensing and source control strategies for microbial and chemical contamination in urban
environments is a major sanitation and developmental priority in emerging economies
and developing countries, with the spread of infectious diseases policy and response
agendas. Considering the scarce resources available in less prosperous urban environments, regulators and city engineers would significantly benefit from decision support
systems capable of targeting the spatial distribution of contaminant input into the raw
water resources, and thus the implementation of early warning monitoring networks (for
fecal or other input), source control systems and need/breakdown of water treatment
strategies.
The diffusion of innovative technologies for environmental sustainability from
developed nations to emerging economies was the topic of an Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD)-sponsored conference in Seoul, 2000 (www.
waitro.org), and of the World Association of Industrial and Technological Research
Organizations (WAITRO; www.oecd.org/dataoecd/19/60/2432617.pdf) conference in The
Hague (2000). It was reported that the main impediments to closer integration are
perceived to be issues of technological competition, economics of implementation and
effective communication. Hence, early engagements through a roundtable discussion at
smaller but focused venues such as International Society for Environmental Biotechnology (ISEB) 2002 will stimulate information dissemination and exploration of eventual
partnerships in this effort on economically feasible technologies for sustainable potable
water supplies. This venue is particularly relevant since attendance at ISEB conferences
tends to include substantial participation of members from the Asian subcontinent, South
and Central America, and European participants, as well as members of multilateral
organizations.

2. Materials and methods
The roundtable involved five participants from leading organizations to provide a
genesis for discussion in the ISEB forum. The lecturers were instructed to highlight key
elements relevant to the enabling technologies required in this framework for 20 min each,
followed by 2 h of discussion by the general audience. Specifically, the aim of the
workshop was to frame questions and discussion within the following context:
(a) Evaluate innovative monitoring technologies for watersheds and define research
needs. Chemical and microbial contamination of potable water supplies in urban
coastal aquifers is mainly affected by nonpoint sources resulting from impervious
surface coverage, and point sources such as wastewater effluent discharge. What is
the current status of environmental mapping and microbial/chemical monitoring in
wastewater, groundwater, surface water and drinking water? Issues that should be
addressed include but are not limited to: central vs. decentralized monitoring,
current and emerging chemical and microbial pollutants, the integration of point
measurements and GIS layers, applications of sensors for offline and online
monitoring.
(b) Distributed water treatment technologies in urban centers and define research needs.
The changing land-use not only has affected water quality but increased the need to
monitor for and treat both traditional and emerging microbial and chemical
contamination in advanced and developing societies. Issues which were covered
include: economic and technological merit of distributed (point-of-use) water and
wastewater treatment systems, protozoan and viral disinfection efficiency in water
treatment systems, and innovations in treatment technology aimed at advanced and
poor economies.
(c) Assess the requirements for data analysis, integration, and technology-based decision
support systems. Regulators, city engineers and planners require decision support
systems for technology or management practice implementation. Considering the
plethora of data that is collected on an on-going basis in many interconnected systems,
at various spatial and temporal scales, a rational framework capable of quantifying
uncertainty for decision-making should be implemented. Issues to be addressed here
pertain to: data collection and integration, data interpolation and interpretation,
modeling and (geo)statistical approaches aimed at combining and propagating
associated uncertainties, interactive visual decision support systems.
(d) Evaluate the needs for professional training and technical expertise. Training and
education of graduate students, practitioners and the public is central to the acceptance
of technology implementation. New generations of experts with an in-depth
knowledge of environmental processes, monitoring and control technology, and
resource management will need to be educated. City managers and engineers have to
be trained to understand and use innovations aimed at sustaining potable water
production and propagation. The public needs to be brought into the discussion early
on in the process to enable successful transitions into a new era of increased water
reuse. Issues to be addressed are: types of interactive educational platforms, web-based
training and education, new curriculum development, integration of local, regional,

124

national and global perspectives with emphasis on technology diffusion between
countries of variable socioeconomic development.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Recent advances toward automated microbial analysis in natural and engineered
aqueous systems (Skerlos)
Urbanization has impacted the public water supply in numerous ways that have resulted
in an increase of chemical and microbial contamination. Moreover, new water management measures, such as direct injection of highly treated municipal wastewater to augment
the raw water supply, are frequently implemented due to increasingly scarce new water
sources and the demand of growing populations. It is expected that these trends will
exacerbate microbial hazards in natural and engineered environmental systems. Whether
intentional, or as the by-product of urbanization, microbial contaminants pose proven and
potential risks to public health, and demand increasingly stringent water quality monitoring and treatment. This must include novel technology to enable online monitoring of
microorganisms and their activity both in source and finished waters.
Solutions to the technological challenges of achieving automated, low-cost, and robust
detection of microbial parameters of interest in field applications are currently under
research in numerous laboratories around the world. The technological challenges are
many and can be divided into three subcategories: (1) sample preparation, (2) sample
detection, and (3) data analysis and interpretation. Current research approaches and
advances in all three of these areas based upon a review of recent academic and industrial
research activity indicate that distributed microbial detection and quantification is highly
dependent on near-term technological capabilities for online microbial detection, quantification and analysis.
On-going research at The University of Michigan directed toward the development of
an early warning microsensor infrastructure for the detection of microorganisms in
aqueous systems has indicated that technology under development based on the principle
of flow cytometry is promising for distributed microbial sensing. Rapid optical detection
methods, based on proven technology such as flow cytometry, offer high-speed multiparametric data acquisition, are compatible with molecular detection and quantification
methodologies, and are amenable to miniaturization. The overall requirements and
constraints of distributed microbial sensing and control technology include: very low
cost, large span, low maintenance, automated, compact, fast, versatile, artificially
intelligent, networkable (desired). Whereas flow cytometry technology is standard
bench-top methodology, our application is novel in that only the basic functions necessary
for microbial detection and quantification have been maintained. As these functions have
been miniaturized and integrated in accordance with recent advances in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, the instrument is named the Micro Integrated
Flow Cytometer (MIFC) (Fig. 2). The ultimate goal for the MIFC is to reduce the size and
cost of flow cytometry technology applied for basic environmental field analysis by two
orders of magnitude. The main challenges for this technology will require research

advances in the areas of automated microbial sample preparation, detection and data
analysis as they relate to the development of the MIFC. The technology development is
currently in the pre-prototype stages, and the impact of miniaturization is being validated
using Mycobacterium parafortuitum and protozoan cells as target screening organisms.
Optical detection of the former is realized using general DNA stains, and fluorochromelabeled antibodies and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) molecular beacons (Skerlos et al., 2001;
Chang et al., in press; Gruden et al., in press).
3.2. Distributed chemical sensing capabilities based on microarrays (Edwards)
Wastewater effluents, municipal sewage and agricultural runoff following field applications of manure have been shown to introduce trace levels of endocrine-disrupting
compounds (EDCs). The endocrine system controls cellular activities throughout the body,
enabling the many cells and tissues of the body to work together as a single organism.
Almost all actions undergone by animals are in some way regulated or influenced by the
endocrine system, which also guides the organisms growth, development, and behavior.
The endocrine system can be influenced by a wide range of chemical compounds.
Bioactive compounds are found in most major classes of pollutants, including dioxins
and furans, halogenated organic compounds, poly-chlorinated biphenyls, phthalate esters,
pesticides (both banned substances such as DDT and others currently in use, such as
atrazine) and a number of other pollutants, such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, tri-butyl
tin and heavy metals. Many of these compounds are highly persistent in the environment
and are capable of bioaccumulation and biomagnification in living organisms (e.g. Hewitt
and Servos, 2001). Many pharmaceutical products and medical wastes likewise influence
the endocrine system, and disposal of these substances can introduce EDCs into the
environment.
The detection of these trace compounds and their activity in the environment, and their
potential for amplification in humans presents an enormous challenge to the scientific
community due to the lack of understanding on their persistence and causal relationships
in living systems. A variety of testing methods have been developed to investigate EDCs
(for a review, see Jobling, 1998). These include physical and chemical fractionation
methods, the study of biomarkers in sentinel species, in vitro and single mode of action
(MOA) oriented in vivo and in ovo assays, and life cycle or multigenerational in vivo tests.
Considered one of the most accurate means of environmental testing involves in vitro or
single MOA-oriented in vivo and in ovo tests (Baker, 2001). At the same time, they are the
most cumbersome, time consuming, and expensive to perform, unless one can capitalize
on DNA microarray-based technology. This new genomics technology is revolutionizing
our ability to achieve rapid throughput of thousands of simultaneous hybridization
reactions at a time. Significant developments in robotics, surface chemistry and miniaturization have permitted rapid developments (Schena et al., 1995). In most configurations, a
DNA microarray is a glass microscope slide onto which many thousands of DNA samples
are spotted in a grid. DNA or messenger RNA is extracted from cells or tissues, labeled
with specific fluorescent molecules and hybridized to the spotted DNA on the glass slide.
The resulting image of fluorescent spots is visualized in a confocal scanner and digitized
for quantitative analysis (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3. Concept of microarray applications to screen the impact of EDCs on gene expression.

The approach presented here was illustrated using research conducted at the University
of Toronto to assess the endocrine-disrupting capacity of bleached Kraft mill effluents of
the pulp and paper industry using 19,000 immortalized human cell lines, including the
breast cancer cell lines T-47-D and MCF-7 (Kandouz et al., 1999), which express the
estrogen receptor, as the test system from which to extract mRNA. These cell lines have
been well studied, are easy to grow and express a number of hormone receptors, including
the estrogen and androgen receptors. The results indicated that DNA microarrays provide a
snapshot of transcriptional activity in tissue samples, showing which genes were
actively expressed within the cells at one point in time. By combining this technology
with human cell lines grown in vitro, it should be possible to conduct relatively rapid and
straightforward assays to identify EDCs by observing the changes in gene expression
patterns in response to exposure (Francois et al., this issue). Future developments into
rapid screening technology for EDCs in raw and treated waters should provide a better
understanding of the contributing impacts of industrial and domestic sources towards the
chemical quality of drinking water resources.
3.3. Geostatistical integration of monitoring data and GIS layers (Goovaerts)
One of the main issues pertaining to the measurement of water quality indicators is the
uncertainty of quantitative point measurements, and its propagation in space and time. In
other words, whereas the false positive/false negative specifications of monitoring tools
may be validated, its propagation in spatially referenced domains may be much more
significant than that of instrument specificity. Recent years have witnessed the develop-

128

P. Adriaens et al. / Biotechnology Advances 22 (2003) 119134

ment of GIS capabilities for conducting spatial analysis of environmental data, including
the characterization of space-time structures (semivariogram analysis), the spatial interpolation of scattered measurements (e.g. kriging of meteorological data or soil properties)
to create spatially exhaustive layers of information, the assessment of the uncertainty
attached to spatial interpolation and more generally the quantification of the quality and
accuracy of produced maps. Most of this analysis is being carried out using geostatistics,
which provides a set of tools for incorporating the spatial and temporal coordinates of
observations in data processing. Of critical importance when coupling GIS data and
environmental models is the issue of error propagation, i.e., how the uncertainty in input
data translates into uncertainty about model outputs. Methods for uncertainty propagation,
such as Monte Carlo analysis, are critical for estimating uncertainties associated with
spatially based policies in the area of agriculture or environmental health, and in dealing
effectively with risks.
The first step to linking urbanization and water quality will require characterization of the
main spatial patterns displayed by the organic constituents as well as their cross-correlation
across the study area. The geostatistical analysis (Goovaerts et al., 1993; Goovaerts, 1997)
needs to include the following steps: (1) computation of direct and cross-semivariograms to
identify major scales of spatial variability and perform a first grouping of constituents
according to their spatial patterns, (2) fitting of a linear model of co-regionalization and
analysis of matrices of co-regionalization which describe the correlation between the
different constituents at various spatial scales, (3) kriging and mapping of regionalized
factors which summarize the major patterns at different scales. The so-called factorial
kriging analysis can be viewed as a principal component analysis of constituents that takes
into account the regionalized nature of the information available. Comparison of maps of
regionalized factors with GIS layers will provide useful information on the factors (e.g.
anthropogenic vs. natural) that likely influence the spatial distribution of constituents. For
example, variables that are controlled mainly by the geological characteristics of the aquifer
tend to display large-scale variability while the impact of human activities is more local and
creates short-scale variability. The end product of this essentially descriptive study will be
the selection of constituents that are likely influenced by urban developments (Fig. 4).
The second step necessitates the development and comparison of models that allow the
prediction of water quality parameters identified in Step 1 from GIS-based layers of
information. Following recent USGS work (Conrads and Roehl, 1999), two types of
models appear to have substantial merit: deterministic (physics-based) models of transport
and water quality phenomena that predict how a natural system will behave under
scenarios of interest, and artificial neural networks (black box) that are large networks
of extremely simple computational units, massively interconnected and running in parallel.
The approaches used at The University of Michigan (Fig. 4), using an example from
Yoon (1996), illustrate that watersheds can be compartmentalized into geomorphologically
defined areas first, after which source apportionment of chemical or microbial impact can
be calculated using unbiased statistical tools (e.g., polytopic vector analysis, Barabas et al.,
in press) to quantify the weighted (coefficient A) contribution of each potential source
(factor F). This will then ultimately allow for running what if scenarios to determine
possible watershed management strategies. Whereas the distributed models have been
developed and validated against a range of watersheds, the integration of spatially

potential source contributions to impacted watersheds (B).

referenced chemical and microbial sensing modules to allow for source apportionment and
weigh their contribution has to date received scant attention, but clearly will be possible as
computational strength, and the capacity of offline and online sensing improves. In the
United States, the national Science Foundation (NSF) is attempting to address the latter via

130

P. Adriaens et al. / Biotechnology Advances 22 (2003) 119134

an initiative (Collaborative Large-Scale Engineering Assessment Network for Environmental Research, or CLEANER) currently being developed via a series of workshops. The
ultimate goal of this initiative is to allow for systematic and dynamic evaluation of
ecosystems conditions and flows across and within media, to improve management
strategies for ecosystems by controlling anthropogenic inputs and applying remediation
techniques.
In practice, it is commonly found that the statistical accuracy of physics-based models
is poor because natural systems are too complex for deterministic modeling method, which
was the reason Roehl and Conrads (2000) obtained more accurate predictions using
artificial neural networks. Hence, a methodology needs to be developed to account for
uncertainty attached to parameters of physics-based models and their input values, to
propagate that uncertainty through the model (Heuvelink, 1998). The output of the
deterministic models will no longer be a single value for the water quality parameter
but a set of possible values with the corresponding probability of occurrence. The accuracy
and precision of such models of water quality uncertainty then has to be integrated with
well observations. A similar methodology will need to be adopted to conduct a sensitivity
analysis (Helton, 1997) of the components of the models, which will help identifying the
factors that have the largest impact on water quality parameters and thus need to be better
monitored.
3.4. Distributed technology for water treatment in developing countries (Egli)
In recent years, the concept of point-of-use water treatment technologies has gained
wide support at the research and policy levels, as this approach allows for technology
development and implementation depending on water quality and water use characteristics, as well as depending on socioeconomic boundaries. Distributed optimal technology
networks (DOTNet) concepts have been advanced to separate treatment requirements
depending on end use (e.g, industrial, commercial, domestic and drinking water) from a
range of waste streams (e.g. blackwater, recycled water, surface water and groundwater).
Unproven at this time to be economically viable, the inherent assumptions made in the
approach seek to optimize energetic benefit for optimal treatment of lesser amounts of
material (water). In its technology optimization, DOTNet incorporates the entire suite of
water treatment strategies available to consumers, ranging from desalinization, to membrane filtration, activated carbon filtration and biological treatment systems. The DOTNet
approach also exhibits significant potential for technology export to emerging economies
and developing countries as relevant to Africa.
One technology developed by the Swiss Federal Institute for Water Science and
Technology (EAWAG), and endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for
developing countries is SODIS, or Solar Water Disinfection Process (Fig. 5). Its potential
for impact is clear: Almost one third of the population in developing countries has no
access to safe drinking water, resulting in 4 billion of cases of diarrhoea, 2.2 million of
which are fatal primarily for children under 5 (WHO, 2001). The Solar Water Disinfection
(SODIS) process is a simple technology used to improve the microbiological quality of
drinking water (http://www.sodis.ch/). It uses solar radiation to destroy pathogenic
microorganisms, which cause water-borne diseases (Wegelin et al., 1994). SODIS is ideal

P. Adriaens et al. / Biotechnology Advances 22 (2003) 119134

131

to disinfect small quantities of water. Contaminated water is filled into transparent plastic
bottles and exposed to full sunlight. Sunlight is disinfecting the water through two
synergetic mechanisms: radiation in the spectrum of UV-A (wavelength 320 400 nm) and
increased water temperature. In order to disinfect drinking water through radiation, the
container needs to be exposed 6 h to full sunlight. If the water temperature raises above 50
jC, the disinfection process is three times faster.
Preliminary field studies in Bolivia, Burkina Faso, China and Colombia have shown
that the process works, and indicate that the cases of diarrhoea may be reduced up to 80%
by treating the water with SODIS before use. For example, it was determined that SODIS
requires relatively clear water with turbidity of less than 30 NTU, and exposure length is
dependent on cloud cover (6 h to 2 days). The most favorable region for SODIS lies
between latitudes 15jN and 35jN. These semiarid regions are characterized by high solar
radiation and limited cloud coverage and rainfall (3000 h of sunshine per year). The
second most favorable region lies between the equator and latitude 15jN, the scattered
radiation in this region is quite high (2500 h of sunshine per year). Various types of
transparent plastic materials are good transmitters of light in the UV and visible range of
the solar spectrum. Whereas in concept this approach is promising, the specifications will
need to be adapted to the actual quality of the raw water supply under consideration, and
hence, the dependence on the spatially referenced watershed quality parameters.

4. Conclusions
Raw water resources are increasingly stressed by chemical and microbial contamination due to urban development, industrialization, agricultural practice and overdrawing
of aquifers, and require monitoring and data interpretation to meet the sanitation and
drinking water needs of the global population. Whereas this issue is at the forefront of
public and political debate, and solutions have been advanced in the realm of economics

132

P. Adriaens et al. / Biotechnology Advances 22 (2003) 119134

and public health policy, there is a role for professional organizations such as ISEB to
help define the potential role of biotechnology and bioengineering in the scientific and
educational debate.
This roundtable brought an applied research vision to capitalize on the integration of
information technology and molecular-based sensing technology platforms such as
microflow cytometers and DNA arrays to ultimately develop real-time data collection,
interpretation and dissemination infrastructure across socioeconomic boundaries. Decision
support systems, to help the regulatory and environmental public health communities
manage stressed water resources, depend on distributed sensing platforms, and a robust
means to integrate and interpret the data from a chemical and microbial perspective to
allow for the implementation of point-of-use treatment technology. Emphasis was placed
on technological innovations, which could be adapted for remote data collection, as a
chemical and microbial baseline condition needs to be established against which
anomalies are benchmarked. Hence, point measurements need to be integrated with GIS
layers to develop a risk framework applicable to local or regional spatial (and temporal)
scales. This emphasis is a truism whether drinking water supplies in rich or poor
economies are considered; the difference is mainly based on how to approach the problem,
once properly circumscribed. The availability and socioeconomic implementation of pointof-use treatment technologies have to be considered in light of the real and perceived
threats on water resources and their associated risk characterization (e.g. diarrhoea,
dehydration, etc.). Technology transfer to developing nations was illustrated by means
of low-tech solar disinfection technology. Criticisms that high-tech detection platforms
have no place in the developing world emphasize the need for technology implementation
with grass-roots input of the population, and considerations for technology adaptation to
the local infrastructure. It should be noted that remote sensing technology is developing to
the point where some of these local infrastructure limitations can be overcome.
A second possible role for ISEB is in the advancement of biotechnology curricula and
technology transfer courses relevant to sustainable potable water issues. The education
barrier for implications and applications of biotechnology for sustainable watershed
management is relevant across socioeconomic boundaries. For example, at The University
of Michigan, curriculum development in this area takes place at three levels: graduate
programs (e.g. Concentrations in Environmental Sustainability, ConsEnSus), development
of user-friendly interactive mapping software for decision support systems and the
development of a remote interactive system for microbial analysis to be used in graduate
courses. NSF and NATO have recently supported technology transfer workshops for
environmental assessment and remediation of contaminated sites with the aim to discuss
areas of technology diffusion within the context of Eastern Europe (e.g. Reible and
Demnerova, 2002) and Latin America. Of particular relevance to this workshop are the
efforts of the Swiss Federal Institute for Water Research and Technology in the area of
water and sanitation in developing countries (SANDEC; http://www.sandec.ch/). Its
mandate is to assist in developing appropriate and sustainable water and sanitation
concepts and technologies adapted to the different physical and socioeconomic conditions
prevailing in developing countries. Perhaps, ISEB could capitalize on the participation of
leading institutions in biotechnology-based applications for sustainable water issues, by
developing a niche and role as a clearinghouse for expertise in this area.
