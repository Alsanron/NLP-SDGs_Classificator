Losses and damages are happening now and the risks of future losses and damages will increase with climate change. This chapter briefly summarises the observed and projected physical changes due to climate change. It sets out both the framework for the analysis of climate risks and the associated risks of losses and damages that underpin this report. Some illustrative ways that climate risks manifest are presented and responsibilities for reducing and managing them discussed. The chapter also summarises the key messages and recommendations emerging from this report, including on the policy, financial and technological toolkits that can be used to reduce and manage the risks of losses and damages.
