Scaling up investments in water and sanitation is a prerequisite to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 6, which aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Blended finance can be an effective tool to mobilise additional commercial finance and contribute to strengthening financing systems upon which sustainable service delivery and water resource management rely. This chapter provides insights into the state of blended finance for water-related investments drawing on analysis from three subsectors: (1) water and sanitation utilities; (2) small-scale off-grid sanitation services; and (3) multi-purpose water infrastructure and landscape-based approaches. The chapter documents insights drawn from experience with blended finance for water and sanitation to date and further explores the potential for scaling up.
