COVID-19 has put pressure on regional labour markets in Australia, as it has around the world. The number of employed people dropped by almost a million between March and May 2020. Employment started to rebound in June 2020 and total employment across Australia recovered to pre-pandemic levels by February 2021. COVID-19 is also likely to accelerate the adoption of automation, as firms seek to increase their productivity. The risk of automation varies at the local level in Australia, with some regions more at risk than others. This chapter looks at how automation could impact people and places across Australia, with a special focus on the regions of Sydney-South West (New South Wales) and Warrnambool and South West (Victoria).
