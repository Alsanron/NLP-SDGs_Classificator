Indigenous peoples are characterized by their specific relationship to the land or territory they inhabit, and their distinct culture often inclusive of language, practices, and art. There are more than 370 million self-identified indigenous people in some 70 countries around the world. In Latin America alone there are more than 400 groups, and an estimated 705 groups in Asia and the Pacific. Worldwide, they account for 5% of the population, but represent 15% of those living in poverty. Since the mid-20th century, indigenous peoples have struggled to obtain recognition of their socio-cultural specificities and consequent rights before States. As such, the issue of self-determination has been at the forefront of the relationship between the state and their indigenous communities. Indigenous self-determination mainly refers to political participation and is explicitly limited by the states right to territorial integrity, although some external aspects of self-determination can still be in place, such as international representation and cross-border cooperation. The connection between the right of self determination and the right of political participation is indivisible, and has been recorded by the UN Human Rights Committee.
