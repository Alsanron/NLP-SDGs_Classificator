More than 60 percent of the area projected to be urban in 2030 has yet to be built; this poses significant challenges but also opportunities to properly integrate DRR in longterm planning. Hazards provide opportunities for major advancements in DRR with focus on building back better; it should not be limited to structural improvements in buildings or to specific elements of infrastructure without adequate focus on underlying drivers. Those living in informal settlements are most vulnerable to disasters, and many have migrated to slums due to disasters in their original settlements. Extensive risk is characteristic of informal urban settlements and low-income rural areas, where poverty forces low-income households to occupy areas of low land value that may be exposed to floods, landslides and other hazards.
