Colombia relies heavily on fossil fuels to meet its energy needs, but declining domestic reserves for oil and gas are contributing to growing dependence on energy imports. This is evidenced by increased reliance on fossil fuel inputs for power generation, despite the countryâ€™s significant hydropower installations. Droughts and constraints on water resources have also highlighted the need to diversify Colombia power mix, and the first renewable energy auctions in 2019 and 2021 drew attention to the country sizeable solar and wind resources. Bioenergy opportunities, by contrast, remain largely untapped, in spite of considerable available feedstock. Targeted policy interventions are needed to meet political ambitions to unlock this potential, which will also provide other benefits such as reduced waste to landfills, emissions mitigation and ability to supply local, reliable electricity.
