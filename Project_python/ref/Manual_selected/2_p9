According to a study on recurrently hazard exposed developing countries, 22% of all damages and losses caused by medium to large-scale disasters occurring between 2003
and 2013 were in the agriculture sector. In southwestern China the Grain for Green Program bans logging and agriculture on steep slopes and prohibits forest clearing and, in exchange, the local communities receive grain and cash subsidies as well as protection against flooding events. Drought alone has caused more deaths during the last century than any other physical hazard, and according to FAO estimates, there has been a total of USD 4.9 billion in crop and livestock production losses caused by droughts in the Horn of Africa between 2003 and 2013. A severe drought in 2000 and 2001 in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan cut the availability of drinking and irrigation water and led to slow, chronic forms of malnutrition as households eliminated meat and dairy products from their diet.
The agriculture sector including crops, livestock, fisheries and forestry absorbs approximately 22% of the economic impact caused by medium and large scale natural hazards and disasters in developing countries
