the final step in the biosynthesis of testosterone is the reduction of androstenedione which is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme ketosteroid reductase evidence is presented which suggests that there are two distinct ketosteroid reductases in rat testes one in interstitial tissue and one in ST the two enzymes have different ph optima for the one from interstitial tissue and for the one from ST at the optimum ph a fold difference in km values was observed mum for the interstitial tissue enzyme and mum for the enzyme from ST testosterone and metabolites of testosterone have very different effects of each of these enzyme MICs the interstitial tissue enzyme activity is inhibited by testosterone and several alphareduced metabolites of testosterone and by Es the most potent inhibitor of the steroids investigated was alphaandrostanealpha betadiol followed by betaestradiol approximately equal to dihydrotestosterone greater than testosterone greater than estrone greater than estriol alphaandrostanealpha betadiol and betaestradiol were shown to act by competitive inhibition with apparent ki values of and mum respectively in contrast it was demonstrated that among the above steroids only dihydrotestosterone inhibits the ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules and this inhibition was only observed at very high concentrations of inhibitor testosterone stimulated the ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules alphaandrostanealpha betadiol at low concentrations stimulated the enzyme activity from seminiferous tubules while it had no effect at high concentrations the remainder of the steroids tested had no effect on the ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules the difference in response of the two enzyme activities suggests a mechanism for local regulation of testosterone synthesis in each testicular compartment that does not involve directly pituitary gonadotropins
