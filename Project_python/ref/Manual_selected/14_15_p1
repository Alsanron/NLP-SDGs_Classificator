Biodiversity loss. Ultimately, the state of the Earth system is determined by the interaction between all living organisms (the biosphere) and the non-living physical systems. Biodiversity is therefore critical to the maintenance of the Earth conditions that support humanity. Biodiversity is also critical to ecosystem health and stability. Sustainable development relies on resilient and biodiverse ecosystems that support household livelihoods, food production and the availability of clean water, while also promoting climate change mitigation and resilience. The diversity of species on land and in the ocean plays a key role in ecosystems and their provisioning, regulating and supporting services. However, as pointed out in the 2019 global assessment report of the Intergovernmental SciencePolicy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the rate of loss of species and genetic resources experienced over the past decades may lead to a sixth mass extinction if immediate action is not taken. About a quarter of the species in assessed animal and plant groups are threatened, suggesting that nearly 1 million species already face extinction, unless action is taken to reduce biodiversity loss. If not, there will be a further acceleration in the global rate of species extinction, which is already at least tens
