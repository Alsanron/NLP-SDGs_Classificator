Establishing good physical health and healthy behaviours in childhood and adolescence is essential for well-being, education and health outcomes later in life. The last half century has seen a number of improvements in child and adolescent health on average across the OECD, notably the reduction of rates of accidental death and injury and a decline in alcohol consumption, smoking and teenage pregnancy. On the other hand decreasing rates of physical activity and rising levels of obesity continue to be a challenge. Education, along with individual, community and society level factors, affects these trends. This chapter explores physical health trends in childhood, their modifiers, and some qualities of effective interventions in education. It covers knowledge gaps and research limitations, and high priority challenges faced by OECD and partner countries.
