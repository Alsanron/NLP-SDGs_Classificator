Yet other indicators are less reassuring â€“ survival rates after a diagnosis of cancer, for example, are poor. This chapter reviews the policies and mechanisms in place to measure and improve the quality of health care in the Czech Republic. Accreditation of facilities is well developed and some specific initiatives, such as the national cancer registry, are also advanced.  Establishing good physical health and healthy behaviours in childhood and adolescence is essential for well being, education and health outcomes later in life. The last half century has seen a number of improvements in child and adolescent health on average across the OECD, notably the reduction of rates of accidental death and injury and a decline in alcohol consumption, smoking and teenage pregnancy. On the other hand decreasing rates of physical activity and rising levels of obesity continue to be a challenge. Education, along with individual, community and society level factors, affects these trends. This chapter explores physical health trends in childhood, their modifiers, and some qualities of effective interventions in education. It covers knowledge gaps and research limitations, and high priority challenges faced by OECD and partner countries. This chapter details the challenges Korea faces in road traffic safety. It combines an international comparison of traffic safety trends with a detailed analysis of Korean accident data. The analysis on Korea uses a novel data set that contains more than 1 800 records of individual road traffic accidents with more than 6 500 affected individuals and data from the detailed analysis of 1 000 accidents around â€œaccident hotspot. The analysis of accident data is complemented by an in depth assessment of the complex traffic safety governance arrangements in Korea and an identification of key areas for further improvement.
