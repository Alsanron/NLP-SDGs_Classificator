This chapter stresses the need to continue enhancing domestic capacities to overcome development traps and therefore improve citizens well-being. A key starting point is National Development Plans (NDPs), which prioritise policies and adopt a well organised and comprehensive approach. Although these plans are country-specific, they have common targets and challenges in design and implementation. The chapter highlights the importance of improving and increasing public spending for successful implementation of such plans. It insists NDPs should navigate effectively in the political economy. Finally, the chapter focuses on the need to increase domestic resources for development to finance sustainable development, considering the role of taxes, financial markets, national development banks and public-private partnerships.
