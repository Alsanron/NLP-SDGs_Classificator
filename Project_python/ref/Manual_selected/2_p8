Disasters destroy critical agricultural infrastructure and assets, and they cause losses
in the production of crops, livestock and fisheries, causing serious damage to livelihoods
and food security of millions of small farmers, pastoralists, fishers and forest-dependent
communities in developing countries. Increasing demand for farm land can increase
the risk of hazards through environmental degradation. For example, landslides can
increase when vegetation is cleared for agriculture on steep slopes. The agriculture-food-nutrition sector is challenged to move towards resilient sector
specific DRR measures, technologies and practices which raise yields and increase resilience against production failure, as well as towards a more sustainable use and management of vital resources
