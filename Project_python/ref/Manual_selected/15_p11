Rapid increase in world population during the 20th century, along with the conversion of land to non-agricultural uses, have drastically decreased the availability of finite soil resources for agricultural use. Per capita soil area for agricultural use is also decreasing because of soil degradation. Four related but different terms, often used interchangeably with erroneous and confusing interpretations, are soil degradation, land degradation, desertification and vulnerability to desertification. Global area subject to different degradation processes is estimated at 1 965 Mha by soil degradation, 3 506 Mha by land degradation, 3 592 Mha by land desertification of which 1 137 Mha is soil desertification, and 4 324 Mha by vulnerability to land desertification. Urbanisation and conversion to industrial land uses and development of infrastructure are also competing land uses. In 2005, 3.16 billion people lived in urban centres over a globally urbanised land area of 351 Mha. In the United States, 79% of the total population of about 300 million lives in urban centres over a land area of 18.6 Mha, or 2% of the total US land area. In rapidly urbanising China, India and other Asian countries, brick making uses topsoil to 1-m depth equivalent to 0.5% - 0.7% of cropland area per year in some regions. Policy interventions are needed to limit conversion of prime farmland to nonagricultural uses.
