In Niger children aged two or under who were born during, and affected by, a drought year are 72% more likely to be stunted. In Ethiopia, children aged five or less are 36% more
likely to be malnourished and 41 per cent more likely to be stunted if they are born during a drought; that translates into some 2 million additional malnourished children in 2005, with possible long term effects on their education and future economic opportunities. In 2005 in the Gulf states of the United States of America, Hurricane Katrina and subsequent flooding destroyed 56 schools and 1,162 were damaged. 700 schools were closed and 372,000 children displaced. While annual social expenditure is about 400 times greater in high-income countries than in low-income countries, the AAL in low income countries is equivalent to about 22 per cent of social expenditure, compared to only 1.45 per cent in highincome countries.
