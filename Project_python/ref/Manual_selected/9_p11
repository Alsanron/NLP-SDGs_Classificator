E-commerce is becoming increasingly important around the world and Emerging Asia, and China in particular, is already playing a major role in this form of economic activity. While the e-commerce market remains smaller than traditional markets, further growth in e-commerce is expected in the future in the region and globally. The scale of e-commerce in the region and the potential for its further development are the result of multiple factors, including levels of ICT use, the development of ICT infrastructure, transportation infrastructure and logistics capabilities, the use of e-commerce payment systems, and the legal and regulatory environment. Among the most important policy areas to be addressed in fostering its continued development are improvements in connectivity, the development of digital skills and the provision of digital security.
