Since the industrial revolution, human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, primarily CO2. Their presence in the atmosphere has already warmed the Earth by a mean average temperature of about 1oC. Emissions are once again on the rise globally, and if current trends continue, global warming is set to cross the 1.5oC benchmark between 2030 and 2052. The impacts of planetary warming are already apparent. Over the past decade, a large number of countries have registered their warmest-ever years. Extreme events such as hurricanes, floods and forest fires have also become more severe. Even a temperature rise limited to 1.5oC above preindustrial levels could damage the prospects for the Sustainable Development Goals, and put pressure on 500 million people exposed and vulnerable to water stress, 4 billion people exposed to heat waves, and tens of millions of people exposed to coastal flooding. A 1.5oC temperature rise would also reduce agricultural yields and increase the levels of species extinction. Should the actual temperature rise be higher, the scale of devastation would be worse. Based on current policies and pledges, human-caused global warming is estimated to exceed 3oC by the end of this century.
