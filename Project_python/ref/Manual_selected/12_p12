Tracking trends in decoupling inputs to production from economic growth is an important issue for monitoring progress towards green growth. Indicators included in this chapter attempt to capture the extent to which economic growth is becoming greener, that is, lowcarbon and resource efficient. The indicators presented pertain to: i) carbon and energy productivity, which characterises, among other things, interactions with the climate system and the global carbon cycle as well as the environmental and economic efficiency with which energy resources are used in agricultural production; ii) resource productivity, which characterises the environmental and economic efficiency with which natural resources such as water and nutrients are used in production; and iii) environmentally adjusted total factor productivity in order to give a more complete picture of the productivity of an economy by accounting for inputs from natural resources and for the generation of pollution.
