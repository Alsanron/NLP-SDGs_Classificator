while the scope of included data varied, the results demonstrate increased adoption of national and subnational efforts to capture patient reported information in mental health care systems. analysis of data collected through the paris mental health pilot documents, in general, positive patient reported experiences of mental health care. the results also suggest improvement in patient reported outcomes for those receiving mental health care services. cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in europe. previous declines in cardiovascular disease mortality have played a vital role in improving life expectancy in european countries. however, since 2010, several countries are experiencing a levelling out of the rate of decline in cardiovascular mortality in populations aged below 65, while a few countries are experiencing increases in mortality rates. this calls for urgent action in monitoring closely recent trends in mortality and incidence, and identifying the underlying causes. currently, unhealthy diets make the largest contribution to the population level cvd mortality burden, with over 40% of cvd deaths being attributed to dietary factors, and prevalence of overweight, obesity and diabetes is on the rise. in other words, we have not reached the point where no more gains can be achieved in cardiovascular mortality, and especially in premature mortality. antimicrobial resistance (amr) is a biological mechanism whereby a microorganism evolves over time to develop the ability to become resistant to antimicrobial therapies such as antibiotics. the drivers of and potential solutions to amr are complex, often spanning multiple sectors. the internationally recognized response to amr advocates for a one health approach, which requires policies to be developed and implemented across human, animal, and environmental health.
