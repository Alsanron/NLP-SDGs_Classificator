Ruminant livestock is an important source of protein and livelihoods, but is a significant contributor to environmental problems, including climate change. This chapter reviews its contribution to the triple challenge and illustrates how governments in Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand (countries with important ruminant livestock sectors) are navigating trade-offs and incorporate facts, interest and values in their policy process. Scientific facts, including from independent advisory groups, play an important role but are not always widely accepted by the public or stakeholders. Through consultation with stakeholders, policy makers hear from groups with different interests, including those with livelihoods at stake. Values play a role as well, including farmers sense of belonging to a rural community, the importance of reducing climate change emissions in all sectors, as well as animal welfare, preserving landscapes, and the ethics of eating meat. Policy developments have also been influenced by court challenges and innovative mechanisms such as deliberative processes.
