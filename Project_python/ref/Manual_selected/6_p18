Water security embraces the issues of water stress, water quality, flood management, access to water and sanitation services, and ensuring adequate water to maintain ecosystems. This topic focuses on the issues of scarcity and access. Many parts of the world are suffering from increased competition for water as overuse and pollution reduce available sources. Climate change is creating additional pressures. In addition, global water consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next 30 years due to factors including development, population growth, and urbanisation. The number of people living under severe water stress is expected to rise from around 2.8 billion to 3.9 billion by 2030, of which nearly 3.5 billion will live in developing countries. Over 1 billion people still lack access to safe drinking water and 2.6 billion are without access to adequate sanitation.
