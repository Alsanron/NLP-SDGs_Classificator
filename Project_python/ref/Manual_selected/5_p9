Promoting gender equality has been recognized as a priority for development for a long time, and it is a key prerequisite for the success of the 2030 Agenda. Parliaments are in the unique position to enact binding legislation within their sovereign limits to ensure that gender-based discriminatory norms and practices are eliminated. When women are
denied participation in decision-making processes, it has been observed that they also have reduced equal access to resources such as health, education, economic
resources, land, and new technology, among others. Women and girls constitute approximately half of a countrys population and their participation in parliaments
is critical. Legislatures with more female parliamentarians are more likely to have an impact by adopting policies benefiting women and promoting gender equality. A way to achieve higher women’s participation is through gender based quotas in Parliaments, which have gained significant prominence since the adoption of The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action at the United Nations Fourth World Conference in Beijing in 1995, as well as the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women’s general recommendation No. 25 (2004) on special temporary measures, including quotas. Since the Beijing World Conference, States have increasingly adopted quotas to boost women’s participation, counter discrimination and accelerate the slow pace at which the number of women in politics is rising. These measures are meant to correct some of the obstacles, especially institutional and systemic barriers that still prevent women’s equal access to politics.
