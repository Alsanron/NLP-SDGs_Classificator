Social protection systems are a fundamental component of the way societies manage to leave no one behind. In the most general sense, the idea of social protection captures
how members in societies support each other in times of distress. This includes in particular social insurance systems, defined as contributory funds that people can
draw from under specific, pre-defined circumstances, such as exclusion from the workforce due to unemployment (unemployment benefits) and old age (pensions); and social assistance measures, defined as transfers provided to different groups of households or individuals in relation to specific circumstances such as having children (child benefits, maternity coverage) and disability (disability allowances). The majority of the people living in developing countries have weak and incomplete government provided social protection systems. The International Labor Organization Despite a large expansion of schemes, existing social protection policies do not sufficiently address the income security needs of children and families, particularly in lowand middle-income countries with large child populations.
