Energy poverty is a worldwide phenomenon with a strong gender dimension. In developing countries, lack of access to energy is an obstacle to womens and girls well-being and economic opportunities, as it strongly affects their living conditions and time-use, and undermines their educational and economic opportunities. Gender energy inequality may be further accentuated by national energy policies and labour market patterns. Seeing as energy is the primary source of GHG emissions, extending access to green energy and promoting affordability can therefore be central to the achievement of more inclusive and sustainable development. Women can also play a key role in the green energy transition as responsible consumers, particularly in the household, but also in business and policy making. Womens empowerment and leadership in the energy sector could help accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy by promoting clean energy and more efficient energy use, as well as help to tackle energy poverty. The ajust transition should also include a gender perspective, to guarantee equal opportunities for both men and women in the workforce.
