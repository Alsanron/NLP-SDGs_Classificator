it is a wellknown fact that the energy sector continues to be maledominated the absence of gender equality can be observed in all parts of the world particularly at decisionmaking levels this reality of underrepresentation is even more accentuated in energyrelated fields where the few women who manage to secure top positions are often less connected with their peers than their male colleagues it is with this in mind that gwnet created the women in energy expert platform which connects and empowers women working in sustainable energy in developing emerging and industrialised countries with the aim to encourage greater visibility networking opportunities and professional connections between women the online platform allows women at all stages of their career to set up a profile that highlights their expertise and achievements and creates a space in which women can network engage and receive guidance and support from their peers this action is in line with gwnets mission to address the current gender imbalances in the energy sector and to promote gendersensitive action around the energy transition in all parts of the world the platform also grants women membership into gwnet where they have access to industryrelevant information and resources which are geared towards increasing their knowledge base and spurring them to achieve greater impact within their spheres of influence the work to oversee the platform and admit new members is accomplished through the combined effort of the gwnet international secretariat and governing board
