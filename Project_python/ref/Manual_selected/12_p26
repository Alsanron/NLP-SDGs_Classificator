A central element of green growth is the environmental and resource efficiency of production and consumption, and how this changes with time, place and across sectors. Understanding these trends, together with the underlying factors, is an essential part of monitoring the transition to green growth. Progress toward green growth can be monitored by relating the use of environmental services in production to the output generated. Environmental services include natural resources and materials, including energy, and pollutants and other residuals with their implied use of environmental services like the atmosphere. Tracking trends in decoupling of inputs to production from economic and sectoral growth is an important focus for monitoring. Relative or absolute decoupling from a production perspective in some OECD countries can partly be offset by displacement effects, particularly when imported pollution- or resourceintensive goods or services are substituted for those produced domestically. The net effect at the global level may or may not imply decoupling. The limitations in production-based measures can be addressed by analysing the pollution generated and resources consumed from a demand perspective.
