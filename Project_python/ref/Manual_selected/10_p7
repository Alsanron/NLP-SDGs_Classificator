Persons with disabilities. Anti-discriminatory laws and regulations. Quotas for persons with disabilities. Incentives for employers (tax credits, support for accommodation or workplace modifications). Special supported employment, training programmes, and microfinance for selfemployment. Increasing accessibility of public spaces. Strategies aiming towards inclusion of persons with disabilities are by design aiming at leaving no one behind. Targeted interventions can be used to reach those not otherwise included in broad-based programmes for supporting persons with disabilities. Examples include specialized services for children with disabilities in courts to facilitate access to justice; ensuring that educational materials on HIV/AIDS for youth are made in accessible formats such as videos with sign language; and providing additional unconditional cash transfers to children with disabilities within conditional cash transfer programmes.
