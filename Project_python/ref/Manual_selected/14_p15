The Regular Process for Global Reporting and Assessment of the State of the Marine Environment, including Socioeconomic Aspects was established by the United Nations General Assembly to strengthen the regular scientific assessment of the state of the marine environment in order to enhance the scientific basis for policymaking. The startup phase to the Regular Process, called the assessment of assessments, was concluded in 2009. A census of existing ocean assessments was conducted and consolidated in the Gramed database. The output of the first cycle of the Regular Process, the First Global Integrated Marine Assessment (World Ocean Assessment), is under preparation and will be considered by the Ad Hoc Working Group of the Whole in September 2015 and a summary thereof will be considered by the United Nations General Assembly at its seventieth session. It is expected to provide an overall assessment of the scale of human impact on the oceans and the overall value of the oceans to humans; the main threats to the marine environment and human economic and social well-being; the needs for capacity-building and effective approaches to meeting such needs; and the most serious gaps in knowledge and possible ways of filling them.
