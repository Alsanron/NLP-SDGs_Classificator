Women and men relate to urban and settlement design and transport infrastructure differently due to different social roles, occupational patterns and preferences. The risks of uncontrolled urbanisation, urban sprawl and slums, as well as inadequate and unsafe transport are greater for women for a variety of factors, ranging from the effects of indoor and outdoor pollution to gender-based violence. This chapter reviews the evidence on how urban life and design affects men and women differently, looks into women role in promoting sustainable and inclusive cities and transport, and provides a series of policy recommendations to better integrate gender and sustainability considerations in urban design and infrastructure strategies and policies.
