Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are a key enabler of green growth in all sectors of the economy. They are a key part of government strategies for a sustainable economic
recovery. This report looks at how ICTs can improve their own environmental performance, and how they can be used to improve environmental performance throughout the economy and society. Direct environmental impacts of ICTs are considerable in areas such as energy use, materials throughput and end-of-life treatment. Government green ICT policies can be instrumental in promoting life-cycle approaches for improved R&D and design of ICT goods, services and systems. Innovative ICT applications enable sustainable production and consumption across the entire economy. The potential for improving environmental performance targets specific products, but also entire systems and industry sectors, e.g. construction, transport, energy.
