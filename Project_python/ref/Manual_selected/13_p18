Roughly half of the worlds population lives in urban areas, and this share is increasing over time, projected to reach 60% by 2030. Cities consume a great majority between 60 to 80% of energy production worldwide and account for a roughly equivalent share of global CO2 emissions. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in OECD cities are increasingly driven less by industrial activities and more by the energy services required for lighting, heating and cooling, electronics use, and transport mobility. Cities can in principle use energy in a more efficient way than more dispersed areas because of reduced costs and economies of scale, however this depends on urban design and form. Growing urbanisation will lead to a significant increase in energy use and CO2 emissions, particularly in non-OECD countries in Asia and Africa where urban energy use is shifting from CO2-neutral energy sources such as biomass and waste to CO2-intensive energy sources.
