Both annual instruction time and the length of compulsory education have an impact on the total instruction time during compulsory education. In some countries, the duration of compulsory education is shorter, and students could bear a heavier annual workload based on statutory requirements. In other countries, the workload is distributed evenly over more years. This indicator focuses on compulsory education at primary and lower secondary levels. However, in 19 OECD and partner countries, at least one year of pre-primary education is also compulsory, so the starting age for compulsory education is younger than the age at which primary education starts (see Figure X3.D1.1 in Annex 3 for more details on the number of years of compulsory education). Moreover, in around three out of five countries and economies with available data, at least one year of upper secondary education is part of compulsory full-time education ().
