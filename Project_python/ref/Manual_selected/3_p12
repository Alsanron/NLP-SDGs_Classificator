Emotional well-being is vital for our health and everyday life. A large body of research documents the long-term benefits of developing social and emotional skills and a positive mental health state during childhood and adolescence. These are crucial developmental periods and research demonstrates that they can be important predictors of emotional well-being later in life since many adult mental health disorders originate during this period. This chapter will provide an overview of some of the long-term trends and challenges in children's emotional well-being, including internalising (e.g. anxiety and depression) and externalising behaviours (e.g. bullying and cyberbullying). It will also look specifically at policy priorities and challenges faced by OECD countries and systems.
