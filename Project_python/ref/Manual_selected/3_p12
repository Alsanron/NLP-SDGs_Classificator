to date, misaligned economic incentives have slowed the development of novel antimicrobials and limited efforts to reduce antimicrobial usage. however, the research which underpins the variety of policy options to tackle amr is rapidly evolving across multiple disciplines such as human medicine, veterinary medicine, agricultural sciences, epidemiology, economics, sociology and psychology. by bringing together in one place the latest evidence and analysing the different facets of the complex problem of tackling amr, this book offers an accessible summary for policy makers, academics and students on the big questions around amr policy. emotional well being is vital for our health and everyday life. a large body of research documents the long term benefits of developing social and emotional skills and a positive mental health state during childhood and adolescence. these are crucial developmental periods and research demonstrates that they can be important predictors of emotional well being later in life since many adult mental health disorders originate during this period. this chapter will provide an overview of some of the long term trends and challenges in children emotional well being, including internalising (e.g. anxiety and depression) and externalising behaviours (e.g. bullying and cyberbullying). it will also look specifically at policy priorities and challenges faced by oecd countries and systems. emergency departments are the front line of health care systems and play a critical role in ensuring an efficient and high quality response for patients in stress or crisis situations. a growing demand for emergency care might however reduce patients satisfaction (through waiting times), increase health provider workload and adversely affect quality of care.
